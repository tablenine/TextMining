Ok Pho Fanatics (You know who you are...)". . Stop reading this review right now.. . I don't really LIKE pho all that much. I think the anise flavor is too strong, and the broth usually smells (to me) like fresh slaughtered meat.. . I LOVED this place. Probably because I'm the antithesis of a pho expert. I thought the broth was rich, salty, and deeply satisfying. Definitely not too much anise. Very...Chicken Noodle Soup-y!. . Tips Tips Tips!:. - The egg rolls (#1) are heavy on the fried. The filling is dizzope. But I couldn't get past the doughnut-y outside. Maybe spring rolls next time?. - The Pho Ga (#....who knows...the chicken one!) is awesome! Organic chicken!. - The vietnamese coffee is a big let down. I like my V-IC to come in one of those 20 minute drip filters, so just when you're done with your food, you pour the intense strong brew into the condensed milk. Heaven. At Pho Cafe it came out pre-dripped and pre-mixed in about 5 minutes. Lame-O.. . But, dude, this place is so cool, they don't even have a SIGN! Word of mouth, pretty much. And take it straight outta mine, this place is worth many a return trip. Wear something cool. You're bound to run into some cool person you know.
