Restaurant: Strip

I really like Strip! I've gone there numerous times, and almost always loved it. The reason I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last time I went I asked for hot sauce and the guy brought me a salt and pepper shaker 10 mins later. Hello??? I said HOT SAUCE, not even close! But other than that the food is good, the ambiance is cool, dimly lit, with two drink bars as well as a sushi bar upstairs. . . Unfortunately, like at most places at Atlantic Station on a Saturday they won't let you make reservations, so you usually have to wait in line for about an hour. But once you are seated they have the yummiest food! Great sushi, awesome NY Strip steak, and delicious sides and salads :) The staff is not that great, one of our servers looked like he may have been 16, but great service is so rare that I won't deduct more stars for it... . . During the weekdays its pretty dead, so go for the food, not for the atmosphere. On weekends it also turns into a bar at night, with people socializing and drinking (mainly upstairs). The crowd is very mixed but can be a bit snobbish. I prefer it as a restaurant more than a bar. Be cautious of the dress code (guys mainly) as they will not let you in with ripped jeans and hats. You can leave your hat outside at your own risk.. . Overall I like it, mainly for the food and the atmosphere. It's pretty trendy, I think Atlanta needs it.
