Another good steakhouse that in my mind would get a higher rating if I could afford to go more often.  It's pretty pricey but this is primetime beverly hills.  . . The service was great and my waiter was very friendly.  The atmosphere was great.  Good energy..good balance of old, young, beautiful.  . . From start to end this is a very well run establishment.  Doens't have the old school steakhouse feel but more of a hollywood meets steakhouse.  . . Personally I'm not a big fan of ultra fatty kobe but mine still had enough red meat to taste beefy rather than buttery. . . bottom line:  A+.   Give it a try.  Definitely won't have buyers remorse.... . check
