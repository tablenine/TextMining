Restaurant: Taqueria Del Sol - Decatur
Category: Tex-Mex
Taqueria Del Sol is one of my favorite restaurants in the Atlanta area. It's cheap AND delicious.. . Things that I LOVE:. The Carnita Taco-(my favorite) It will melt in your mouth!. The Brisket Taco-(my other favorite) Yep. It will also melt in your mouth.. The Fish Taco- The talapia, poblano tartar sauce &amp; pickled jalapenos compliment each other perfectly.. The Roasted Chicken Enchilada with Lemon Cream Sauce is divine.. The Turnip Greens are probably the best I have ever had anywhere.. The Nutty Shrimp Taco (one of their weekly specials) is awesome.. . The reasons that I am not giving it 5 stars: . 1. There have been a few times when my food has been a little dry or they load a million onions into one little taco, but this is a very rare occurrence. . 2. Finding a place to park can be a huge pain.. 3. They sometimes try to hurry you out of there as soon as you have taken the last bite of your food. I am referring to the grumpy man (I think he might be the manager) that works there that stares/glares at you until he makes you uncomfortable enough to leave so they can use the table. . . All that being said, the food is so good that these few minor annoyances don't Â come close to stopping me from eating there on a regular basis.
