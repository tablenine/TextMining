Excellent! They just had a write-up in the Weekly, so expect this place to blow up. It's in a little complex of Japanese restaurants that looked equally appealing, so I look forward to trying those out the next time I'm down there. The review in the weekly says that they aren't F-ing around when they talk about the spiciness scale and they are correct. I got the mid-grade octane and it just about scorched my semi-spicy-tolerant face off. We also had a pretty okay (read: perfunctory) bowl of agedashi tofu as an appetizer, as well as some dumplings (less gyoza-like and more like fried shu-mai) that were great. Big pitcher of beer and huge waters, and for the three of us, it was very reasonable. Like $10/per reasonable. I'd definitely go back. It's NOT, however, very vegetarian friendly. It's sort of pork, pork, and oh maybe I'll have pork. Just a warning.
