Restaurant: Buddha Restaurant
Category: Chinese
It has the virtue of being open really late and right in the heart of midtown but I don't find the food as good as the alternatives. I looked at the review history and it peaked at 5. I'd say an accurate rating is really 3 stars. . . If you want late-night Chinese I think you're better off with Hong Kong Harbour or Bamboo Luau. Both of them are on Cheshire Bridge Road.. . If you want to stay in Midtown, go to The Vortex for a burger. . . If you're talking about a really, really late night, then the Buddha is for you. It will always be better than Checkers.
