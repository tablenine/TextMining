I prefer this locations hands down over the Santa Monica location: the space is larger, it's easier to find a seat, there's plenty of outside seating, and there's parking right there.  The outside tables are a fun place to start up a conversation or just enjoy the warm LA air.  I haven't had any issues with people being unreceptive to sharing a table which has pleasantly surprised me.. . Come for the burger and the sweet potato fries.  Yes, it's a little on the pricey end, but generally speaking, those items are quite good.  The beat salad is actually pretty tasty too.. . Large selection of beers so you're bound to find something you like.  Definitely a dollar or two over-priced in some instances and no happy hour from what I know.. . You order your food from the bar and then the servers bring it out to you based on where you expect to be sitting.  Don't expect anyone to ask if you need another round -- you've got to go to the bar yourself and display your independence.
