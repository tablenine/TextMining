Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I would have to agree with Michelle T. on this one. I too came to this place with high expectations and hopes to taste this so-called "Fifth Taste". . . There were 5 in our party, which probably wasn't a good idea since the "host" guy (if that's what you wanna call him) kept seating parties of 2 that came in way after we did. I just didn't think that was fair since our "30 to 40 minute wait" turned into about an hour and 15 minutes. So yeah, major brownies points were subtracted right off the bat.. . I ordered the truffle burger and my husband ordered the Umami burger. To my surprise, when my husband took the first bite of his burger he said "this tastes just like the burgers you made last week". Which goes to show, we could have spared ourselves the traffic and the hassle of driving here, if I had just made burgers at home.. . My sister had the SoCal burger with their homemade cheese tots as a side dish. The cheese tots were ridiculously salty, and I'm not exaggerating, to the point that each bite we took made us look like we just sucked on a lemon.. . Personally, I liked my truffle burger. But I would say that the truffle flavor was overbearing. I had a bite of my husband's Umami burger, which wasn't as tasty. . . All in all, the burgers were cooked well and were satisfying (since we were starving). But I wouldn't say that I would come here again. At the very least, my curiosity is now satisfied and I can say that I've had an Umami Burger. . . If you're planning on coming here (especially if you're from out of town), I would suggest coming on a weekday instead of a busy weekend. And if you have a big party, I think your best bet is to split your party up so you can get seated faster. Also, make sure to ask for your sauces when you order, or they will just give you "Umami ketchup" as a sauce. Which is just, well... regular old ketchup.
