Restaurant: Suehiro Cafe
Category: Japanese
It can't be said for many Japanese restaurants that you'll be more than full on $15.00, but Suehiro has managed to do it.  . . I'd have reviewed much sooner, because I've dined here three times in the past six weeks, but I kept forgetting the name.  (it happens a lot at down home Asian restaurants here in LA)  . . At any rate the combos are the way to go here.  They start off with a very, very good miso soup, include shredded cabbage salad, macaroni potato salad, daikon, rice, pickled cucumber, and even green tea ice cream for dessert.  My favorite combination is the sashimi / tempura.  The combo is very artfully presented on a large rectangular wooden platter.  An involuntary 'whoa' is uttered when you see the size of your personal spread.  . . The tempura is light and crisp; and the sauce is neither too weak or strong.  The sashimi is cut thick, and is very fresh.  The sashimi is chef's choice but it's always tuna... which is more than fine by me! . . Other great offerings include the pork katsu, gyoza, saba and yummy cold soba noodles.
