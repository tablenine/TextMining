Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
The Pizza Pot Pie is the star of the show here, the name pretty accurately describes what you'll be getting - it's cooked in a bowl, then scooped out hot to your plate, the end result is like a bread bowl with an italian-style sauce/stew inside, topped with a big wad of molten cheese.  Delicious!!! Some folks rave about the oven grinders, but I've never tried one.  If you don't think that the pizza pot pie will fill you up, try the tasty Mediterranean Bread as an appetizer.  Be prepared for a wait to get seated, CPOG has never taken reservations.
