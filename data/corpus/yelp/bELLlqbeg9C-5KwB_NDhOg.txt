i really like this place. Â downtown is the winner here.. ambiance is open, colorful, artful, and contemporary.. although i do not like the early hours it closes down.. . i had appetizers and top shelf drinks to get comfy .... then before i could reach second gear, time to go.. so i'd suggest you go early to enjoy fully.. the appetizers are simply excellent,. so i must try the paella next.. . valet is a must b/c prkg garage is a maze.
