Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
I've tasted 2 different cakes from Porto's at one of my BBQ's last summer, and they were excellent. That's why I was so excited to visit their bakery/eatery in Burbank on Magnolia and (I think) Hollywood Way.. . It was excellent! The place looks and smells like heaven. The food is so delicious, and there are so many people who swear by the place! I'm a believer, now. I had the Pork Sandwich (wow), potato balls (mashed potatoes and beef in a fried ball...it's really good), and cinnamon roll (huge and moist and flaky). I can't wait to go back next Sunday!
