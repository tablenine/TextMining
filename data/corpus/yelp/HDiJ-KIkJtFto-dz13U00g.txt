Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Was so excited to try Daikokuya after reading some awesome reviews here.  Headed on over with the fiance and some friends and, as expected, waited in line for some good-smelling ramen.  . . The hostess and waiter who helped us were quite friendly so our dinner was off to a great start.  Our friends each got the Daikoku Ramen ..while me and the fiance got the Daikoku Ramen with the Kotteri flavor.  The boys also ordered combinations...ramen with tempura and the ramen with the small chicken egg bowl.  Oh yeah.. and we started off with the Sliced Roast Pork.  We also wanted to know what Ramune soda was, so we ordered one of those too!. . The Ramune soda came out and I realized I've seen that a couple of times in Japanese markets before but I never knew what it was called.  An interesting contraption of a bottle...a tiny narrow bottle neck so that when you push the glass marble in (yes, glass marble), the marble stays up in the bottle neck and it essentially shakes around your drink every time you drink it!  Interesting indeed!  Tasted like a regular soda, though... nothing too crazy...but definitely worth drinking out of such an interesting bottle.. . Then the food came.  The sliced roast pork topped with tons of green onions were delicious.  The sweet glaze was quite sweet over the overly tender pork, but the green onions give it that slight refreshing crunch and balances out the dish just nicely.. . The Daikoku ramen with Kotteri flavor was really quite yummy.  A huge bowl, too.  I don't necessarily think it's the BEST ramen I've ever had... but it is really darn good.  Apparently, my cousin tells me that the ramen used to be tens of times better and now so I'm sad I missed out Daikokuya's heyday.  . . All in all, though, the food was quite delicious and next time I'll check out some other locations and some other dishes!
