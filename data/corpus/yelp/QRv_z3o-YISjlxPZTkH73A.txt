(Sigh)  I come to this ranking with a heavy heart.  I say this because I adore pizza - truly adore - yet this pizza was only a shadow of its predecessors' legend.  Now, I will be the first to admit that my taste buds aren't all that discriminatory, but it's pizza!  You have to try real hard to get pizza wrong.. . On the plus side: large variety with some interesting combinations.  Our party seemed to like the mushroom pizza and the carbonara - slap a fried egg on anything, people are bound to love it.  There was a large group of us, so we were able to order 7 or 8 of the pizzas to sample the different flavors.  The service was pretty spot on and they separated our checks very nicely.  I liked the outdoor patio, decor and ambiance were trendy but not overly so.. . Ironically, the least satisfying part of the pizza was the crust - too much of it exposed on the top (which means far too little of the actual toppings) and much of that naked crust was burnt.  You'd think the namesake of this joint wouldn't be pointing out their biggest flaw.  Now I get the "we're organic, we're hip" thing they're going for here, but if organic means poor quality for a high price? Count me out.
