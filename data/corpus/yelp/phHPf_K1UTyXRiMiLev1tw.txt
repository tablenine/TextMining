Honestly, I really try to like all of Bob Amick's creations in Atlanta.  I don't think it's much of an exaggeration if I described him as one of the most celebrated restaurateurs we have, but they all have the same theme: make everything sleek so no noise can be absorbed (except by the clothes everyone is wearing), keep the portions small and expensive, and make the location a little hard to find (*ahem* Two Urban Licks).. . I know not everyone is going to like everything and I'm okay with that... I will commend Tap for being easier to find (being right on Peachtree at one of our most eye-catching skyscrapers) and for the portions to be more filling than some of his other concepts.  I get the gastropub idea, but the portions seem more filling because they are heavier to mix well with beer.  Sometimes that's awesome, but I think more times than not if I wanted to fill myself with carbs and a Bud Light I would be at Jock's and Jill's (and it would be cheaper without having to valet).. . They hosted Big Gay Brunch (. http://www.biggaysuppe.... ) last month and their staff and patio were both very accommodating.  Everyone who participated had a good time and I think that mostly had to do with our large alcohol intake. . . Fans for the outside seating, carpeting to absorb the sound, and maybe a few appetizer specials would get me back in the door.
