Real awesome bar!  Food is good, atmosphere is chill and the crack box is always there for you.. . Tater tots... all the way!  That's what I start with when I'm drinking.  It's greasy, bad for you and oh so good!  It's a plate full of tater tots, topped with chili, jack &amp; cheddar cheese, onion and jalapenos!  Yes, doesn't that sound good?!  And it's only $5.50!  I also love their jalapeno corn fritters.  They're so good...  . . This is a real cool place to hang out and definitely a place to have a group dinner.  If you love the smell of cigarettes and love to drink like a fish, the Highlander had a stool waiting for you.
