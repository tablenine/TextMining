Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
Where do I begin..... . I'm in Chicago and need to try this deep dish pizza that everyone is raving about. Gino's East was our choice.. . The restaurant is large and interesting. You can actually write on the walls, chairs, basically anything you can get your hands on. . . The deep dish pizza takes about 45mins to an hour to cook so relax and wait it out. You can mix and match so if you like pepperoni and your friend likes supreme get the half and half. . . 45 mins later we had a very greasy deep dish pizza in front of us. I could only get through half of a slice mainly because of the size and the guilt. This pizza is packed with calories but Lord knows it is GOOOD!. . If you can finish your pizza take it with you. It's a great 3am snack after a night out. :-)
