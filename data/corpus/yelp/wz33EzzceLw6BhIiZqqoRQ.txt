Restaurant: Kamehachi
Category: Sushi Bars
Kamehachi is the best! I have never ever had a bad experience. I love the patio in the back (very zen like) and both sections of the restaurant. Longevity is the secret to this establishment,  I found out the have been open since 1967,  and the restaurant expanded from a modest sushi counter to an elegant dining institution that's been around for more than three generations in one family.  The food is always in perfect harmony, and as a plus I have never ever felt any stomach uncomfort after eating here. i love that I can eat raw fish with confidence!!!
