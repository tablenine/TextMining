OMG the fries will be my downfall! so...effin....tasty.. . this is the place for me and my girlfriends to grab a random mid-day bite because.  1) the place is INSANELY busy on the weekends/nights and . 2) what better activity is there for a bunch of girls than stuffing your face full of winers! (sorry, couldn't pass up that joke). . really though one of the best food stops in LA, even my mom likes it (dont even go there haha). . My rec.... Fries with bacon dip or curry ketsup  and the ginger or rattlesnake sausage with onions and peppers. . . I'm hungry just talking about it!
