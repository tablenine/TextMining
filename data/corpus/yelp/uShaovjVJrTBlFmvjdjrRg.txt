My BF and I came here last night, Thursday night around 7:00pm, hardly any wait!! SWEET! We actually called ahead just to check how long the wait was before heading over to LA. The guy said 20 mins so why not...... . We probably waited for 20 ~ 25 mins, but that's cuz we actually wanted a table. Yes, and of course, the wait was worth it. We got 2 Kotteri Daikoku ramens with extra pork belly slices and for the appetizer, we got the Kurobuta sausages.. . WOW!!! The kurobuta sausages DID NOT disappoint. YUM YUM YUM. They were so juicy and flavorful, and sooooooo nostalgic to Japan....for $4.95 you get 5 delicious pieces of sausage heaven...it's to die for. . . Then of course our ramens were delicious and sooo flavorful. Getting the extra pork was a plus! Extra yummy. The broth was amazing as usual, the egg was pretty good too. It was my BF's first time getting the ramen, I think he enjoyed it very much.. . We were out by 8pm! I'm coming on Thursdays from now on...
