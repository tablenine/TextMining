Rattlesnake and rabbit. For those two things alone I'd schlep downtown to Wurstküche, but oh, there's so much more.... . The concept is bril. All manner of sausage including a large selection of exotics, amazing chip house fries that would make even a Brit expat proud, and a large selection of ale on tap. . . The sitch is interesting in that you come into this industrial corner building and place your order at the counter (after taking in a long looksie at all of those sausages in the glass case), then you either wait at one of the little bartop and stool areas for a to-go or peddle down the long concrete hall to a dimly lit exposed brick dining room set with long paper-lined communal tables and a large modern bar to dine-in.. . We did the latter and split the aforementioned rattlesnake and rabbit sausage topped with (not too) spicy peppers and caramelized onions and the duck and bacon with (not too) sweet peppers while we cozied up to some downtown peeps who were more than happy to share some fries with us while we waited for ours to arrive. Both sausages were delish though I think the surprisingly delicate flavor and texture of the rattlesnake was my fave. As mentioned, the fries are fanfreakingtastic and go up another notch with the variety of dipping sauces on hand - the curry ketchup, bacon blue cheese and chipotle aioli were good enough to bathe in. Seriously. . . Washed it all down with a Leffe Brune and Chimay White and settled into a very happy food coma. Good times.
