Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
I'd been battling a sore throat, got tired of canned chicken soup, the weather was drizzling outside, Pho Dai Loi was on my list to visit, happened to be in the area - all the right reasons to eat Pho for lunch today.. . First, this place is faster than fast food. If you already know what you want, you can get your food on the table w/in minutes after arriving. Case in point - I walk in, server leads me to a table, I open the menu, server remains standing next to me, I give him my order, about 2-3 minutes later, my food arrives. No joke. And best part - the food tastes good, too. Broth was very tasty. Even better after adding the Sriracha hot chili sauce. Perfect for a cold. Perfect for a rainy day. I got the small bowl with eye round steak &amp; well-done flank for $5, which of course also comes with the bean sprouts, basil, coriander, jalapenos, &amp; lime. The herbs weren't necessarily the freshest looking but that was my only complaint. . . I craved a smoothie after the hot soup but the only flavors listed on the menu were durian, jackfruit, soursop, &amp; avocado. I got the avocado and well, that's what I got. It tasted like 99% pureed avocado and maybe 1% sugar or milk or whatever else usu. goes into smoothies. The aftertaste was not good. I really should've quit after the Pho. . . I'll definitely be back but no avocado smoothies for me.
