Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Ok, the prime rib just about smacked me in the mouth.  It was that good!  The creamed corn, the creamed spinach, the mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding, and the grand finale...my creme brulee...topped the evening perfectly.  I LOVED my dinner.  It was fantastic and our waitress was super friendly...Miss Coco, if you were wondering!
