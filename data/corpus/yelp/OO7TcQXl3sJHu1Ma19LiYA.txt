In my quest for the ultimate Biscuits &amp; Gravy in Chicago (ok, let's just go with "respectable" as I believe ultimate will never happen, sadly) I came across Wishbone.  It had been a loooong time since eating here, try like 8 or so years and only did lunch back then, and it was good iirc.  . . So this review is based solely on their B&amp;G's and I'm gonna give them the "best of Chicago" up to this point.  They are solid. Very good as a matter of fact.  They have the best sawmill gravy i've tasted since, well, probably since the one's my Mom made several years ago; and if you've read any of my B&amp;G reviews, you'll know that hers are the absolute standard bearer, the best ever, and have had none in the world that even come close to hers.  . . Wishbone's gravy itself is pretty much perfect though, really nice; creamy and smooth consistency, with just the right amount of heat at the end (which sort of creeps up on you).   Not overly spicy, and defo not too mild.  Their gravy is a sausage gravy and instead of "crumbled" sausage they just cut up pieces of sausage patties, which to me, is ok but my preference is the crumbled variety.  Finally the biscuits.  Again, very very good.  Light, fluffy, beautiful texture and perfect moistness....4.5/5 on the biscuits. . . The search for the ultimate B&amp;G continues but i'll definitely be back to Wishbone for their version in the future, no doubt about it.
