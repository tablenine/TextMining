The food is delicious!  The prices are great and there is a good variety.   My favorite dishes are the tofu noodle bowl, beef pho &amp; chicken sandwich.  I can never decide which dish to get.  The thing I would suggest is when you get the noodle bowls, get the vegan nuoc cham. It makes the dish taste so much better.  . . The restaurant is very modern and clean but is Americanized.  The place is quite small and it get pretty crowded at night.  I usually order to go so I don't have to deal with the crowd.
