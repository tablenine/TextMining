Although this place already has almost 600 reviews I HAVE to share my experience. My friends and I agreed to have lunch here on Sunday. We chose to sit and have our food at the bar (something I usually dont do I seriously prefer a booth). But I'm glad we did or Im sure my experience would have been  a lot different. I HAVE to give some background. Friends ordered the appetizers of the sizzling shrimp and oyster  had just come out when a party of 65+ arrived and were told they would be given appetizers in the bar area which turned out to only be one tray of garlic fries and two trays of rolls. I knew this would be a iffy situation I rarely share and I definitely dont share with strangers. I seen 2 girls in the corner staring at our appetizer and I knew it was only a matter of time before they come over with their plates. It took them about 4 minutes to walk over. I kinda hate informing people whats not theirs I feel like they should already know. But I will. Luckily my friends a lot nicer then me and she did it LOL. . The lady sitting next to us was a riot. Her son told her he wanted her to meet his new gf and she kindly informed him "she didnt want to meet that Hoe" her exact words were "I dont wanna meet that Hoe". When the bartender asked her if she wanted another drink she said "yes, and use my same glass since its already seasoned". She was good fun LOL. . Now to the food had the short rib it was great seasoned perfect and way tender. I could eat that all the time. I would have licked the plate if I were at home. I had my first tokyo tea and let me tell u it's f"ing fantastic every1 21 and over should try this drink at least once. The garlic ice cream is very different not really nasty, but not good. The mole on top is fantastic, but once its gone the ice cream just isn't the same.
