Jane and I went here last night for our anniversary. The restaurant was fairly crowded, but even though we had no reservation, they found us a seat right away, in the back corner so we both got to sit on the couch wrapping around the back wall. . . Looking over the menu, we decided to try a bunch of small plates, much to our server, Martha's delight:  "get in there and play around!"  We sampled all kinds of great stuff... swordfish, elk schnitzel, cheese-stuffed peppers and a few other delicious items including pork belly tacos (bacon and tacos... two great tastes that taste great together!). . And then after all that, dessert. Like the small plates we had for our meal, the desserts are all small-sized but packed with flavor. You can get 4 for $12 which is a great deal. The price drops by a dollar if you let the pastry chef pick them for you. We opted for some gooey toffee cake and three of the most chocolaty items I've ever eaten. I'm still recovering from the sugar shock but WOW they were tasty.. . It was worth every penny. Great food, great service, I recommend it to everyone :D
