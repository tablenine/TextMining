My cousin recommended this place, so I went to go try it. I ordered the miso base soup for my noodles and got it medium spicy. That was pretty spicy enough, so if you're looking for something spicy, this is the place! The gyoza is good as well but they're kind of small. It's a small place so it does get pretty crowded on the weekends.
