For those of you who want to satisfy that crab craving, this is the place.  Crab served the old fashioned way.  It's brought to you in a bucket, then poured over your paper tablecloth.  You're armed with a bib, mallot, and cracker.  Get ready to get your hands dirty.  They have crawfish, blue crab, dungeness, and king crab.  You can have it with garlic butter, the sha bang (I recommend, very intense flavor), and a few others.  They also serve fresh oysters on the half shell.  Best with of course, beer!  Get ready to wait because this place gets packed... big time.  They open from 3pm - 10pm on weekdays, 12pm - 10pm on weekends.  Best to get there early to beat the crowds.  You don't have to drive all the way to the Crab Shack in Long Beach anymore.  It's right here in town.
