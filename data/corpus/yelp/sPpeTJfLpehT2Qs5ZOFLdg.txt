So maybe my expectation was too high because of all the hype, but I don't get it. They were decent tacos and sliders (tried the tofu, short ribs, chicken,and spicy pork) but there are too many fillers (lettuce, sauce) that cover up the meat taste. The meat itself is tasty...the pork and the short ribs are my favorites.
