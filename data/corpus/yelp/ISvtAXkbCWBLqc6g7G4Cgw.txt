Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
A step above common brunch fare.  Exceptionally fresh food with careful preparation.  Even the toast is a warm buttery brioche.  In the warm months, sitting outside sipping a cappuccino, eating an omelet with filled with organic vegetables, overlooking youngsters (an oldsters) playing in Giddings Plaza is what makes me love living in the city and love Cafe Selmarie.
