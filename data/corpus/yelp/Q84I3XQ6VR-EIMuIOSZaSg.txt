My husband was thrilled to see they had cans of Porkslap Pale Ale, so that helped ease our 45-minute wait for a table this past Friday. When finally seated, we ordered a bunch of dishes, all of which deserve accolades and exceeded our expectations: pickles, cheese plate with roasted grapes and honey, green tomato soup (spicy and tasty), Rhode Island day boat scallops and mussels, warm mozzarella and romaine salad...point I'm trying to convey is that this place is a winner.. . It's not that pricey given the quality of the food and service. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive, and I felt bad that she had to bus her own tables (and the room was crowded).. . This is not just a neighborhood gem but it is also worthy of being a destination restaurant. I think the word is already out!
