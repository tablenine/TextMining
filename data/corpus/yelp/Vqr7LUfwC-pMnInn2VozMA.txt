Blueberry Cornbread.. . No seriously, Blueberry Cornbread.  The stuff is amazing, but sometimes it's stale. . . They have this hot lunch organic arty food station there.  Where you can go eat organic arty foods and sit outside and thumb your nose at passers by.  It's amazing.. . On another note, the other day I was there, eating some sort of tofu-koi organic-meat-spring-roll, and I noticed I had some of the aforementioned stuck in my teeth.  Being without floss I decided to use one of their recycled napkins to remove said food.  Well, a large chunk of the napkin ripped off and became lodged in my mouth.. . I proceeded to run around the store with my mouth closed (to hide my shame), looking to buy some organic dental floss.  I had to settle on some organic toothpicks, however.  They taste like campfire and cost me $7.  They're glorious.. . Did I mention it's next to a Borders? Double score.
