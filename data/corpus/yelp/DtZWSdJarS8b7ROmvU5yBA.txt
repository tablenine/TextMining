A man came in with his son and Â sat beside me. Little did I know this man would become my hero in about 3 minutes. Life is funny that way, no? The man ordered pie...as an appetizer. Not just any pie...Boysenberry pie. Sighhhh. If I weren't already in love and this man weren't 20 years my senior, we'd be stuffing Boysenberry pie into each other's faces at our wedding. All that aside, I Love this place. It's small, it's cozy, it reminds me of home. The little paper cones they give you to pur your soda in?! Could it be anymore quaint? The burger was awesome (I got the hickory burger) and we shared some yummy fries. I even got a real coke..not diet. Come here and enjoy it for what it is, which is a little burger joint that has survived the LA scene despite it's lack of glitz and presence of non-vegan, no-frills, down home food. Oh, and get the Boysenberry pie. You won't be sorry.
