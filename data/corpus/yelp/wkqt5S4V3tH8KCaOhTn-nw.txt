so i havent ordered from this place for a long time.  thats because last time i called to get a delivery their manager was rude to me for no particular reason.  apparently managhing a pizza restaraunt makes you cooler than most other people.  . . but whatever, . . it had been a long time, so i decided to give them another chance today.  . . i ordered a large supreme pizza, and it cost $25. . all of the toppings were there, but only in trace amounts.  i know the economy is down, but cheating your customers just isnt good business.  . . i dont understand why it is so hard to get a good pie in my neighborhood these days, its really not difficult or expensive.  . . today they let me down for the last time.
