I research sushi restaurants whenever I am in another town (which is often) so I have had a lot of fresh fish.  I am very picky and I told the sushi chef that I am a difficult one to please and to bring on the omakase.  Most of the fish matches some of the freshest I have had.  Wasabi is not real, but you can ask for the real stuff (it should just come with omakase).  Left very impressed and much poorer ($135 for two with tax/tip).
