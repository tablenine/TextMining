Like most everyone in LA, I have been eating here for more years than I can remember. Most of the ladies behind the counter have been here for eons. I always get the beef sandwich double dipped and sit in the train room. Their pies and cakes are awesome. My wife loves the cole slaw. Where else can you get a cup of joe for 10 cents!. . Avoid this place at lunch time (12-1) and before Dodger games unless you don't mind standing in line for awhile. I went there for lunch yesterday at 11:30 AM and there was only one person ahead of me in line.
