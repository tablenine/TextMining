Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Yum. Seriously. Yum.. . The first time my left-coast boyfriend came into Atlanta, I wanted to introduce him properly to Southern Barbeque. After asking around for the best place in Atlanta, I received a resounding edict: take the man to Fat Matt's. Oh, am I ever glad I did. . . This may very well be the best ribs I've had. They were cooked perfectly, and even my food-snob boyfriend had to admit that this was fantastic stuff. The line was a little long the day we visited, but we luckily got there before the big rush--as we left, there was a long line out the door.. . The grub was cooked up fast once we got in to order, the sweet tea was just the perfect amount of sweet, and the food made us sink back into our chairs and pat our tummies happily. . . Thank heavens, for my waistline, I don't live nearby. I'd be as big as a cow if I did...there's no way I'd be able to resist the tempation of such great food and atmosphere.
