3.75 stars.  Was here on valentine's day.  Food was good - the squash, and eel stand out as memorable, as well as the spicy tuna roll.  My friend did the ordering.  Had a bottle of japon sake, which was very, very light.  On the small side, and was very, very busy.. . Why not higher?  Very, very noisy and hard to hear what was being said.  If noisy if your thing, then more power to you - I like the energy, but find it annoying to have to deal with strained conversation.
