This is a really unique restaurant.  From the location to the decor.  It almost feels like you're stepping into some sort of circus...but a really classy, upscale circus :)  I had the glazed salmon... if you've been reading my reviews, I think I've tried the salmon at every single restaurant known to man.  I believe we also had the ahi tuna appetizer- which was good.  The location is pretty out of the way, so you definitely have to cab it over there.  Definitely not super romantic, as it's a louder and more bustling restaurant, but you really can't stop looking around at all the decorations.  You could go there 50 times and notice something new about it, which I really love.  I would give it a try if you're in the area.
