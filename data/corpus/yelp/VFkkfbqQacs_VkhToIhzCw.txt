Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
The place is great for people who love meat, and enjoy Brazilian and cuban style foods. Its Argentine and its the only Argentine restaurant I have ever had but its really good, I loved it. They have this meat dish combo, it's best for two people. And try their sangria.
