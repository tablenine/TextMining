Meh. . . I'm not Jewish, nor an East Coast transplant.  I'm more of a Midwest truck stop diner kind of guy.  Maybe that's why I couldn't give two shits about this place. . . I get the nostalgia factor, but the place looks like no one has decided to do any upkeep in the past 30 years, and I don't mean that in a cool retro way. . . And the food?  Other than the fact that it is delicatessen food, I don't know what's great, or even good about it.  It seems like all the items a deli needs are there, but without the care, love, or flavor that I'd like to see in a place that I'm going to pay money to eat at.
