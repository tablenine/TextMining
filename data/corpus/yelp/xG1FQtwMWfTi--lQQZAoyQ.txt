I am about to commit high treason for what I am about to say.  But, i would like to know that I will at least be truthful and repent before I die.   Please tell my wife that I "usually" loved her!. . Get ready for this....This place is like montezuma's revenge.  Intended to target all non hispanics for all of the social injustices to mexicano's through time  and for stealing California from Mexico.. . If i said the food here was good, I would be slapping my abuelita in the face and spitting on her grave(she is not dead yet by the way).  The food is bland and expensive for being beans, rice, and what i think is beef, chicken, and pork.  Look at it....anything shredded like that can't be meat.  If your latino and think the food is good, then you were raised a mother or grandmother who couldn't cook for sh*t.  I haven't read the reviews but I can bet that most of the people who like this place are not from "around here" and just wanna see what's doing.  Authentic places have flavor..most likely from Lard and are heavily seasoned with chili, etc.  . . Back in the day, the food was cheaper and tasted better.  Now, its more of a novelty in my opinion.  I've had my share of "hollenbacks", Manny's Special, etc but Im not a youngster anymore.  In the world of Yelping...Imma Shot Caller.  Don't hate the player...its just part of the game(oh yeah...I changed it...because I can).  . . Keep on Yelping
