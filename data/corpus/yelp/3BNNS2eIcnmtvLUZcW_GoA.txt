Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
I had a wonderful experience dining at Buona Terra. The laid-back atmosphere with both intimate indoor and outdoor seating is a great addition to Logan Square. . . We shared 2 salads for our appetizers: The caprese, which had thickly cut tomatoes and fresh mozzarella with just the right amount of basil and olive oil, and a squid dish that was served pan seared with herbs over a bed of greens. Both dishes were perfect and there was plenty to go around for 3 diners.. . For dinner we stuck to pasta dishes: The gnocchi verde (spinach gnocchi) served with a creamy four-cheese sauce, the veal ravioli in a red cream sauce topped with fresh mozzarella, and the rotini di la nona, which had mushrooms, peas and proscuitto in a parmesan cream sauce. We all shared and still went home with plenty of leftovers. . . Finally, we also had dessert (cannolis and tiramisu) and the entire experience led me to believe you couldn't go wrong with the food at Buona Terra. Blindly put your finger down anywhere on the menu and you are likely to be satisfied.. . The service was great, the prices were more than appropriate for the quality of food, and there was plenty of street parking available. I highly recommend Buona Terra if you are looking for quality Italian food.
