Even the exotic sausages are interesting, gotta love that Bratwurst and beer selection! Leffe Brune is the best! Seriously! And the fact that people all sit at a long table with one another can lead to conversation with folks you don't even know. A rarity in the world these days! But it is usually other beer afficionados and foodies.. so I guess there is bulit in "something in common" element here.
