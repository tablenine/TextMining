Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Matt K. took me here. . . It was one of those religious or significant experiences where you're allowed to cry because of the flooding of different emotions. . . I was happy that I had the best pizza in my life. . I was also sad that what I thought was the best pizza in my life was not, in actuality. . . Then I cried. . . The mushrooms aren't good. They're bad. They're canned and conventional. But we got the sausage and eggplant- it was amazing. I wanted to sing about it after my first bite. It burned my mouthroof, but it was the best burning I've gotten. The sausage is housemade. wow. Go with friends. Wait in line because your growing hunger only makes the pizza taste better. Theyre not open sunday and monday--these are two very sad days. Good thing I go to church on Sunday-- otherwise I would be sad that day. But monday. I am sad.
