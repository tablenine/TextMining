I was recommended this place on a Friday and went the very next day.. The food is light Vietnamese. Everything tastes fresh and you leave feeling healthy, rather than weighed down by heavy sauces or fats.. . I had the crab and avocado fresh rolls, followed by the bun with Shrimp on skewers. The shrimp were extra tasty as they were marinated before grilling.. . I also had the Ginger grass gingerale which was a special treat. . . This is definitely contemporary Vietnamese cuisine, but it also has authentic food too.
