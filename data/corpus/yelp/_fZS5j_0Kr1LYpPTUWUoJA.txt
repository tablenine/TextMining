Liked it...didn't love it...probably won't trek out here again. Had the Santa Fe Skillet. Was good-ish...nothing special...not horrible. The coffee tasted burnt. The service was 'meh' . The meal was 'meh'. I've had way more exciting brunch experiences. But it wasn't the worst brunch experience either. . . Dunno if it was worth the 30 minutes for a table.
