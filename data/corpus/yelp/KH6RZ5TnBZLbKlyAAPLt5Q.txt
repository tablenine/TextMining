The legend: attracting strange bed fellows for a looong time! The food is very tasty, the bakery is insane (although not as insane as some of the patrons) and the decor is very delightfully kitsch! Who doesn't love plastic foliage against Â faux stained-glass while watching the most bizzare collection of characters any city could every produce in one place: Ron Jeremy in one booth, next to another mid-western expat who thinks he's Axel Rose, next to the yuppie-hipster, next to the hip-hop dudes very loudly spoken and dressed, next to the pale German tourists and Japanese hipsters, next to an overly make-up'd hollywood old-timer still trying to look hot...WOW!!! This place is a buffet for your palette as well as your eyes....LOVE IT!!!. . Particularly interesting Thurs-Sat late nights after 2am when the club goers start pouring in.
