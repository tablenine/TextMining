I wish for some meatloaf from Wishbone!!!. . They honestly have the best meatloaf with 2 sides. I get the mashed potatoes and mashed sweet potato...what can I say I like my potatoes!!!:-). . I had the brunch once and I'm not a fun, but if you want some yummy meatloaf with tomato Â sauce and some good sides, this is the place to go!!!
