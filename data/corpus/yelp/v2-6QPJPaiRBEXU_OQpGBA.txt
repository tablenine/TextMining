Restaurant: Santullo&#39;s Eatery
Category: Pizza
I actually hate this place. They're in a good spot and open late, so they abuse the fact. The guys who work there are usually @ss holes. The pizza is ridiculously overprices and it's not even good. There is a guy who sells similar quiatlity pizza for $2 outside the Mexican place on six corners (Milwaukee, North, and Damen). The crappy pizza at Santullos is $4 for a regular slice.
