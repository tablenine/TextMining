Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
i like eating healthy. i also like to eat a bunch of junk. sometimes, good restaurants don't like to humor the former.. tender greens does, though - i can get my health on, my epicurean on, and first and foremost, my californian on. their dedication to local produce is refreshing - and so so so fresh (in both the actual and 80's sense). meat-eaters and vegans alike can sit down and eat, while enjoying the l.a sunshine, or just grab and go. the tuna nicoise salad is to die for. so good!
