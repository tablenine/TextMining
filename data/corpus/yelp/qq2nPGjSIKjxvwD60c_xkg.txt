Great decor - I'm digging the tourquoise alligator skin looking chairs.  Coffee is strong and good - kinda thick (I like Intelligensia coffee more).  I had a panini which was really yummy.  Really lovely service.  Yes, it looks upscale, but don't let that throw you off.  I walked in w/ my  grubby ass self in workout gear after running around the "lake" and no one was staring me down or being all snobby.
