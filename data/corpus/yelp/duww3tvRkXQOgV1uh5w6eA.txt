Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Pretty good pastrami, and they make a big sandwich. My beef is this place is so expensive, and they don't Â let you use credit cards. I hate that. I always have to run to the Tito's Tacos ATM. Even Cinco De Mayo accepts credit cards. And their pastrami combo is like 5 bucks.
