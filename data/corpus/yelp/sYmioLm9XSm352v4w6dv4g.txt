Wow.  A lot of reviews. My buddy introduced us to this place. I've only been here twice. Each time I ordered something new. The food is awesome, service was pretty sweet. I love the big portions and the chill atmosphere. The line is long, you don't have to eat here.  Across the street is a strip club or something.
