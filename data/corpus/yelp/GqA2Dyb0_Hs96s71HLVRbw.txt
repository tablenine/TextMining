Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
The restaurant use to be hard to find and a hidden gem in LA since the only distinct signage was from the valet but the secret is out since they have a casual dining version of the Little Door next door (which I don't particularly care for). . . My boyfriend and I love this place for the ambiance. It's dimly lit with Christmas like lights strung throughout the outdoor patio seating area with soft lighting in the numerous other dining rooms. The food, the huge French wine selection and the service completes the restaurant.
