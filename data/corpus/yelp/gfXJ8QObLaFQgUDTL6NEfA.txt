We came here on a Saturday evening and the place was packed but we were able to squeeze into a standing place at the bar.  That was pretty much the only downside.  The drink list is really nice...if you are into bourbons and ryes.  Which is interesting considering they sell mexican fare.  I figured the tequila list would be much more extensive.  We got one of each taco and my favorite by far was the goat.  So tender and delicious.  The carne asada was quite delicious as well, and you can't go wrong with the pork belly taco.  The quac was very tasty and I like the radish in it which gives it a nice contrasting texture.  Overall, if you don't mind crowds and want cheap but really tasty eats come here.  Maybe next spring/summer they will have some outdoor seating which may open things up a bit.
