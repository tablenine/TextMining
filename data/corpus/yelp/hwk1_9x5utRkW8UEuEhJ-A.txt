Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs -- my, oh my, do they have hot dogs!  They have a huge variety of gourmet dogs to choose from, along with great service.  The spicy Polish dog was the best I've had.  The menu is confusing just by the sheer volume of selection...and the celebrity names don't help; not really a bad thing, though.. . On the negative side, you'll have a line to wait in at almost any time in the day, and the food is pretty damn greasy.  If you're at risk for a heart attack, you might want to keep walking by...otherwise, dig in and enjoy some grub!
