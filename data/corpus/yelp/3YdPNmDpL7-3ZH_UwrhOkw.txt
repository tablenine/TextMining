Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
mmm... Pink's. I tried this place because my cousin from the Philippines actually has heard of it. When she came to visit here in the states she wanted to go. Ever since then I've been hooked. Only criticism towards Pink's is that I think they should expand their business to other locations other than the Las Vegas location. The line is long depending, but the staff is friendly. I begged the chef to let me order a hotdog right when they were closing their doors late at night after they stopped taking orders, and he took my order! (Of course I tipped the guy pretty well for being awesome Â :) )
