I love this place, but rather than add much to the other raves here, I just HAD to address the review below from the guy who has "gone here three times.". . First off, you haven't. You've been once. The first time you got an attitude about an overestimated wait time on their opening. That doesn't make a lot of sense, but ok. Your other complaints from that night seemed worthy of complaints, but jeez, it was their opening, give them another shot.. . You did, and they were too busy so you went elsewhere. So I don't think that counts. And then you did again, but they were closed. Don't you think it's fair to give a staff at one of the busiest restaurants in town a break? Or no they should just stay open, even though they were closing, to serve you and your friend, since you're previous customers. Dude you had been there once.. . I'm sorry but that doesn't make a bit of sense. If you were really giving them a "fair shot" you wouldn't post a one star review after dining their one time just because you were mad that they were too busy for you to wait in line (hint, maybe they are busy because they are good?) and then the next time they were closed. . . Speaking from someone who dines there once a week (at least), I can tell you that FLIP has some of the most consistently delicious fries, onion rings, pickled veggies, caesar salads, shrimp po boygers (OMG, like crack), and last but not least, to-die-for nutella shakes that I've ever eaten. Their food is adventurous and exciting but still appealing to even the most meat-and-potato eaters. It's great for hipsters, older folks, kids... business lunches, girls nights. It's tasty, unique food for the masses and it's what Atlanta needs.
