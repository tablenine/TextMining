The cute milk jug silhouette signage and al fresco dining seen from the street were the main draw for two tired travelers from SGV. Sadly, the draw didn't quite meet expectations. The bathroom was broke and the metal furniture was too lawn chic for me. The ice cream flavors were also way uninspiring--vanilla bean, mint, chocolate Â (*yawn*). We got the Ooey Gooey Chocolate Cookie Sundae, and as much as i loved the coconut ice cream, something was off. I thought it was my tastes buds--no cookie? It then started to make complete sense when a server sprinted to our table with a turd-like item cradled in her cupped hands. It was a bizarre sight. Apparently, she forgot the Ooey Gooey Chocolate Cookie. It was neither ooey or gooey when she brought it. If you're going to play up the cute factor, please make it worth the high prices please. I don't think I would go back. I rather patron the old school soda fountains in the area, and Bonne Maman jam has the same quaint packaging.
