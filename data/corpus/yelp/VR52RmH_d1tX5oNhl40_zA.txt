So I often find myself at Rebel bar &amp; grill across the street from this fine establishment.  Curse?  Some would say so.  . . I love the different kinds of pizza they offer with toppings that I would never have put on a pizza..like..mac n cheese pizza...LOVE IT!  I BELIEVE I've also had the barbecue chicken pizza..the memory is a bit fuzzy though.. . ANYWAY, I always get good food here...you're in and out, stuffed, drunk, and ready to pass out in no time!
