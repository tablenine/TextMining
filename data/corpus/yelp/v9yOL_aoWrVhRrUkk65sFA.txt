Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Came here for the first time for with a co-worker just yesterday (she swears by this restaurant). We got to Sushi-Gen around 12 and there were, I kid you not, 20 people waiting for a table. The entire restaurant was already PACKED. While waiting, we asked the host if there's ever a time that it's not so crowded. Unfortunately, he shook his head and told us that even at 11:15, when the restaurant opens, there's already a long line outside. Boo.. . The service is great and the food comes out very very fast. My friend ordered a spicy tuna cut roll and I had the sushi and tempura lunch special. The sushi was incredible...as in melt-in-your mouth incredible. The tempura was a tad on the greasy side, but still delicious. I loveee sweet potato tempura, and Sushi-Gen's was divine!. . I was really surprised by the portions! 5 or 6 pieces of tempura, 6 pieces of sashimi, rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, and some tofu all for $15. Not bad at all! I'd come back here for lunch more often if it weren't for the atrocious wait.
