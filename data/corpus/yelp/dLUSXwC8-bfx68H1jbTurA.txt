Great food, cool atmosphere, good looking people and decent prices. . . I've gone here for lunch and dinner a bunch of times and I've never been let down by the food.  Whether its the ribeye or skirt steak, the grilled chicken with mushrooms or with the garlic chutney, the risotto, the swordfish skewers or just a beer and some sightseeing (the little melrose hunnies cruise by once in a while!).   . . It all adds up to a quick bite thats well priced and well flavored.  Cute waitresses and an easy on the eye crowd (most of the time) make it a local favorite.
