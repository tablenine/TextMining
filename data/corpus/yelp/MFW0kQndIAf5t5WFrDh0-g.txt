So I'll give it 4 stars for food but one for service/delivery. Take out from here only!! I've had really crappy service especially from one flamboyant waiter on a few occasions. And I've waited 90 minutes on at least 2 occasions for delivery. The peanut sauce spring rolls and tiger cry beef rock. The peanut lovers dish is great and super spicy. All curries are great as is Pad Kee Mao. Beware when ordering because spicy means spicy.
