Juicy, mouthwatering-- I don't think I've ever had a burger like this before!. . The quality at Father's Office is exceptional. I've been here twice and my burger was perfectly medium rare, just as requested. I love that they have their own specialty sauce (yummy!) for the fries/sweet potato fries, but I am a total ketchup lover (I love it on practically everything), I was tempted to pull a Vivian (Pretty Woman) moment-- I, of course opted to stay classy (plus, they don't stock on ketchup, and I didn't have my own individual packet of ketchup at the time). Anyway, don't mind me, I'm just being nit picky.. . I'm not a beer drinker, in fact it's just gross, but FO introduced me to my first favorite beer, Lindemans Peche Lambic (Peach Beer!!). . Thanks Father's Office, I'll definitely not FO, if you know what I mean. :)
