Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Took the family and met the sister-in-law's family to celebrate 3 kids graduations.  June is a very busy time for Lawry's due to graduations and anniversary's (all those weddings in June).. Our reservation for 8 people was for 5pm.  We did not have to wait, but the dining arena was already 70-80% occupied.. Service was very attentive, and very professional.  As you have read, Lawry's serves the prime rib, and most sides from steel rolling tableside serving carts.  These cost over $30K each, and they had 7 out in the arena that night.  Each cart costs the same as a Lexus ES350 (without premium accessory package). Roast beef was very tender and had good flavor.  Medium rare was pink, but not read.  Au Jus was excellent.  They offer two horseradish sauces, pure hot and cremed/whipped that is less hot.  I find that combining them is about right.  Mash potatoes were as good as you would expect, and the brown gravy was ok - slight bitter edge on the aftertaste, but not so bad that it distracted from the experience.. Cremed spinach was rich and flavorful.  My wife had the salmon is citrus glaze.  Pretty good.. I made my reservation on OpenTable, and noted the kids graduation.  Without prompting, the waitress brought raspberry shortcake w/ fresh heavy whipped creme w/ candles to the graduates.  Very nice touch.  This place is a splurge but a very safe place to go that always meets your expectations of a moderate-to-high $$$-$$$$ prime rib house.  It really is a good brand extension of the Lawry's seasoning empire which is now owned by Unilever).. I go to Lawry's about 1x every 4-5 years.
