Love this place for brunch. I got the blueberry pancakes...THREE whopping flapjacks with lots and lots of blueberries immersed in the cakey goodness. I thought I could eat it all myself, but all I did was put a dent in it! I was only able to finish one and a half pancakes and I was beyond stuffed.. My friends got the nutella french toast to split, a smart move since they didn't end up suffering like me in the end!!!. . I really want to try the Golden Ticket Pancakes when I go there again. Would also like to try some regular breakfast items like eggs and potatoes.. . Be sure to get there early or go a little later in the afternoon - otherwise you will wait in line for a very very long time. . . Overall, yummy place for a great casual brunch!
