Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
If I lived closer to Wiener's Circle, I would weigh 200 pounds more.  I love the Char Dogs. And cheese fries.  So much.  I want one now.. Great spot, obviously it can get out of control, I have seen some crazy shit in there, but I really don't care what is going on around me, as long as I get my Char Dog.  Hold the relish.
