Argh, being V-Day soon, I thought it was proper to review this place.  . . I took the ol' lady here last year around V-Day. A nice little surprise for her, she saw it on L-Word and was all about the venue.  . . Then we sat down.  Service was a bit slow.  The food was merely so-so.  . The prices are reasonable, but I would be willing to shell out a few extra bucks for a head chef who knew what they were doing. . . The view is nice. The decor is awesome.  It's a great building and Hollywood landmark.  So is the sign. Doesn't mean I'll go to either to get a drink or a bite. . . In other words, find another place.  Be more original than I was.  Or, as they say, you often get what you deserve.  Leave Yamashiro to the newbies, tourists and townies. . . Or something like that.
