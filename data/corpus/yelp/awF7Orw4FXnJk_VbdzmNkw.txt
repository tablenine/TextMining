The place/building is really cool Â - the crowd is different...I liked the setting.. . But the food was not ok. . Do not get the Prosciutto pizza. It has this broccoli crap that is so bitter,. it made the pizza disgusting. And I like spinach and broccoli. . The truffle fries - I was not impressed. Real fries are way better if you are going to eat fried stuff'. . The salad with goat cheese was the best thing and it was just ehhh. The bread they serve on table was cold, I hate that. . Wont be back!
