I had heard this place was really good. Sadly , other then decor , nothing in this place impressed me or my dining companions. We came on a weekday night and it was quite packed. That seemed like a positive sign. . We ordered half of the appetizers on the menu and lavender mojito which was recommended by the server. The mojito lacked punch.. it tasted like a generic ice tea. The server brought all the appetizers at one go even though there was no place for them on our table. He over lapped the Â serving plates!! Seriously .. tuna tartar sticking on the coconut shrimp.. not desirable!!. The food was bleh.. even the hot appetizers were cold . Everything was flavorless. Oh and did I mention the server nearly dropped a plate on my husbands head!! Thankfully hubby ducked and it fell on the floor.. We left the restaurant after that to get some real food.
