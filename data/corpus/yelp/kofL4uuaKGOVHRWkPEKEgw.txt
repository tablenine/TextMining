Some of the dishes are great, some are just blah.  The unusual balsamic vinegarette is very nice, as is the panzarotti appetizer.  As a special, I've had chicken vesuvio ravioli, which is spectacular.  But the mafaldina is only so-so, and some of the specials border on ridiculous with the number of ingredients.. . Roseangelis does have a fantastic outdoor seating area, though, which makes sitting through some of the poorer dishes worth it.
