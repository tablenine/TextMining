MEAT HOLE!!!. . Holy crap, I'm in a meat hole.... . Tunnel vision... everything's getting darker... and it looks like I'm staring out of a pit, with 8 gauchos holding meat skewers and knives at the opening.. . Aaaaagh... breathe... sloooooowly breathe.. . I'm going to give birth to a 300 lbs. calf.. . ------------. . So I finally got a chance to try this place out.. . It's pretty nice inside... and kind of like what I mentioned in my review for Greenfields - you can feel kind of underdressed walking in, until you see a bunch of other people in shorts and t-shirts.. . The meats:. . The best, by far that I enjoyed, was the filet mignon.. . Ooooh wait... maybe the beef ribs.... . Ooooh wait... maybe it was the lamb chops.... . Ooooh nooo... it could've been the prime rib.... . I dunno, I couldn't decide.   : ). . One bit of warning!  It's kind of pricey (2 dinners + bottle of wine + 2 desserts + tip = $228.63).. . Also, don't forget to bring some cash with you (it's $5.50 for valet service + tip).. . The service was very attentive.  But I think a bit TOO attentive.  Very, very polite... but  almost overbearing at times.. . My glass never got past being half empty and after saying "thank you" about 18 times every time someone came up to service us - I just started ignoring them and let them do there job.... . ... but then I started feeling all snobby and stuff.  Cool people though (meaning, the staff) - I was joking around with most of them and they were all pretty laid back and friendly.  I can't believe one of them talked me into eating a damn dessert.... . He should be a car salesman.  Damn thing was GREAT!. . Some papaya ice cream with a type of liquor poured over it.... WOW.. . ----------------. . So, summary?. . I thoroughly enjoyed myself:. .    Great quality meats!.    Friendly and knowledgeable staff..    Nice decor.. . I would suggest toning down the service a little bit... you guys are great - and I guess it's MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better than being ignored.. . Or maybe I'm just not as high-maintenance as some people.. . Okay... so save up your months allowance and treat yourself if you love eating great tasting flesh cut from really cute animals!. . ... vegetarians - come at your own risk, you have no business here!
