Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I think everybody should experience Pink's at least once in their lives. But two pointers though -- try not to go on a weekend night after 6 PM. But if you must, then try to find parking on the street. We waited two hours on a Friday night (not a big surprise) for a fully loaded hot dog, Onion Fries and italian soda. I totally went insane and ordered the "Martha Stewart" dog because I wasn't too hungry. Bad mistake. It didn't fill me up that much, and didn't taste that good either. I think the next time I go, I'm gonna order the fully loaded with the mushrooms. Hee hee.. .  I cannot say that I'd make this my daily stop, but I'd come back again. Weeeee!
