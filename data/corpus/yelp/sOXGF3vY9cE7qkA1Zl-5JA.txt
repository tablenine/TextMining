Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This is a Taiwanese institution.  Wifey reminds me of this all the time.  Apparently, Din Tai Fung started out in Taipei and grew in popularity because of the quality of its ingredients and their renowned service (which is quite astonishing considering service in Taiwan ain't a high priority in any restaurant).  This place expanded and expanded and now El Lay  has a branch of its very own!. . Now I've been to the Taipei branch several times, it was good, real good.  So good in fact that I became a Din Tai Fung crack addict.  Every time we'd visit Taiwan, I'd drag wifey to this dumpling place despite her objections.  For some reason, despite their renowned reputation, most Taiwanese consider Din Tai Fung to be too "touristy".  Go figger.... . The dumplings at DTF are created with scientific precision.  Each one weighs exactly 16 grams and the signature pork dumplings have exactly 18 folds on the dumpling skins.  Now it was really fun watching the cooks make 'em in Taiwan.  Imagine how fun it is watching the mexican cooks make 'em here in El Lay!!!!. . Do they taste any different than in Taiwan?  Nope.  I'd say we're gettin' a pretty good representation right here in smog city.  Is the service as renowned as in Taipei?  Not even fucking close!!!. Servers here actually look kinda pissed when they take your order.  God-forbid you check off something on the order sheet by mistake, if you try to erase it, the server will come over to slap your hand.  And forget about a private table during busy times (which is most of the day).  Sharing a table with strangers is the norm here.  I won't even get into the menacing eyeballing you're going to get from the hostess if you take your time to enjoy your friggin' dumplings.. . Service blows, but those dumplings are heavenly!
