Totally pleased to find it non-crowded and cheap and nonetheless next to the El stop on a Saturday night. I had pop-eye noodles (spinachy, hold the sprouts), my boy had red curry, and we were sated and pleased at the super fastness. The decor was kinda odd, like a Buddha-curious high schooler watched Christopher Lowell's rag-painting special and ran amok with the Dutch Boy, but that 's just nit-pickery.
