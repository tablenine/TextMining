first thing when you walk in, is like wow red carpet. great serivce and great food. the best steak house i have ever been to in my life. i was vacationing in la and wanted to take my boyfriend to a nice restraunrat. found this place on yelp and decided to check it out. usually in pricy places like this, u would dink the portions are small, but the apperitizers are huge and so are the side dishes. we over ordered way too much even though our waiter warned us. the tuna poke is so yummy. my bf ordered a steak that was so tender and i order the sea bass and is was so delicious. the mush rooms and cream of corn for the sides were the best and for dessert we ordered the butter cake. it was huge. i was so full but i had to try it and if i could i would have eatten the whole thing. i would come back here any time. for everything i ordered i thought the price was resonable. people if u are looking for a steak house, check this place out!
