I had an unusually bad experience here so I think I may have to give this place another try.  Our waitress was incredibly scatterbrained and was never around when we needed her.  It was busy at the time, but not THAT busy.  My boyfriend's pancakes were cold, and we ended up borrowing syrup off the table next to us since there wasn't any brought over (I was under the impression that pancakes and syrup go hand in hand.  Apparently this assumption was not shared by our waitress).  We asked for refills on our coffee, but after 10-15 min with no coffee we decided to just get the check and get out of there.  And just as we're getting up to leave...here comes the refill haha.
