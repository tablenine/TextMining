Damn! I had the Turkey Cowboy burger W/O bacon and the sweet potato chips and I was n burger heaven. The service was quick and friendly. I'm in love with the Chipotle Ranch sauce and they validate your parking. Will I be back. Absolutely! Justt open another spot some where or sell that damn sauce. This is not Burger Bing, McDonalds or Hardee's. If you you want cheap crap go there.
