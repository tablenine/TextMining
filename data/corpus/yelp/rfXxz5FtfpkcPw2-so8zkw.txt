This place was fantastic!. .   Aside from some minor seating issues (we had a party of 8, and we were seated like a party of 6), everything went off very, very well.. .   The appetizers were amazing. I had a bruschetta that involved chicken bites wrapped in bacon, and also some light sauce (that tasted like salted broccoli) which was just incredible! I wanted to eat it with a spoon!!!!. .   My main course was a custom pizza on which I chose sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, and garlic. Wow. That WAS a tasty pizza. I don;t often eat a whole pizza, but I almost did this time (left 1 piece). . .   Everyone else at the table equally enjoyed their meals.. . Good prices for the quality of the food. Worth every cent, and also a good tip.. . Try it out!!!
