They get offended if you ask for ketchup. I thought we're American. I tried to tell them that it goes really good with fries.. . They don't seat you... you're left to hunt down for a "bench" on your own, so even if you get there 15 minutes ahead of someone else, you can still get screwed. If you get peeved when people cut you in line, be prepared. It's literally like musical chairs. If individuals are going to spend $30 for a meal and a beer, you could do the courtesy of seating your guests.. . The worst thing about this place is the snooty attitude problem that the staff has. I'm not the only one that feels the vibe they give off... as if it's an honor for you to eat there. Seriously... it's a freaking bar! F.O. can F.O. in my book.  Highly overated.  Oh and if you want a REAL burger? Go to the Counter.
