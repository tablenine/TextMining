Came here today as a pleasant surprise on a lunch date. . . I ordered the Iced Roseberry Tea. I am usually not a tea drinker, but decided to give this a try. It was actually great. I was truly surprised at how flavorful it was. . . For my entree I had the Tac-o' The Town...silly name...serious dish. We fucked around with the name a bit before our food came which was pretty fun (that alone is worth 5 stars). I scoffed at the price originally, but honestly for the amount of food and the flavor that it had it was almost worth the price.. . My date ordered the Ciao Bella sandwich. Not sure how it tasted but he waaaaaaay tore that up. . . The service here was fast and friendly. These people seemed to enjoy their job...which is always great to see. . . I will def be back here again but I will try to come for the brunch next time!
