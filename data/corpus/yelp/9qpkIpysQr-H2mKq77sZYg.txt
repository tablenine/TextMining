Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I've eaten here twice so far, since I'm now in the hood and it's pretty damn good, and relatively inexpensive.  Lobster ravioli was a definite hit with my mom and I and the chopped salad was good if underdressed and undersalted.  Not a huge fan of the meatballs..... really expected a bigger portion and they just were uninspiring.  No bread?  Don't know if that is weird or cheap, but we do live in LA , the anti carb capitol of the world.  Service was mediocre on our 1st trip, but it doesn't seem like the kind of place that inspires professional waiters if you know what I mean.  . . Gelato bar is great, service there is excellent.  Lots of choices and suggestions and tons of tastes, so you don't commit to an ice cream you can't eat a lot of.  I've had 6 flavors so far and they are all pretty good.  My favs so far?  Choc/hazelnut, vanilla crunch and the grapefruit.  I strongly suggest you try it, if not just for the gelato.  Prices are pretty reasonable as well!
