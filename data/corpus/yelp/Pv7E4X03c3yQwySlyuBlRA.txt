1 Star: Eek! Me thinks NOT.. . Re: Watching the 2010 World Cup. . Situation: When you call the restaurant/bar to find out more details about watching the World Cup final game there and they tell you entry is free, you would expect this to be the case.  After all, these sorts of details help the consumer pick and choose where they want to go.  But when arriving at entrance of the place, we were greeted with a $10 COVER.  . . Seriously? I beg your pardon? There's a reason why customers call beforehand.  And I wasn't the only one because other people had also said they had called and were told that there was no cover.   . . It's one thing to state it from the get-go but to get greedy because you see that there's a huge line that's formed and decide last minute that hey, you could make some extra money, is revolting.  It disgusts me that the best interest of the customer is no longer a principle valued by places like Bar Celona.  Instead, they are consumed by the selfish desire for wealth.  It's not like they were offering any specials inside either.  What if, after waiting in that huge line, you had no cash to pay the cover? Then you would have to scour the streets to find an ATM and re-enter the line again hoping that the place has not filled to maximum capacity.  . . We requested to speak to the manager and were denied.  "You either pay the cover or leave," said the bouncer.  Had my mind and my group not been so set on watching it at this Spanish place (game was on ABC, mind you), we would have left in an instant.  . . It's reassuring to know that other people have had bad experiences at Bar Celona.  Now I can confirm that I won't be going back.  . . Shame on you, Bar Celona...
