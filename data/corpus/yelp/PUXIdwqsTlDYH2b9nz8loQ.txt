I tried this "food" for the first (and last time) this past Friday. My girlfriend kept telling me about how great this Kogi truck is, or so she keeps hearing. Well, then we noticed that the truck comes around about a block from our house. So we go and try it. Wait in line for 1 1/2HRS! Then get our food about another 30MIN LATER! . Definitely overpriced, over hyped garbage. Since we never had it before, we tried one of each of their tacos, a quesadilla, burritos and the hot dog. The kimchi is DISGUSTING. We spent a total of $38!! And we didn't even finish it. The burritos, we took a couple of bites and that was enough. That was the worst $38 i have EVER spent on a meal. We fed that crap to our dogs. Never again. F this stupid Kogi crap. We wished we I had spent our money at the damn Del Taco that was half a block away. Also, my girlfriend threw up after having the quesadilla. UGH! CRAP FOOD!
