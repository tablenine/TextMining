Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
The staff here is so friendly and accomodating, not to mention the ramen is SUPAA OISHII = excellent!. Although it is Hakata style, you can choose the "hardness" of your noodles, as well as the flavor &amp; oiliness. I personally enjoy hard noodles with strong flavor and a side of spicy miso. It's totally affordable - about seven dollars - but if you go on their "sale" days as one of the first five hundred people, it's only three bucks!!!! Well worth any price though, since ramen in SD pales in comparison.
