Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
I've tried Cafe Selmarie twice now and haven't been thrilled either time.  I've ordered a variety of pastries for my guests and myself, and they've been hard or dry everytime.  The pastries I've tried seem like they're a few days old already.  Not really worth returning for a third time.  Not to mention that the girl behind the counter kept coughing as she was boxing up my stuff!  And how about the $1.60 for a can of Coke???  Think I'll just skip the pastries and hit up Cold Stone Creamery down the street next time.
