Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
a wonderful dinner with wonderful ambiance.  a friend and i went to the little door on the recommendation of another friend and it was worth it!  the service was fantastic - i had my dog with me (and sadly, he doesn't fit in a purse) and the hostess made every effort to see if the patio qualified as "outdoor" and therefore let him stay.  it was mutually decided that my dog would remain the car, but that the fact that she didn't scoff at my request really impressed me. . . we were seated at a lovely table in the patio anyway and had a wonderful dinner from the ever-rotating menu options.  the waitress suggested their special, i believe it was salmon that day, but i can still remember that it was a delicious dish.  i have no doubt that any dish the chef prepares will be delicious.  and organic cooking to boot!. . the food is great, the service is great and the experience is wonderful.  this is a sexy, sexy restaurant!
