If you like garlic, this is a nice place to be. . Recommend to try their sizzling iron skillet roasted, the mussels and shrimp one is good.. Garlic Steamed Clams, Baked Portobello Mushroom, Popcorn Calamari, Roasted Garlic Bulb, and Meat Loaf are all good.. . Nice bar area as the waiting area sometimes get too packed.. . Valet parking available and almost a must.
