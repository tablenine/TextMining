It almost seems frivolous to write a review about a place so heavily reviewed... almost.  I figure it's the mass of reviews that helps show others where the best places are to go, so here's my 2 cents.. . Love the sandwiches.  French dipped and simple.  Slice of cheese on beef always seems to be the most appealing to me.  I tried the pickled egg tonight just to see what was up with it, and it didn't really thrill me.  It was fine, but I probably wouldn't spend money on it again.  . . The drinks are cheap.  I tend to opt for the free water, but you can also get a 65 cent cup of lemonade, or 55 cent cup of iced tea.  Great price... but they are on the small side.  My friend ordered a cup of 9 cent coffee, being very thrilled at the price, only to discover why it was probably worth only 9 cents.  Though she did end up drinking the whole cup, so it must've not been all that bad.. . Great place to go out to eat if you don't want to spend a whole lot and want a very casual, no frills atmosphere.  Also a great place to take out of towners.
