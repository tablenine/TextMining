Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Based on the good reviews of Parker's, we decided to check it out. We arrived around 9 p.m. with no reservation on a Saturday night and it was quite busy. The hostess was very pleasant and noted a table had just cleared and she would seat us momentarily. Once seated, our server, Freddy, promptly greeted us, told us the specials they had that evening, took our drink order and brought us water. So far, so good. . . I ordered the 8 ounce New York strip steak cooked medium rare with a side of the black truffle mac &amp; cheese. The steak was cooked perfectly, but had no flavor and it was on the tough side. The mac &amp; cheese was really good. However, was not hot - it was actually room temperature and I love my food hot and could only imagine that this dish would have been excellent had it been served hot. . . Since the entree was only $16, I didn't feel "ripped off"; but I was disappointed. . . I give Parkers one star for the great service and one star for the room temp mac &amp; cheese.
