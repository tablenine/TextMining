This place is a hole-in-the-wall, but it's a bourgie hole-in-the-wall in Los Feliz with the clientele to match. Dennis I is right - you won't see the King Taco crowd here. Yuca's lacks the realness of a true East LA taqueria, both in style and substance, and while there is indeed a major difference, it's not necessarily a step down in quality, but that also depends on what you're specifically talking about.. . The pibil here is juicy and flavorful, on the same level as the other cochinita pibil places in LA (I would prefer Chicken Itza for a complete meal, or La Flor De Yucatan for better prices) I did like the carne asada here, and while I wouldn't crown it the best carne asada I've had, I was surprised at how much I did enjoy it. It's different than the more smokey char-flavored asada at other taquerias, because it's juicier with a sweeter marinade. Almost like Korean BBQ but not as sweet, which isn't a bad thing - I prefer it to the Korean BBQ tacos. While the tacos here are a little bigger than normal, they're still expensive at $2-2.50 a taco (so if you're concerned with a price per weight value, the cost is above average). The tortillas are also different - they're made from flour and more chewy than the warmed corn tortillas, but the nice thing is that they help to absorb some of the juices from the meat. The weakest point here is probably that the salsa isn't particularly inspired but just decent. The service was really quick and I came here before the lunch rush and had my food prepared a minute after I ordered it.
