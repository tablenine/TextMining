This place is cute, casual and perfect for a relaxing brunch. I went there on a Thursday with Javeck V.'s fiance. Thanks to all the yelp reviews, I got a big hankering for french toast the night before and decided that Square One seemed like the perfect spot to satisfy this hankering of mine.. I ordered the brioche french toast with the bourbon pecan topping. It was good but really really sweet! A little too sweet for my liking. My friend ordered the brioche french toast with the seasonal warm fruit topping. Her's was delicious! I definitely would recommend the fruit topping over the bourbon pecan. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. It was just right. Yum!. Their OJ was also really good. A little pricey for such a small glass, but hey, what do you expect for fresh squeezed OJ in Hollywood.
