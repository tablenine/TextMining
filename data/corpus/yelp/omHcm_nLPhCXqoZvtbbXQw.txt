Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe's signature waffles . + juicy, crispy fried chicken . + butter . + syrup. + gravy. ________________________. SUPER DUPER YUMMY. . How have I gone 28 years of life without even knowing about chicken and waffles let alone going and relishing this wonderful dining experience? I feel like someone somewhere along the line really let me down and I will seek out said person and make him/her take me to chicken and waffles to make it up to me.. . I got the chicken breast w/ one waffle and a side of gravy. It was the perfect amount of food, the waffle was light and tasty, and the fried chicken was some of the best I've had in a long time - besides my own, naturally :p I greatly enjoyed mixing all the flavors together and getting the salty and sweet together in perfect, fatty, cholesteral-laden harmony. Service is fast and friendly, there's a bit of a wait and it's in need of some remodeling, but the food is well worth it.
