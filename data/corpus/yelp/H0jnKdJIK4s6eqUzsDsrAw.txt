So you think you like burritos...well, you gotta try this place.   My fam loves the Hollenbeck aka the GINORMOUS burrito that can't even fit on a plate...they need a slab of cardboard to carry that thing.  I am personally a fan of the guacamole &amp; taquitos, but will partake in the gluttony when this burrito is around.  I swear it can feed a family of 5 with no problem.  If you attempt to eat it by yourself you will have problems.  That being said, the meat in the burrito is a little tough and only eat this if you like spicy foods.   . . So if you go, plan on a long wait.  Luckily, my Grandma still lives down the street so when we are craving to add a few pounds, we call in our order to go and bypass the line.
