This was a very memorable meal as it was my 30th birthday meal. The presentation is just lovely here. Jason was our server, as recommended by other Yelpers, and he was just great. This was a pretty pricey meal, but it was worth it. The Ginger Lime Martini was excellent. We split some apps; the asparagus salad and the trio of tofu, as well as the mushroom soup. All of those were great. I got the duck breast, which was very good, but not my favorite preparation ever. The desserts we got were the breton butter cake and the banana crepes. This was a long time ago (May), but I would definitely be back here again.
