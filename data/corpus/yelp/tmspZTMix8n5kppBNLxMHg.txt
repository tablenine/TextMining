Restaurant: Strip House Steak House
Category: Steakhouses
NY Strip is pretty excellent here.  The steaks have a nice buttery flavor to them and is prepared very well.  This is definitely a guys place and would say that this is definitely one of the better steak houses in Manhattan.  The location of this steak house is nice because you don't see many good steak houses outside of 40-50's east.  Try the goose fat potatoes as well.  The crowd usually consists of young professionals so you don't get too much of the old corporates which is also a plus.
