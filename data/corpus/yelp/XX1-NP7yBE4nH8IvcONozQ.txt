I saw an email via DailyCandy ages ago and had been dreaming of waffles on wheels.  I checked out their site and even considered getting a group of people together so that we could get them to come to us instead of us having to track them down.. . Finally checked it out in front of Trader Joe's and got 2 waffles (brussels and  liege):. . If you must, get the:. . Brussels (crunchy, light and yum yum): I agree w/ the description but might have to take away one "yum".  It was crunchy but a little too light and airy.  We ordered it w/ strawberries sand whipped cream.. . Skip the: . . Liege (chewy, rich and flavorful): chewy yes...rich and flavorful...I'll have to think about it.  It was significantly smaller than the brussels wafel and way too chewy.  It was a struggle to even come close to finishing b/c it just wasn't that good.  Got this w/ strawberries and powdered sugar (in an attempt to minimize caloric intake) and have come to the conclusion that whipped cream or ice cream (wish it was available) is a MUST.. . Iced Coffee: not bad, but not that great.  Could've used more ice and cream.. . If I want waffels, I'm going to hit up Petite Abeille - they have one w/ vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce that makes for an awesome dessert to share at brunch!
