1:15 PM - Me &amp; Co. are seated in the patio for brunch.  Lunch? No, brunch.  It's so New York. . . 1:30 PM - Fresh house-made rustic banana bread w/ softened lemon butter served on a wooden cutting board.  Awesome.  I can hear the scale tipping already. 2 lbs.. . 1:45 PM - He hates his job.  Slo-mo server, lacking a zest for life, jots down our order.. . 1:45 PM ~ 2:15 PM - Lots of people watching behind stunner shades and cap.. . 2:15 PM ~ 3:15 PM - My shadow cast by the sun has crept over ninety degrees and I'm having hypoglycemic shakes.  Still no sign of food.  Curt responses from said server, "It's coming." . . 3:15 - Huevos rancheros, a big juicy burger on an english muffin and I don't remember what else arrives finally and our server was without emotion.  Not even a faint apology.  The slick manager dressed in seersucker, on the other hand, was very gracious and comped the entire bill explaining the kitchen lost our order.  That was proper.. . 3 stars food - 2 star lame server + 2 star manager who reversed behavior of lame server + 1 for a great place to chill under the sky.
