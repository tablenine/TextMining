Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Caf√©
Category: Cuban
Thank you America for banning trade and vacation to Cuba. You are infringing on my right to be even fatter than I already am. I want to eat a Cuban sandwich in Cuba. But do you know what's a close second? Eating on at 90 Miles. . . This place is awesome from the food even down to the decorations and the testimonials on the wall from local celebrities. They even have a heated patio section to make this place way bigger than it normally would be. And it is WARM, its not like some places who have to constantly fight to keep it just above freezing. . . Lets get to the food. Oh the papas relleno (SP) I'm sorry. But its fried potato with meat inside. Its one of the best things ever. With my diet I eat Vegetarian 6 days a week and I give myself one day to carnivore it up. This place is my fix. . . The Cuban sandwich. I want to inject it, I want to smoke it. Hell someone teach me how to free base it. It is the perfect blend of meats, melted cheese and mustard. The bread is the perfect accompaniment. . . This place rules. The food is so good. The atmosphere is so warm and inviting and the wait staff and management are the nicest people on the planet. Seriously check this place out!!
