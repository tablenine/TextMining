I had the ramen at Daikokuya only once before, and have been meaning to find a reason to go back..and jury duty was it! :)  . . I get lost around downtown very easily, so I need the gps on in unexplored territory..  Following people around is even better (human gps's)!  After waiting forever for lunchtime in the crowded jury hall, my two newly befriended jurors and I went to Little Tokyo! . . On weekdays, the line to eat delicious ramen is a lot shorter.  On Tuesday, during the lunch hours, it took about 20 minutes for a table of three, and I think generally 5-10 minutes for a table of one.. . I had the Daikokuya ramen, a murky broth of pork belly, a (perfect) half-boiled egg , and a sprinkle of veggies (erm, look at Dave's description haha). :)  You can order it already in the soup, or on a separate plate.  The noodles were a good consistency, elastic and chewy.  . . Compared to Shin-Sen-Gumi, I believe that Shin-Sen-Gumi wins out on the broth, as there appears to be a richer taste.  I guess the pork belly could be a bit more tender.. :) The half-boiled egg is my favorite..     . . Although..space is quite limited, the interior design is really interesting, vintage Japanese items everywhere!  The service is prompt and efficient.  Cute girls!
