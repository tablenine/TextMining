I'm not gonna waste my time typing more than:. . "You gotta get them PORK CHA SIU!!". . I've never had BBQ pork as juicy and tasty as this. It goes SO well with beer. . . I just wish they had a mini ramen.... because the ramen was okay. You can challenge on the hell-raised spicy ramen that'll probably burn more calories sweating and tearing than eating. But it's just okay.. . I'd say just simply, pork it up.
