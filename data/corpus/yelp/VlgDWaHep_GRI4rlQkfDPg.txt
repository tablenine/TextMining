Restaurant: La Fonda Latina
Category: Latin American
I'm not sure what category you would put this restaurant in, but their seafood paella keeps me coming back (the best I've had outside of Spain), and when I can find someone to drive, I enjoy their margaritas too, and occasionally their Irish coffee. Their fish tacos were somewhat disappointing, you can find better elsewhere. They make Cuban sandwiches too, but I haven't tried them, I usually go to Papi's or Las Palmeras when I'm in the mood for that.
