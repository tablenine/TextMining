Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Oh, Daikokuuuuuuu.. . I once did not like Japanese ramen, but Daikokuya changed my mind. . This is a place my friends and I go weekly, sometimes biweekly. It's so satisfying on a rainy or cold day.. . The broth is what keeps you coming back. Made from boiling soysauce and pork bones for a full day. They also have the special option of adding more pork fat in it. It's super fatty, but can satisfy like none other when you're just having one of those days.. . One thing that most people don't know is that you can get 1/2 orders of ramen. It's perfect for people like me who cannot finish a whole bowl (b/c I order other things as well :D). . . I've tried pretty much everything on their menu. Their rice bowls are 'eh' - you can get these at any other restaurant in Jtown (even at the J grocery stores). Their sashimi is not very good - sometimes tough, stringy. Their salad is addicting, it's the sauce! My favorite thing to order besides the ramen is their gyoza. You can tell its fresh (not the prepackaged kind)! . . The only downfall is the long wait. They used to not have a wait, but somehow, all of a sudden, everyone and their moms know about this place. Find street parking or park at JVP, have them put your name down, and walk around Jtown.
