Living next to Little Saigon for 3 years, I scoffed at the idea of coming to an "upscale" Vietnamese restaurant aka Asian restaurant for white people. But I was pleasantly surprised... My girl friend and I showed up around 830 Saturday night and had a 20 minute wait, so we walked to the liquor store and found some travel size Chardonnay to drink fabulously on the sidewalk while we waited with the other silverlake hippies and hipsters. But the host kindly called the celly to let us know our table was ready so we ditched our brown baggin' it wino idea and settled in our seats for fresh mango mimosas.  . . I'm not much of a sweet drink kind of gal, but these mimosas were fizzy and refreshing. We had the shrimp and yam fritters which was something my Garden Grove Vietnamese friends had never showed me (still not sure if this is something made for the gringos or authentic) but it was scrumptious and the fresh mint and cilantro accompanied with it were a perfect combination.  . . We also tried the crab and avocado roll which was puny and almost awkwardly served on a large, lonely white plate with ONE roll cut in thirds. Last time I checked crab was not on the endangered list. . . The best was the Gingergrass Tofu. Oh my, I'm still dreaming about it. The tofu melts in your mouth, the shitaki mushrooms have a perfect earthly flavor, the bok choy was fresh and made for a great contrast with the shrooms and tofu. And really, I don't know what it was with that rice, but it was, no joke, the best rice I've ever had. . . We had another round of mimosas - but this time we tried the lychee - delish.. . For desert -the lime coconut bars with coconut sorbetto. Meh, I wouldn't recommend this - a little too sweet and just didn't go with the whole meal. Next time I'll hit up the ginger creme brule... and a coffee. . . This place makes do-over status.
