OK, is Sushi Gen one of those over rated places?. I've heard from people that Sushi gen is pretty expensive and I was not sure if this place was " Omakase worthy", so I decided to order Sashimi deluxe.. The potion was American size and it was way too much.. There are 6 pieces of Toro on my plate and I couldn't finish it. It's just too much.. The fish selection on the deluxe plate was very interesintg,,,,, there was a tiny piece of grilled salmon, and I thought it was odd. It looked like left over from Makanai.. I also ordered Ankimo sashimi, and it was not my favorite.(It was better than Otafuku,though). I will go there one more time and see if this place is at least 4 star worthy.
