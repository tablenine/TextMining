Let me issue my little caveat: This review is favorable, in large part, because of the ambiance--a potentially huge factor in any dining experience, in my book.. . There, I said it. Now, let me be honest, the food here isn't the best. It's cafeteria food steeped in tradition, old-worldliness, and comfortability. No, they're not the absolute best sandwiches I've had but that's probably because my taste buds have been so accustom to MSG, high fructose corn syrup, and generic seasoning salt for so long that I am not used to the simplicities of bread, cheese, and meat au jus. But on the flip side, it's definitely not the worst sandwich I've had. Far from it.. . When I bite into the aforementioned bread, cheese, and meat au jus there's nothing quite as satisfying because you're surrounded by decor that's nearly as simple and comfortable. Saw dust on the ground, communal tables with little condiment stations and service so unabashedly old school that you can't help but feel like you've stepped back in time.. . I'm no fan boy of tradition; I'm only a fan of tradition if it works and Phillipe works.. . PS--If you're not completely grossed out by it, try the pickled (purple) eggs. I get one every time.
