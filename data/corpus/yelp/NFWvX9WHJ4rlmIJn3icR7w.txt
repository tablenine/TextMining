Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I wish I knew what Wiener's Circle tasted like sober.  It is so delicious when I am drunk I am drooling just thinking about it.  I have a feeling that would be less true when it isn't 3am and I can remember my name.  . . It is not only the food, but I also tend to have the most surreal experiences and meet the craziest people here.  What can be better when you are drunk than fighting with the cashier's!
