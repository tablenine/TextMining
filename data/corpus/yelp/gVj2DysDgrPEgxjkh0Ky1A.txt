OH - MY - GOODNESS!. . This place BLEW me away on Valentine's Day. . . Yes we had to wait 1.5 hours for a table but SO worth it! . . We started with the sampler cold plate with the pineapple/cucumber/jalapeno salad, the raw squash salad and the hearts of palm/chickpeas. Yum!. . Then we had the pumpkin ravioli and the sweet potato pancakes...I will dream of those ravioli's for weeks to come...I cannot, in words, describe the sheer yummy awesomeness of those raviolis. The pancakes were really good too.. . Last we had the curry. A bit conventional after the raviolis and pancakes but still good. :-) . . We had four of their sake cocktails. The pineapple, the coconut, the pear and the apple ones...the three fruit ones were all really good with the pear being my fav. The coconut one was okay but it didn't stand up to the fruit ones. . . Dessert was chocolate covered strawberries...I think they were supposed to have some chili pepper in chocolate but I didn't taste it.....the dark chocolate was amazing....all in all they were good but not really worth the $1.50 each but hey, it was Valentine's Day. :-)
