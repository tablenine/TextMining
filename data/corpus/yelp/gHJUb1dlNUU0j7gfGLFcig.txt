Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Brunch is my favorite meal of the day!  . . The wait on a Sunday morning for six people was 10 minutes.  There's a parking lot behind the restaurant that you may park for free.  We were seated in this private room in the back of the restaurant.  It was nice and quiet.  My first concern was that the waiter would forget about us  but he was really good about checking to make sure we were doing fine.  . . We've been told the portions are huge but we couldn't pass up the offer to try as much as possible.  We all decided to order one dish and share family style.  Based on my dad and bf's feedback, the French coffee was awesome!  To top it off, the French coffee had complimentary refills.  BOMB!. . This is what we end up ordering...let's just say I'm thankful that I didnt eat before coming here.  . 1.  Banana Nana pancake - between the two, I would order this pancake again.  Not too sweet but total kick-butt pancake that reminded me of banana bread.  . 2.  Scotch on the Rocks pancake - I dont have a sweet tooth so this was too sweet for me.. 3.  Apple Cobbler French Toast - I believe that was the least hit during our visit.  I didnt have stomach room to try the french toast.. 4.  Poached y Papas Benedict - this is the only reason I would come back to Griddle Cafe.  I've never...EVER ate such a delicious combination of ham, two poached eggs and my all-time fave, potato skins!  Everyone loved this dish!!!  . 5.  Muscle Bound Scamble - light and refreshing dish.  We chose turkey maple sausage and we felt that was a good choice.. 6.  Big T Melt - basically a tuna melt with steak french fries.  I'm a fan of tuna melts and this ROCKed!  I finished my leftovers the same day!. . It's only been less than one week since I've visited and I'm already craving the Benedict!  MUST HAVE MOREEE!
