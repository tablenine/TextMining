Cortadito...is the best expresso with warm milk...Machiatoo....or cafe con leche...yumyum..... . The fetta cheese sandwich is excellent and cheap..... to me, this is as good as it gets.. . The other pastries are way too fattening, altough way too tasty.... I see we only have 1045 reviews...so i better stop here. . See you there?. :)
