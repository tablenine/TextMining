Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
I'm not a fan of beer, so I guess I'll never get the full Brickstore Experience, but I love it just the same.. . The service is good, the food is good (B.S. Pasta is my jam) and the actual building is beautiful. . . Parking is a pain since it's right on the square.
