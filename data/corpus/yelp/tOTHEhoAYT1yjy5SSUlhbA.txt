Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Unfortunately, i have been cheating on shin sen gumi with other, younger, hotter, tastier ramen.... i had to remove a star, because i have, indeed, found better.. . im sorry to do this baby, but.. its not you.. its me.. my taste buds have evolved and they want more... . . Although you are no longer my favorite place, you will forever hold a spot in my heart (and in my mouth) as my FIRST good ramen. . . You were the gateway into this elite society, bent on conquering and taste-testing the ramens of the world and organizing them into some sort of heirarchy so that other lovers may follow without the trials and tribulations of having bad ramen.. You were the first to introduce those special spoons with the little nooks that prevent them from falling into the broth bath.. You gave me my first authentic Japanese Greeting...and Farewell.. You were the first to offer programs of HOW to eat traditional japanese cuisine via television, while waiting to ACTUALLY eat a traditional japanese meal.. You are still the only one that offers different noodle textures, soup base, and oil quantity.. . YOU are and forever will be...the only SHIN SEN GUMI for me!. heart.
