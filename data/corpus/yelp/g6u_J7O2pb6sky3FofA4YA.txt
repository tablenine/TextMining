Yesterday I was in desperate need of some delicious curry tofu.  I didn't want Lucky Buddha, and wanted a step up from Chinese Buddha.  So I found Spoon after searching for Thai on Yelp.  As far as Thai near Tech is concerned, I've found my favorite.  I ordered the green curry with tofu to go.  It was ready on time, only ~$8 (+tip).   I drive on home, battle traffic, but when I sit down with my curry tofu, everything was just great.  It was delicious!  The curry sauce was pretty spicy and very flavorful, there were tons of veggies, and the tofu was fantastic!  Plus I was stuffed and I still had enough for another full meal.  I will be going back as soon as I can.. Note:  I'm a bit anal about a valet driving my car, but I told the guy I was just running in to pick up take-out and he let me park it myself.
