After viewing the website, I knew this was the place I wanted to go to for my birthday brunch. At first glance, I had high hopes for the food, but moreover, I was delighted by the atmosphere! It's a beautiful house made over into a quaint restaurant. Ordering from the kitchen is the best part. However, seating is inconsistent (better to sit out front) and cramped, especially on the patio. Waited for over 20 minutes for our food and was very disappointed by the Brioche French Toast. The orange juice-rum-banana concoction served as a dipping sauce was awfully bitter. The best french toast I've ever had is at Anastasia in Laguna Beach. Perhaps I set my expectations too high. . . I've heard other reviewers recommend the Shrimp and Lobster Omelette and the Crab Cake Benedict, and I have to disagree for the most part. Even if the omelette is thoroughly cooked and well portioned, the potatoes are overdone, and the crab cakes are drenched with hollandaise sauce and soggy spinach. Overall, I expected more from the food, especially since the setting is so charming, warm and inviting.. . And I couldn't leave without a slice of Red Velvet Cake! Brought it home, and it was good but not great. I'd suggest the cupcake version to avoid the dry effect an exposed cake that's been sitting out in the refrigerator case has on baked goods.
