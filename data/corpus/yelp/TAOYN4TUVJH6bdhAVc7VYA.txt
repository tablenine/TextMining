5 words-fried green tomato eggs benedict. Heaven.. . This place is...interesting. The service is hit-or-miss, it's kindof in a weird part of the neighborhood, but I love it nonetheless. . . It's more or less self-service (unless there is some kind of schedule of which I'm not aware) and cash only, by the way.
