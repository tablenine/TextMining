Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Bring a good amount of pepto bismo for the heartburn and warn your arteries about the incoming amount of grease. Pink's has been a staple in Hollywood for years and the hotdogs are pretty amazing. I grew up eating Topdog, where it was the quality and flavor of the sausages that impressed its legion of followers. Pink's does a new twist. Instead of coming up with innovative flavors, it comes out with innovative toppings. Lettuce? Guacamole? you name it. I prefer mine with a topping of pastrami and saurkraet, kinda like a pastrami reuben, but on a hot dog. . . For those who are daring, try the double poli bacon chili cheeseburger... Â Chili cheese fries are pretty good and they have these vintage-ish glass soda bottles to wash everything down in. I haven't quite figured out a time to go where the line isn't horrendous. We dropped in on a Tuesday around 3pm and the wait was still at least half an hour - its worse around midnight!
