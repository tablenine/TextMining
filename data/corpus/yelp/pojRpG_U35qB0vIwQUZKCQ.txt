Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
One of the best steakhouses in town. Up there with Ruth's Chris and Morton's although this one seems to be trendier and dripping with celebrities. There's live music in the second floor that compliments the dark ambiance in the room (although I could use more light, I at least like to see who I'm talking to). Only negative for me is the tables are very close together for my liking. As expected, in one of our visits - there's an old geezer with a young woman with huge fake boobs seated next to us - so Beverly Hills [in a bad way].. . Now on to the food! The steaks here are great, as can be expected. I can't decide which steak I like better - Ruth's Chris or here. The servings are huge (well, I guess it depends on what you're ordering but generally they are); we always opt for them to bring the second half of our steaks after we're done with the first half (so it' always hot and fresh). The seafood tower is artfully prepared and the seafood themselves are really fresh. They have this lobster mashed potato that's not on the menu but they will prepare for you upon request - you gotta try that instead of the mashed potato on menu. The gorgonzola mashed mac and cheese is to die for. The creme brulee that I always have is really good but not unusually so.. . The service is impeccable.
