My review is based solely on their sandwiches - one of my clients frequently has it brought in for lunch. I've had their Italian sausage, prosciutto and mozzarella, smoked turkey, corned beef, and roast beef sandwiches, and all are decent. . . I'm beginning to get a little tired of their bread, which is an Italian loaf, and while I'm a fan of good crusty bread, this is both crusty and chewy, and my teeth hate me after a little bit. My other (admittedly nit picky) complaint is that condiment distribution is not very even. I love mustard as much as the next guy, but when there's a big stripe of it running down the middle of the sandwich, and none elsewhere, you get alternating bites of no mustard, and more mustard than you really wanted at any one time.. . I can't take price away from them. Maybe it's just the way the client handles orders, but I'm paying $6 for a huge 12" sandwich, which strikes me as a pretty good deal.. . A lot of these reviews seem to be incredibly complimentary of the grocery store aspect, which I should check out. I also see reviews of food items that are not available to me on my client's order form. So take my review for what it's worth.
