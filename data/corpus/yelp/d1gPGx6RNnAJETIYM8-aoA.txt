Well, went here for the first time last night with an old friend. Very hip, pretty swanky, and a little on the romantic side.. . So we had the Salmon Chips as an appetizer. The salmon, capers red onions and cream cheese were REALLY good.... not exactly to die for, but I might have gone comatose a lil bit lol. Not that I knew what to expect of a Salmon Chip, but the chip part actually tasted a lot like a Pringle (hmmm....). . Our meals were great, well cooked and attractively plated. The drinks were strong though. My friend tried to tease me because I'm a "lightweight". Then he had his drink.... his face puckered a little bit. At least we got our money's worth, I suppose. I'd definitely go back!
