Have I died and gone to onion heaven?  WHAT!!. This place has the most amazing french onion soup.  On a cold and rainy afternoon I introduced my friend to this soup.  Wait, that's not rain.  It's her tears of happiness and gratitude. . It takes a while to come out of that little oven of soup love, but it's worth it. . . I usually follow it up with a glass of wine and the Banana Sara crepe.  I am not ashamed- I like the good things in life!. . If the patio is open you must check it out!  I know patios are meant for summer weather, but this one has a special summer feel.  . Dining inside is nice too- very cozy!. . je t'aime la creperie!
