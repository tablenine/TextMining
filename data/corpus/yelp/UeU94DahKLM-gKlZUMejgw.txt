Use to love it here but.......... last time I had the "manny burrito" here the meat had a re-heated taste to it as if it wasn't just cooked. At first I thought maybe it was just that piece but all the meat in the burrito was hard and stale. The service of course was good. . . Dissapointed because I would always speak of the glory of these burritos.
