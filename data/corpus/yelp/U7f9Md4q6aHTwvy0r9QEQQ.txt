Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Some of these reviews are hilarious. I've heard some say that this isn't real Korean BBQ. Lemme tell ya: I lived in Korea and this is very real. As far as the wait staff, I shrugged it off cuz I just considered them Americanized. They know they don't have to run and bow for your every whim. I just orderd all we needed for the night once I saw the service go south and I can tell my waitress and I had a mutual respect because of it. lol Words of wisdom: Go during an off night like a Wednesday at 6. Ample street parking and the place will be pretty empty. The only thing that's 1 star about this place is the drive on the 10 from the westside to get there.
