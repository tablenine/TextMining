Restaurant: Pricci
Category: Italian
To me Pricci is an upscale restaurant that doesn't feel upscale.  While the waiters don white jackets, they are super-attentive and very friendly in my experience.  The over all atmosphere also makes you feel comfortable and not like you are in some fancy-schmancy restaurant.  . . The food is amazing, and worth the price, but if you aren't looking to spend a fortune, the pizza is very reasonably priced, and the dipping sauce they serve with the bread, literally melts in your mouth! . . I highly recommend Pricci for a special occasion, but without all the fuss of going to a super-fancy restaurant, and they are very accommodating for big groups as well.
