The wait is well worth it.. . That day, my first time here, I help my sister and her husband move, and I accepted payment for the favor in the form of dumplings, and it was tastey!!!!. . OMG, I probably devoured like 40 dumplings. Â They were juicy, the skin was perfect, and the mean filling was tender.. . Highly recommend getting there early so you can actually get a seat.
