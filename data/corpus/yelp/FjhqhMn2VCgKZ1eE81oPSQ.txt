Alright place to get some tapas with some friends and not too pricey. Fun environment. All I remember about the food was that it all kind of tasted the same. They don't serve any alcohol too so be prepared to bring your own if you want to drink.. . The only reason why I'm writing a review is because of what I saw. So two tables next to us there was a couple on a date. The chick was wasted...like roofies wasted. But seemed like the chick roofied herself because the guy was not feeling the situation. The guy excuses himself to the bathroom, the girl passes out, and the guy never comes back. Pretty sad but awesome at the same time.
