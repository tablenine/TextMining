It had been decied..the Kogi chicken tacos are my favorite tacos. Period. with that being said, I must almost suggest you try to the sliders and kimchi quesadilla.. . Yup, the Kogi Truck does have a line but its a part of the experience. you meet other and discuss your fondness of  food, etc.  If you want something fast  and subpar go to tacobell. If you want something tasty and a bit adventurous..add this on your weekly to-do list. . . Cheers!
