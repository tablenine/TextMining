Favorite bubble tea in town!  I seriously crave this stuff all the time (Unfortunately, I am not too close to Chinatown).  I've always thought that the food is good, but not great.  The service isn't that great either.  The bubble tea, however, is incredibly good!  They have a take-out window for drinks, so if you just want to stop by for that you can.
