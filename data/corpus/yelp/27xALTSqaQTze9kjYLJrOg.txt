Restaurant: Baoguette
Category: Vietnamese
I guess I'm super spoiled by living in San Jose where banh mis are $3, but for NYC - where Vietnamese food in general is hard to come by - Baoguette is a great option. Within walking distance from the Yelp office, my coworkers and I headed over to this tiny shop for lunch. . . I ordered a $5 regular baoguette (pork, pate, julienned carrots and cucumber, cilantro) and got it spicy (with jalapenos and sriracha sauce). The spicy was no joke! The bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and about a foot long. I wished I could have taken the leftovers with me, because it would've made a tasty snack at the airport. While not the best banh mi I've ever had, it still hit the spot.. . There are seats for about 10 people, so it's more of a take out joint, but we were able to grub inside as it wasn't that busy while we were there at around 1pm.
