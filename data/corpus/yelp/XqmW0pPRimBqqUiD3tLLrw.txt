Restaurant: The Earl
Category: Dive Bars
The EARL does most everything really well.  It's a terrific bar with a decent beer selection and colorful, amiable crowd.  The food is really, really good.  I assume.  Okay, I've only ever had the veggie tofu pita.  There are so many other things on the menu that sound so, so tasty...but I can't ever bring myself to bypass an opportunity to eat that delicious tofu pita.  It's just that it's so, so amazing.. . There are a bunch of other veggie options, though.  And they make it really clear on the menu what has meat in it and what doesn't (the rice and beans, for example, do).  That's always appreciated, even if I'm never going to order anything but that pita anyway.  Which I'm not. . . The service can be kinda slow and kinda disinterested, but you'll survive, although the one time we stopped in for Dunch I wasn't sure I was going to (my first meal of the day really, really needs to be in front of me sooner than an hour and a half after I sit down).. . The EARL is, of course, also a great little music venue, probably my favorite in the city.  It can get smoky, yes, but that pretty much comes with the territory, and it's nowhere near the choking fog that fills Lenny's.  All in all, I'm always happy to go to the EARL (and it's a good thing, too, since I'm there at least twice a month).
