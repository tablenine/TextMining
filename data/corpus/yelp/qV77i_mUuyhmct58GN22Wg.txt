I LOVE Sola and highly recommend it.  I know that the menu is seasonal but here are some of my favs: short rib benedict or steak and eggs for brunch; the tuna poke appetizer and the hoisin-mustard-panko crusted tuna for dinner; the pineapple with coconut sorbet and macadamia nut shortbread cookies. Yummy!!!. . Also, my husband threw me a small 30th birthday brunch here.  They were very accommodating in working with him on a set menu.  Everyone enjoyed the food!
