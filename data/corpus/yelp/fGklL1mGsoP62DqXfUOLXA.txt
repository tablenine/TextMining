Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Holy cow, amazing! My roommate took us here because she found out about it on Yelp, and we could not have asked for a better experience!. . Because the atmosphere is so cozy and the sushi is so delicious, there is often a wait, but they let you give your phone number, so you can go to a local bar and grab drinks while you wait and they'll call you when a table is ready. Once we got in, we got to sit at the bar, which we quickly learned is the best place to sit. Mitch was so friendly, offering us suggestions for what to order and giving us a free sample of the super-white tuna, which was INCREDIBLE. Everyone else sitting at the bar had been there before and was so friendly, telling us where the local liquor store was (as Toro is BYOB and we didn't come prepared) as well as what were the best rolls to order.. . There are so many delicious options to choose from, and everything's decently priced. Definitely a favorite place to go.
