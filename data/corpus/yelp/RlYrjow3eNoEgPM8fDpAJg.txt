There's hype and then there's reality... Kogi is both.. . This taco truck is arguably hyped by foodie's who like novelty. But, hey, if you live in Los Angeles you probably had a korean bbq and if you don't know what a taco is then you're not on Yelp. So, yes, you're going to like it. Try it... it's good!. . With so much demand (hype) your taste buds may get tarnished by having to wait in line for a couple of $4 tacos. But, it's worth having and I actually signed up a twitter account (geek) to find out where they'll be so I can see if it coincides w/ my day/night.. . The other night it came together... two friends and I went to the Brig and we were surprised to see TWO TRUCKS and no lines (we were early and so was the truck)! We ordered something like 12 tacos and a kimchi quesadilla... excellent!!
