Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
Nacional 27 is a perfect celebration spot. The food is excellent - ahi tuna &amp; watermelon ceviche, pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, and boniato and plantain croquetas are great choices for appetizers (can you tell I love croquetas??).  For an entree, my fiance always orders the chimichurri crusted sirloin - which is a little too spicy for my tastes, but perfect for him!  I've had the grilled marinated skirt steak and the beef tenderloin medallions  and both are delicious.  Drinks (caipirinhas and mojitos) are very tasty, service is excellent and the decor has a breezy South Beach feel to it - very nice :)
