Went for lunch and enjoyed it.   Went for dinner and got shafted!. . Our server didn't acknowledge us for some time after we found a seat.   The only one who paid any attention to us was the nice guy filling our water glasses.. . I had to ask for a menu "Wow!  Sorry!  Didn't even see you three sitting there!"  ask to place our order "You again!  Hi!  It's a busy night!"  (it was a Tuesday) ask for our food, for our drinks, for our check.   . . I had to ask for so many things I sounded like a needy date.. . Our drink order didn't arrive until after we had finished our salads.  "Sorry, guys!". .  I live down the street from the place and I got attitude from the typical Wicker Park chad waiter his first week on the job.. . If I try it again, it'll have to be takeout.
