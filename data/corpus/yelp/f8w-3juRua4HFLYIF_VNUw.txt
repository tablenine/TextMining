Great Salsa!! . The Pico here is really good. I know what you're thinking, really? The Pico? Anyone can make good Pico.. it's true.. good Pico is not difficult, but REALLY GOOD PICO? Now that's something.. . In addition to having really good salsa, they have good Mojitos and a good fried pork taco plate. The fish tacos are good too. It's not fried fish, it's baked, which is unusual, but better.. . They also have outdoor seating, but it's across from the bus station.. sooo.... it's loud, but you get to see bus people.. and depending on how many of the mojitos you have had, that could be fun.
