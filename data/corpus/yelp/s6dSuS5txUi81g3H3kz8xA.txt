My bf and I went to the craftbar on a Saturday night.  We were worried that we wouldn't be able to get a seat at the bar.  But at 8pm, it wasn't that crowded.  We waited about two minutes, someone got up and we sat down.  Apparently, they get very busy on the weeknights, but are a lot slower on Saturday, so I recommend going then.  Also, they have a large outdoor area that is part of the bar.  It was a little too cold for us, but it looked pretty cool. . . Like someone else said, the prices are all under $9 and each item is 2-4 bites.  BUT, everything was spectacular!  Great flavor combinations.. Ben's favorite was the fennel sausage ravioli.  Mine was the braised beef ravioli, but an honorable mention goes to the lamb sliders.  Those had intense flavor and were delicious.  . I also got one of their speciality drinks - the ginger mai tai.  It was great.  I got two of 'em.. . We weren't out to spend a lot of money, we just wanted to try Craft out.  So we left when the bill hit $60 and drove to the nearest pizza place to satisfy our hunger.. We decided to go to the actual restaurant next weekend to celebrate our engagement!. I'm docking one star because of the prices.  No complaints on service or food!
