Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
By far the best Southern cooking I've had. I went with the special of the day - chicken wings with an apple cinnamon waffle. The corn bread was among the best I've ever had (though the peach cobbler was merely ok), the service was fast once we were finally seated (huge line out the door), and the sketchy exterior belied the clean and well maintained interior. Well worth it.
