mmmmm, chiiiiiicken.  Seriously, they must be putting something in that syrup, I feel it in my veins. . .I want that syrup.  You must order smothered chicken, and waffles and put the chicken, gravy, syrup and waffle all together in a scrudidilyumtious bite.  . . Waits are long, service aint great, but there is a reason people keep coming back, its crack good people!
