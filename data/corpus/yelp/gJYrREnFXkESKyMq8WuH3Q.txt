Mostly it's all been said, but I'm not letting that stop me.  Doughboys has good food.  Don't go between 11:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on weekends, but any other time, go for some tasty, carbo-riffic grub at reasonable prices.  Unlike others, I've not had particular problems with service here, except for one time when we sat at the bar and the bar staff oscillated between ignoring us and being slammed.. . My faves:  antipasto salad (I get it without meat); afterschool special (tomato soup and grilled cheese); cornmeal pancakes; oatmeal; the (reasonably) new potato dishes with melted cheese, onions, chili, etc.. . Boyfriend swears by the vegetarian chili.  Added bonus - the soups come in a bowl larger than your head.  You can have soup for several meals at home after you leave this place!
