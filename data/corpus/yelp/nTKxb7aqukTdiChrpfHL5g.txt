I usually only write when I don't like a place.  GEISHA HOUSE is one of those that I did not like.  WHY?  Sundays are supposed to be half off.  Yes, Sunday is half off but the prices are so inflated to pay for the: "hey look I'm so cool, trendy and hot" annoying atmosphere it sure didn't feel like half off.. . And what really ticked me off is that Geisha house FORCEs you to pay a 18% Gratuity based on FULL FARE prices.  GO to Rue SANs way better, even on half priced night.
