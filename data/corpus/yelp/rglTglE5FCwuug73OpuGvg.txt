My boyfriend and I go to Sinbala when we're really hungry and poor.  OR when it's hot.. not really.. just when we're in the mood for rice balls.. . I love the shaved ice.  My boyfriend and I fight for the rice balls.  I end up winning.. . Anywho, I like the oyster omelette, the Taiwanese sausages and popcorn chicken the most.
