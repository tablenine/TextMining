Believe the hype- the food, ambience and service are still top-notch and Lee Hefter's cooking (WP does not usually cook in the kitchen) is amazing. Do note that most nights only VIP's and celebrities will be seated in the garden area and that those of us who are not weekly regulars or have a marquee name will not be sitting with the likes of Sidney Poitier or Tom Cruise.
