Restaurant: Ri Ra Irish Pub
Category: Irish
Had drinks here with friends yesterday. To begin we walked from the Dogwood Festival, so I'll say that parking was a breeze. Otherwise had we driven we'd be screwed because I didn't see any public parking anywhere on the block or surrounding blocks. Street parking is there but limited, and I hate that option since you never know who will sideswipe your car.. We only had beers and the selection seemed good, but they were out of several choices and admitted the menu was outdated. Well, update it maybe? The beers they did have were all a mix bag, some an Irish pub would have, others that were like "huh?", but still good choices. Prices were average but we're in Midtown, so expect to pay $1 more for most anything, liquor prices weren't even posted and their selection here was a bit weak. One couple ordered the garlic fries and they weren't bad, but nothing to write home about. . I'd like to say I'd give it another try but I rarely am in Midtown and can find a lot of other places I'd enjoy just a short drive away if I did end up there.
