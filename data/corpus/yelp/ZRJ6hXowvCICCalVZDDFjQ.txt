Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Well we went here on a recommendation from a buddy from work and man was this place good. We were visiting from NorCal and as we walked down Melrose looking for a spot to eat we remembered the recommendation and stopped in. The place wasn't to packed and we got seated in the patio right away. Since it was an Argentinian grill I had to get a beef dish so I ordered the Bife Encebollado a skirt steak topped w/ grilled onions, garlic and parsley. She got the Entra√±a al Ajo which is the same as mine just no onions. Both dishes were awesome. Tender and juicy with a ton of flavor. We sat on the railing so the people watching was pretty fun too. Cool place to eat and great tasting food.
