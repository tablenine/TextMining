I went here last week and am going again tonight because I loved it so much!  The tomato sauce is so fresh.  The pizza is nice and light -- I didn't feel like I was 10 lbs heavier by eating here.  I had the eggplant appetizer and loved it.  All and all, a great place -- and worth the wait!  I can't wait to go back.
