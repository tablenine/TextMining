Restaurant: Strip House Steak House
Category: Steakhouses
It's your standard high end steakhouse.  Food is extremely good and well prepared, ambiance is dark, waitstaff is attentive.  Nothing extremely memorable about it, but a good solid steakhouse.  . . My only gripe is the starters.  I was so in the mood for an iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon, but they didn't have it.  . . For the main course, we ordered the porterhouse for 2 medium rare.  It arrived perfectly cooked, being just warm enough in the center.  The truffled creamed spinach, fried onions, and herbed fries were all amazing and the perfect complement to the meal.  Even if we got smashed and ended up with more fried onions on the table than in our bellies.  It looked like we had a fried onion fight... yet the bus boy cleaned it up with barely a smirk on his face.
