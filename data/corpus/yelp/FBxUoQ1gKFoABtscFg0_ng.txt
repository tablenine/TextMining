Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
The title "Diner" is underrated. I walked in wearing my sweats, thinking this was a Denny's-type place. NOT!  Everyone was dressed up, so I walked right back out.  I went back for lunch a week a later.   When there are linen napkins and a guy comes and combs your crumbs off the table cloth, it's definitely not a diner!  But the food was good, nonetheless. It's a good place when you have guests that like American food, and are a little snobish.  I'm not so sure about the prices, though. Expect to pay about ten bucks for a sandwich.   I didn't even want to look at the prices for dinner.  Expect to drive around the tiny lot for a while to find a parking space.
