My boyfriend's family is a pack of foodie Jews.  They know good eatin'.. Sadly, my palette isn't as sophisticated as theirs.   So when we go out to dinner, I am always used to pretending everything sounds great while covertly trying to flip the pages looking for the kids' menu.  Last summer it was a different story at Sola.  . We showed up there pretty late in the evening because we just wanted dessert (our dinner at Think left us looking elsewhere for sweet treats).  Dad, Mom, sis, and lovey-boy all ordered fancier items and I went for THE COOKIES, ha-ha.  In minutes our desserts arrived, and even though everyone's selections were great tasting, my cookies were the hit.  Everything was fantastic, and I'm not even a sweets fan- I have more of a "salt tooth.". The place was dim, clean, and lovely.  And making it even more lovely was Dale from Top Chef passing us every few minutes while he was waiting tables there.  Star-struck nerd girl in full-effect!  . I can't say I know about the rest of the menu, but you can read the other reviews for that.  I hope you learned from this story to Never. Underestimate. Cookies.
