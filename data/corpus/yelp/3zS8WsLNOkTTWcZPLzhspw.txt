I love this restaurant.  I have been here a number of times, and the service has always been excellent--the manager stopped by each time to check how our meal was, one time we didn't like our table and asked to move, and they were very accommodating.  . . The food is also delicious.  I've had the Kobe beef cheeks, which truly melt in your mouth (so tender you can cut them with your fork!) The lamb was also amazing--tender and flavorful, the couscous was great, as was the flat bread.  . . This is a wonderful place to come on a quiet date night, with your mom or your man.  I highly recommend it!
