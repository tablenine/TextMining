I am at TDS at least once a week, sometimes two or three. It was voted runner-up for "best taco" in America by Food Network and Bon Appetit! magazine. This is the best location to go too also-the lines might be long at times, but go early for lunch and get a drink at night. They actually get people in and out a lot faster than the other two locations. The staff here is also wonderful-especially Robert! He remembers the regulars, and is just a nice guy. Â Try the taco specials, shrimp corn chowder on cold days and the cheese dip/guacamole!
