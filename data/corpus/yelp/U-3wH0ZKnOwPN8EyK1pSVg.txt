Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Really, you're paying for the experience, not the dog. The hot dog was alright, nothing I had to call my mom about. Heck, you put that much condiments on anything, it'll taste alright. The lines can get long. Damn tourists! Wait, I'm one! Heh. Anyway, I like really quirky stuff and this place is definitely that. Giant hot dog stand shaped like a hot dog, what's not to like?
