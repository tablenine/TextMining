Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This place was a bit of a conundrum for me going in. I didn't grow up eating red meat. When I did, it was :gasp: well done. So the idea of going to a place that serves pretty much only pink and fatty prime rib was not exactly appealing. Walking in and passing many tiny shorts wearing gals was also not comforting-this is not a club but supposedly a fine dining establishment, right? But a few things here wooed me enough that I enjoyed myself.. . The food was actually quite good in the end. I wish they offered a few sides that were not full of starch and butter, but my sauteed mushrooms were delicious and covered in fresh herbs that complimented the fungi wonderfully. I had the California cut, their smallest one, and it was tasty, though fatty enough that I left half of it on my plate in favor of the buttery little shrooms. . . I split creme brulee with the birthday boy even though we were both full enough to pop a button or two and while we each only managed a couple bites it was worth it for the delightfully satisfying crack of sugar. It was not the best I've had but was still good. Ultimately I could never come here for anything other than a special occasion, the food is too heavy, but I would enjoy a return visit nonetheless.. . The decor was thankfully a good mix of traditional and contemporary. Stodgy places do not impress me and I appreciated the large open space, the high-backed chairs and light fixtures that made me forgive the old fashioned style and horrible shade of the waitress outfits. . . As for our waitress Heidi, she managed to be both charming and the business. She had the other servers sing 'Happy Birthday Mr. Jameson' to my boyfriend because he'd ordered a few tumblers of the stuff, was similarly cute throughout the night and poured wine and the spinning salad dressing with enough flare to win me over.
