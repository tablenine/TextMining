Three stars but only b/c the incredibly talented and extremely handsome Rouzbeh (aka HOT, FINE, YOWZA!) was playing flamenco music the night I went.  Good googly moogly....the things this guy can do with his fingers.... . Otherwise Eclipse Di Luna SUCKED.  The food was horrible and it's very loud in there--nearly impossible to carry on a conversation with anyone.
