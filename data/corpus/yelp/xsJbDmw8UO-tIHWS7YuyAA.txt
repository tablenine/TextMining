2pm, Monday afternoon, PACKED. that tells you something--- either this place is completely over rated or really good.. . My friend and I decided to give this place a shot- thinking that almost over 6 months later, the hype would die down, but clearly it's still quite popular!. . We were seated at the bar within 20 minutes with no hassle. The hostess was extremely friendly and smiley. Points for that.. . We started with the Mozza Caprese salad. Presentation was 5 stars. Off the vine tomatoes sitting on a pillow of burratta mozzarella cheese. It was seriously heavenly.  I have had quite a bit of Caprese salads, but this one takes the cake. The basil infused olive oil was perfect for the salad, and every bite was seriously decadent.. . Next we tried the Ricotta Stuffed Squash Blossoms. Deep fried, which doesn't really appeal to me, but I thought I would give it a shot.  It lacked flavor, and it wasn't anything spectacular. reminded me of an updated version of Jalapeno Poppers.. . Finally we had the Goat Cheese Leek Green Onion Bacon pizza topped with whole roasted garlic.  Delicious! A bit hard to eat because of all the toppings being so stringy, but it was an olive oil based pizza and the crust was so delicious. Light, flaky, and not heavy or dense like most places.. . In and out within 45 minutes! This place truly lives up to the hype.. . Valet is $7.50 but go around the block for street parking. Definitely some of the best gourmet pizza i have ever had!
