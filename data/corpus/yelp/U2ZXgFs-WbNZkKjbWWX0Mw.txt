Restaurant: Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
The Vortex is best known for burgers, and rightly so; however this place also is good for huge salads, tater tots (with or without chilli and cheese) and daytime drinking - since it's always dark in there I never feel guilty. Clientele are a mixed bag but I love the bar staff.
