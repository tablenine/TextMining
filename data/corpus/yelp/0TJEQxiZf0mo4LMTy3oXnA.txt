I know that is this place is very famous in LA, but I went to college in Montreal, Canada and this cannot even compare. The meat was a little dry although the bread was ok. Adding mustard to increase the flavor of the sandwich was a mistake. That mustard will knock your socks off! The side dishes (coleslaw, flan, etc.) were also decent, but could be better. They just lacked flavor and the right texture. The atmosphere complemented the casual feeling of the food well.
