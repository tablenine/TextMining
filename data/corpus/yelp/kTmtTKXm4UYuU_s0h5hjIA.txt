Come for the Mac n Cheese pizza...stay for a slice of S'mores.... . We popped in here for a late dinner, and it was everything that I thought a Mac n Cheese pizza would be! All the deliciousness of mac and cheese, sitting on top of a slightly thicker than thin slice of pizza dough. I also got to try portions of the Spinach Feta Pesto pizza and the Philly Cheese Steak pizza. Each flavor combination had the right amount of flavor without overpowering your taste buds.. . Many different ways to get here both private and public transportation-wise (Clark/Addison buses, Red Line). Use your best judgment when the Cubs are in town though.
