blow your head off good.. I wasn't expecting the two bits of toffee hard pig skin that almost broke my teeth, but once I got a corner on it, and chewed that up, I was happy.. My dentist, however, won't be.. great tender pork, no more fillings.. . oh, and fucking Ed Koch came in while we waited. Â . Awesome.
