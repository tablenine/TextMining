Obviously this place has been reviewed a whole bunch but it just bears repeating... This place is great!  The fresh made food in the cold case is great for picnics or a quick gourmet dinner when you're too tired to cook.  I also highly recommending picking up a few desserts or cheese to bring for any dinner party you're going to... the guests will like what you bring more than what the host made!  The only thing I would note is it can get a bit pricey, but you pay for what you get.
