Deeeeeeee-licious!! We have been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing it was on D, D &amp; D's and also I read about it in Travel and Leisure magazine, and of course my husband hears burrito and is pulling out of the driveway. . . The owner could not have been cuter, he was so excited to greet us and introduce the menu. Everyone was so friendly, the service was excellent and the food was just yummy and very fresh. . . We ordered the carne asada cemita and chicken burrito and split it. Both were great. The baby had some avocado and rice and some of ours and loved it all. Two thumbs up!
