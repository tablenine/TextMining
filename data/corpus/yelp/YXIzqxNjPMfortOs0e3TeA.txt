Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
Ok, I am not really a burger girl.  I grew up on those lil McDonald's cheeseburgers and I will grab one of these on the go if I am really hungry or just for that taste of ketchup mixed with onions that takes me back to my childhood.  But honestly I might eat less than 10 burgers per year.  I went down to the Grindhouse because my boyfriend has been talking about this place for weeks.  He has been here with co-workers on several occasions and Loves these burgers and so do they.  So he arranged a "family field trip" down to the Grindhouse this past Saturday.  . So we arrive 9 deep (a multicultural group ages 1 to 65) to sample these much talked about burgers.  . The Verdict-Delicious!!  I had the single traditional burger, though they all sounded delicious.  It was nestled on a soft potato roll, it was moist juicy and the perfect size.  I hate having to fight to get a bite of a burger or have all the contents fall out all over the place.  This was a good burger plain and simple.  I enjoyed every bite.  I had the seasoned fries also, they are salted with seasoning salt but not too much.  I love some Lawry's baby so...nice touch.  The finale, soft serve ice cream on a cone.  Tasted just like homemade.  The service was slow (take a peek around at some of the produce in the curb market while you wait. Or sit and watch the movie projected on the wall a la Elvira narrating horror flicks..nice:) but the product is worth the wait.  The waitstaff was friendly and thanked us for stopping by, always nice.  Grindhouse...go check it out.
