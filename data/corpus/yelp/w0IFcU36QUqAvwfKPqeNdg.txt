Great little place to meet for munchies and drinks.  The wings were really good, although a bit small.  The agedashi tofu was yum.  The deep fried halibut was good.  The enoki mushrooms in butter were muy delicioso.  The grilled rice balls were interesting.  I heard a lot about the hampen cheese so I was excited to check them out.  Pretty dam good eats.  The chicken karaage was a liiiiiittle dry but tasty.
