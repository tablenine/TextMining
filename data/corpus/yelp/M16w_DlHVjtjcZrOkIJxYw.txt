I always leave this place speechless.  Bill Kim has an amazing knack of figuring out creative mixes of ingredients that work great with each other, but that you've never had together before.  Tonight I had (among other things) the watermelon salad, which had watermelon, arugala, basil, vinegar, and radishes.  Who thinks of that?  It was phenomenal.  I've loved almost everything I've ever had here, which is almost everything on the menu (particularly recommend the meatball sandwich, the somen/shrimp salad, and all of the deserts).  Highly recommended for creative, delicious food in a casual byob environment.
