Hilarious...that people think this place serves good food. . . Ahhh you bridge and tunnel people kill me. Whats even  funnier is they overcharge for their  disgusting crap.. . The pros: A great hipster/tourist trap....for the owner that is. He's banking off these people.. . Most come here for the "ny experience"; The owner dragging his knuckles when he walks is kinda funny  . . Unfortunately, this isn't a NY attitude.  Its an attitude you get when life has bent you over and did you with no vaseline.  Witness the permanent grimace on the workers and owners faces.  You only get that one way...through deliverance.
