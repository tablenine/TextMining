I really love this place. As a vegetarian, I always get the rice, beans and plantains and it is always delicious. The rice is buttery, the beans garlicky and the plantains are soft and yummy. Â The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because sometimes it is a bit too greasy and the service could be more attentive.. . If Versailles would team up with Porto's and create a Cuban super store I would be in heaven.
