I don't get it - the chicken tasted fine, but didn't, by any stretch, blow my mind.  The mouth-watering accolades, I don't understand; the chicken was average, the beans were quite bland.  . It's just tastes like lemon - I don't see a reason to return for a chicken that's so underseasoned.   For a garlicky half chicken that knocks my socks off, I'll stick with my Zankou (and they use the same hot sauce)
