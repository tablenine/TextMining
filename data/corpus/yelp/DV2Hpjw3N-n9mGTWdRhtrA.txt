Gotta give the guys props for turning out a delicious, succulent little snack. The Chairman Bao was warm, meaty, just the right amount of fatty, encased in a pillowy soft puff of a bun... and also so tiny.. . For $4 each and a 15 minute wait, I'm not sure this is worth it. Chinatown and all its treasures are just a short walk away, after all.
