The secret?  It must the Brontisaurus-sized slabs of hand-cut USDA select beef sizzling on a hot plate of clarified butter at 400 degrees.  I'll take the bone-in rib eye, medium rare, please and pair it with a nice peppery Shiraz/Syrah blend.  . . Recommended sides: Gorgonzola Mac &amp; Cheese, Sauteed Spinach and Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  . . There are two levels, the first, which is where we were seated, is very gentlemen's club and very dimly lit.  Probably done on purpose, so you can't see how much each menu item costs.  The second floor is much more hip and uppety with a live band and bar.  I got the opportunity to see the second floor because I had to use the ladies room.. . This is a definite must-try-before-you-die type of place.  But start saving now because the bone-in rib eye alone will set you back around $50.
