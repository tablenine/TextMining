Yum, wow this place was definitely well worth the forty minute wait.  I went there with some other food lovers on Memorial Day and there was a looong wait even at 12pm.  I ordered the french toast which was absolutely fabulous and gigantic!  I will definitely go there many more times, but make sure you don't leave starving because there definitely is a wait, they say that 40 minutes isn't even a wait!!
