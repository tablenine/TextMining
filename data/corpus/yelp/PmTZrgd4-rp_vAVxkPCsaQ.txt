Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
We showed up on time for our 8pm reservation on a Friday night, and were slightly annoyed when we were told that our table was not ready. Our moods were instantly lifted by the live jazz and we headed over to the bar for some drinks.. . ....30 minutes later, we were still waiting for our table. Wtf?! . . When we were finally seated, we were presented with complimentary crab cakes as an apology. Alright, Hugo's, you redeemed yourself. The crab cakes were absolutely DELICIOUS! Huge chunks of fresh crab served with a great pink mayo sauce. We of course had to try the sauteed frog legs, which were also really fantastic. Tasted like really, really tender chicken and I'm sure the fact that it was all drenched in garlic butter didn't hurt. Also had some pan-roasted mussels, which were good but nothing to write home about. . . Both of us opted for steak when it came to our entrees, since they do share a kitchen with Gibsons. The Chicago Cut (which was a rib-eye) and the Porterhouse were both good. Not the best steak I've ever had but certainly up to par. Note: each entree comes with a soup or salad! The lobster bisque was just okay (the one at Shaw's is still my fave), and the clam chowder was not bad. Thought it was cool that their entrees weren't truly a la carte. We finished with the biggest slice of key lime pie I've ever seen (took about 80% of it home).. which I probably wouldn't order again since I found it to be more tart than my liking.. . Overall, a really great restaurant with excellent service and great food (definitely try the frog legs!)
