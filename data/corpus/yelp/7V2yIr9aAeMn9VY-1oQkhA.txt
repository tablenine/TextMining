My coworker And I are huge Man V Food fans as well as spice fanatics. After seeing this place on TV and finding out one of our clients was fairly close, we made the trip. He dove right into the special #2 the hottest noodle dish on the western hemisphere (according to MVF). I am not that adventurous and went with a number 2. Th flavor is outstanding and the serving is a little larger than normal (mostly Broth). The noodles are OK, the services was good. I would go back...if I do... I am gunning for the wall of fame!
