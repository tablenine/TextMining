Very good chicken and waffles.  Of course you have to get that combo if you come here.  This is one of the better chicken and waffles places I've been to, although it's not as good as Home of Chicken and Waffles in Oakland and doesn't even begin to hold a candle to Gladys Knight's Chicken and Waffles in Atlanta.. . The chicken is crispy and flavorful.  The waffle has a good flavor, but I wish it was a little more crisp.  The mac and cheese side dish is slightly above average.. . One of my favorite places to go when I'm in LA.  Recommended.
