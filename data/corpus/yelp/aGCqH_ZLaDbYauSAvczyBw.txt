Restaurant: The Old Oak Tap
Category: Bars
A solid 4-Star Brunch experience! . . My friend and I arrived a few minutes before Old Oak Tap opened for brunch service on Saturday, but the very friendly hostess told us to have a seat and a cup of coffee while we waited for the kitchen to open. No problem! Seating was actually my ideal brunch seating... A long bench booth along the wall with chairs on the opposite side of the table, a few high tops and some regular tables on the other side of the restaurant. I love a good booth, which allows me to cozy-in, sip my coffee and gossip and eat at my own pace. . . So down to business, now, eh? While the brunch menu is small, it is very, very mighty! I'm definitely not afraid to leave food on the table in favor of trying everything, so my friend and I each got eggs (omelet of the day with olives, tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese for me and chilaquiles for him) and split the brioche french toast. My omelet was good... not the best I ever had, but very stand-up. It's actually served more open-faced, and they didn't skimp on any of the toppings. The chilaquiles were spicy and yummy and the brioche french toast is an absolute work of art. It's huge, and topped with chocolate syrup, ice cream (yes, ICE CREAM) and candied nuts. So guilty... so delicious. . . Oh yes, they have very tasty coffee, served in ginormous mugs. I like that. . . We sat at OOT for quite some time, but the place never really filled up, so it's a good brunch option for those who don't want to wait in the mammoth lines you'll find at other places. So get over there and ch-check it out!
