I've seen the light. . . Finest Bloody Marys I've had in Chicago, even if they're usually out of the "Mondo Bloody Mary", which has shrimp and a bunch of other extras in it.  They make them thick and delicious with olives and lots of celery salt on the glass.  Seriously, these are tops.. . I usually go here for brunch, not dinner.  Somehow, slowly and unexpectedly, this place went from "that annoying yuppie place down the street" to one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  I usually dislike popular brunch places but this place is just exceptional.. . The last time I was there I had the breakfast burrito, which was huge and totally delicious.  I can't say enough about the food, it is just so flavorful.  Other times I've had other entrees, I've never been disappointed.  It's so goddamned good.  . . The service can be spotty, but I think all the waitresses are good-natured and (also good looking in that hot indie librarian way).  Plus, they have the Packers and the Bears on TV usually, so it's a win on all accounts.
