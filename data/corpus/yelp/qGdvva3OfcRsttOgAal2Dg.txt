god DAMN that's a lot of ceviche.  I mean, holy crap.  The three-tostada ceviche dinner is a freakin mound of chopped shrimp goodness that pretty much guarantees leftovers.  I actually got tired of eating shrimp.  That's never happened before.. . Tamarind margarita, yum.. . Queso fundido with chorizo... yum, but kinda gloopy/slablike.  Good taste, iffy texture.. . The food is seventeen different kinds of awesome, and I can stumble home from there if needed, and come summertime (did I mention margaritas are good?) I can foresee the need.  Mmmyep.
