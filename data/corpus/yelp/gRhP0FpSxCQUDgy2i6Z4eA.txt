This is one of my semi-regular brunch spots, and I've never had a bad dish.  I highly recommend the hash, chorizo or seitan; the specials are usually reliable as well.  The only dish I was kind of meh on was the bacon cornmeal pancakes (I know, they sound great in theory, but the bacon doth not stay crispy in them thar pancakes!). . I've only been once for dinner and I don't have a good reason why; I got the special which was a butternut squash risotto and it was delicious, and reasonably priced.. . The only low point?  The wait staff can sometimes be kind of dippy.  Not mean or snooty or anything, just kind of... space cadets.
