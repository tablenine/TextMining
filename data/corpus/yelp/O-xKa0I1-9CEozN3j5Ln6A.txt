Best. Food. Ever.. . Get the veggie plate.  Trust me.  Your 1st veggie will be (listen to me, now) BEEFY CHEESY POTATO CASSEROLE.  It's a layer of meat loaf and a mound of mashed potatoes topped with cheese...it's a veggie.  If Mrs. Carver didn't cook that, then she cooked some variation thereof.  Cheesy Ham potato casserole, etc.  . . I don't care what you get after that, it's all delicious.. . Mr. Carver is the nicest man ever and we spend a few minutes talking about their latest vacation getaway and how his knee is coming along now that he's had his surgery.  He and my grandmother had the same procedure.. . Best. Food. Ever.  If you didn't know this is the food they serve after church and in heaven.
