Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
Went last night (Sunday 1/6). I really wanted to like this place but, I just couldn't.. . The wine list is extensive but, the choices by the glass are limited (I was not really in the mood for beer but, others seemed to be enjoying them). Had the Endive salad - the Bleu on it was brilliant - the rest, meh.. Then some moules. The sauce was spicy. I may be a traditionalist but, damn man - the sauces ain't supposed to be spicy! It really took all the fun out of the best part of moules, the bread / sauce thing. Suck!. . The thing that really made me luke warm on this joint though was the fact that the chairs were so unconfortable. I mean, seriously folks, who thinks a mini-lab chair from a high school chem lab is a good idea for a resto? Heck no! My back hurt just looking at them. Sitting on them was worse.. . Its a loungey sort of place. How about some loungey sort of chairs, eh?
