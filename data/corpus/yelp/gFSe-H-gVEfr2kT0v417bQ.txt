The reviews here says it all. A cool place for happy hour with their extensive beer selection. The best happy hour deals would have to be the pizzas. The four stars are mainly for the atmosphere. Good for groups but expect a long wait. . . It's basically a place to hang out at the bar and check out the "scenery". Girls, you'll definitely be able to find a chump to buy you a drink here. I'm not one of them! . . Popular eats: Hawaiian Poke Stack, Onion Ring Tower, Happy hour pizza. The Pot Pie is huge and really good. The steaks are average so go with something else. You gotta get the Chocolate Souffle. Order it early cuz it takes them like 20minutes to make. . . Worst appetizer ever - Chinese Garlic Noodles. This has got to be the worst dish they have. Avoid at all cost.
