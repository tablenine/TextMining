Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Toro has quickly become a "once a month - minimum" sort of destination.  The best sushi of any place that I've yet been to.  The "Three Amigos" roll is the b-o-m-b; coaster-sized pieces containing, oh, about 30 ingredients (only slightly exaggerating) served with a trio of sauces including guacamole.. . Guacamole and sushi - who knew?  . . The baked mussels appetizer is equally delicious - four half shells broiled with a garlicky/spicy/buttery sauce.. . Some sushi restaurants will charge a hefty premium for such creativity...not so Toro.  Reasonable prices and BYOB can make for an economically friendly meal.  . . You just have to stop yourself from ordering EVERYTHING :-). . As some reviewers have mentioned - the only drawback is the minuscule size of the space.  I've seen bigger closets.  Get there early (especially on a weekend) if you don't want to have to endure waits of up to an hour.
