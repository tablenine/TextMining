This place makes me smile. --- :). . The tempura is ALWAYS perfectly battered, not too crispy and not too soft, and has a yummy variety. Each time I've gone, I've always gotten a different batch of veggies.. . The rolls are always pretty small, but enjoyable nonetheless. The lunch is pretty basic. Rice, choice of beef/chicken/salmon, salad, and tempura. The rice, as I always make a thing to point out, is of good quality and as sticky as ever.. . As a person who has grown accustomed to exclusively carry plastic, the cash only policy can be frustrating, there is, thankfully, an ATM inside next to the entrance.. . Being extremely cramped and not so generous in space, the wait can be a pain sometimes. I, personally, have only had to wait once, but if it's worth it then no wait is too long now is it?. . When it's busy, server quality dips a little and you will be left either having to wave one down when you need something or just getting up and walking to the counter. I was grown to get things myself rather than wait for things to come for me, so I have no problem exercising the latter.. . Of all the downsides I've referenced, the stars remain at a peak 5 for a reason. Maybe it's the social aspect, maybe it's the authenticity, or the silent connection spoken between the workers resonates with the customers, but I find my heart reserving a spot for this place.
