it seems as though i fall in with the majority of other recent reviews... i really wanted to give this place more stars, but just couldn't bring myself to it. . . if i was judging based solely on the guac, the enchiladas suizas and the atmosphere, easily 4 stars; but the rest of the experience left me feeling pretty 'meh.' i got the tilapia tacos which came recommended from other reviewers. they were alright, but nothin' to write home to mom about. the orchata was once again fine, but nothing special. the service was super duper friendly but slower than molasses; and no, it wasn't busy at the time. . . probably worth giving a second try, but as of now, not a standout.
