Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
My first impression was, "Shabu Shabu for the first time.". . Impressed.In the center of Little Tokyo, it's a must stop if you are visiting the area. For the price and the quality of the meat, plus all the amazing sides, it's amazing! It's a small little restaurant, but it seems to be packed every time I visit. The wait will take awhile if you go an a weekend night especially, but I say it's worth the wait. If you want to leave a lasting impression of Shabu Shabu on someone who's never tried it, this is the place to take them.. . I am a fan of this place because of the sauce. It just goes so well with the meat, veggies, rice, everything. I can eat it with anything. Everything about this place...I took my aunt from Japan to eat here and she said it was the closest thing to the Shabu Shabu back in Tokyo, Japan where she lives. That tells you a lot!". . The lasting impression? "The meat and sauce, perfect!"
