Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
We stopped by Heaven on Seven for lunch last week in hopes of getting comforting southern/creole food on a very chilly and windy day. . Well, the place is interesting... totally decorated in New Orleans Mardi Gras style, with hundreds of hot sauce bottles covering the walls. It's a very comfortable vibe though, so we were looking forward to the food. . . We ordered sweet tea and fried crawfish to start with. The little crawfish pieces, battered, fried, seasoned.. were quite delicious. A good start. They tasted like a mix between shrimp and calamari - an interesting texture, but very good. . Erwin P. got the shrimp po' boy and I got the bbq sampler as our lunch entrees. It came with a choice of gumbo, soup or salad. Erwin P. went with the gumbo (quite good), I got the soup of the day (cream of chicken - warm and decent). . The Po' boy was pretty much like the crawfish appetizer but on a huge roll. It was ok. My bbq platter was gigantic! The meats were very tender and sauce had a kick to it which was nice. It was very saucy though, and almost needed a piece of bread or something. I got the rice/beans, coleslaw and tater tots as sides. They were ok. . Needless to say, I had quite a bit leftover and took it home for dinner that night. That night and the following day, however, both Erwin P. and I (who both had of the bbq) had horrible stomachaches. Not fun! . I seriously regretted my order/visit. Maybe it was an off day? But I can't imagine what was wrong with the bbq that would make us feel so sick. Weird. . Anyhow, we won't be back. There are tons of other places to try, even though they may be more expensive than Heaven on Seven.
