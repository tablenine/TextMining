Giving Mirai 5 stars for one reason: . . One of the most amazing food items I have ever put into my mouth is Mirai's SPICY MONO. It's tangy, rich, savory, complicated, it's an absolute orgasm in the mouth. Sometimes I spend a whole entire day thinking about eating this roll, it's that good. My advice: If you don't feel like going out to eat or shelling out the bucks, but you'd like to try the spicy mono, call into the restaurant, place an order for the roll, and go pick it up. I do this a lot, but I live down the street, so it's a convenient thing to do... and so worth it.
