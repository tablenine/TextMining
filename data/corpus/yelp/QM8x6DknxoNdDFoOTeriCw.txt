Restaurant: Hub 51
Category: American (New)
HUB 51, you have proved my long-standing theory about restaurants who serve multiple cuisines wrong.  Tacos, sushi and burgers all on the same menu?  I USED to think that a restaurant needs to stick to just one cuisine because they'll never get it all right.  Well, I've enjoyed everything I've eaten at HUB51, which includes all of the above plus the carrot cake - heaven!  This is also a cool place to hit up for drinks &amp; appys.
