The food was good and fresh, however, not well seasoned for my taste.  . The worst part was that our bill came to 59.00 and our credit card was charged for 71.00.  Someone was dishonest and wrote themselves a 12.00 tip just because we forgot to put down the total amount on our bill.  This is called stealing in case you don't have any morals.
