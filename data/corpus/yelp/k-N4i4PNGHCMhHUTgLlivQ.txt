Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Stinking overrated. After such a long wait, I was expecting alot from this place. The food is average at best. The setting is unique and fun i guess. But def. not worth the wait and money. So many good restaurants in the area. Can't believe our group chose this place.
