My favorite place for comfort food: Chill-Lee burger, Bang Bang (flat noodles in lemongrass broth), pancakes, milkshakes, or red velvet cake...it's all good. (Especially surprising since they offer such a wide selection of menu items -- diner food, Asian-style dishes, brunch.). . The wait staff is always friendly and attentive, whether it's a crowded night or a slower Sunday morning.
