Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I took my ex bf there because I was such a great gf LOL. . The Prime Rib here is probably the best Prime Rib I have ever had in LA.  I had the Lawry's cut (medium rare of course) and it was just soooo perfectly juicy and tender and the horseradish went so well with it!  They have a great selection of wine!. . I did not know about the meatball and chips while waiting thing~  I should look out for that next time!
