Seriously... with almost 500 reviews, what else can I say? My brother has always been bringing me bake goods from Porto's. Then my friend suggested a really good bakery in Glendale... it's Porto's. Then, my friend's mom (different friend) gave me a cheese roll that her friend bought her... from Porto's!! So, today... I went to Porto's.. . The place was a cluster F*. Really long line. But then again, the line moves pretty fast. My husband was running around in the bakery looking at cakes and breads. He's the one with the sweet tooth. I just wanted to cheese rolls.... . We came out of the bakery scoring cheese rolls, some guava with cheese bread, fruit tarts, and potato balls. I think we did good for our first time there. We've had both the cheese bread and guava bread which were awesome. Will be back to report on the other stuff. I don't usually have sweet tooth, but fruit tarts is my sweet spot... =). . Edit to add: BEST FRUIT TART EVER....!!! Potato balls were yummy too... But the fruit tarts... Â ~~drool~~. . We're going back this weekend to get a cake for my mother in law's bday. I'm suggesting to get the biggest fruit tart they have... =D. Husband suggested to camp out for a couple of hours and try out all the cakes they have before deciding... I think he has ulterior motives!
