Wow this place has been around for a while now, but I guess nothing has changed.  Last time I came here, I made my reservation 3 weeks in advance...for a party of two.  I hate how crammed the seating is, and I also hate the expensive valet parking, but who can resist marrow with perfectly charred bread?  And of course, the pizza is quite unforgettable, all thanks to the wonderful crust.  I chew and chew, trying to get the most flavor out of one bite.  Also not to be missed is the budino.  Mario Batali seems to have  a thing for olive oil gelato, but it's really not my thing (although at Otto, they have an olive oil coppetta that is awesome!)   . . I would love to fly back to LA for another meal here, but unfortunately, that isn't happening anytime soon.  Budget allowing, I will try to explore all of the Batali restaurants in NY though!
