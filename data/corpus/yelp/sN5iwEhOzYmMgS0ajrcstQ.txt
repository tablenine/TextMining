Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
I tried to go to the "new" Pops.  I was very confused.  I mean, I know it moved and everything, but they wouldn't change the charm and beauty and everything special about the old location would they?  Apparently "they" would.  It makes me sick to my stomach.  Especially since I never made it one last time to the old locale.  . . I don't even know how they feel justified keeping the name.  It's like a big giant corporation bought this great local place for the name recognition alone and turned into what they thought it should have been in the first place.
