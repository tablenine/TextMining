BF and I ventured here late one night after a movie at The Grove.  I opted for coffee and the Blue Velvet, BF had the sundae with the cookies (can't remember what it's called).  . . While it was good, I wouldn't say it was great.  Just way too sweet.  I appreciate tastes and textures, but when excess sugar is used (and I find in most cases no one ever thinks sugar taste bad), it becomes more of a quantity over quality thing, and I always go for the quality.. . Like most others, I have a sweet tooth, but too much sugar and it shuts my system down.  Any of the stuff here would've been great shared between two people, and with a glass of milk.  Otherwise, all that sugar is just unnecessary.
