One of the best ever. I rate places not only on quality and taste of food but also on customer service. This truck has it all. I expected good food and poor customer service (as is the case with most places that I go) but the truck staff was friendly and quick! Yes, they were late but thats what happens when you travel southland freeways plus the time flies by when you are in line with 50 other people. I had a short rib taco and a torta, both were delicious and filling. I also had a tres leches desert and although I don't know how to describe it, it was one of the most delicious deserts i have ever had. Not only were there several different textures to this desert but the different spices were wonderful. I will be back.
