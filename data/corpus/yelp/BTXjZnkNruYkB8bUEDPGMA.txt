Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
#37. . I had never eaten at Philippe's before Saturday, despite spending the first 21.5 years of my life in LA. Only after I moved away from home did I finally visit the restaurant that allegedly invented the French Dip Sandwich. When you think about how long this place has been around, it's amazing. Imagine all the historical events that elapsed: World War I, the Depression, World War II, just to name a few. I wonder how many other restaurants can say they've been in operation for over 100 years.. . When we first walked in, I was overwhelmed by the number of people waiting in line to order. However, the line subsequently breaks up into several smaller lines that lead to individual cashiers. All things considered, the wait was not too long, but don't expect to walk in and go straight to the counter.. . I opted for the Beef Dip Sandwich ($5.55). I requested double-dip and Jack cheese ($0.40). Add on a lemonade for $0.75 and a slice of NY Style Cheesecake ($2.75) and we have ourselves a meal. I can honestly say that the sandwich was not the best I have had. However, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because the meat wasn't very warm when I started eating. Although I think they bring in their pies (cheesecake?) from a outside bakery, the cheesecake was excellent. I much prefer it to most plain cheesecake I have eaten elsewhere.. . I certainly think Philippe's is a great value and will definitely return. I hear the Lamb Dip Sandwich is a hit, so that will be on my list for next time.
