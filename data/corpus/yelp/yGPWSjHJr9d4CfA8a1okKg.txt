I'm not sure what I can add that the other 1300 reviewers haven't already covered. . . Acting like they're just a neighborhood bar where you can order food with your drinks and seat yourself is insane. Time to rethink. . They have Maredsous, which made me happy.. They have a kick ass burger, which made me full.. . I could use one of these in K-town, cool?
