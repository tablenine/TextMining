Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
Up until now, I have only been visiting A Taste of Heaven for their lemon bars.  Who knew that they have a good breakfast?. . I love a good breakfast burrito and I think I have found my favorite.  Most places the burritos are so huge that I can't finish it.  At A Taste of Heaven the breakfast burrito is perfect.  I added chicken sausage to mine which made it all the better.  Looks as though I have a new breakfast spot!
