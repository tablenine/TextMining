Great Food and Friendly Service.. . Though it has been awhile since I've been here, I used to go quite a bit (once month).  Without a reservation, I usually could get a seat at the small bar within 30 minutes.. . The pizza is thin-crusted, almost cracker like as it is cooked in a real wood-fire burning oven.  One of the better pizzas in L.A.  The pastas are fresh and the lasagna is a little different (not as traditional), but full of ricotta and done well.  . . The wine list is loaded with Italian wines from a variety of price ranges, but I often just go for a glass of Chianti.. . I definitely need to go back soon.
