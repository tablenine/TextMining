My sister suggested this place for breakfast/brunch while I was here. She also mentioned it as a place where "The HIlls" cast members have been spotted and where she has personally seen ____ from "America's Next Top Model." Now I'm a huge fan of brunch so it was a no-brainer. However, I am no fan of reality tv (you'd think in a town full of real actors, they'd try to make shows to employ more people like writers, but I guess the economy sucks) so that almost made me not want to eat here. . . It was just the 2 of us and everything sounded so good so we got an eggs dish (Gone Shrimpin') and a pancakes entree (Black Magic). Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. The pancakes are huge, about a foot in diameter and stacked 3 flapjacks high. We finished off the eggs with difficulty (scrambled eggs, shrimp, capers, tomatoes, and avocado), but had to pack up 2/3 of the pancakes (oreos in the batter with whipped cream and crushed oreos on top) and the garlic toast (not so great, and I love garlic anything.)  . . I would come back to try other stuff, my sis thinks the Golden Ticket is the best pancakes dish. Service was average. Loved all the condiments on the table (3 different hot sauces, green Tabasco, maple syrup, et al). Prices for the breakfast entrees around $10-13 each.
