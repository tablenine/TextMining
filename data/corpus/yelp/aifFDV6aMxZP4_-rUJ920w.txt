I went here for my birthday on the recommendation from a friend. It was soooo good. It's been a long time since I've been to a place that has a wonderful atmosphere, excellent food and super friendly waitstaff. . We had a table near the super-cozy fireplace and coffee bar. The coffee bar looks like the kind of place you would get coffee with someone on a first-date kind of experience. . . I had the "duck-duo." Absolutely delicious and plated in a really fun way. The friends I was with had the meatloaf (it's HUGE and possibly the best meatloaf I've ever tasted), red-pepper stuffed gnocchi (yummola), and the pumpkin ravioli-- which were divine. Literally everyone's meal looked wonderful and tasted even better. I can't wait to go back. It is a little pricey but totally worth it for special occasions. Our server, Brittney, was super friendly and put up with us calling her "Brit" and then "Christina" after we'd had a couple bottles of wine.
