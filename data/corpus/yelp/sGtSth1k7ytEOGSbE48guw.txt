This place receives only 3 stars because I live too far from here.  The food is good, not great, but good.  They have good pork chop rice, and excellent shaved ice, and when people say "how could you mess up shaved ice?", they should know that YOU can.  The chewy texture of the taro balls, the consistency is important.  Too much water, the balls chew like mush, not enough, and feels a little hard.  Perfect balance means a perfect chewy texture, and I LOVE it.  Plus the size of their shaved ice is larger than most places so it's enough for 2 people.. . All the other food is tasty, but not something I would crave for and drive 40 minutes from Torrance to eat.  Sinbala would probably get 4 stars if I lived closer.
