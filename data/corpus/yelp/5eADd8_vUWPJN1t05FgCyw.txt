I don't care if a thousand people already reviewed this place... I still have to give my piece on it only because like many, I enjoyed every bite that I had and I feel the need to share my experience.. . Everything we ordered was delicious!. . - Hainan Chicken - of course!  I can't imagine coming here and not having this dish.  It's this whole entire place's claim to fame.  Delicious with all the right dipping sauces.. . - Shrimp rolls - piping hot, crunchy, and flavorful. . - Baked Halibut - fresh and deliciously drenched in an alfredo-ish cheesy mushroom sauce.. . - Curry Beef Stew - really tender.  The curry was just right, not too overpowering like Indian curry.. . Why not a 5?  Because the place is too damn small!  You're almost rubbing elbows with the party at the next table.  They also didn't have a high chair or even a booster chair for our little one.  Oh and last, I read on some of the reviews that the Chrysanthemum Iced Tea had refills but when we asked, server said no refills.  Wack!  . . Aside from my minor complaints, I still think that our trip from Chino to Alhambra to try this place out was well worth the time, gas, and mileage.  This place makes it in my book and deserves more visits.
