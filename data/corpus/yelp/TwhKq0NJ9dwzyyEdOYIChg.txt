This place is a favorite for a casual date night for my husband and I.  He introduced me the wok tossed noodles with chicken and we've both ordered it every time we've been in.  I recently became a vegetarian (raw/organic/vegan?! in my near future I fear) so when we hit Gingergrass on Saturday for lunch I had to forgo the noodles with chicken (though I think it comes with tofu if you like)  and ordered the claypot curry vegetables with baked tofu.  I was afraid it wouldn't be enough food.  It was as big as my head, and so hot, and really delicious.  We'll be back!
