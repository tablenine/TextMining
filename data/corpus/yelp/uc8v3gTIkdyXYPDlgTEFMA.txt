Kamehachi has some good sushi, not the best in town but also not the worst. . . Some of my sushi rolls did fall apart as others mentioned and I had to clumsily piece them together but other than that I had a good experience. Â The Dragon Roll I had was pretty good and I wanted more after I finished.
