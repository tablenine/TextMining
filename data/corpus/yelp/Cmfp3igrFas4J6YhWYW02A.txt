We had a group of seven that came here for Allison L's birthday last weekend. Â Even though I've lived mere steps away from here for years I'd never been before. I don't know that I need to say anything more than, the service was excellent, the food was delicious, and that for a nice dinner (it is a tiny bit pricey) I would love to come back again.
