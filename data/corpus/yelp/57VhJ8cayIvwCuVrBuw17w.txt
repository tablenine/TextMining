Ladies and Gentlemen... We have a winner!. . Here's the scenario... our good friend was getting married saturday, so we traditionally get a group together the night before... it's kind of like our version of a wake.  My other friend set up a dinner here, and said that they couldn't have been more accommodating... even though the number of people kept changing, they never gave him any problems.. . We get there and the place looks amazing.... really high ceilings, bare minimum decorations... very modern elegant.  Started with a couple drinks at the bar  (while waiting for our group of 27 to show up), and they had pizza sitting there for the folks at the bar to munch on... how great is that?. . We finally got the group together, and were seated.  The arrangement was basically for a sort of prix-fix menu, with a huge assortment of menu items... it ranged from pizza to salad to ribeye steak.  Is it the best Italian food I've ever had.....No.  Was it really, really good.... Yes.  They make a delicious cheese-less lasagne (sounds wrong doesnt it?).. . The staff was ridiculously nice... I imagine that when they clock in, they all pop a prozac, because they were truly beyond nice.  One of our waitresses, I think her name was day, was so cute.... I wanted to put her in a hula skirt and have her stand on my dashboard and roll with me to work.. . Bottom line... very cool space, incredibly attentive and nice staff, really good food....Great.. . We even ended up going back for breakfast the next day... which was equally as nice as the dinner.  Will definitely go back next time in l.a.
