Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
We can't decide between 4 seating spots at the Father's Office- What?!  Ok, so it was a monday night, but still F.O. on Helms is a much more stress free experience than the Santa Monica office.  . . The food here is good.  The beers they have are fantastic.  Everything severely overpriced.  . . The sweet potato fries are probably the best around.  A la carte I was already aching at the stomach.  I guess for the portion its a decent value at 7 bucks so get them to share.  Now if only I could steal the cool little shopping cart they serve them in without getting beat up by the guys out front then that would be a total deal.
