While this place is one of the most structurally sound of the local BBQ joints, and the staff and manager are all very friendly, the food is not up to snuff and is not served decently. I won't be back unless I hear things have drastically changed.. . The sauce is pretty decent, but the meat itself is very mediocre. I had a pulled pork sandwich, and it was very disappointing. Frankly, Shane's BBQ sandwich is better than this place.. . The sides were also underwhelming. The macaroni was lukewarm (should have been hot) as was the potato salad (should have been ice cold). All in all, I was a bit worried by the food temperatures, but thankfully I didn't get food poisoning.. . All of this would be forgivable if this place was a portable shack at a flea market, but it's not. The prices are SKY HIGH, and way out of line with the quality of the food. Get real, guys! Lunch for 2 shouldn't run $30 if I'm not drinking!. . I don't think this place is going to last unless they really get off their butts and improve the quality of the food and reduce the prices a bit.
