Restaurant: Blu Jam Café
Category: American (New)
we were a party of 6 with visiting relatives. I wanted a breakfast place with not only great food and service but quiet enough for us to talk. Blu Jam was able to fulfill our needs. The owner, Kamil was gracious and accommodating when he suggested his private room in the back. It was perfect. Jenny our waitress was attentive without being pushy and we were able to have a leisurely meal and conversation. The food was excellent!  Our choices ran from eggs to pancakes to crepes &amp; french toast. Everyone was more than happy with everything. I can't wait to go back and try their lunch menu. I highly recommend this restaurant.
