After hearing my BFF go on and on about Market, I decided to give it a go. It's actually a sports bar so I was expecting something totally different from what I got.. . We actually went rather late and boy was it packed! We were seated rather quickly so no complaints there. . The food was pretty good and the drinks were spendid! . I wasn't fond of the insanely loud music (DJ on the weekends). It was almost impossible to carry on a conversation with my friends without shouting and using hand gestures. . . The only issue is that my BFF requested the remainder of his meal to go and the server trashed it instead!!!  He ended up taking $$ off our bill.  Ah Ha ! wonder if he didn't hear him because of the music?  Overall, a good time had by all ! ** Don't forget to try the cotton candy !
