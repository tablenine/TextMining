Okay, I'm not rating their food, just my experience. I know what Kalbi and Bulgogi taste like, but wanted to taste the Hype. I attended the demo at Surfas, then went outside to get in line for some tacos. Why not get the free ones inside you ask? Cuz some of us could not eat pork and couldn't take a chance. So patiently we waited in line for an hour and got within four of the order window and got turned away. The reason he said that they are out of meat. B.S.! They just loaded the truck with two pans of meat, tofu and tortillas. Kogi truck guy is a liar, if only I could speak Korean. Just cut off the line, and feed those waiting. Like another poster, it felt like the soup Nazi on Jerry Seinfeld. The real Taco truck never turns down a customer. Never will I chase this truck with twitter. Food, we will never know, just like the twenty people behind us.
