The wait staff here is SO nice.  From the time you walk in they do everything possible to make you feel comfortable and they are very unpretentious.  The food is perfect -- wonderful vegetables - the portions are very small which is fine with me, but be advised.  The prices are high.  I'm sure I'm the only person who would care about this (hello, my family is from Humboldt and it makes you more sensitive to this sort of thing), but this is the oldster version of hipster heaven and I like to be in places where people are very comfortable, but they don't need to speak loudly about how much cash they have - so just to speak plainly:  no one who has a personal jet will be speaking about it loudly here, but people who ride in other people's planes seem to be well represented in this location.  Honestly, every time I come here people are speaking about money in public - maybe I have bad timing or maybe this is just the nerve center of LA crassness (again - not to cast aspersions on the staff or the quality of the restaurant, but eat here and then tell me if you disagree about the new money decibel level).
