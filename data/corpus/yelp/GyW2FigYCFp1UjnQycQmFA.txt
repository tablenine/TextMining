Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I've been to every Din Tai Fung except the one in Tokyo and they're all great but this was probably the bottom one (although trust me, its still good... I'm just comparing it to their other stores in Taiwan which is amazing).  Plan to show up and wait cause there's ALWAYS a wait but love those dumplings.  Just stick with the original... they're the best and I can eat about a million of them!!!. . the shanghi rice cakes are pretty good too
