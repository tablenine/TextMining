Flatbread shrimp pizza, Italian cured meats and assorted stinky cheeses along with some nice glasses of Sauvignon Blanc make this a nice place to sit, nibble, converse, and people-watch. . . Prices tend to be on the high side, but I've been fortunate enough to have always gone with tab picker-uppers... I'll cheers to that!
