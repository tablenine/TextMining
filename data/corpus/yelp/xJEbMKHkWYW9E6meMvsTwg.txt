Not spectacular, to say the least.. . Portions are below average and our food came out literally within 5 minutes of ordering and with my powers of deduction, they are clearly preparing these dishes ahead of time.  Makes me feel cheap.. . The Flo Style plate was bland, too simple and didnt do anything for me.  I will give points for the banana-strawberry pancakes because they're delicious.  But for the price, the food I ordered should have been delicious, if not more plentiful.  Service was decent but nothing to make note of.. . Drive a mile east and eat at Yolk at Chicago and Wells.  Way better food and a load more selection (especially for vegetarians!).
