I feel weird giving the Daily 4 stars since I'm not sure I consider them a favorite.  But... I can't say I have any issues with them either.  The servers are quick, the food is fast, the vegetarian options are decent, and I like the drinks.  And they've always played the Blackhawks when I asked them to.  That makes for a solid grade, right?  Perhaps what pushed me over is the gigantic mountain of tater tots I got last time.  I'm a big tater tot fan.  I asked for some on the side... and I got a HUGE pile!  Give me some tater tots and I'll give you more stars.  :)
