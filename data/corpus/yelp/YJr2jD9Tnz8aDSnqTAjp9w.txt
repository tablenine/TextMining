Impressive all-around dining experience!  Very modern, classy decor.  Attentive, professional service.  Sooo many tempting options on the menu- from the dry aged meat options to the dover sole daily special.  Popovers were buttery and melt-in-your-mouth good.  Caesar salad prepared tableside was excellent.  Dry aged bone-in filet was the best that I've sampled anywhere.  Reserve, dry aged bone-in ribeye was mouth-watering.  Had the fresh-baked red velvet cake for dessert.  Was a nice touch to serve the beaters before the actual cake to lick the batter like a kid in mom's kitchen.  Cake itself and cream cheese frosting were decadently good.  Overall, can't ask for a better dining experience.
