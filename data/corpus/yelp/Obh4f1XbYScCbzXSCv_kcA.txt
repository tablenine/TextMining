Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
As far as this establishment goes, I will never put another penny towards supporting this joint. . . The last time I was there, which was years ago, I waited patiently to get a table. I was sitting outside while other parties (namely B-squad celebs) got seated. Now, I understand that you want to have your place get some Hollywood cred so you seat some recognizable faces, but there's a line you don't cross: if people that arrive after me get seated, eat, finish and leave and I still haven't gotten a table, then you're just an asshole (the establishment, not the workers - unless you're the prick that works the door with the ugly hat).. . The bottom line is that I hate Roscoe's, and I will go out of my way to spread the hate. If you're looking for some real soul food, please don't go to Roscoe's Chicken and B.S.. . By the way, if you just got done with you're night and still a little inebriated and feel like munching on some chicken, there's a Popeye's right around the corner.
