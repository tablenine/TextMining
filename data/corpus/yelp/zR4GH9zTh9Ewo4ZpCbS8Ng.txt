I have been following Kogi BBQ around L.A. for the last three months. I always enjoy their tacos and burritos, especially the short rib. I've tried the chicken and pork but the short rib has consistently been the better of the three meats. The tacos are a normal size and the burritos seem slightly smaller than at other taco trucks or Mexican restaurants. Fortunately the burritos are not greasy like their counterparts. The lines are always long and if you don't arrive at least 30 minutes before the truck is scheduled to arrive, you are in for a long wait. Part of the experience is standing in line, socializing with friends or with strangers, all while smelling the sweet and delicious smell of sesame in the air.
