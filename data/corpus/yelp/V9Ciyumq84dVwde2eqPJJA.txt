In  my opinion, this is the best sushi place yet.  The sushi is so good and is really fresh and everything is tasty.  It isn't that expensive either, I went with 4 other people and we each ended up paying $20 each for dinner and we had a lot of rolls, and we each had a drink.  Now that's a good place if you ask me- great food, great prices.
