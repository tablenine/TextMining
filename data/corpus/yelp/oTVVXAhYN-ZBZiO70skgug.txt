I had the long-awaited pleasure of eating here a few weeks ago. It happily reminded me of Katz's in New York. The pastrami was possibly the best Ive ever eaten, with a dark, rich, surface carmelization that was new to my life-long appreciation of pastrami. The countermen and check-out lady were appropriately effective, funny and laconic.
