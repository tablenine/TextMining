Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
I went with a large group so we ordered practically 1 of everything which I got to try.... . The positives:. -Service was awesome and deserves 5 stars. Dan was very knowledgeable about every cut of meat and the history of Kobe/Wagyu/Dry Aged vs. Wet Aged, etc.. -Maple Pork Belly Appetizer. -Wine Sommelier was great!. -Berry Crumble dessert. . Steaks were unimpressive. I ordered the Snake River Wagyu Porterhouse. The Filet was charred and the New York was decent but not great. Portions were small. Mastro's is by far a better choice for steak.
