If you are a broke ass college student that is in search for some good sushi, this is the place. The atmosphere is cool and they play the latest hits at the perfect tone. You cannot help but love the head sushi chef Mitch. He is one of the friendliest sushi chefs around and greets everyone with a fist pound! . . The sushi itself is extraordinarily amazing. I highly recommend the "Oh my god" which has a little spicy tuna that works well with the crab and special sauces. It will keep you coming back for more I guarantee it. Another favorite of mine is the Red Dragon (another spicy tuna combo but worth a try as well). If you are more into cooked sushi, I recommend the Southern Galz which is smoking goodness. Also, they make their own mango ice cream which is full of flavor and made of real mango.. . This place is so good and cozy that the best time to arrive here is once it opens because it gets packed pretty quickly. It is still worth a half hour wait though because it is that good. I recommend bringing some wine too (_8^(1)
