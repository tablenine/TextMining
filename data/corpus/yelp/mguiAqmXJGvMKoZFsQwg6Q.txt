I'm now in NY now and have yet to try M. Batali's restaurants here.  But as a native Angelena, I can say that I've never had pizza that good on the west coast before.  Must be those high-quality hard-to-pronounce ingredients they use ;-)  Had the squash pizza.  Excellent.  So are the appetizers and desserts.  And had the cheapest wine, but it was so dang good, and good enough to serve two people.  I love this place.
