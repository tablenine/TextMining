Went here a while ago for a pal's birthday. Make sure you dress well cos everybody else does. It is a bit pricey and classy. They have a full bar and mainly pizza that I thought was good but its not the kind of place I would frequent all that much. Parking along the street can get crazy some days. Also the wait staff tending to us that day seemed not capable of handling a crowd as big as ours. They seemed perturbed!
