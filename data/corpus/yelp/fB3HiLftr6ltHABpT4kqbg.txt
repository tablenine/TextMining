Perfect for a quick bite before catching a flick in Culver City.  The service is fast, the food is fresh and the prices... 10 bucks for a HUGE Tuna Nicoise salad or steak and mash potatoes hot plate how can you beat that?  It's the perfect place for people who are looking for a chill dinner or folks that are on a budget.  The only pitfall to this place is it's set up like a cafeteria inside, so if you prefer to be waited on it's not for you.  It can be crowded at times so there also may be a waiting time for a table.
