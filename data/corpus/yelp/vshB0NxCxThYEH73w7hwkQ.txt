NOT AS ROMANTIC AS REVIEWERS SAY IT IS! Go to II Cielo for romance, go to Little Door for people watching....watching dumb people that is. . . THIS IS THE MOST pretentious place I've EVER encountered in L.A (and that's saying a lot)! The place itself is nice; HOWEVER the people that come here are LAME, and they place the tables WAY too close to each other.. . I came here for a romantic birthday dinner...we were sitting 6 inches from the table next to us!!! My butt was in their face when I had get up to use the ladies room during dinner!!! Seriously!!! . . We were trying to enjoy a special occasion, however, the guy next to us kept complaining and asked for the waiter, then the manager, then the GM to complain about EVERYTHING, from the wine, to the service, to the food. It ruined the entire romantic evening. This is what we experienced AFTER we asked to be moved from one section to the other because our first table had guys next to us yelling into their speaker phone during dinner about a new client they just got and commenting on how drunk they were...shoes off, on their chairs and all....it was so gross. . . This place is full of dumb, ego-centric idiots, and it's so overrated!!! Service sucked and the food wasn't anything special. So many better places in L.A to try....skip this place for sure!!!
