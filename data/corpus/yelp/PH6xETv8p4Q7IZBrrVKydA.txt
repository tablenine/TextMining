Been to both but have only eaten at this one. You can buy some excellent wines right next door and bring them in with you. It's popular so there is always a wait, but the food is worth it. I think I've eaten half of what's on the menu. Probably one of the better tapas places in LA; I haven't been to others so I don't know. Great ambiance. In my opinion, this location has better service than the other location. Delicious baked goat cheese and albondigas. Â . . I think a couple people are confused about the locations. The one in Silverlake on Hollywood Blvd is the one with the spray painted red books. This one is on Beverly Blvd with no spray painted red books, if I recall correctly. If I'm mistaken, let me know.
