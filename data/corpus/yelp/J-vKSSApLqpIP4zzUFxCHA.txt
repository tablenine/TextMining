Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The first time I came here last summer, I thought The Boiling Crab was just okay. I wasted more energy cracking open crawfish than I got back in return from the meat, so I felt it wasn't worth my money. The shrimp, on the other hand, was quite delicious and well worth what we paid. After I finished my bags, I was still hungry, but I didn't want to spend more money trying to get full. Instead, we opted to pay the check and get some sandwiches from Mr. Baguette.. . This time, I hoped the crawfish would be bigger. Sadly, I missed the best season again. The shrimp, with the whole she-bang sauce (medium hot), lived up to my expectations. Quite succulent and finger-licking good. In addition, we added a basket of fried catfish with Cajun fries. This was definitely the piece missing from my last trip here; the catfish was so fresh and juicy, adding tartar sauce only made it even tastier--and I usually don't like tartar sauce! I was much more satisfied this time. Next time, I'll get more shrimp, and once I get my paycheck, get some blue crab while I'm at it (definitely not on the cheap end--market price was around $20/lb).. . The wait's rather long, but if you have a small party, you might not have to wait quite as long. I came with my friend and we were seated in about 20 minutes. Service is prompt and helpful, and we managed to find parking on the residential street behind the restaurant.. . Water is $0.25 per person! Somewhat irked that they didn't mention this surcharge on the menu or at the time of ordering, but it's only a small gripe.
