Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
The food here is descent, and the service was good the night I was there.  After ordering I had my meal within 10 minutes.. . The main reason I go to the cheesecake factory is for the desert, which is better than the main course.. . Overall, it rates well as a chain restaurant.  Good service and good food.
