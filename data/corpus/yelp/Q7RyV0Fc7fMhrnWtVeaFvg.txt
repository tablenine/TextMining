Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
There aren't many places I'd give a star for their atmosphere but Bottega Louie is one of them.  . . The food was ok - the corn, the pappardelle with truffle,  the mache salad, the sage ravioli were all good.  . The macarons were hit or miss but were okay (currant and coconut).  . . But the atmosphere - all that sunlight in the white background, albeit super loud, makes this place a return spot.  3.5 stars rounded up.
