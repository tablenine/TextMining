If you are a garlic lover, the Sticking Rose is over the top. The steam mussels is a unique flavor hard to match.  The potatoes reeks with flavor.  . I find the salmon and prime ribs their top dishes. If you can't handle a lot of garlic, it's easy to over do your taste buds and unsettle your stomach. Stay away from the garlic wine, share the novelty garlic ice cream, one bit is enough.  Fun atmosphere and a crowd pleaser.
