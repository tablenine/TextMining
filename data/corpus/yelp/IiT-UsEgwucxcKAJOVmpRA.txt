A friend was in town and we had a gathered group of 10 or so for dinner.  They had good beer on tap, and a delicious (but pricey) cocktail list.. . The mac and cheese was delicious, so was the a chick and gnocci dish.  We were loud and rowdy, but the service kept up with our drinks, meals and our antics so i can't complain.  I'd definitely return and recommend this place to anyone.
