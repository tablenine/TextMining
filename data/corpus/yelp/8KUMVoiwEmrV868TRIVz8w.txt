food = good, service (incl. hosts) = friendly, decor = homely, atmosphere = way too loud. ok, so i wasn't aware of how busy or loud the place can be. not a place to celebrate a romantic evening because you won't be able to hear anything the other person is saying. the hosts were gracious enough to seat us in the back room where it was much, much quieter. plus i was able to see dr. mcsteamy and his noczema girl wife. woot! overall - i would just have to try it again.
