This is one of the places I bring my out-of-town friends to when they visit. It's got that hip, downtown, modern feel, and yes, I agree with Jennifer Y., there is indeed more space than you'd expect at a Manhattan restaurant. There also isn't anything TOO exotic on the menu, so if you have a picky eater on your hands, you shouldn't have a problem. Minus one star for the price, though. I hate to do that, because the food IS actually really good, it's just not THAT special. Drinks are super pricey, too. (But yummy.). . Food: Calamari is a good starter, as is the salad (I don't remember the name of it, but it came in this little pile, all wrapped up in a cucumber! So adorable.) The reuben is also tasty (reminded me of Katz--just as expensive, but you could pay with a credit card here....), but my favorite is still the turkey burger with the truffle fries! The turkey in this burger comes in a behemoth of a patty, and is SO perfect. Get it cooked medium. Yes, the fries are very delicious, but my favorite fries are still from Hungry's in Houston, TX. These are in second place. Eat them right when you get them--while they're still piping hot!. . Also, there is this kind of awkward mirror against the back wall of the restaurant. I kept wondering why my dining companions were staring so intently at the wall above my head when we were chatting, until I turned around and realized they were either looking at themselves in the mirror or watching the people behind us with utter fascination. Oh, and I always happen to get that waitress who IS Lily Allen's American twin. She is nice.
