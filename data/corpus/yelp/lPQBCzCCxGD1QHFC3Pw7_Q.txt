Really have to admit,I enjoyed myself here immensely.. Now this is not a place I would frequent often, as the selections are narrow and you won't spend less than 50person However the service was good(not excellent) I like more the Â details, The fuji water and the edamame instead of bread brought to the table... I generally dislike other BuckLifeRests, but this one and the Italian rest in midtown are a cut above.. I had sushi with apple and wasabi sauce and liked the contrast. friend had a dish I wasn't fond of, but it was the sauce not the preparation. the dessert was not as delish as I had recalled in prior experiences so I can see why some give a 3 considering price, but I tilt towards 4
