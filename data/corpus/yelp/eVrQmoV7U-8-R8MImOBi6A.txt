This place has the most incredible gyros. They're huge, and the pita bread, as everyone has said already, is out of this world. For $6.99, I can't really complain. I love how homey it is, though I do wish the location and atmosphere were a little more organised. I love that they have a free parking lot, though. I'll have to go back and try the kebobs sometime.
