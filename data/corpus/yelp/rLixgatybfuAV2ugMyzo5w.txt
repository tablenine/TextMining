Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna - Park Place
Category: Tapas Bars
Ok, I must admit that I don't get the hype attached to Tapas Bar's.  I think it is the latest gimmick to charge a lot of money for a little bit of food.  Plus, the drinks are always overpriced.. Despite my feeling about Tapas Bar's, I have found myself at Eclipse Di Luna - Park Place on numerous occasions.. First, I must first rave about the Grapefruit Martini...it is so tasty, but there can't possibly be that much alcohol in it. I had four of them at a Happy Hour Mixer and didn't even feel a buzz when I left?. Second, the food is good.  I think my favorite dishes are the Mussels with Sherry sauce, the Spiced Potato with Romesco and the Asparagus with Lemon and Parmesan. . Third, the service is exceptional.  Every time, I have been here the server's have bent over backwards to make sure that everyone is having an enjoyable time.. So, if you are "into" Tapas Bar's, I recommend that you try Eclipse Di Luna -  Park Place, as I have always had a nice experience here.
