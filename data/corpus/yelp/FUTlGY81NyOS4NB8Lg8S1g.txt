Category: Italian
I have eaten here a handful of times and I always leave staisfied and without spending a ton of money. The ingredients are always fresh.  Bruschetta is great and the farfalle pollo is probably my favorite dish. . . Only complaint is last time I was there is was towards closing and the kitchen crew was eating dinner at the bar and they were very inappropriate with me and made me very uncomfortable when my boyfriend went to the bathroom, leaving me a lone. It was so bad that I had to switch seats with my bf so my back was to them.... . but anyway, good food, pretty quick,  for not a lot of cash.
