I love this place. My wife and I do breakfast here whenever we can. The wrap on fire, any of the Benedict's, or my wires fave, the old world are all great. The service is wonderful, and the prices are very low for what you get..  and don't get me started on the Friday Night Bistro. Every week is a different and special menu..   I'll see you there.
