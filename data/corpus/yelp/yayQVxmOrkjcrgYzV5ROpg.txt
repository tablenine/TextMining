Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Given that I get off late for work (typically like 11 pm), my bf and I run into quite the dilemma for late night dining that pleases us both... but Canter's has pulled through many late nights when this native California girl and this NY deli born and raised boy find compromise. I love their array of sandwiches and late night live music and terribly poured drinks. My bf loves up on anything turkey and pastrami and raves about the corn beef. We both weren't extremely pleased with the sweet potato fries, but we've made a recent quest for the best sweet potato fries. The atmosphere is that of the quintessential LA deli environment complete with an old school cash register,convenient pay-to-park specific parking lot, and an AMAZING pastry counter. I'll admit the main reason I love revisiting this LA Fox Hotlist 2010 restaurant winner is for the to die for black and white cookies!!
