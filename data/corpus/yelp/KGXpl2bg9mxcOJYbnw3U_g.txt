Philippe's is bombness on a plate.  There is no better place to get a beef dip in the world!  In addition to bomb beef (actually a plethora of dips, including lamb and turkey) dips their soups a delicious (try dipping the sammie in it - trust me it is good!), the blueberry pie is sinful, and the lemonade and ice tea are cheap and wonderful.  This place should be on everyone's bucket list...it is just that amazing!
