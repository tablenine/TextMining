Dealmakers and business poeple who's who bring their appetites and expense accounts to this mighty mecca of meat where the "melt-in-your-mouth" steaks including real Japanese kobe beef.. . Clean atmosphere and service that is beyond reproach make it ideal for business dinner or making good impression.. . You may have to sell yourself to afford it, but converts claim other steakhouses simply can't compete.
