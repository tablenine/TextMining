The Yelp description for 2 stars is "Meh. I've experienced better."  That pretty much sums up my review of this place.  The the staff are fantastic and the owner, who is the original Tom's son, is great (and I wish I could give them a better review).  The decor is kitsch to the max, which is fits perfectly and adds to the experience.  They also give you orange slices and other treats as you wait in line.. . However, each time I've been( and I really want to like this place, but after the fourth trip I can't do it anymore... ) I've been underwhelmed by the quality of the food.  The brunch menu contains pretty simple fare, so I'm not expecting the world, just a nice country-style brunch properly executed.  The eggs, though, are rubbery and overcooked and the homefries are, frankly, terrible.  They're just chunks of potato (cut too big so that they don't cook all the way through) and fried in a skillet until brownish and soggy.  They're neither crisp nor flavorful, and sort of mealy.  I've also had the corned beef hash, which is also (noticing a theme?) flavorless and undercooked.. . To be fair, I'm not big on sugary brunch food like waffles and pancakes, which other yelpers seem to love at Tom's but I haven't tried, so if that's your thing, give it a try I guess.  However, if you like a heartier brunch, there are a number of other places on Wash Ave that do it better, and don't have an absurdly long wait.
