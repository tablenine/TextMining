Category: Breakfast & Brunch
the one thing that bay area lacks is a soul food place like this. i've always heard about this place from friends, relatives and from famous people. i couldn't imagine fried chicken and waffles as a tasty meal (regardless what time of the day). i mean, i've had left over fried chicken for breakfast cuz it was sooooo good the night before and i was soooooo hungry when i woke up, but, never thought about combining that with waffles or any other typical breakfast item.. . the menu here is full of soul food options and breakfast options including grits. beer available here too.. . what i ordered? since i didn't know what to expect, i ordered a thigh and waffle with Â a side of corn bread. yeah i know, get-tow. i first dived into the waffle that came with very soft butter and maple syrup. dressed it up like how i like my pancakes. it was soooooooo good. never tasted a waffle like this before. their batter must have an extra special ingredient or something. really good. so, i'm like "i'm on a good start so far...". onto the fried chicken. crispy and tender, the thigh was almost perfect. i was hoping to taste a bit of an original flavor unique to roscoes. but nonetheless, it was juicy, tender and crispy. last but certainly not the least, cuz i LOVE cornbread, was the cornbread. i was served a large piece of cornbread with butter on the side. when it was first served i dressed it up so that when i eat it, it will be soggy with butter and still warm. it was great. you can tell a good soul food joint on how they make their cornbread. they can make good cornbread, pretty sure everything else will be good or great!. . when in so-cal - you gotta!
