Restaurant: Farm Burger
Category: Burgers
Clean in and out. We were in the area and found this for lunch.. My hubby and I are on a green/organic/sustainable streak at the moment, so grass fed beef seemed like a good fit.. I tried the French Onion option, he tried I think the spinach/mushroom deal, and the kiddo got the little burger.. I am not a burger person, but after we got our food, there was eating in silence for the next 10 min - something that all parents of toddlers will appreciate thoroughly.. I don't remember ordering specific temperature, so my burger came back medium/well, which I liked. The in-house made french dip sauce and fried onion strings were a very good flavor mix, and I enjoyed the burger thoroughly. Fries were freshly made, drinks were clean and crap-free. Service was fast and precise. . I liked recycled paper mats, eco friendly paper towels, eco straws, and natural tables and metal chairs and wooden benches.. . Price-wise it's acceptable, in my opinion, and I liked the simplicity of the interior, and all the farm pictures.. Portions are appropriate size, not huge.. I will definitely go again.
