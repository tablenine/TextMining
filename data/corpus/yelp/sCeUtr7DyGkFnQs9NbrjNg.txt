Ahh, Hainan Chicken, the dish that launched a thousand cars to the border of Alhambra and San Gabriel. . . Yep, just like the approximate million others who have reviewed Savoy Kitchen, I come here for one thing and one thing alone:  that chicken. The poached meat, the fluffy rice cooked in poultry juice, the soy sauce, the spicy sauce, that oh-so-incredible ginger sauce. Does it need to be repeated one more time? Sure yes, why not? Go to Savoy for the Hainan Chicken! It is cheap, it will fill you up twice-over and it may just be the best seven dollars you'll spend on something that doesn't contain sugar or alcohol.. . Cramped dining area? Cash only? Location in BFE? Don't fret little ones, don't fret:  take one bite of that unique, savory poultry dish and you will forget all your troubles.
