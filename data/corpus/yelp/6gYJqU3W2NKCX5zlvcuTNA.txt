In town on business and took a walk in the hot mugginess of a Monday night in mid-June only to stumble upon this lil oasis. The Tour of Belgium flight was a refreshing relief from the heat. A nice choice too as it reminded me how much I like Ommegang Rare Vos. The beer selection is, well ... a fine one indeed.  33 draughts by my count and a welcome recognition of Belgian beer coupled with a knowledgeable bartender.  Well organized beer towers adorn the spacious rectangular bar. I followed my flight with a Rogue Brutal Bitter, cask-conditioned that perfectly complemented my meal.. . Speaking of the food, a fine menu of nicely priced food items. I ordered the tomato bisque as an appetizer and this was one fine bowl of soup.  Followed that with a trio of crispy tilapia fish tacos that were both unique and tasty in equal parts.. . I fully expect to return at least once this week.. . Update: Make that twice.  Pub burger good, tomato bisque awesome twice.  Sampled more beers; they have $2 shorties for sampling.  Latched onto the Rogue Brutal Bitter but the Lips of Faith sour brown ale is spectacular too.
