No, that's not a broom closet in the middle of Broadway - it's actually a restaurant. This tiny Asian fusion location seats only 20 (plus 15 during warm weather with outdoor seating). But the diminutive size is not the only reason you frequently see a crowd of people outside its doors, patiently waiting for a table. The food is consistently solid, the prices are fair, and it's BYOB (corkage fee of $3.95, which is waived if your purchase was made Valhalla, the wine store across the street). I hear the crab rangoon is fantastic, although I've never tried it (not a big fan of cream cheese with my seafood - ick).
