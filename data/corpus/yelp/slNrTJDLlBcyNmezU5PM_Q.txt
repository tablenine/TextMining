wow, really? People like this?   this place must be hit or miss and tonight it was a miss.  It would have been better if the hair in my burger was also missing.  The onion rings tasted like onion rings, the fried onions i got on my burger tasted like dung.  I had to take em off and set em aside.  I would compare it to the two dollar burger at Lionshead but i believe that the lions head burger is better bigger and cheaper and that there is really no comparison...  Moody's, more like doody's.   Doody's in my mouth moving down to my stomach which has every right to be upset with me.  I actually went and got a Mcrib to get the bad taste out of my mouth.  and did i mention the hair i found half way through?  Now the positive.  It wasn't crowded at all and our waitress had two arms, in fact,  all of the waitress's had both arms and legs. They also have two fireplaces, and people can sit at tables on chairs.  The waitress was also nice.  I would rather eat filet McDon than at this wretched place.  *Also totally discredited chicago magazines top 25 burger list.
