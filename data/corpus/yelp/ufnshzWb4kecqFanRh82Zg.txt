Fennel sausage pizza and squash blossom pizza--every time. Well, I used to get the Fresno chilies pizza, but recently discovered the squash blossom one after having enjoyed the popular squash blossom appetizer and now have been completely converted.. . I just went back last week for lunch and loved the experience yet again. I do not understand why some say it's over-hyped. Yes, not every pizza on the menu is a total winner, but they are out of this world when they work. The sauces are unique and delicious--the squash blossom has a NYC-style tomato and the fennel sausage has a milky "panna" cheese. The crust is crisped just right and left soft and fluffy on the inside. The cook manning the brick oven mesmerized me with his pizza-making skills during this last visit (we sat at the bar overlooking the open kitchen--I prefer the tables usually, but didn't have a reservation and got lucky that the bar even had any seats available). Even thinking about this again is making me hungry... . The butterscotch "budino" desert is also ridiculous: salty, sweet, tons of stuff going on, but not overwhelming at all. . . The place is emblematic of the power of hype in the LA restaurant scene; it has been totally packed since it opened during the summer of 2007. While the prices are not terrible (it's no Domino's, but not bad for the usual trendy LA spot), Batali, et al. must be making piles of money off these crowds. The food is certainly good enough to keep me coming back as long as I can still get a table.
