Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Chicago: land of broad shoulders, Da BEARS, and deep dish pizza.. . I was told that I HAD to have some Chicago-style pizza while I'm here, so we decided to check out two spots: Gino's East and Lou Malnati's.. . Gino's... yeah, let's not talk about that.. . Lou Malnati's, however, EXCELLENT. The pizza was delicious and buttery, without being soupy and hard to manage.  I wasn't expecting to like it much, but I totally BEASTED out on a small, nearly destroying the table, a surround couple, and the sign holder.. . Yes, THAT good.. . I can honestly say that before you try anywhere else, you give this spot a shot first.  Especially for the busy traveler that wants to check everything out in the city and has a limited time schedule, I promise you won't be disappointed by this experience.. . So, why not the 5 star? Well, our server... it started off well, but completely gave us the gas face after a while. Not a fun experience, but it wasn't enough (for me at least) to knock the pizza.. . A must try and a Chicago staple. Do it!
