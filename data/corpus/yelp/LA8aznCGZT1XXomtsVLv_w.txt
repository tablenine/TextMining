Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
Granted I've only tried pho at two or three places, but Dai Loi is where I find myself returning again and again. A co-worker of mine brought me here - she's Vietnamese and a foodie, so I took her word that it was the best. . . The broth is fantastic. It really warms you up on a cold, rainy day. I'm a little finicky about the offal, so I generally stick with the basics. For those that are super picky eaters, you can even get chicken breast. There really is something for everyone.. . Yes, I always make my friend order for me because I'm clueless. Yes, I generally manage to splash and trash my clothes (that's why they invented Tide pens). But I always leave the restaurant full and with a smile on my face.
