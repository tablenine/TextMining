Restaurant: DBA Barbecue
Category: Southern
Just when you think Atlanta has exhausted every conceivable dining concept that could be imagined, DBA Barbecue hits the scene with a fresh take on an old Southern favorite.  . I was lucky enough to attend the "Friends and Family" soft opening and get a preview one day before the restaurant officially opened.. . First, the interior has been completely refurbished, and in a way that gives a new take on the traditional barbecue motif.  Unlike its defunct neighborhood predecessor, Dusty's, there are no drawings of dancing pigs on the wall.  Rather, the use of barn wood, rustic bricks, and mason jar lighting give the place a feeling of downscale comfort, without anything annoyingly whimsical.  The red upholstered booths define laid back style and the art is southern coastal, while Coca Cola memorabilia is ubiquitous.  All of this combines to create an atmosphere that is comfortable, true to Southern roots, and still down home enough not to force upscale to a cuisine that begs for simplicity.. . And, speaking of cuisine, the menu is diversified enough for one to enjoy its bounty every night of the week and still have a unique meal.  This is due to the fact that DBA offers cuisine from the Louisiana coast, stopping in Memphis, hitting Georgia and Alabama and then settling comfortably in North Carolina.  As the menu is available on the web on multiple sites, I won't repeat it here, but besides the typical barbecue offerings, there are such treats as oysters on the half shell, texas style cream corn, and sweet potato fries, all of which I tried and loved.  There is a kid's menu, and an abundant array of old southern favorite bottled drinks (remember cheerwine, anyone?). . All in all, DBA has the potential to become an Atlanta Classic, staying true to its roots as a barbecue restaurant, and still offering its patrons a unique experience.
