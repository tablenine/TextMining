Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This sushi place is the best I've found in the city so far. . . I'm not all that into the glam sushi bars/restaurants. Places like Japanois makes me want to shoot myself. . . But this isn't about them. It is about Tank. This place is delicious, cute, affordable, fun, and always ready for a fish eating good time. I came here a couple of weeks ago with my friend and my brother. The food is to die for &amp; so cheap if you go here when the rolls are half off. (What a steal!) . . This place would get 5 stars, but the service is a little too much for me. Nobody smiled, or really gave a crap that I didn't have any water for most of my meal. Sigh. Oh well, I don't come here for service, I come here for the sushi! . . I think I need to bring Lauren H here. She'd dig it.
