Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
This is one of the best places I've ever eaten.. . The first time I was here, I was in Los Angeles with my father, and he sent me in just to buy a jar of their famous hot mustard. I never got the chance to eat there, until now.. . I was in LA recently with my wife, and I wanted to take her somewhere special for lunch. We walked in and we were just blown away from the moment we took our first steps onto the sawdust covered floor. The place was packed with people. We had just missed the lunch rush, and even though we had seen documentaries on Philippe's, we still needed help ordering, because it can be confusing at first. But everyone is really nice, and I walked up to 2 guys about my age and asked them for help and they told me what to do. So Josie and I ordered 2 french dips, a plate of macaroni salad, a plate of potato salad, 2 small bags of chips and 2 Cokes, served in cans. We saw some people had ordered 2 or more sandwiches!. . Everyone sits together at these long tables, and there are people from all walks of life, different social classes, sitting together, talking and enjoying each others company. As you sit there, it becomes nostalgic, and you get a feel of old Los Angeles. The sandwiches were incredible, and the potato salad and macaroni salad were unbelievable.. . As we left, we couldn't believe that it took us so long to come here. It was our first time here, but not the last.
