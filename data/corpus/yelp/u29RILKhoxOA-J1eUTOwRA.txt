Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
We went to this place for Mother's Day.  I wanted something fast, inexpensive, and delicious.  I didn't want to deal with the crowds.  We arrived at Shin-Sen-Gumi around 4pm.  Perfect timing before the rush.  We were welcomed with a lovely greeting, as other yelpers have mentioned.  I was a bit confused on how to order so I asked the server for some direction.  She just asked me what I wanted and ended up filling out the form for me.  I wish she would have walked me through the menu a bit so I could really pick and choose.  But, since she didn't, I had to choose ramen w/ wontons because its the only thing I recognized.  It wasn't until after I ordered that I realized they had chasyu.  I wish I would have ordered that.  Anyway, both the hubby and I ordered the ramen w/ wontons.  I did think it was cool that we were able to choose the firmness of the noodles, the oil in the broth, etc.  I don't recall being able to choose the spiciness.  I wish I would have been able to choose because I would have added some spice, for sure.  The ramen was pretty good.  Broth was definitely thicker than I am used to...but it was still really good.  Hubby didn't like it much because he's used to Hawaiian style ramen.  . . The gyoza was very good, albeit small.  They were delicious though!. . We will definitely be visiting again!  Total bill was around $19.  Great value.
