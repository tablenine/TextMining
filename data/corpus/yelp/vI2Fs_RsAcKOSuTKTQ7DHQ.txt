Mmmmm.  MMM!. . I've only been there three times, but each time made me curse not living closer to Eagle Rock.  Two times I was sober, the other, I was not.  Every time I left a happy, stuffed lady.. . I always get the Oinkster burger (with bacon and Gruyere) because I love it so much I never want to miss out.  My bf got the pastrami sandwich, which was seriously deeeelicious.. . It's nice to be able to get a good beer there and enjoy a burger.  The crowd's nice, staff is good and I adore their burger.. . I'm currently salivating.  Num num num.
