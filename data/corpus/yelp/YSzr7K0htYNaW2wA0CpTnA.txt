Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
When I look for a french style bistro, there are a few things that I consider in my experience; Decor, Menu, Authenticity.. . Comme Ca pretty much satisfies on all accounts when comparing a traditional French bistro, which is probably my favorite cuisine.  This place definitely gives you the taste of a bistro, yet with a modern edge.. . Before sitting down you must grab a drink at the bar.  Even go a bit early if you can.  The cocktail list is that good.  By far, better than most restaurants in West Hollywood who claim to have an "award winning" one.  Try the El Matador.  It is one of Comme Ca's takes on a margarita, complete with a flaming orange peel.  I get it everytime.. . Start with the cheese plate and a glass of bubbles, which is always heaven and a great way to start off the meal here...or anywhere if you ask me!. . If you're like me and love a hearty meal when hitting up a bistro, try the Rib Eye for two.  I personally tend to head straight for steak frites.  But in my experience at Comme Ca specifically, the Rib Eye for two with a side of frites is miles more divine.  The cut of the steak frites just isn't that great in my opinion.. . In all of my experiences at Comme Ca, I have yet to make it to the sweet portion.  I tend to sway more towards another glass of champagne or another yummy cocktail as I am usually already stuffed.. . The food, decor, and experience at Comme Ca are all amazing.  Be patient with the staff, they tend to get overwhelmed easily.  By overlooking that you'll walk away ready to plan your next visit back.
