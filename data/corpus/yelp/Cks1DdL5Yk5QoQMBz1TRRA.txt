I love eating here, I should eat here more often!. . I highly recommend ordering the garlic bread, mushroom appetizer, the chicken and beef stroganoff, any of the steaks, plantains and mash potatos!. . You will be in heaven!. . I also like the fact that this place is open until 4am. Perfect for hangovers or just trying to get a late night bite to eat!!
