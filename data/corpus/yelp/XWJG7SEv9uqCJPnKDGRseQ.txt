these tastes are transporting.. . every bite is melodic.. . fried spring rolls wrapped in lettuce leaf with crazy good sauce for dip?  yes please.. . heaping bowl of fresh sliced rice noodles with perfectly seasoned grilled meat and shrimps with a chopped egg roll and peanuts on top and some mint leaves for fun?  ummm.  yes.. . total bill- i don't know- $14?. . while the cafeteria style lighting is rude and unfortunate, the sngle green lightbulb in the bathroom makes up for it, so ummm, take your date in there post noodles, or something.. . YUMMA!
