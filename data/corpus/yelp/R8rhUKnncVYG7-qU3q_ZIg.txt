Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So were in West Hollywood, me and my sancha and were hungry so we said hell why not have what we've always wanted PINKS! Well The line was 1 hour long!! 1 freaking hour !! I was Hungry and Getting Grumpy, I though to myself these hot dogs better be out of this world. When I finally got to order Everything looked so good! :) So I had a Chili Cheese Bacon with Sauerkraut hot dog. Was it good ?? HELL yes, I made sure my hunger wasn't doing the talking. The hot dogs were full of flavor, the kraut could of been a bit better, the chili was delicious and the cheese was well cheese. I would Definitely like to come back but I'm bringing a dam chair.
