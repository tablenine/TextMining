Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
Everyone should experience this place once in their lifetime!. It should be celebrated with a GROUP of people, who likes to eat (even though the sushi was just okay), drink, sing.. just be down to have fun, with the waiters/waitresses and their friends! .. oh and have money too. . . this place IS expensive but the experience is worthwhile.. If you have more than 14 people (i believe), it is required to pre-order their party plates. And they urge you to drink, a lot.
