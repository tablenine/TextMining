so i went here on a random night with a friend and boy were my taste buds pleased. the drinks were delicious, the food was so savory--i had the kobe beef, YUM YUM YUM is all i can say, the presentation was beautiful and we got several complimentary appetizers that were also delicious, the service was great, and the vibe is awesome. we sat in the back upstairs bar, where they make the sushi in front of you, those chefs like to have a good time, no doubt. all-in-all this place is fantastic, i will definitely be back.
