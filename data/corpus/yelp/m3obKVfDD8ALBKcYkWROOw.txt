Maybe it's the air in Va-Hi that makes people think the food is better than it actually is... . Request Thai hot on most dishes, still come out weak and servers get irritated if I ask for Sriracha/ Sambal Oelek and fish sauce. . . As for the sushi...it's Ru San's in Bill Hallman's clothing. . . Basically, middle of the road, nothing exciting or innovative...translation: it's safe for kids and adults alike. Even the name is safe. Better than Doc Chey's and Mama Fu's...but why not just head down the street to Ma Li's for a few steps up in quality? . . This joint is good as a starter kit for Thai and sushi 101.
