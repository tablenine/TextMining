Reza's is so good!! I have not been to this one, but my work is down the street from the one in the burbs, and it did not dissapoint. I am extremely extremely picky with my middle eastern food, and was definitely impressed. We got the buffet, and the hummus, bhaba ghanuj, Â and the chicken were so so good. highly recommend this place.
