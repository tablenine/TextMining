The only thing that was disappointing was the fact that I was too full to order dessert. The donuts sounded great but alas I will have to wait for my next trip to Kyma for those.  . . We shared the grilled octopus - which was amazing. Really unlike the chewy nuggets I have had at other places.  Even my friend, who is much less adventurous, loved it and had to scoop the last little pieces before the waiter cleared the plates.  Warm pitas with the spreads - yum.  We had the whole fish but they filleted it in the back (less adventurous friend &amp; all that). . . All in all - service was good and the food was yummy, fresh and well prepared. Will go again when I am back in ATL.
