I really liked this place!  Wasn't too crowded for a Saturday, though we did go around 9 or so.  I had the pancake orgy which was amazing- comes with 3 different types of pancakes- blueberry, lemon poppy and banana and then granola and yogurt on the top, though I skipped the yogurt because dairy grosses me out!  The potatoes were really good and had a hint of truffle salt on them.  The person I was dining with had a crab omelette which he really liked.  Prices are reasonable and service is very fast.  This is probably my second fav breakfast place after Yolk!!
