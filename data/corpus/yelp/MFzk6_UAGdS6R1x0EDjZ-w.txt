I feel pretty... oh so pretty, I feel pretty, and witty, and... (what's that last lyric?). . I loved going to Sepia.  I took a female client here for lunch, and it was a perfect spot for three young business women (so ridiculous that I even consider myself one) for lunch.  The menu had a lot of options for any palate, and the decor was classy and functional.. . I had the trout for lunch, and I really loved it.  They balanced the texture of the fish on this black eyed peas mixture, and the veggies they served with it were crisp and fresh.  The food was definitely high quality and creative, and I'm looking forward to my next chance to eat here.
