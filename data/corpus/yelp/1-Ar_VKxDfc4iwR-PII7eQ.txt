Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
You only need to eat once the day you go to Roscoe's. You'll walk out of there so full you won't even know what to do with yourself. Going there is always an adventure with plenty of characters and a fun staff. The food is fantastic as far as southern food goes. Try something smothered in gravy. Â Bring your own angioplasty kit.
