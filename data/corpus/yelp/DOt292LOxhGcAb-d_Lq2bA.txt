Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I'm hovering between 3 and 3.5 stars. . . Over the weekend, my GF and I were shopping on Melrose and decided to check out Joan's. It was freakin hot as a mofo that day and finding parking was a major pain in the azz. Lucky for us, I spotted a street spot 2 blocks away. . . I didn't know that Joan's was a store and bakery as well, so it was cool to be able to check out the goods. I took a pic of the cupcakes and the lady was like, "No pictures allowed" My bad. It's not like I'm gonna sell the pic to someone.. sheesh.. . Sandwiches are pricey here. My tuna sandwich was $10! And it just came with some pickles. But, whatevs. It was a pretty damn good sandwich and it was ginormous. I was only able to eat half of it. The pickles were really good too. . . My GF got the prosciutto sandwich and it was quite tasty as well. I prefer tuna though. After all, I am a cat.. . I noticed that Joan's has a lot of rules. There was a sign by the cash register that said "Please finish your cell phone conversation before ordering". Ok.. Kinda random. I get that it's rude to be on the phone while ordering, but what if you are on the phone with someone who wants you to order something?. . Anyways, the waiter was nice and pleasant. At least he seemed to enjoy his job. We sat outside in the shade which was nice when the breeze kicked it. . . Since my GF has such a sweet tooth, she ordered a vanilla cupcake with raspberry filling. It was pretty, but I thought it was too sweet. Meh. I'm more into Angel Maid cakes. . . I'd come back, but Urth still reigns in my book. . . PIX- . http://www.epicureancu....
