Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
I have never had anything under phenomenal from Mario Batali's kitchen. Osteria Mozza is no exception.. . The cocktails are great and the wine list is superb. The sommelier came and recommended the perfect (and perfectly priced) bottle to go with our course choices. The wine was unforgettable as was the meal. . . Definitely order the mozzarella cheese plate.
