Greetings again Yelp-land,.      Listen... I will try my best to keep this short and sweet, but I have loved this place for at least 4 years now! It is always consistently outstanding!!! Tucked away on Old Chattahoochee just off of Howell Mill Road, the quaint little space that is Laredo Nuevo is a city gem..        I was introduced  by some good friends of mine who have a knack for finding good drinks and good times. We originally went for the award winning Cadillac Margarita (an $11 dollar, covet - worthy dream) it's a special house mix topped with both Controy and Grand Marnier liqueur... mmm... so tasty! Just one of these bad boys will remove those worry wrinkles that start showing up near the end of a long work day..      The food... ah, yes.. the food... marvelous! Of course you must begin your experience with a heaping pile of fresh tortillas and salsa matched with the oh-so-tasty chile con queso dip and their rich, buttery guacamole (I squirt  just a bit of lime juice on the guac' and OMG!). Now let's move on to the entrees: I've had many; from the piled-high chicken nachos to the shrimp quesadillas, the loaded chicken soup (compete with a full quarter chicken and rice) to the sinful enchiladas and refreshingly light salmon tacos; but tell me, who among you can deny the beautiful matching of lump, juicy lobster meat, chile con queso, spinach, lime, cabbage, and a warm tortilla??? Yes, you read right... LOBSTER TACOS! They are the absolute pinnacle of this dining experience pick up at least one "a la carte" with your meal or order the dinner; you'll be an addict!!! Nothing on the menu disappoints, so be sure to bring your appetite. (here's a link to start the salivation process: . http://www.nuevolaredo....  ). Enjoy!!
