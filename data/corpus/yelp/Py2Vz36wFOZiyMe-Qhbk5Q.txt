Small store, with to go window, a patio and a nicely kitschy dining area.. After sitting at the window counter, we were brought coffee and ordered food... Though the waitress basically told us she could not allow substitutions on the menu and they were out of just abotu everything on the menu... . . Things they were out of, Â Cornbread, anything involving the cornbread, the stuff in the breakfast burrito, at least two of the 8 things on the menu, etc etc.. . After the coffee came out, we waited 40 minutes for food, so they brought us some raspberry and lemon bars to tide us over, both were tasty.. The food came out soon after, it was good, my omelet was watery cause it was overcooked, but was okay. My friends burrito came with all of the things he asked to NOT be on it.. . Coffee was okay.. All in all it was okay.. . On another note, they closed the kitchen once they realized they were out of everything. we were one of the last people seated before they shut the place down.. . Weird.
