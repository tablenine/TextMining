Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
I don't think theres anything I can say about Daikokuya that hasn't already been said. Amazing ramen, rich and delicious broth, tasty meat and the best fried rice I've ever tasted. Mm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it again. :D I love taking new people here because it reminds me of the first time my friends and I ate there; that first wide eyed look of amazement around the table after you first taste the broth, followed by the end of all conversation and loud slurping and the pouring of more beer.. . Definitely be prepared for a long wait. I'm still trying to figure out when Daikokuya's "down" time is. I'm starting to think it doesn't exist. I've been there ranging between 3:00p to 9:00p and it's ALWAYS busy and there's always at least 4 or 5 groups waiting ahead of me to get seated. I'm definitely someone that usually walks away from a restaurant with a wait longer than 15 minutes, but for this ramen, I've waited over an hour on several occasions. But, you can usually count on some less diehard folks ahead of you giving up and not being there when the lady calls their name off the waiting list. :D I would suggest trying to come in a party of two and sitting at the counter if you're eager to try but are intimidated by the ever present crowd outside.. . Based off food alone, I would give 5 stars, but the inconvenience of waiting and not being able to comfortably seat slightly larger groups gives it an overall 4 stars.. . PS - Does anyone else think the high tech ordering pads they use there are nifty??
