Wanna go back with me Ryan F.? My experience was the shizzle. Praise God I live down the street cause I'm going back every damn night this week! I had a Unami Burger (portobello mushrooms &amp; Â a cheese crisp), the BEST vanilla cream soda ever in a glass bottle, fried &amp; onion rings with aoili- I usually don't like rarer meat but as good, fresh &amp; quality meat goes, pink works. Not all that big on space but a cool ass place for a burger night with some cool as friends-
