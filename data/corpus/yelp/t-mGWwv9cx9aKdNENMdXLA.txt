Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Coalfire has been open...about 2 months now? I think? I've been about 4 times and I am really loving the pizza. It can be very difficult to get your beverage refilled (water) and sometimes they forget we ordered 2 pizzas. It seems their staff has doubled since they've opened (I went last night), which is a good thing. It was packed and poor Barbara was running around like crazy with those pizzas.. . If you're really hungry, you can totally eat a whole pie yourself. I've ordered the same pizza every time I've gone because it's so good. I can't remember the exact name, but it's the one with the red peppers and the spicy salami and marinera sauce. It's BYOB which is pretty cool. The service just after opening was much to be desired and they're definitely improving. They should have their art down pat before no time. I recommend it!
