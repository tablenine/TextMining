Really not as wonderful as everyone says it is. It does taste better than the one in Jack London in Oakland however, it's still not as wonderful as everyone says it is.. . The chicken is relatively good. The waffles are relatively good. It will definitely give you your fried chicken fix. The breasts are normally tender and sweet, moist and well worth the calories. I do think it's a good place to go, however I don't advocate having fried chicken and buttered down waffles a lot.. . A good place to go and get your grub on but in general, their fried chicken is actually pretty average. Â Maybe just slightly above average, but not above enough for me to want to shell out the other star.
