Went back to Yamato again, had the usual (and got to sit in the cute balcony seat (: ). . We went at 5:00 and the place was completely empty, which was nice. The food came out very promptly and we were both satisfied and well fed within 35 minutes of arriving there. The only down fall was that at the end it took them 10 minutes to bring the check out. When they finally did, it took them a while to get back at us too so my sister had to walk over to our waitress and give it back to her herself.. . So although I love you Yamato, and although it breaks my heart, I have to deduct one star for your crappy service at the end of my meal.. Hopefully next time it won't happen again (:. . Oh, and another thing. I decided to try the Ankimo again because my sister loves that stuff (she ordered it and the waiter corrected the way she pronounced it, how rude...) and it wasn't AS bad as last time... but my sister loved it. Maybe I'm just not an Ankimo type of girl.
