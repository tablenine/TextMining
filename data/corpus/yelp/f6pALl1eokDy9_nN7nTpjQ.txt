The toad in the hole was a throwback to a childhood favorite my mother made with an egg and sliced mantou, the Chinese steamed bun, in our cast iron wok. Fantastically simple with nothing much but the runny yoke to season the buttered toast, this slice was a treat for the inner child sick of fou fou fine dining flourishes. Just be ware that the price tag for simplicity is quite dear. Â A word of warning, the specials turned out to be much more expensive than what's on the menu and the prices were not reflected on the board, at least I didn't notice their existence.. . J got the burger and was too engrossed in conversation with my dad to share. I did manage to steal some fries, which were nicely salty and pleasantly crisp.. . Then there was my pork ragu over pappardelle (photos of the food may be found at . http://livetonibble.bl.... ), a substitute for the gnocchi I had heard much about. My disappointment over not being able to try the gnocchi evaporated as soon as I saw the bowl of pretty pasta covered with cheese shavings. I haven't had pasta this good in many months. So perfectly al dente was the homemade pappardelle, I could see myself eating it plain by the bowful with just some salt, pepper, and good olive oil. But why give up the awesome pork ragu, when it was so generously provided and so full of porky flavor. Lip-stickily lardy as it was, it managed to not come across overly rich thanks to the acidic touch of red sauce, just lovely and crave worthy.. . To end our meal with sweetness, we ordered the phatty cakes, the only type of "cake" offered at Cake &amp; Ale. I was a bit let down that a place with Cake in its name doesn't offer real cakes, but rather serve cutely named cookies. I did love the creme filling with a bit of tang and liked the ginger cookies, but they were just slightly harder than I would have preferred.
