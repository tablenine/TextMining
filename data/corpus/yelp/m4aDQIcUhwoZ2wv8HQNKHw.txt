I really like this place. Let me just say that that super ice cream dessert they serve in that big ol', tall cup is just delicious and it makes me think of the Jean-Philippe Pattiserie in Vegas--yup, that good. Meant to be shared! I think it's called a something-sundae?. . I think their meat plates are really good, and so worth it. Â I just about adore the decor in this whole place! Fabulous, I can't get enough of it! I want to eat in all the rooms--the "party" tables are really cool and really make for the experience. So far, I've only hated their lasagna because it tastes like frozen kind and is real small...even their salads are good. I like the bbq chicken pizza too. My favorite are the big meat plates, get one of those.. . I'd say the sexy red tables are good for date, but then what about the garlic? :X. . Oh, and the mashed potatoes are soooo good. I'm surprised at how cheaply affordable it is.. . My favorite thing to date has been the braised boneless short-rib, also known as what I am getting here from now on. I also like their porkchop thing with apple-something, but it's a bit too small.. . The Neon Ravioli is also good, but the pastas are just too small for me--that's the thing about this place: some plates are big, and some are just too small.. . The garlic ice cream did not impress me...but it is garlic ice cream.
