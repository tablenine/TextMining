Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This restaurant is inconspicuously hidden behind two small wooden doors.  Upon walking through, you are presented with a lovely roofed courtyard area that gives a feeling of romantic coziness.  . . We started with the crab cakes, had pumpkin ravioli and the filet mignon, and finished with sorbet and the creme broulee trio. Everything was perfect.  Equally as good was their wine selection.  They also have a great selection of Ports.. . The wait staff were the most competent and attentive that I'd ever seen.  Our waiter was fully knowledgeable about the menus and offered up great recommendations when asked.. . The only downside is the price.  It makes the saying 'you get what you pay for' very true though! And  besides, its worth splurging just to get the chance to eat at this restaurant .  I'd recommend it to anyone.
