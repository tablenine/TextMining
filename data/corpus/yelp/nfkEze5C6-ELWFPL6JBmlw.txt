I came here with some of my girlfriends for a girls night out and was rather disappointed. While the ambiance was really pleasant and the hotel is beautiful, the food and service were booth less then notable. . . The papads and chutney were really quite lovely, but most of the meal was underwhelming. Â I tried the Chicken Samosas, which were fine. The Calamari was very oily and pretty average. The Green Vegetable curry was completely underwhelming. It was very bland; despite the waiter assuring us it was the spiciest curry on the menu. One of the other girls got the Cod, which was quite pleasant.. . Our waiter was less than helpful and over all the service was lacking. Probably not somewhere I'll visit again with all the other choices in Atlanta. It wasn't terrible, but definitely wasn't the quality I was expecting.
