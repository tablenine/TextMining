Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
as long as the line always is, i somehow manage to keep getting dragged back here by visiting friends and family. the dogs are decent (i keep forgetting that i despise the canned mushrooms they use) but i suppose that line makes you hungrier so that you enjoy your meal more! my favorite part about pink's is getting a nice cold bottle of bubble-up. and a side of those greasy-good onion rings.. . big ups to the outdoor seating; it was nice to be able to bring our dog along with us for lunch!
