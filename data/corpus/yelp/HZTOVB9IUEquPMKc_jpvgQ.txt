There wasn't the "wow" factor I would expect from a place I'm giving 5 stars, but it was still great.  Two large slices and a drink for $6 flat is difficult to beat.  I couldn't really think of anything to penalize them for, other than their location.  On the other hand, I fear the land whale I would become if they threw one of these in Atlantic Station.
