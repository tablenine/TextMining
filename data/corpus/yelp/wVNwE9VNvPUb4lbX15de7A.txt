Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
By the name of the restaurant, one would think that Palms Thai, would possibly be located in the Palms district.  But shockingly, no.  It is located in Hollywood, where there are so few Thai restaurants.  . . Palms Thai, definitely stands out from any of its competitors.  In an area where most of the restaurants are fusion restaurants, Palms is not, it serves up authentic Thai food.  What is not so authentic about it is the Thai Elvis impersonator that provides the entertainment  He alone, makes this place worth the inevitable wait.
