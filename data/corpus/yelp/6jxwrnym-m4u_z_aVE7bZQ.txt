Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Dinner at Jerry's was an overall shocking experience. "Sandwiches? Shocking?" you say. Let me explain. . . As my friend and I walked into the restaurant, I was expecting a counter-service delicatessen. To my surprise, Jerry's is a hip, warm restaurant with sit-down service. Since my friend came directly from running along the lakefront, she was a little underdressed, but we were assured that Jerry's had no dress code. Nope, not even fresh-from-the-lake runner will be turned away. . . Gazing at the menu of over 100 sandwiches, I was a little overwhelmed to say the least. Luckily, they've kindly divided the menu into different meats (or lack there of) - turkey, chicken/chicken salad, roast beef, vegetarian, and so on. Immediately drawn to the vegetarian section, I noticed the Baba R - a sandwich featuring peanut butter, apples, grilled onions, basil and chipotle chutney. Feeling lucky, I took a chance on this black sheep of a sandwich. And then came shocker #2: IT WAS DELICIOUS. Bizarre, but delicious. I chose mac &amp; cheese and asian slaw as my sides, which were also very tasty.. . Jerry's takes a unique look at the classic sandwich and gives it just the right amount of flair to keep us interested in the ol' standby.
