Pros: Nice interior, good outside seating, price is reasonable. Cons: Food is ok, valet parking after dark is a pain. . The problem with Pan Asian food is it tends to spread itself too thin. There's no distinct taste, and while a blend of different and usual ingredients can be a good thing, I feel like the food here just gets muddled.
