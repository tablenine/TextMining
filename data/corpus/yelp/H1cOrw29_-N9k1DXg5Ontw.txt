Category: Chinese
Doesn't a place make you curious when you know people spend one hour to drive to a place just to eat (I'm one of them).   I don't know any other place that specializes in XLB, but this one was pretty good.  I've had XLB at normal Chinese restaurants, but they don't make them very well at all. . . Of all the soup dumplings, I would recommend only getting the pork XLB, the one with crab doesnt have much soup actually, and the others are more like boiled pot stickers.  Dumplings are not usually a main course meal for me so I end up getting other side dishes to fill me up.  If you ordered just soup dumplings, your cost per person will definitely be over $20 / person.  On a side note, I had the sweet and sour soup and it was great, very unique compared to other soups.  . . I took my parents here (they are from Taiwan) and they have said there are better places there, but this is SoCal so if you want to make the 1 hour trip into a 8 hour one, then go for it.  . . Biggest downside is that I know that parking is always going to be horrible and the wait will be super long.  The one in the rear always seems to have a shorter line.  Its also nicer looking on the inside so I recommend taking the detour here instead.
