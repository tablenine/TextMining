Category: Sandwiches
Love the French dips at Philippe the Original. The long line is worth queuing in for a fatty, meaty French dip sandwich, drizzled in gravy juice. That wonderful gravy elixir is sweet ambrosia on a kaiser roll. It's like a Dunken donut you dunk into a great cup of coffee. It's greasy, soggy, but taste so good. It's sooo good, but soooo bad for you. Â But some times you need an unhealthy meal. Yeah, sure you'll regret eating the French dip afterwards (damn, high calories), but in the moment you enjoy this wonderful delight. Ahhhh... I love the French dip sandwich at Philippe's. Give me a Philippe Frnch dip, a cup of coffee and a Philippe slice of meringue pie and all is well in the world for me. . . Philippe's is an LA treasure and landmark. May it never go away.
