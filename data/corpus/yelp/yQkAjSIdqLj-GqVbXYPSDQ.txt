this place is really cute and everything.. but i didnt feel like the ice cream was WOW.. most of the stuff was too sweet for me. everything was chocolate covered.. the ice cream sandwiches are unique because instead of a cookie on the outside its more like a macaroon or meringue cookie.. which i liked.. but i didnt like the lady bug one because it was.. strawberry sorbet inside.. and i ususally want the more dairy creamy ice cream inside.. i'd recommend the vanilla ice cream sandwich or the coffeee tofee one.. i didnt like the strawberry shortbread ice cream stick.. cuz it was white chocolate covered.. it was WAY too sweet.. i wish i tried some of the pastries there.. they looked really cute.
