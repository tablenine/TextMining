Category: Middle Eastern
Nice food in a cool atmosphere but the range of flavors is relatively limited.  After about 4 trips, you'll be pretty much "Reza'd-out".  The grilled mushroom appetizer alone is worth the trip.. . The all-you-can eat lunch buffet for $10 is a steal.  The only catch - it's always the same thing.. . Private parking lot available across Clark Street.
