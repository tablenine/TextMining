Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
For my first review on Yelp, I've chosen The Apple Pan. Sure, it's already got 569 reviews, but I wanted to start off on a wonderful note, and I wouldn't hesitate to give it another enthusiastic shout-out.  The hickory-smoked burger is the best diner burger I've ever had. The old-fashioned establishment--with oldie, but goodie servers--and old-school cash register just add to the awesome air (which sure smells good!) of this place.  Wait anxiously in line along the perimeter of the counter, pay that extra $ for the slice of cheese, and sip quickly from your paper cone of Coke. The experience (and that incredible patty) is undoubtedly worth the trip.
