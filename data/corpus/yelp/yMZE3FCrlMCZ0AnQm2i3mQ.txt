Patio was great, because of the weather. . . Server seemed lost, forgetful, and overwhelmed when it was not that busy. He was trying but not very good. . . The bodybuilder sandwich was excellent. . . The chicken soup served in a Rooster jar was creative but didn't pack too much flavor. . . The pizza was a good size for the 10 dollars, but felt like a ton of bricks afterwards. . . Great people watching, more of an upscale crowd. . . Overall, the service could have been sooooo much better and the there could have been more options for someone who wants to eat healthy non fried cheese drowned foods.. . The menu had some options, but it was more leaning towards creative type versions of what you already could get at a bar!
