We met the truck in Santa Fe Springs. Most of the people in line were first timers, like us, they didn't know what to expect. We waited in line for 1.5 hrs. The ambiguity of where the truck was going to park was half the battle, 2 lines formed: 1) on the street and 2) behind the Â 'secret' warehouse (ended up going with number 1). The guys on the truck were great, I even spoke to Chef Roy and Mark while I was waiting for our food. Roy complimented me on my "Jam On It" shirt - told me he used to pop to it back in the day. It's amazing how the guys that run the show aren't too proud to mingle with the common folk, even with their success. We ordered a few Korean Short Rib Tacos &amp; Burritos, which were well worth the wait.. . In the end, the experience was great, the service was fantastic and had an opportunity to meet some good people. It won't be our last visit, that's for sure.
