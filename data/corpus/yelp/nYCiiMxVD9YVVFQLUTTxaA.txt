Four words for you: Gunthorp Farm crispy chicken. Seriously, any incarnation of this chicken is sure to win over even the most picky palate. I even dream of it. No, really!. . This coffeeshop/resto/music venue is one of my favorite places to lounge, linger and relax. And, you'll breathe easier knowing everything is locally-sourced, organic and sustainable in most cases.. . Like to imbibe? Yeah, me too. Even drinking can be done with a conscience at Uncommon Ground! Check out their signature eco-cocktail, the Agripolitan (like the Metropolitan, only greener), or the super delightful lemon-ginger martini. These go down like candy-- don't say I didn't warn you!. . Gwyneth Paltrow thinks UG is cool, and so do I. Word.
