I'm sure I'm biased. When you've had Italian in New York and Boston, in some of the grubbiest joints in Little Italy and the North End, it's hard to rate a comparison with a posh celeb magnet on Melrose in Los Angeles. But guess what? Tough nuts, posh celeb magnet restauranteurs. You get the comparison. And does your food compare? It does not.. . For a 9 pm reservation (which got us seated at 9:30 - I totally call b.s. on that), I have to say our server was friendly, knowledgable and attentive. We had some nice wine - which I would expect from any decent restaurant at this point - and the mozzarella tasting, which was good but not earth-shattering. I had the raviolo, which was also good - and unusual, of course - but not monumental. I've had pizza in Brooklyn that gave me magic dreams, so my expectations are pretty high. I have to say I don't believe they were met.
