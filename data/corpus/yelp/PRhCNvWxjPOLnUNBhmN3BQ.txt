Best version of a torta milanese I've had in Chicago.. . There may be a heavy load of queso on these, but you can take some off if that doesn't appeal to you.. . The sauces, a great Â quacamole sauce in actual sauce form rather than the thick chunky mixture we're more used to in Chicago, and a mellow roaster pepper concoction that is also oilier than typical, are both great flavor enhancers without overpowering the rest of the food.. . These rolls are fantastic.
