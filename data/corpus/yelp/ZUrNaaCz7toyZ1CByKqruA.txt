We had reservation for 4 at 7pm on a Friday night. It was very easy to find street parking near the restaurant. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived but it started getting very crowded around 8pm.. . We had the crab cakes for appetizers, decent but small so a little on the pricey side. Nothing spectacular about them.. . I had the duck confit, that dish was very good. I loved the combination of all the flavors. A friend had the moules frites, it was an appetizer dish but perfect for someone who wasn't hungry. The fries were good!. . Wine list was good. We picked a bottle of cab but our waiter recommended something else, and it was good. . . Service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drink selections at the restaurant. Â He even took our coats and brought them back out when we were done with dinner. The exec. chef even came out at the end to talk to all the customers.. . Overall it's a cute place to either bring a date or meet with a group of friends.
