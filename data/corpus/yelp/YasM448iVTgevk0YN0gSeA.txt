I really enjoy coming to Rodan. Whenever someone is in town visiting, this is usually the spot I bring them too. It's small, intimate, not too loud, and you can usually find a place to sit and chat. It's definitely more of a loungey-type feel than a bar or club. Which is what makes it so appealing to me. It's good for a date, a girls night, or just with a friend to grab drinks. Any reason to come to Rodan is a good enough one for me. I've munched on their sweet potato fries (yum!) and their tempura fried green beans (more yum!). My favorite drink they serve their is Ketel One Cintron mixed with San Pellegrino Limonata and topped with a splash of the Belgian wheat beer, Allagash White. It is quite delicious.. . The service isn't anything great. I've never really felt that the bartenders/servers are very nice. They've run out of food and drink mixers more than once when I've been there. The woman's bathroom is pretty annoying... instead of a mirror they have a busted video camera that you can't see yourself in. Maybe cool when they opened, definitely not anymore. Time to fix that, ASAP. Â Either way, I keep going back and continue to enjoy the atmosphere.
