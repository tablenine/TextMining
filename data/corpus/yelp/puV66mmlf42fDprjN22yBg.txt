Went here for my 18th birthday expecting the world, only to find, that this place wasn't what I though it would be. I love the food, it is terrific! The service was not up to par with their pricing though. Also this place is cramped, very small and busy, not a relaxing environment at all. I did enjoy the decor and food, it was very trendy, but i don't think this place is what their website claims to be!. . Try it once for the good sushi!
