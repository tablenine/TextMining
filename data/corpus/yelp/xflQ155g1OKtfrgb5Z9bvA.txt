Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
Father forgive me, for I have sinned. It's been ... it's been a while since my last yelp in the city of Atlanta. . . What's that? My "real" sins? . . Well, I did commit *cough*adultery*cough*... but let's get to the important stuff here... . . I lusted for Barbeque, so I bowed down to yelp, my "false idol" of sorts, in search of the best 'que in Atlanta. After praying to the yelp gods who have come before me, the decision to go to Daddy D'z was an easy one. Boy were they right. The ribs were incredible, the bone fell right out they were so tender and perfect, I had the rib plate with the hot sauce, sides of candied yams and slaw. Not only was there a ton of food at a reasonable price, I hadn't had yams like this since I was a kid. The slaw was crisp, cool and flavorful and the ribs made me wanna slap your mama. . . I coveted, then stole a bit of my boyfriend's smoked turkey. I bore false witness when I told him that I hadn't, but secretly I was salivating for that smokey, tender bird. I think he could tell. . . What will be my penance, father? . . ... Father? Do I smell Barbecue sauce over there? I do! Â See? Now you're just as much of a barbecue sinner as me. I'm just gonna go tithe and say a few hail mary's be on my way. . . Oh, and I hope you got the cornbread... that little brick of honey and love is definitely where it's at.
