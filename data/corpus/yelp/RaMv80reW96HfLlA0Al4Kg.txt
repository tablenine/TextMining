As a lover of tapas restaurants in SF,  I tried this place on the Standard Hotels recommendation. While the service was very good it felt like dining in a hotel (seems typical of downtown dining in that area...surrounded by hotels). It's very oddly lit and seems like a cafeteria.. . I wasn't really impressed with the quality of the food either. Their sangria was also way too sweet and  I am queen of saccharine sangria!. . They have a lot of tables so i doubt there's ever much of a wait there. I would ask to sit outside tho for sure! 3 stars for close-ness to our hotel when nothing much else was around and the service not being bitchy.
