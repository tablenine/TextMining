The food is good but not amazing.  Aside from gigantic portions there really is nothing to it.  THe hamberger patti is flavorless.  The eggs are flavorless.  I don't know if they ever really season anything.  Don't get me wrong...it's a joint made for "cool" people but it's not amazing food.  Also, the wait staff always seems super busy and beware if you try to call-in a to go order!  Everytime I try to order for pick up they either put the phone down walk away until you finally hang up....or they tell you they are not doing any to-go orders because they are busy.. . It's whatever.
