I would totally recommend this place for a nice inexpensive un-complicated dinner.  Not super impressive looking but good food and friendly staff.  Causal type environment.  There is even a quite Japanese karaoke bar just around the corner (where isn't there one, lol).   It's called Nirvana and worth one visit if you want a low key night out.  But back to Shabu Shabu.  The food tastes fresh and once seated you don't have to wait around for service.   I'd go anytime if asked.
