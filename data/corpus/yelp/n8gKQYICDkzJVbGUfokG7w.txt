Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
The Thai Elvis is the big distinction at this place, but the food really measures up as well. Great Thai dishes, at great prices. I cannot believe the peole who knock the service, as far as Thai restaurents go, you just can't expect doting and super-patient service. They get the job done and serve some fine food here. Less charm than the old location, but larger, cleaner, and easier to deal with.
