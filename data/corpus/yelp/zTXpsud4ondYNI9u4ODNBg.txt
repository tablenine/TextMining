Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
If you like dumplings and have never had a soup dumpling grab your GPS, jump in your car and head straight to Din Tai Fung Dumpling House in Arcadia. . . This place is crowded and deservedly so. The dumplings are delicious. So good that they have two restaurants in the same parking lot and they both are slammed with people. Ka ching $$$
