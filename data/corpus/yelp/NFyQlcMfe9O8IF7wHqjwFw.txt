This was the first of three dinners my sister and her husband arranged when we were in Chicago. Maybe my expectations were elevated based on their ravings, but I was just not that impressed. . . I had a caesar salad for a starter, and it was pretty good, but a fresh caesar isn't rocket science. In contrast, my entree, a lamb burger, looked like it had been cooked in a rocket engine--it was charred to the point of unpleasantness on the outside, but almost raw and kinda falling apart on the inside. I'm positive I could've done better myself on my trusty Weber.. . Nothing else about the meal really sticks out in my mind, which is not a good sign... when I enjoy a meal, I tend to remember it in detail for a long, long time.
