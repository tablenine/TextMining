I've been here a couple times before and had a pretty good experience.... WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED!!! Went last night... our drinks took 30 min!! A glass of wine and a beer....30 min! Really? Food was dissapointing.... As a vegetarian I asked them to leave the chicken off my dish, they still charged me full price for it. When I asked the waitress about it she said there was no way for her to ring it up without the chicken so I had to pay full price. Sounds fishy to me, and I felt ripped off. Noise level was rediculous, couldnt hear anything. Not a good date spot! I left unsatisfied, angry and with a headache!
