Had to check out the hype of this vietnamese-by-way-of-korean-chef cafe that tends toward the ever greening culinary world by serving natural and some organic dishes.. Yes, it's good. Yes, I'll go back.. Why I'm not crazy over it (hence the 3 stars) is that it's just too pricey for it's portions. I have no problems laying a frankie for a piece of steak, but damn, don't rice noodles come pennies to a kilo?!. One dish I wasn't thrilled over was the Mako Salad -- the beef was on the jerky side and hard to find in the bed of cabbage.. In all fairness though, I truly appreciate the greener restaurants and the cleanliness of the place enough to dine there again and fork over the hard earned cash.
