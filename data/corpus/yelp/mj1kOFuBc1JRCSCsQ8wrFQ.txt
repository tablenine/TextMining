Category: American (New)
Lunch for two:. . - Zucchini Frittes. - the open face sandwich. - stuffed french toast. * cappucino. * soy chai latte. . Hands down the best thing was the soy chai latte. Obviously people go here to be "scene" and not for the food. The food is extremely average, the service is a smidgen below par ... all it can rely on is the fact is in a prime spot.. . Sorry, won't be back anytime soon.
