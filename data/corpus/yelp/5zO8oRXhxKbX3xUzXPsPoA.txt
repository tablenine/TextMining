This restaurant has become for me something that I dream about during the week. I have eaten here close to 8 times in the last 2 weeks.. . So few restaurants in LA can come close to what is achieved here. Their Hainan chicken is just so good, it's good enough to sit next to many of the restaurants that I love in Hong Kong and Toronto.. . Waitresses are very friendly - kind of like your older aunt and crazy cousin - abrupt and eccentric in the best possible mix. Hainan Chicken may not look so amazing but man, it is fantastic, chili sauce and ginger is superb. Rice was amazing as well. . . Great value, fast and courteous service, nice patronage. Would move on top if they rented!. . Only complaint, it closes too early. They should get an evening staff and stay open until 2 AM.
