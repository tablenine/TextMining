This one's a true five stars.  RFD has impressed me as a foodie (better word?) and inspired me as a home cook.. . I'm not vegetarian but would be as excited to eat here as I would a steakhouse.  The monthly specials are ecletic and delicious and freaking kick ass. The basics are so good too - I lost it when I tried the mashed p's &amp; gravy.  Juice, soup, nachos, I can't seem to find anything I don't like. The nori maki is a little dry, but at least you know it's good for you!  The menu covers such a big range, all my friends have their own favorite. . . Mouth's watering as I type.. . Ann Gentry is so cool to publish all their recipes in the RFD Cookbook. I made the RFD burger for my coworkers to their delight. Gravy is next.. . Lastly, the weHo location's got an interesting crowd. A friend &amp; I turned to see an incredibly handsome man getting seated at the next table, and she clued me in that it was Orlando Bloom. A lady friend joined him, and we figured out she was a Victoria's Secret model. Tee hee.
