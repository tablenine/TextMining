Dinner was amazing! My friend took me here for my birthday. We each  started with the bone marrow flan,  and then we each had the Japanese Wagyu rib eye with the side of sweet white corn. UNBELIEVABLE!! The meat melted in my mouth like butter! Every bite I took was like a party in my mouth. Even my cocktail ( I can't remember which one, had one too many) was amazing! har har.... I would definitely dine here more often if it didn't cost SO much! My friend spent $600 for two! sheesh! But nonetheless, it was an AMAZING experience!
