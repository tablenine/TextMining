We didn't have a reservation. They seated us since it was very early, around 5 pm., before the dinner rush. So far so good, except for the clearly annoyed behavior of the people seating us. My pasta was average. My date later told me that he later got sick and wondered if it might of been food poisoning. The service was good. Eating outside on the patio was nice. I was rushing my meal because I didn't want to take up any more real estate so, I can honestly say that it was not an overall good experience. It was just okay. Too bad. I really wanted to like it.
