Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Some girl, in a review before this one, mentioned her frustration with people calling this place by the wrong name. It's not Hide like "Hide and go seek." It's Hide, pronounced "Hee-day." That had me on the floor, cuz I feel her pain.. . Hide is apparently not as much of a secret as it once was. This is obvious when looking at the waitlist, during peak lunch and dinner hours. The place is TINY, so if you're not there before the crowds show up, you might be in for quite a wait. (Hence the subtraction of one star) You can avoid this by ordering on the phone and taking it to go, but let's be honest, part of the fun of a sushi experience is sitting at the bar and asking, "What's good today? I trust your judgment, chef... Omakase." Translated, I believe Omakase means, "I'm in your hands." And sushi chefs relish these words; this is when they shine. Trust and honor are a big part of Japanese culture. . . Hide, aside from having reliably good sushi, has GREAT (and comparably affordable) lunch specials. Yes, that's right... Japanese lunch specials. Anomalous. I usually get the Teriyaki steak, served with tsukemono, rice, and tempura. Off the chain. . . If you do plan on a visit, don't be discouraged if you have to wait. There are plenty of cool shops along Sawtelle, which will make the wait fly by. It's also a great place just to people watch. Parking can be rough, but if you're willing to walk a bit, there's plenty of parking to be had in the neighborhood surrounding the Sawtelle area. My family has been coming here for decades, and they know us by name. I plan on keeping that tradition alive. Thumbs up, for sure.
