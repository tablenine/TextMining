Once upon a time I was a Vegan and it was all thanks to Real Food Daily,my vegan roommates and that LA culture is all about performing your best, feeling your best and looking your best.... . I promise you won't miss animal products when you eat here!. . Orgasmic food that's healthy for you while you star-gaze make this place a must visit.. . When I think of sunsets on Santa Monica, Miracle Mile and the La Brea Tarpits I'm usually reminded of awesome food.. . This is one of the places you want to visit weekly.. . The Raw Juice Bar is also super awesome here.
