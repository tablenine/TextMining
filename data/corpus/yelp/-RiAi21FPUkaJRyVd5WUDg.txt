Eric is my practice partner, for many different things.  Yesterday we practiced drinking Zaya's $3 vodka mixed drinks.  I was very happy about that and the conversation gets so much more interesting with alcohol on the cheap.  . . Outside of the daily drink deals and half-off appetizers from 5-7 Monday-Thursday, the food was pretty good.  Eric has eaten similar food in Israel and it met his standard.  We both got variations of schwarma, which was pretty tasty and came in fairly large portions.  For sides, the french fries were small and dried up, but the yogurt dip and baba ghanuj were well done.  Plus, the free pita and dip appetizer was awesome.
