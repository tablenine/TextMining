A++ The parmesan fries were the bomb-diggity.. . A++ The service was great. And quick. . . B The beer selection seemed pretty good.. . C+ The ambiance is trying to be cool, but comes off like a hospital (the teal and tan I think cause this) . . . C The burgers were ok. Lacking flavor, even with all the toppings I thought would be flavorful/spicy.
