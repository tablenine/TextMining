Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
I love expensive places where you get FOOD for your money. I hate emptying my wallet and then leaving without a full and happy stomach. The Hungry Cat has good sized portions for their price. I love the ambiance, but hate that it is so tucked away into the little corner that it is. Even after reading that it was hard to find, we walked up and down the block twice before finding it. Just a tip: It is tucked away in a short dead end alley. . . On to the food! We shared a dozen oysters: 6 carlsbad and I can't remember the name of the other one. They were both good, but the carlsbad was slightly saltier. I guess that is a preference type judgment, but I just love oysters so I wasn't complaining. I had the pug burger based on rave yelp reviews. So I was hesitant to order a burger at a seafood place, but I did anyway. I was happy with my burger - it was deliciously juicy and so large that it had to be eaten with a fork and knife. The bf had the alaskan king crab leg, which didn't look like such a large portion, but somehow crab meat kept coming out of the bowl. His dish was absolutely amazing - awesome butter sauce with fresh crab. . . Service was attentive for the most part. I'm really glad I had a dinner experience here. Warning: major food coma may result from eating at the Hungry Cat!!!
