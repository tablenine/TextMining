if only I could eat like this everyday... some of the best sushi I have ever had! so clean, so flavorful and decently priced too. I had the 8 piece nigiri, mackerel and yellowtail. so so good. the service was really friendly and the chefs were nice enough to answer my questions about what was what. my only gripe was that the sushi rice was a little over seasoned. like it had too much vinegar or lemon juice in it. other than that it was pure satisfaction.
