we went here because they are offering a free meal for those people who celebrates their birthday on October! So here i am lined up with my friend taking advantage of that shit and we ordered some extra pizza. One thing that sucks is that they charged us twice for our corkage but we only have 1 bottle of wine that we brought. I was like whatever we got free entrees. I don't know how come this place is famous. They got good pastries though. but i will not even go back here for their entree. but i might for some shit that's hard to find cause they have a mini grocery store. . . shut up!
