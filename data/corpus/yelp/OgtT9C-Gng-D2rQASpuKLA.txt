Im usually here for dinner or some late nite chow. i don't think Ive ever ordered the same thing from the menu ever, their menu selection is HUGE!!! This place is always packed and we usually have to wait to get seated but not too long. Â Everything Ive always tried has been great and I've never had any complaints...I also appreciate that there are vegan and vegetarian options available so it makes it a great place to eat because there is always something for everyone! I will continue coming back :)
