WHAT?? I CAN'T HEAR YOU.  Because I'm still deaf from the damn band at loca luna.  Holy crap that place is loud, it's like being at a concert.. . Anywhoo, if you are looking for a scene, this place seems pretty good actually.  Plenty of women, can't really say about the guys cause I wasn't looking.. . I visited for a birthday celebration, but the people I was hanging out with don't really drink and don't really dance, so it wasn't the best place for us.. . Food wise, that's where the 3 stars comes from.  No reason to go here for the food, overpriced tapas, that aren't bad, but not worth the trip and craziness.  The asparagus were actually pretty good though, fish eh it was actually decent, but again, pricey small portions, nothing special.. . Worst part was waiting for the tacos that almost never arrived.  I think it took literally about 20-25 min after I got my tapas before the last guy's tacos showed up - there were 4 of us.  Ah it happens, but still this place is a mad house.. . If I wanted a place to pick up chicks, I guess I would head here, but I don't think a bar type place is the best for such activities.  Although the one random horribly drunk girl I ran into said I looked like Jason Mraz, which I guess is a compliment, which means I should go back and look for crazy drunk chicks??!  Wow, maybe I should give this place 5 stars.
