I like this place. A friend suggested to go to Los Feliz for some cheap eats, and so we ended up at Fred 62. Our waiter was friendly, and we got our meals pretty much right away. . . I got the BLLTA and it was good. I ordered a side salad with a balsamic vinaigrette which was strong. I liked it, but my friend didn't. I would've loved to try their desserts or milkshakes due to the past reviews, so I'll have to make multiple trips so I can also try their brunch options.
