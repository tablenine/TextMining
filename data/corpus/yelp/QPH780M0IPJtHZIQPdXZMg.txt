Loved the burrata w/bacon and sauteed shallots and escarole.. . -Loved the tagliatelle with oxtail ragu. . -The sauce of early girl tomatoes, garlic, and breadcrumbs on the Maccheroni was very nice, very fresh and vivid flavor -- I don't usually like tomato sauces at all. . -The ricotta &amp; egg ravioli (yes, singular) is enormous and frankly just not special except for the presentation -- it's like eating a big lump of fresh ricotta (which is delicious, ok) with butter. I would skip that ravioli and go with another pasta instead.. . The guinea fowl with liver and pancetta sauce was good but I didn't taste much liver flavor, which I was really looking forward to. . . The bombolini with lemon crema were excellent (although the bombolini I've had in the past have been much lighter/airier). The boysenberry Â crostata-like thing was really nice- great vivid fresh fruit flavors and the crust had sesame in it, but I'd rather eat a bowl of berries and save on the calories, personally.
