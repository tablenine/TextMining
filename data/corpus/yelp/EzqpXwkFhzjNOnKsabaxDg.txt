Restaurant: Sun In My Belly
Category: Caterers
What an appropriate name for such a blissful Â place! Eating here is indeed like the warm blissful sun kissing your belly. I have ate a broad array of yummy items from here. I have experienced items from the Kirkwood breakfast, Challah French Toast, Shrimp and Grits and quiche of the day to the lunch items consisting of my favorites including the Fanta Se Salad, the Venus and Geisha and my favorite,The Tuscan Sandwich. I also really enjoy the orzo pasta as a side. All of their food is beautifully pulled together by fresh ingredients and neat combination's that you might otherwise find at a restaurant for 3 times the money. The atmosphere is very appealing and service is great. Nestled in the Kirkwood neighborhood right between Decatur and Atlanta, This up and coming area is THE place to be. I miss you Sun in my belly. I will come again soon!
