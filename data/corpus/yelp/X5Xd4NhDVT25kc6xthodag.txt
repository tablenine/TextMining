Soooooo... I friend of mine had been pushing and pushing for me to try this place out so on my home I give it a try... . . First thing I didnt like...... I had to wait in line to longggggg to place my order, took around 20 mins or so then once that was complete another 30mins before I received my order... The food didn't come out together my friend received her food 10 mins before I received my shrimp po boy, which couldnt have take that long to make... really guys this is something that needs to be work on.... . . Other then that , the food was great!!! Â I love the freshness of the seafood I mean with that alone I think they should receive 5 stars.... . . I tried a couple of things, I had the fried catfish, the hush puppies, the slaw, fried oysters with fries, (I didn't really care for the those, I think if they were fresh cut fries, that would make them a lot better) and of course the shrimp po boy.... (hmmm hmm good) . . So I think my suggestion next go round would be to call ahead and place your order, that way when you pull up your order is already coming from the back.
