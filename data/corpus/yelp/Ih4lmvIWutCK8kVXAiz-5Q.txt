Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
After I finally did my review, I went down to Roscoe's.  The first wonderful thing I noticed was that the place had doubled in size.  Yes, I hadn't been in over two years, which is when the change took place.  So, it's no longer quite the hole in the wall it was and that's a good thing.  The wait, I'd imagine, isn't quite as bad as it used to be.  I went just after the lunch crush and got right in.  I had what I always have - the Carol C.  That's one fried chicken breast and one waffle.  First off, their chicken breasts are HUGE - the June Wilkinson of chicken breasts.   They almost seem like mutant chicken breasts, but all that matters is the taste, and it's simply the best fried chicken in LA (and most other places).  It's so succulent and wonderful and I ate every bit of it.  Their waffles have a unique flavor that I just love.  I slather it with butter, extra syrup, and it's just perfect.  I also had one of their great biscuits (with yet more slathered butter), and some potato salad.  After I was sated but felt great.  As you kids say, Roscoe's is the bomb.  Well, I think you kids said that about ten years ago - I need an update on my lingo - I'm so yesterday.
