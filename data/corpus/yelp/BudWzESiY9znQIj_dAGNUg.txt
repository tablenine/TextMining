Restaurant: Joe&#39;s On Juniper
Category: Gay Bars
I had finished up with a miserable dentist's visit and had the rest of the day to myself.  My little mobile web showed an interesting spot so I set my navigation on and followed the directions to Joe's on Juniper.. . I'm always amazed at how these little gems are tucked in and around unexpected places in downtown Atlanta.. . A clear sunny and warm/cool day on the patio seemed A-Ok.  Then the blasted drilling and blowhorns started across the way.  According to my server, this misery across the way was been going on for quite some time.  I feel so sorry for the workers!  6 stories of construction below ground and then multiple stories above and it's not done yet!. . I digress.  My Border Veggie burger was awesome.  I'm not a total vegetarian, btw.  I just like the feeling of being full without being dragged down by what I ate.. . Joe's doesn't rely on Morningside Farm for their veggie burgers.  They make their own!  It's so good!   And, they have Guinness on tap!  Boo on the fact that they didn't serve mine in the traditional Guinness glass. . . This place looks like it can get crazy on a Friday/Saturday night.  Count me out.  That parking area they have looks like a surefire way to bring on a bad mood and attitude during peak hours.. . Oh, if you go, don't sit under a tree.  Ha!  Is that possible?  I did and got bird poop on my top.  Yay!!!!
