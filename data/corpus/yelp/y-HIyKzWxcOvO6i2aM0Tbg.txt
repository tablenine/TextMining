Restaurant: Tia Pol
Category: Tapas Bars
I came to Tia Pol on a recent trip to NYC with my boyfriend, his uncle and a few of his uncle's friends.  It's very small but has a great feel and the food was delish.  This is where I had squid ink for the very first time, and, although I had a slight allergic reaction to it, it was heavenly.  Be sure to get the roast piglet and the croquettes.  Other stellar things on the menu are the razor clams and the blood sausage.  I could definitely see myself here for a happy hour and not leaving for 4 hours because of good food, drink and ambiance. Great first date place.
