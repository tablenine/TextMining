Something actually fun to do in the burbs?  You got it.  This is the place to go.  But definitely get there early.  It is small and it gets VERY BUSY.  Parking is a bit of mess before valet gets there at 4pm.  And you WANT to get there before 4pm.  Even on a Sunday afternoon it gets crowded - therefore, minus one star for parking.  . . Other than that - great drinks (very reasonably priced!), fun bartenders and some serious eye candy can be found at PURE any day of the week.  The food is good and reasonably priced too.  But bottom line for me - a fun place to go in the burbs earns 4-stars in my book.  Check it out!
