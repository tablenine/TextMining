Last Friday I went to Katz's Deli in NY and had a pastrami sandwich, cream soda, french fries and pickles.. . This Friday, I went to Langer's for a #19 with french fries and a cream soda, and of course, pickles.. . Katz's wins in french fries and interesting-NY-experience departments.  Hell, even their cream soda was better (dr browns) but let's get real here.  The Langer's #19 stole the show, and this competition isn't about sodas and french fries, it's about the better pastrami sandwich.. . there you have it.  a side by side comparison within a reasonable time frame.. . now, if only i could get the french fries at katz's to be served with my langer's #19... except i'm pretty sure that's what heaven is, so i'll have to wait it out.
