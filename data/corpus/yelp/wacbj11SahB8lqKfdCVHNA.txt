Very trendy, chic and stereotypically Californian.  I discovered this place from The Hills and Entourage and I'm completely glad I did!  Although the parking and waiting for a seat can be a bitch~ the food is totally worth it.. . My personal favorites:. . Chicken Chow Salad. The Portobello Omelet with egg whites. The Favorite Omelet with egg whites. Lattes. Blended Banana Mocha. . I love sitting outside for brunch and catch up with my girlfriends.  I've also seen a few celebrities there, which has added to the experience.  Sometimes the waiters are hard to flag down and the food can take its sweet time~ but overall, this is a definite MUST place to try.
