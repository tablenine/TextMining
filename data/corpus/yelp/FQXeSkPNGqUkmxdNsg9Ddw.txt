Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
I love that the menu is simple and small (that usually means it serves something really good, and just banks on that). . I hated that the place was so tiny and compact. . I loved the two dressings for their chef's salad (which seems to be their main sell point) and also their flatbeard, which was amazing. Remember to use the salad dressing for that. A great pita like texture, with plenty of garlic and herbs. . I did not really like the pizza, which was unique (upside down pizza), but tasted simple. I loved the big whole mushrooms, but not the small pieces of sausage. I love my sausage BIG. . Overall though, for the prices and the quality, the place is awesome. I heard the wait is horrendous on weekend nights. So come at a better time. We came on a Saturday afternoon, and only needed to wait 15 min. Loved the food!!!. . Buy the dressings for $6 a bottle too. I didn't, but I regret it already.
