My daughter loves the petite brownies.  This place is always bustling with the hip crowd.  It has delicious food to go.  I haven't dined in because it always seemed so crowded, but the food is awesome. The pastries are superb.. . Be prepared to eat high calorie/ high fat content food.  But it is delicious.
