Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Friends were here from California and I had heard that Joy's was the "best" Thai.  We all decided this was better than our favorite Thai in California... which we thought was good!  We loved the Panang, like everyone else.  The bbq pork with ginger gravy was amazing, the wide noodle dish we had was good.  Each dish had it's own unique flavor and were distinct from one another.  The chicken was not "weird" like many other Thai restaurants and the tofu was really good too.  The veggies were fresh and the flavors were just awesome.  So glad this place is two blocks away... this is now our new fav.
