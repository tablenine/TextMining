I've never been so influenced by parking at a restaurant before.  I had a couple hours to kill before meeting up with some friends for dinner at this fabulous Greek restaurant.  I thought to myself... "Sigh... Traffic sucks in L.A., parking sucks in L.A.  I'll probably end up just cruising around getting lost in L.A., wasting my fuel away."  I was proven wrong.  I arrived to find tons of free parking.  I was able to rest, take a nap and go over my work benefits without any intrusion or hassle.  It didn't hurt that it was a nice breezy day too.  The ample amount of free parking in the rear on a weeknight was enough to make my Lamb Chops taste 10x better.  Free Swig of Wine &amp; Cheese + Nose Up in the Air Aroma + Friendly Family Service + Legit Greek Food = True Love that would make Aphrodite gain 100lbs.  Don't forget some Hummos &amp; Pita to go!
