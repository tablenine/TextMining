Most places fail to impress me just because they're in a high location overlooking a beautiful view, but a view that changes within the hour makes for a very memorable dining experience coupled with great food, service, and decor. The food, while somewhat spendy, is delightfully prepared featuring a splendid presentation. Service was fantastic, our waiter was humorous and offered to tell us about the buildings around Atlanta. The decor was filled with paintings, odd shapes, and sphere-like ornaments to emphasize the "sundial" theme, which was very new age but subtly done. This place should be a must visit for all visitors to Atlanta!
