GF tried the Cactus salad and it was kind of disgusting.  It was slimy and didn't taste very good.  Probably should have sent it back, there was probably something wrong with it..  Didn't help that she felt sick the whole night afterward.  We still make cracks about how nasty it was.. . I had the fajitas which were good, but not good enough to be able to convince her to ever go back!
