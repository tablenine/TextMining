Jewbulant.. . How the *f* does this not get 5 stars? . Seriously? What would you change about this joint?. What can be improved upon?. . Plop yourself into a booth that squeaks, say hello to the sassy gals taking your order, and enjoy yo'self.. . Eat pastrami.. Slurp the matzoh ball soup (no carrots HOORAY!). Chow down some stuffed cabbage and toot your way to happy tummy heaven. . Pickles? All you can scarf. Â . Latkes to cut a man over.. Kugel of the G-Ds.. . If Canter's isn't five stars, the entire Yelp system should be abolished.
