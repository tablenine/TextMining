**Sigh**. . This is my consecutive pho review I've written today.  As mentioned in my review for Pho Hoa here in SF...I count on pho as a hang over cure, which 90% of the time does work.  The other 10% is spent cursing myself for making it too spicy and taking a turn for the worse.. . My visit to Pho Cafe is no different.  After a night of heavy metal music and whiskey...I had to find pho and fast!  I heard about this place through a friend and it was right around the corner from her apt.  A huge plus since more than 10 minutes in the hot L.A. sun might have killed me in my deadly hang over state.. . The minute our server put the bowl in front of me...I was confronted w/ my noodle pet peeve once again: too much noodle, not enough broth.  I also found the broth to be less savory than most.  Maybe not enough star anise? . . I like that this place is in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it strip mall w/ no restaurant sign...it weeds out crowds.. . But hey...Ellen Pompeo was slurping away at it when I came in, so I guess if Dr. Grey approves it's not all lost?. . Just kidding. I've had better.
