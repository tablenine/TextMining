Nice seafood restaurant out in the SGV.  They're known for their lobster and, from first hand experience, it's easy to see why.  Although my lobster was overcooked (which was disappointing to say the least), it was very flavorful (think garlic and lots of it) and there was plenty of meat to go around.  Their geoduck is also excellent.. . As some of these other reviews have pointed out, MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH!  They do not take credit cards.  This is a pretty big drawback in my opinion because this restaurant isn't exactly cheap.. . With regard to the service, I must say that it was exceptional.  The staff was friendly and, unlike most Chinese restaurants, was not in a hurry to get us out of there.  . . 4 stars for Newport Seafood.
