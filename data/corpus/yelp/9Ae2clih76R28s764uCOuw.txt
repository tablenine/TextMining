I was fiddling as always and came across this place on Yelp, so knowing the outgoing me I decided to give this place a try. I went in and the atmosphere was almost like a Johnny Rocket's. The customer service sucked..not too friendly. I ordered the cheeseburger with American cheese, fries, and a drink. In that case it became a combo meal for $8.65. You get a number and they serve you your food. I decided to eat outside and my burger was so so..not that tasty..beef patty really thick..fries dry and bland..needs Lawry seasoning..and the only sad thing I fell in love with was the Crimson ice tea..caffeine free..fruity, tarty,and so refreshing with a lot of ice.
