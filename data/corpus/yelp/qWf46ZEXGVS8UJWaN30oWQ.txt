What can be said about the Oinkster that hasn't already been said? Personally I love the burgers and the pulled pork sandwich. I love the fries but I have noticed recently they are kind of hit and miss.... . My only complaint other than that is sometimes it gets crazy packed especially now that they are advertising....but overall four solid stars. Great beers on tap too :)
