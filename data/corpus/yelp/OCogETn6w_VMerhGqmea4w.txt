My friend Mariko is the cutest preggers chick on the planet. She's actually VERY preggers, as in she was due on the 13th and yesterday was the 16th... so needless to say, she's ready to pop at any hour. She is also one of only two people I know who actually live in the city of Glendale. . . Since she and her husby invited me over for the afternoon, I decided that this would be my perfect excuse to swing by this bakery to pick up some goodies... . . The Damage: . Potato Balls. Amazing! Think of croquettes stuffed with savory meat &amp; sauce. I could have eaten 15 of these! . . Chorizo Pies: Not really huge fan but my friend's husby enjoyed these . . Chicken Empanadas: Perfecto, delicioso... the filling was excellent with diced chicken and finely diced fresh vegetables . . Ham &amp; Cheese Croquettes: Not so much . . Guava &amp; Cheese Pastry: Dangerous... loved the guava paste that paired so well with the cheese inside caressed with a wonderful puff pastry. This has got to be at least 15,000 calories. . . Other items I picked up were the California Fruit Tart, Dolce De Leche Napoleon (phenomenal) and a Mango Pudding Tart. . . It's imperative for me to see to it that Mariko's unborn lil girl is very well fed before she even enters the world ;) I actually kinda envy her that she will be growing up 10 minutes away from Portos! Lucky little devil!
