Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Service was HORRIBLE.  had the energy and attentiveness of a baby that's been up for 14 hours straight.  the bus boy was basically our waiter.  had to ask for bread because we were jealous of every other table that had it but us.  ended up regretting that request as it tasted like it was bought at costco about 4 months ago.  oil used to dip said braid into was watery without any flavor, probably the cheapest and lowest quality they could find.  entree's were entirely mediocre and extremely overpriced.  . . this place is about as authentic italian food as olive garden, except the garden's breadsticks are probably better.
