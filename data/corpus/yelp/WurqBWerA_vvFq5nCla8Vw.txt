Nice concept, lots of different interesting choices. Long wait, so make sure you have a lot of time. I'd give this place a 3.5 ... generously rounded up to a 4.  I ordered the Austin one... it's sounds a lot better than it tasted, it was a little to salty for me, and I couldn't really taste the tri-tip. I also had the bockwurst, which was a little better. It's quite flavorful with veal taste. My friends also order a few other ones. I didn't try the exotic ones because I'm not into food that's "different". I heard the rattlesnake was good. I did enjoy the Filipino one, and sundried tomato one. The fries were okay, but the dipping sauces was what stood out. I loved the curry ketchup and also the bleu cheese, walnut one. All the flavors were distinctive, but also came well to together. Overall, it's a nice place to check out once, and nice place to drink so beers, but I wouldn't really go out of my way to come back.
