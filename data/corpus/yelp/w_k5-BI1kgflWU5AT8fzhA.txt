Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
After all the hype people were giving me about this place, I finally went to it. And after a 30 minute wait, I was finally able to get in and get seated at the bar. Now I have to say the wait staff were great, very nice and personable. . . My friend and I ordered the chicken liver pate, lasagna, and the fennel sausage pizza.  I really didn't like the pate but I can't blame the restaurant for that.  I just don't like chicken live much.  . . I am also not a huge fan of lasagna but this one was great.  It was just the right balance between cheese, pasta, and noodles.  But the star of this restaurant is their pizza.  The fennel sausage pizza was great!  It was a bit greasy but it was great.  I'd go back to get more of their food.. . If I can give a hint.  go early and go sit at the bar...
