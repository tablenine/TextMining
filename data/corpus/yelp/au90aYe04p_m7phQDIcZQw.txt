Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This may rank as one of my favorite Japanese restaurants ever, and I do my best to seek out good Japanese food / sushi when I travel. A lot of people in Atlanta get hung up on MF and other similar places that seem to put more emphasis on appearance and being the new hip-spot. Taka is concerned with the only thing a restauranteur should be concerned with, and that's the quality of the meal and the satisfaction of his customers.. . In the five years since I have been back in Atlanta I have become a regular at Taka Sushi and Passion, both for the quality of the food and the personality of Taka himself. This is by far one of my favorite experiences in Atlanta and I always look forward to my returns there.. . I'd make menu recommendations but I have yet to have Taka prepare anything that I didn't enjoy.
