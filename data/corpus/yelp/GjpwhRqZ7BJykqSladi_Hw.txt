Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Wow! People weren't kidding when they said Father's Office had the best burgers! I love the atmosphere, and outdoor patio seating. Great to sit outside on a warm night. Service is great. . . My only complaint is that it's really overpriced for burgers (about $14 for a burger and fries)... even if the burgers are amazing! I wasn't expecting to pay that much for burgers... maybe $10 max, but not more than that.
