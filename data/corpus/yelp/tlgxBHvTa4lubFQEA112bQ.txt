Restaurant: Zuma Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Thus far, some of the best nigiri and sashimi I've had in our fair city has been from Zuma.  In fact, I would be happy to five-star 'em if it weren't for the inconsistent service and portions.. . The waitresses, clad in black and red kimono inspired digs, are....pouty.  And while the gals are pretty, it comes off less sexy and more like their dogs just died.  Sometimes we get lucky though and the host waits our table--he's attentive, friendly, and pout free.. . My primary complaint is the starkly inconsistent portion sizes!  It's hard to tell whether the beau and I get shafted when we order the Sushi and Sashimi Deluxe, or whether he just always gets star treatment when he orders it with someone else.  But the bottom line is this:  We order it, we get a fair amount of succulent morsels--enough to be content, but not fully satiated.  When he dines with someone else (the same menu item, mind you!), he sends me incessant texts about the mountains of delicious sashimi he's scarfing down, "2 much 2 finish!" and "so full!"  What the...are you kidding me?!. . So while I highly recommend their product, and really do think the fish is fresh and delicious, I'll personally feel better about eating here when I don't have to wonder whether I'm getting the wrong end of the stick.
