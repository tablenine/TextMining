A bad year thus far, I realize I've totally neglected my duties as a friend. I decide to do a little making up by planning a small gathering with my chicas.. . We head to Wasabi. This place is pretty small. I think there is only room for about 2 large parties (meaning about 6 to 7 people per party) and then more intimate seating for couples. Now shame on me, I read the review which said not good for groups but I thought I'd see first hand (plus the other girls were also to my knowledge Wasabi virgins and I wanted all of us to experience it together).. . I like that we were seated although the entire party wasn't there, some places are really against that. Our waitress was cute as a button. I had the X-rated rockstar which was rockin'. I liked how the bathroom walls were a chalkboard, and I loved leaving a little piece of the Sexy 6 on the walls =).. . Drawbacks, it took the food awhile to come out, it was pretty good so I can't complain too much. The waitress was totally clueless about how to break out the check, which leads to my #1 pet peeve. When it's a group larger than 2 you SHOULD ALWAYS ask if the check is going to be split. . . Overall I really enjoyed the intimate environment and the opportunity to have a nice dinner with the girls. For this fact alone I give this place 4 stars.
