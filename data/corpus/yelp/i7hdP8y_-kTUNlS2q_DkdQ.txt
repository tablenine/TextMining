Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
After reading several reviews in various magazines, feeling home sick in need of some good food in a vegetarian friendly establishment (or so I read), I opted for smoke daddy.  . . For starters this place doesn't hold a candle to home (Texas) BBQ, in the land of cattle, they still make excellent vegetarian food.  In contrast, smoke daddy did not, they simply through a pre-made boca burger on the grill.  The homemade BBQ chips had no flavor, until i dipped them in the BBQ sauces (which were pretty tasty).  I was very disappointed, my root beer was good and that was about it.  My friends had the chicken, which looked moist, but was very dry.  They also had the rib tips, you get a lot, but again they lacked in BBQ seasoning and flavor.. . I definitely don't recommend this place if you are vegetarian or if you have had real BBQ before.
