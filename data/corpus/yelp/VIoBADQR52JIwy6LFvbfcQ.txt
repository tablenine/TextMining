Hand's down this is the best, by far the best pizza I have ever had.  When going here, you must order the butter crust pizza and please for the love of god do yourself a favor and if you like sausage at all, make it one of your ingredients.. . I've gone there during the day and during the evening (on weekdays) and have never had any wait whatsoever.  The pizza takes a little while to cook, but it is surely worth it, so sit back and order a couple drafts and let the good times roll.. . I recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially someone who has never had a true Chicago Style Pizza.  My mouth is watering, just writing this.
