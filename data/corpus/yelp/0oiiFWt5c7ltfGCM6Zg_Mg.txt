Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
dont get me wrong. roscoe's is really good, but its just chicken and waffles! it's definitely worth a try, but you'll agree with me afterwards. you'll be walking out of the restaurant saying, "it was good, but it's just chicken and waffles!" i mean come on how special can chicken and waffles be?
