I like this place more than the SM location. They have the best sweet potato fries in the planet. I have not found a place that can compete with it. They bring them in cute containers and GARLIC ALOLI (i always ask for two because the aloli is that good YUM!). Now for the big daddy, the office burger this burger is huge but very delicious. I could never finish it. Its one of the top five burgers that I have ever eaten. The only qualm I have with this place is its selection of Belgium Beers. I wish that St. Bernardus and the Duchess were on tap only then I would become a regular.
