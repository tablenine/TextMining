I really wanted to like this place after reading the reviews, but I wasn't blown away.  Sure, the decor is nice and with the white/orange combination, it creates an inviting space.  However, the tables are a bit too close for my comfort.. . Servers were attentive and on top of their game.. . Food was a hit or miss.  My friend's appetizer was fabulous.  I was a bit torn about what to order and asked the server for his opinion btw. two dishes.  He chose their signature Ping Pong Chicken.  It's basically chicken stir fried w/ vegetables and honey roasted walnuts.  While it wasn't horrible, it lacked flavor.  . . This will definitely be on top of my list should I be in the area again bc friends have found a few dishes they love there and I'm hoping they win me over too.
