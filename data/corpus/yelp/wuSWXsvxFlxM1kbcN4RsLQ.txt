The Bears and i had a hankering for lobster, and so we asked for a tip and received one from a panda who sent us out to San Gabriel -- so we braved the 10 East through downtown, followed a blue ball from Mrs. Bear's iphone map, and arrived at Newport Tan Cang. Since it was only an hour or so before closing on a weekday night, we didn't have to wait for a table and were immediately seated. The service was brisk and all I can really remember now is falling face first into a heaping plate of fresh lobster. Sure, we tried some other dishes -- one vegetable and another with chicken -- they were good -- but the highlight is clearly the lobster. You can pretty much binge on the shellfish here and avoid the fortune that most seafood restaurants will charge you. Warning though that it's awfully messy to eat, and probably tips the sodium scale a little toward the unhealthy side, but really, how often do you eat lobster? New Tan Cang is definitely worth a visit, and we're heading back for more...
