I wish that half stars were available, as this is really a 3.5.  In reality, I consider Naha to be a place to eat so that you can say you did it.  While the food is very good, the service leaves a bit to be desired.  I suggest this locale to see and be seen and have a nice dining experience, but don't expect to dream over the food.
