I don't know why this place has such a high rating because I am not a huge fan of excess oils and sauces to coat my bland vegetables and potatoes.  For a place that is supposed to advocate no meat products in any of its dishes, you would think that they would also advocate healthy eating! NOT the case for Native Foods.  I've gone here twice thinking that perhaps my first impressions of the place wouldn't be a fair assessment since it was after all only one dish out of many, which Native Foods has, that I tried - I should have kept to my first impressions.. In my first visit I ordered the Mad Cowboy bowl.  After only a few bites of just eating starch and vegetables in a heavy sauce I had to get a to-go bag because it was just too much of the same taste, texture and flavor being consumed - almost too overwhelming.  My coworkers who also accompanied me thought the exact same thing, and one of the coworkers was a vegan! In my second visit I got a chicken wrap and my friend (vegan) got a pizza during our lunch hour.  The chicken wrap was only so-so and the pizza was drenched with tons of oils which didn't make it very enticing.  The cardboard box that was given to store the leftover pizza was soaked with oil at the end of the day. Not the greatest place to eat with a big group and the price of fake meats is out of this world expensive. I'd rather pay for real meat with less oils.  I would not come back to this place and gave two stars instead of one since the restaurant does have "good intentions" to "eat healthy" with their foods cooked in tons of oil and lathered with sauces. I would not go for a third strike out! No more, please!
