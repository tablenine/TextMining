Best french dips in Los Angeles and the best prices too!! Tried Coles the other day to compare and Philippe's won hands down!! You can get a turkey, pork, lamb or beef dip and they are very reasonably priced! Under $7 or maybe $6 each dip! And the lemonade is outstanding for less than $1 a glass, the desserts are fresh and very reasonable as well. I don't think you can get a strawberry cheesecake slice anywhere else these days for the $2.85 they charge. I also love their tapioca pudding for $2 something. They always run out of turkey and their yummy chocolate layer cake early in the day so you have to make it in by 7/8pm for those! The rest. stays open til ten though! This is somewhere my boyfriend went with his parents as a kid and I really like than 20 years later this place is still the same. They are always consistent and always good. One of my favorite places to grab a $30 meal for 2 (with desserts) in town!
