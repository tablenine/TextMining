This place has such terrible service that i wouldn't even know what the food was like. We came in at 2am and were greeted by a host, who was more like a bouncer. Gave him my name and said table for 2, he replies go wait outside. Now it is cold outside, there are plenty of free tables. So i ask him why do we have to wait outside, his reply "because i said so." I ask him can't you just give us a table it's really cold outside. His reply "you guys are pricks for not following my rules unless you go outside i will not sit you." At this point he starts explaining to us that he is a cage fighter and that he is here to stop people from making trouble because it's Armenian genocide week. Â  I can't believe that not only does the restaurant hire people who don't give you good service, they are openly racist, and they go even further to insult you. I go up to a waitress to ask for a manager, she looks at the "bouncer" and replies to me there is no manager tonight. Magically two minutes later the manager appears talks to the bouncer and has a smug look on his face. I explain the situation to him and he says there is nothing he can do, and that unless we wait outside we won't be seated. At this point we just left after having dealt with a racist insulting door man, a lying waitress, and a indifferent manager. Personally i will never go back to a place who treat their customers like that.
