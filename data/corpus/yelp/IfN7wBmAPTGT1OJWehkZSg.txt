This place is pretty awesome.  I know a lot of people go here because Guy tagged their previously perfectly acceptable kitchen door, which includes myself.  But remember that these places apply to be on the show, and he doesn't just go there because it's the best INSERT MEAT/STARCH/FAT HERE in the supercluster of galaxies we live in.  It's just that the place is good.. . If you ask me, the much-hyped pork is overrated.  It's nice and moist and tastes great, but it seems everyone comes for that one.  I had the pastrami and was very impressed.  I'll have the burger next time.  It comes with this type of horseradish sauce that tastes amazingly like the mayo they give you for fries in Europe - really sweet and awesome.  I like awesome.  Fries are awesome too, and I like fries.. . The joint is kind of like an old timey diner, which it was at some point.  But the 'ol 'Ster has put some nice new finishes and upgrades to impress the newbies like myself.  So I guess if you're reading this to find out if it's worth it, check it out fsho.
