i love this place! pizza is good. here... but my favorite is their caprese salad. its the best i've ever had.... . super super good mozerella and tomato w/ basil... dunno how they make it so good. its such a simple dish and they perfected it.. . i got pasta here, some kind of mustard one i think and it wasnt good. but everything else has been so im still a fan!
