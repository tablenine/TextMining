Quite possibly the greatest selection and variety of beers in Southern California.  You will try and see beers you had no idea existed when you slip into the Yardhouse.  And on top of that, it's a fun spot to hang at, and the late night happy hour pizzas are the perfect compliment to all the great beer.
