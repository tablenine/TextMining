Restaurant: The Original Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Alright, I've been to three other "OHOPs" as I prefer to call them, but I stepped into this one this morning and felt like I wasn't in Atlanta anymore. In a bad way. Like, a random diner on a road trip through the midwest type place. It looked like they renovated it in the 80s and hadn't cleaned it since then. Even the calculator the guy used at the "register" to calculate my total was 80s. Don't get me wrong, the people watching was awesome, but it was just...gross. Everything was dirty. Everything. Dirty floors, dirty tables/chairs, dirty dusty old celing panels and vents, dirty silverware. The majority of employees and customers were also dirty. The service was good and our server was very nice and attentive. The food was okay, but they didn't serve new cream for coffee or serve the tropical syrup (with the coconut pancakes, I get these every time-highly recommend) in a ceramic pourer like they do at the other ones I've been to. They gave it to me in one of those salad dressing or soy sauce plastic containers. I'm not sure why, but this irked me. Boyfriend said his eggs were "weird," but his pancakes and bacon were decent. All in all I was disappointed with this location. I won't be back. I'll hit up Flying Biscuit for the same price, or Waffle House if I'm looking for that grungy "I-don't-care" atmosphere. Or if I really get a hankerin' for some of their coconut pancakes, I'll head up to the Alpharetta location.
