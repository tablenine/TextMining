Fiddle dee dee! I met my friend Jen G. here, along with some soon-to-be friends. We were the only peeps in the place on a blustery winter day, looking to warm ourselves with copious beverages from Fiddlehead's extensive selection of wines and beers. The cheese platter and humus were AMAZING (the Persian feta will make you forget all about that pesky Greek feta) and all the cheese is available for sale at the restaurant. . . Our server, John, was fantastic and very knowledgeable about the menu. Â In addition to his on-target drink and food recommendations, he was pleasant and even took some pics with us by the Christmas tree. I had the pulled pork sandwich with blue cheese aoili and although the aioli was inadvertently forgotten, it was still delicious. Maybe when I go back to try the sandwich with the aoili, they'll earn back the extra star. Everyone else seemed very happy with their selections and a delightful time was had by all. . . Thanks to John and Fiddlehead for providing the excellent food and the warm holiday glow!
