PROS. -Good service! We went from walking in to eating in about three minutes. We were lucky that there were open tables when we went in though. The servers speak English, if you're wondering.. -Good food! As recommended by the other reviews, we each got the Hainan Chicken and the Chrysanthemum Tea. The rice was soft and had a light chicken broth flavor. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The plates came with spicy sauce, soy sauce, and ginger sauce on the side. The chrysanthemum tea goes great with this plate!. -Good portions! Our plates were very fulfilling. It is easy to finish off the plate because it is so good, but it will keep you full for a while.. -Price is decent. When we came, two Hainan Chickens and two Chrysanthemum Teas came out to around $18.. . CONS. -The tea was so good, I wish they came in bigger cups. I'm unsure if they offer free refills.. -The eating area is extremely small, and you're lucky if you can grab a table without waiting. It is so small that the servers often bump into each other and squeeze between chairs. It is definitely worth the wait, but do your best to avoid peak hours.. . CONCLUSION. With all the good reviews of this place, of course I had to come out and try it. And I was not disappointed at all. I would love to try the other stuff on the menu, but that would mean I would have to turn down the chicken! Yeah right! Highly recommend that you check this place out and order what everyone else is ordering.
