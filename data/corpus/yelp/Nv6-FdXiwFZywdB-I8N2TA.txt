Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Caf√©
Category: Cuban
I sure wish they had a location closer to me. Solid Cuban fare, cheap prices and byob to boot! Tried the ropa vieja and the empanadas - can't go wrong. Brought some bottles and sat outside on the little patio. There's even a small parking lot. I'd like to go back to check out more of the menu or even the breakfast.
