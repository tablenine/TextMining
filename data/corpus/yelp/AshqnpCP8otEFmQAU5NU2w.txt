Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Uh.. Soo not worth it.  If I didn't have to wait AN HOUR AND A HALF for a freaking hot dog, I guess I wouldn't think it wasn't worth it, but I did so I do.  I got a Chicago Polish Dog that came with mustard, tomato, lettuce, and relish.  I traded the relish for sauerkraut which cost me $0.55 more, but the dog was pretty cheap to begin with ($3.85).  The wait is so ridiculously long, and the Pink's website claims that the service is fast.  IT WASN'T!!!  They seemed pretty efficient, but the wait was just too damn long.  The wait was so long that I wasn't even hungry by the time we got our doggies.. . I love that they have old school type sodas like Bubble-Up and GRAPE(!), Strawberry, and Orange Crush in glass bottles.  They have cream soda too!!  They have a lot of outdoor seating to rest your poor little feet after you just waited 293847 hours for a hot dog.  They also have a parking lot but it's pretty small and the line goes through the lot, so you run the risk of hitting a person who was innocently waiting for their famous Pink's.. . But I guess it's just cool to say that I've been to Pink's since it's a historic landmark.
