This place was cool...  dark and fun.  The wine selection is great, the service was rather good, and the prices were affordable for the caliber of restaurant it is.  This place is great for a date or a business meeting, and it's hard to leave when you're having a good time.  Unfortunately for me, I had to jet because I had to be somewhere else... but I definitely want to go back next time I can.  Great place!
