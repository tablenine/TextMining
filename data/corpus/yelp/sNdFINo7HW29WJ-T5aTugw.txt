Category: Mexican
sigh... Mexican food has been part of American culture for so long that it can be now be considered bland and average...however, a cornerstone of the American/Mexican food scene is the drinks, and the more you drink the better it tastes!. . If you think about El Azteca, you'll recall the entire staff is Spanish (I won't say Mexican...) . . Plus the people watching isn't so bad... plenty of people come here before the hit the pub...a bit of anticipation can be felt as groups of singles wipe salsa dribble from their newly financed club wear.. . Personally, if its sunset and its summer, Mexican food,Corona and cool people always seems to work for me. Â . . I honestly can't think of better in town Mex than this place, so it gets 3 out of 5... of course, the "real" stuff is available for the uber adventurous over on Buford Hwy...
