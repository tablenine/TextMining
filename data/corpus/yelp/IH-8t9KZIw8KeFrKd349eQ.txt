I used to live down the street from this place so it was a regular haunt.  My favorite thing to do was to go there on a bright sunny day for lunch because as you pass through the door it was like having a flashbulb go off in your face.  Passing from extreme light to the EXTREME dark of Casa Vega takes awhile to get used to and I would always wander in like Frankenstoner going "I can't see, I can't see".. This place is dark but has the most awesome paintings on the walls.  Where do you get such dramatic paintings of bulls?  My favorite is the bull that has been stabbed many times and is bleeding profusely.  I secretly wish it was me in the fancy gold and pink matador costume standing there with my red cape going "ha ha you're dying, this is a great sport and is in no way cruel, so there".  Spaniards, the inquisition has shifted to the animal kingdom.. Casa Vega does great mole and thats all I care about.  THe place is VERY popular with the TV comedians.  Go and you will sit there and notice that the guy next to you is that guy from that one show, whats the name of it again?  You can't remember but he's really funny.  . Casa Vega is worth the stop.  So stop.
