Overall a fantastic dining experience. We went with a small group of friends to celebrate a double birthday. Everyone in our party enjoyed their appetizers and entrees. The entrees took a little longer than expected after we were done with our starters, but the place was packed and in the presence of good company you hardly notice.. . They have a fairly large wine selection which most of my group took advantage of. I was looking for a good beer though that night. It always disappoints me when a nice restaurant doesn't have an equally nice high end beer selection to accompany their wine selection. Our waitress wasn't very familiar with their available beers but after some coaxing I was able to get a few higher-end beers from her and settled on a nice Chimay White.. . The quality of food, drink and atmosphere is fantastic without breaking the bank. We will be back to Canoe.
