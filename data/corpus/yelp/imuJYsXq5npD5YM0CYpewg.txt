Gingergrass is awesome.  I mean no offense by this but most Pho I have tried has a taste to the broth that kind of reminds me of urine. I have usually been left feeling ill after eating at most Vietnamese food establishments. . Whereas Gingergrass has obviously fused Vietnamese and California cuisine, I see this as being a good thing.  Those of us who find traditional Vietnamese cuisine to be a bit strange tasting can appreciate many of this cuisine's best elements at Gingergrass.  Some may find GIngergrass's Pho to be lacking in flavor.  The flavor it lacks is exactly the flavor that I find objectionable in traditional Pho.  If you are into traditional Pho, GIngergrass may not be your thing.  If you are like me, however, it can give you a chance to appreciate it.  All of the noodle dishes are amazing at gingergrass, and I have always found their staff to be exceptionally helpful and friendly.. I recommend the Dang Ade -- ginger lemonade mixed with beer.  Lovely!  It's a fun place to bring a date and the always fabulous Red Lion tavern is right next door!  Make a night of it, I say.
