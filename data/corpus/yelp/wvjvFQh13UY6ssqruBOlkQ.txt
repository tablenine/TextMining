Meh.  This place is fine, but not the revelatory dining experience I've heard.  The salads and sandwiches generally taste good, but there's not enough of anything that's not lettuce.  Literally you will get three strips of meat that are maybe 2 1/2" x 1/2".  Triple the amount of meat and we'll talk, until then I'm done with this place.
