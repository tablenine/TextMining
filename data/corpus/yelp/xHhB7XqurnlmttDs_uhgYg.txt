Restaurant: Co&#39;m Vietnamese Grill
Category: Vietnamese
This place is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Atlanta.  It is the only place where I can take my Vietnamese friends and family, and non-Vietnamese friends to.  Both parties can agree on the authenticity and taste, it is light, healthy, and beautifully presented consistently every visit.  The service can be slow when it gets busy but the food pardons the service.  My first experience was June 12th, 2006, on my birthday and it was the best lunch a friend could ever give me.
