I am not a huge fan of Vietnamese food, but my boyfriend is so we end up going to Gingergrass once and a while.  I wasn't going to review it because I thought my review would be a little biased since I'm not a huge fan of the food to begin with.  However... I decided to write a review because of the absolutely wonderful customer service I saw there a couple weeks ago.  . . We went there at 2:30 forgetting they close from 3pm to 5pm.  They didn't mind when we stayed a little past 3 finishing up our food.  Around ten after three, a man came in and wanted to place a large to go order for 7 people.  They apologized very nicely and said they had just closed.. . The guy started throwing a fit like a child who didn't get his way.  He was being such a little bitch and ended his rant by yelling he had 7 hungry people and YOU GUYS DON'T EVEN CARE!. . What an ASSHOLE!  If I were the one listening to that I would have told him to leave and never came back.  But the guy at Gingergrass very calmly said "We do care, sir."  He took the little bitch's order and the staff (who were supposed to be taking a break and eating before their dinner crowd) made the 7 to go meals without complaint.  The asshole continued to make snotty comments until he got his food of course, but not one of the staff members even reacted.  And when he left, no one commented about it, they just sat down and ate their meals.. . What a patient group of guys and GREAT customer service!!!
