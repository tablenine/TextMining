The night started off poorly when the waiter said they didn't offer the tasting menu on weekends.  I called a few days earlier and specifically asked the hostess if they were going to offer the tasting menu on Saturday and she confirmed that they did.  Did she say "yes" just to get me off the phone?. . Very interesting dining room with a nice outdoor area that blends into the indoor area.  Atmosphere is vibrant (very fast-paced with loud conversations and an army of staff running around).  I didn't expect this almost hectic ambiance given its two-star Michelin rating.  . . Had the lamb ragout for first course - flavorful, but tasted like something my in-law in Switzerland makes every week.  Second course was the Alaskan halibut, which claimed to have chorizo...must have been essence of chorizo because I couldn't see or taste it in the dish.  It also had tiny pieces of clam shells, which made my teeth hurt when I accidentally bit into it.  Halibut was slightly bland -- needed some salt.  Only redeeming qualities of the dish was the halibut was cooked well and the sauce had very nice delicate flavors. . . Husband had the crab cake for 1st course -- pretty good.  Then tried the leg of lamb for 2nd course.  It was a LOT of lamb...same problem as the Halibut...flavors slightly too bland.. . Other redeeming quality of Spago: nice waiter who asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion.  We told him my company was relocating us to Dallas.  He told the dessert chef, who wrote "Good luck!" in chocolate on our plate.  Very nice gesture.. . Would have received more stars if food wasn't as bland given the large bill we received in the end.  (2 first courses, 2 second courses, 1 dessert, 2 bottles Pellegrino, 2 glasses rose champagne, and 1 red wine totaled around $275, including tax and tip).
