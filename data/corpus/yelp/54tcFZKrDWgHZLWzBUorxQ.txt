Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Wine Bars
Went to Rosa's for early dinner. The restaurant was medium busy. . . We had pork taco and chicken enchilada. They are famous for their Guac as an appetizer. They miss no opportunity to push it on you. It is pretty good but at $12 you can do better! . . Both dishes came with rice and beans. The pork also had a chili sauce which was pretty poor. The enchilada was OK but it was not as spicy as they had promised. . . We had margarita and a Pinot Noir for drinks. The Margarita was OK but the Pinot was really not much of a wine. . . For deserts we had cheese cake and ice cream. The ice cream is in reality gelato so be prepared. It is not your typical American ice cream. It was not as flavorful as you would expect. The cheese cake came with an apple compote. It was rich but has a slight flavor of refrigerator. Guess they are not selling deserts everyday:-( The coffee was luke warm but OK. . . The service was attentive and overall taking good care of us. . . In summary: mediocre food, mixed drinks, avoid desserts and praise the service.
