Okay so let me start by saying that I am not a great fan of Asian food, but I went here with my sorority sisters prior to a concert.  It was okay.  The place is beautiful, very trendy, seems like a great place to go and be seen.  It's overpriced as far as I'm concerned and because it seems to be more Thai Fusion than Asian Fusion it was doubly gross for me (I despise Thai food, sorry, but all the peanuts and stuff, not for me).  We had the chicken lollipop things, they were just fair, we were like girl this aign't nothin' but sweet and sour chicken from the corner wing/philly/chinese food spot.  I had the garlic noodles with chicken, very basic, nothing to write home about.  Bottom line, if you wanna go and hang out, look pretty and be seen Straights is great, if you want like a really great Asian Fusion experience I personally feel like Chow Baby and Noodle provide a more flavorful experience, the food here is just mediocre and Ludacris thinks this mess is made out of gold or something because it is just too expensive.
