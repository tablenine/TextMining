pitcher of frozen mango, yes thank you.. Not quite the strongest I've had but what a primer to a night of binging! . Kept it simple and cheap with a burrito to suffice. Was quite tasty and filling. Pico de gallo sauce, surprisingly sweet, sweet to the taste- i dug it. . Hope to return for enchilladas and get my fill.
