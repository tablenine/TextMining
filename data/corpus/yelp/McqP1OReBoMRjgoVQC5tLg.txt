Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Ever since I moved to LA from Seattle I have been looking for a cozy local hangout with good beer and good food and without the hang-ups of the LA scene. Ford's Filling Station comes really darn close. Food is excellent, atmosphere is warm and inviting, beer is good. It is a little pricey, which I would be willing to completely overlook. If.... . . If it weren't for the service. Oh, the service. It kinda sucks. . . The first time I went we tried to get reservations, just to be sure. No one answered the phone. Instead, I got an answering maching asking me to leave a number and they'd call me back. No one ever called back. First bad.  . No worries, we just showed up and hoped they got the message. Well, not only didn't they get the message, but the dining room was closed for a private party. Almost a second bad.  . . We couldn't have dinner. Bummer. But they said the bar was open. So we sat down and discovered a really great bar menu. Things looked up.  . . Now, you have to unsderstand that the place is pretty small, It's basically a big rectangle, with the dining room in the back end, and the bar towards the front. While we were happily chatting at our table in the bar, someone in the "private party" decided to give a speech. One of the wait staff actually came over to our table and shooshed us. Shooshed us! Second *and* third bad! . I am sorry, but if you're going to have a private party, you should just close the place. Don't shoosh the public that you hope will visit you again (and hope will write good reviews for you on Yelp!) just because of one high-roller who pays you for a special party one night..
