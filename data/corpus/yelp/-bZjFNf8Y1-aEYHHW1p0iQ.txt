Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
i've had kogi before at alibi bar in culver city but never from the actual truck until today.... . went to the santa monica location on 2500 broadway (the yahoo center).  they picked a great spot cuz there is parking and room for people to eat.  i went at 1:30pm which was sweeet since most working people are not there at that time.. . today, i got my favs...kogi hotdog $5 (kimchee hotdog) and kalbi taco $2.  great meal, just as i remember it.  . . the line wasn't long.  service was quite efficient much better than other food trucks.  pleasant experience.  if i worked around there, i would be sooo happy to eat it daily...or take turns with coworkers to grab food.
