I kind of knew I would end up giving this place five stars after reading the reviews.. . It's not too often that about halfway into a meal, I say aloud, "this might be my favorite restaurant in Atlanta."  That was the case with Agave.. . This place just has everything going for it.  The atmosphere is perfect-- very comforting, warm, cool, and friendly.  . . The staff is very attentive and helpful.. . The food is original and excellent.  We sat at the bar, where you get BOGO appetizers EVERY night from 5-7, so we got 4 apps.  They were all wonderful, particularly the shrimp and tenderloin-- the steak was just amazing.  It was cooked rare and was up there with the best steak I have ever had (weird for an app).  . . The drinks were phenomenal.  We tried four margs, and they were all outstanding.  They are pricey, but they are quality drinks.  I can't really suggest a particular one, but you should be able to ask the staff for help, and you really can't go wrong.. . You probably can't afford to come here regularly, but this place makes sense as a regular place for special occasions (if that makes sense).  I'd imagine I'll be coming back here at least annually.  Thanks for existing, Agave!. . Note-- we got there around 4:50, so we got to park in the lot ourselves instead of using valet.  Then we were there for the entire buy one get one free appetizer at the bar deal.  Also, it was not crowded yet on a Saturday at that hour, so our service was great.  I couldn't think of a better time to go to Agave than 4:50-7:00 sitting at the bar on a Friday or Saturday.]. . On the update, have to lower it to four stars for a bad service experience.  Still a good place, but service must be consistent.
