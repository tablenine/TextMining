Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
I had the goat cheese tamale, pulled pork tamale, and a shrimp taco. The food was really, really tasty. I don't understand the reviews that call the food bland, although the pulled pork tamale could have had more spice cooked into the pork (easily fixed with the hot sauce on the table). The goat cheese tamale was delicious, as was the shrimp taco. Neither was bland. . . The atmosphere is typical of a trendy West Loop restaurant. It's nice, but a lot of hard surfaces make it loud.. . The service was a little slow for a Wednesday night, but that was forgivable. What I found troubling was redeeming my $35 Groupon. The bill came out to $29 plus tax and tip. I gave the server my Groupon and my credit card for the tax and tip, but for some reason she simply could *not* redeem the Groupon, since the bill was less than $35. She said she could not give change for the Groupon, to which I replied that I didn't want or need change. Nowhere does it say I have to spend at least $35. She asked if she could bring something else, and I refused. . . Eventually she brought two margarita shots, which we did not ask for, and which she added to the bill. I drank my shots, signed the check, and left, but this was not a pleasant end to the dining experience. Please, when someone hands you at $35 coupon for a $29 bill, cheerfully accept it.
