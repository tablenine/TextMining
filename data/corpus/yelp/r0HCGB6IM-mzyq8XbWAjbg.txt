It's tough to hand out 5 star reviews on yelp, however because of the positive impact this restaurant had on my otherwise miserable stay in Atlanta, I am certain it's worth every star of it. Â . . LET ME BE CLEAR, If you happen to find yourself stuck in downtown Altanta and are in need of a good meal, this is your place, IF you are looking for great food, a vibrant yet relatively quiet and tasteful atmosphere, good service and best of all a wine list full of delicious $20 bottles.
