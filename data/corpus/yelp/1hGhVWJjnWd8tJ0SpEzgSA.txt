Very good Mexican comfort food - nothing pretentious, but nothing out-of-this-world, either.. . Vegetarian friendly, which is a big plus.. . Everything tastes fresh, and the deep fried items (which there are many) seem to be fried in good, flavorful, clean fat. No stray odors or out of place flavors.. . Nice people on staff!
