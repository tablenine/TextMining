I wonder how Tom Colicchio would rate his own food if one of the contestants called in for take-out and re-plated Craft's food? My guess would be somewhere strongly in the middle of the pack. Simple and good, but nothing amazing. Not a place for the non-meat-eater, though we did have a killer spring pea and mint ravioli.
