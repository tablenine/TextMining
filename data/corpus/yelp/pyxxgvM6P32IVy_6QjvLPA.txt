I love Moody's.  My fiancee thinks they put Cocaine in the jumbo shrimp because its addicting.  My friends and I go here all the time to grab a drink or to get some food.. . I have never had to wait for a table in this place no matter what time of day or what day of the week, just simply seat yourself and grab a handful of peanuts when you walk in.  It always seems like we grab one of the two last tables, so the crowd is steady.. . FOOD:  Free peanuts.  Enough said.  Claim to have the best burger in the city but it's just good, no Kuma's.  Food is plain and comes served on a prison style steel food tray.  Steaks get A1, everything else can use ketchup.  Sweet potato fries are very good.  Limited menu which is great because I dont spend 20 min reading it.  A few good selections is all thats needed.  They serve relatively late.. . DRINK: $10 pitchers of Anchor steam.  I think thats one of the better deals in the city.  They also have a slew of signature drinks which I am going to try one day, but I can never get passed that tasty Anchor.. . ATMOSPHERE:  This place is pitch black.  If you walk in during the day, your eyes will have to adjust.  Two fireplaces keep it warm in the winter.  Very intimate setting with the jukebox hardly even noticable.  Outdoor patio is nice.  Very warm and welcoming feel, seat yourself and check out the cool backlit stained glass and 1800's style decor.. . I will go back to Moody's until they tear it down.
