Restaurant: Parish
Category: Cajun/Creole
Parish is a restaurant that serves really great cajun/creole food, and is similar to what you would find walking around St. Charles near the French Quarter.  The upstairs restaurant is more upscale, and is in a beautiful space, which manages to be both industrial and warm at the same time.  They have a great mixologist there that comes up with unusual drinks that can range from excellent to "what is IN this???"  The food is fantastic as well, using fresh ingredients and wonderful flavors.  My favorite section though is downstairs in the market.  I love the farm table that you can sit and drink coffee and eat a muffaletta with your friends, meet some neighbors, and bask in the neighborhood community feel this place allows.  This place is a treasure, and what the words "neighborhood" can be all about.
