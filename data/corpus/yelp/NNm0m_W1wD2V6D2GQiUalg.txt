Took my man here for his birthday and it was one of the best eating experiences ever. We got the Chef's Omakase, which is where he chooses what you eat and takes an hour to eat everything. Everything is fresh and meticulous.. . I've done this twice and each time had different entrees, each time amazing!. . It was expensive, its about 40 bucks a person, but it is the best sushi I've ever eaten. The service was awesome. They described everything we got and were attentive to our drinks and when we were finished. . . Its a small place so a reservation is highly recommended otherwise you could be waiting forever. With our reservation we still waited 10 minutes to be seated. . . I'm not a big spender when it comes to restaurants and it was a special occasion. But it was well worth it and will definitely go again, and again and again.
