I think that this place is a solid 3.5 stars.  I like the decor, the mismatched tables and chairs.  For the most part, I like the menu.  I have had some hits and misses, but that's to be expected.  . . Dinner:. The beets with the goat cheese and hazelnuts is surprisingly good -- and I'm not a fan of beets, either.  I also have had the olive assortment (oooh, olives) and the caprese salad, which was just ok.  For dinner, I think that the ricotta and spinach ravioli/dumpling was excellent.  That brown butter sauce is very good.  The risotto is usually pretty good as well.. . Brunch:. I have liked everything that I have had here for brunch.  But, I always seem a little disappointed by the brunch menu options.  I think that I expect more of them.  The granola and berries was good, as was the french toast.  But it was nothing special.  The one thing that I can say is great the few times that I have had it is the fritatta.  That thing is amazing.  Definitely a must try.
