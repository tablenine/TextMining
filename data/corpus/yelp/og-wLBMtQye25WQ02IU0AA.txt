I went there this week to curb a craving for some Chinese food.  I was looking forward to it because I've heard some pretty great stories about the place.  Unfortunately, I was not their biggest fan.  The smoothies were amazing- it took forever to make them, but it was worth it.  . The food on the other hand was average, I was not wowed by the meal I got.  The menu was overwhelming- if I'm going out to eat I want choices, but seriously there were too many at Joy's.  And the wood box things they put the food in is cute, but I'm not too sure how sanitary it is.   . The service was by far some of the worst service ever.  I looked around to see if my group was the only group to get snarled at, but it was everyone.  . . So, 3 stars because of the bubble tea.
