Trendy and busy.. . First time i went i had the omelet, not sure exactly which one but it was good.  Second time i went i had the stuff french toast with bananas and it was damn good.  I would was hoping for some cream cheese inside but I was still happy with the dish. My friend had the berry french toast and the strawberries, raspberries and blueberries were very fresh.
