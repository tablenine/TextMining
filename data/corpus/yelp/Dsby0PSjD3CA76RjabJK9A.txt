Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
Terribly loud terribly noisy terribly trying to be something it is not.. it is not a delicious french bistro. it is not terribly charming. the ginger tequila "diablo" cocktail was certainly memorable - the stand out of the evening. otherwise, the food was bland, boring and came out warm not hot. the fish dishes i would skip altogether. the bread and butter was tasty and the fact that it is served with out a plate you can forego your. knowledge of good manners. the room is so loud conversation is. impossible. in typical LA fashion - all hype no substance.. ****revisited the restaurant in may 09 and the food was much better. as well as noise level and service. standouts include: steak frites, moules and of course, the cocktails.....
