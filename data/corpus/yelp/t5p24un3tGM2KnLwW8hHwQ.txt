Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
A chain by Mike Boogie &amp; Ashton Jutcher &amp; boys from the 70s show... not that bad. If you're a child of the 80s, or just love that awesomely bad music, this place is for you. When you enter you hear music that you reminisce over &amp; the atmosphere brings Â you back to what you enjoy currently - trendy, clean &amp; dim lit rooms. . . Searching for a nice quiet cozy restaurant to take a date to? This is far from the place. I would have preferred the music to be turned down from 11 to 10, to converse with Joel, the waiter- but during the meal it was a pleasure to grove to. The seating was comfortable from the bar area to the pleather covered tables in the dining area. My G&amp;T was strong &amp; the food was very good (app: love bruscetta, soup: red &amp; yellow pepper, entre: trout filled w/ crab &amp; shrimp). . . I wish the crowd was a little less uppity, but I guess it's all due to the name. I guess I prefer the actual California lifestyle... to the Atlanta packaged version.
