Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The food these days aren't as good anymore, the seafood usually has a bland taste and flaky texture. The deal breakers for me when it comes to Boiling Crab is the wait and the parking. That parking is a joke, its parking is smaller than many 7-11's parkings. Let's not forget the WAIT, don't get me wrong, BC is good, just not worth the 1-1.5 hour wait and parking hassle. These days I only go to Captain Crab...never a wait, never a problem with parking, and food is better overall also with better sides and drink selection.
