Food and Beer selection here was pretty rad.. . I loooooved the thanksgiving dinner sammy i ordered.. nothing like turkey, cranberries, stuffing and mayo on toasted white bread.. oh and i cant forget to mention the yummy side of green bean casserole. . mmmhmmmm.. . service pretty much sucked though. every server there looked like they rolled out of bed and went to work with whatever they slept in. . half of the time my server was missing or not paying attention to us when we needed her.. . she was helpful though when there was a giant crack in my beer glass and i asked for a new one. (i did have to go to the bar though because it was nearly impossible to get her attention.). . ill put the crappy service aside though because i liked the place and the food and beer were good.. . ill actually probably go back.
