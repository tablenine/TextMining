Restaurant: 123 Burger Shot Beer
Category: Burgers
I went to 123 Burger Shot Beer a few months back because all of my friends were talking about how they checked the place out. You have to have i.d. to get in (because they have a large bar). The food was okay, the mini sliders were $1 and they were just okay, not great not bad but a little greasy. The one thing I do remember is that the waitress took FOREVER to bring our order, we waited at least a half an hour for a few burgers and fries. For a place that specializes in making burgers and fries you would have thought it would have taken 15 minutes tops, but no 30 minutes. It might have just been that it was a busy night or it could have just been our waitress. The fries were good though, pretty much what I expected. It's great if you're with a bunch of friends and just want to hang out at a very relaxed location (jeans and t's are common here). Worth trying out at least once.
