Category: American (Traditional)
I want so badly to give this place five stars, but I can't, because the service was terrible.  I understand it's one in the morning and you're kind of busy, but for the love, please be courteous.. I ventured in here after contemplating Cinco De Mayo, which is right next door, and deciding I'd go for something a bit less adventurous tonight.  Unfortunately I only had ten bucks in my pocket and Johnnie's is a bit pricer than expected, so I couldn't get fries or a shake or any of the trimmings.  Mentally, yelp stars were dropping by the second.  But oh, when I finally got my sandwich, my delicious chicken breast sandwich that randomly came with two baggies of pickles and hot peppers, faith was restored.  I can't wait to go back - with more cash this time around - and try something else.
