Such a unique, unpretentious Williamsburg spot. Have been for brunch and dinner and always enjoyed both. Brunch is more of an a la carte affair as I recall, but everything is delicious. Service is good, and the ambiance and people watching is amazing. The banquet-type seating on the back wall is great for a group of 6-8.
