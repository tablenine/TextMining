R to O to S to the C O E... . . sometimes I make plans to go to LA and my top 3 priorities is to come here and get me some chicken and waffles. The first time this was introduced to me I was thinking this cant be a good combination but oh man I was wrong. I use to be able to eat the biggest portions but now that food goes straight to the gut, I hold my portions to the 1/4 order. But man, it still gets me full. I wish this was in the bay area I'd be there almost every weekend. Love the taste of these combination.
