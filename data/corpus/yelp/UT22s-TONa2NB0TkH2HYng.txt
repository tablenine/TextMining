Love it. I studied in France twice, and this is as close as you can get to the feeling of a French cafe. The food is great. Their wine and cider selection is good too. I've has steak frites, crepes and dessert. Do not skip out on the dessert!! I had the nutella, creme anglais and strawberry crepes that were all deelish. Their Croque Monsieur is the closest I've seen to one you would get in France. But the fact that the owners ave lived in France probably helps. My only complaint is that there isn't any air conditioning, which is common in the city, but the back patio is so pretty that with the right amount of wine, you can forget the summer heat.
