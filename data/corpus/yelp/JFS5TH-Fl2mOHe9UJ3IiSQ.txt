Eating here just made me downright happy. The food is just sooo good! My favorite food was the tostones, but the soup and entree were excellent as well. Bill Kim himself was working the open kitchen while we were there, which I thought was awesome. And you wouldn't think a place that works as a snack shop would have all that great of service, but they were fantastic! Clearing our plates, opening our BYO beers - one of the ladies even caught me trying to figure out what was in my soup, stopped and explained it to me. Wonderful experience all around. Wish I'd learned about it sooner!
