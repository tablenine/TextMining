Delish and healthy food in a beautiful neighborhood! On a nice day, it's great to sit in some of these outdoor tables and have some cold ice tea or a microbrew.. . I used to hate tuna, but now have this obsession with ahi tuna (still can't stand the canned stuff). So I'm a huge fan of their ahi tuna nicoise salad (still haven't figured out how to pronounce "nicoise" correctly, but luckily all I have to say is "I'll have the ahi tuna salad"). My friends were also big fans of the entrees especially because of the mashed potatoes they come with. . . For $10, it might not be the cheapest lunch, but still worth it for the quality and health factor - and I think it's great that you can see everything being prepared in front of you. I just wish with all the people working there, they'd be able to move a bit faster...
