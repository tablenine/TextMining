Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
One negative star, for the lack of parking, and for not having dolmas, with meat. Isn't that a Greek staple? Sheesh! . . The food here is delicious, and the decor is, well, Greek as hell.. . Don't find it weird, if you're surrounded by an army of Greek people. It's pretty common here. Pretty viable way of Â knowing the food is authentic!. . The restaurant system can be a little confusing. Once you go inside, go all the way to the right, and order at the counter. The menu is above your head, and the food is pretty much omniscient. There's all kinds of food hanging over your head, behind your butt, behind the counter, etc etc. . . Feel free to get Greek'd out =). . . Oraya!!!
