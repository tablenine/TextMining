After being skipped on the ridiculously long waiting list for a table, and trying to explain it to the girl at the "desk"  to no avail (she was nice ,just overwhelemed it was so packed! ) a manager came over and asked what was wrong etc.. he promptly sat our party of 4 hungry asses  and made our night fabulous . the food is soooo damned goood, and the guy who took care of us, was super nice.. Between us all  we got and shared , prawns, steak, pork chops portabello fries, and of course the chocolate souffle good lord ! (i mean why order a pizza for gods sakes ? its reallly good because we were  comped it, but there are so many other GREAT dishes )Thanks for hooking us up Bottega Louie !. Everrrrry time  we go there , the experience just gets better and better !. LOud ? if its too loud your too old ! I dont really want to hear what anyones saying after a few drinks anyway , i just want to have that awesome food !
