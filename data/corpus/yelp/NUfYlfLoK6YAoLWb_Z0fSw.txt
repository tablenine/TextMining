Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
After a VERY disappointing late night dumpling run @ Dragon Mask----the friend and I haaaaad to fulfill our dumpling craving. What better place than Din Tai Funggggggg?!?!. . - pork and shrimp dumpling: YUM!(not juicy). - juicy pork dumpling: YUM!. - pork and shrimp shuimai: YUM!(juicy). - stir fried veggies: YUM!. - shrimp fried noodles: good, but wouldn't order it again. - 1/2 taro(bleh) &amp; 1/2 red bean(YUM!) dumplings. . Bottomline: IF Â you haven't had dumplings at DTF yet, you are definitely missing out on YUMMMY grubbin'!!!!. . btw: we were so hungry and it was so packed, that we agreed to "SHARE" a table with other people. Next time, I'm going to wait for a table of our own. Sitting with strangers and ordering the way we do---is waaay too weird for me.
