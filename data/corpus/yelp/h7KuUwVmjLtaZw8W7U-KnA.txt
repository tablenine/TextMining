Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I'd like to write a short review for this restaurant by saying JUST GO, but this place deserves more than just two words.. . All of the items on the menu are made extremely well to perfection and you can't find many dumpling houses with such an extensive menu. They have a window to show that their chefs are actually making everything from scratch and not just using frozen stuff made from factories. The XLB's are great and the Water XLB's are even better (they are only served during certain time/days I believe). A lot of the dishes remind me of home as I am originally from China, and all of them are authentic as it gets. The service is very courteous and the food comes out very fast.. . I would have given this place a 5/5, but there is one thing that does bother me about this restaurant. When placing orders, DTF gives you a card for you to make check marks and numbers to show which item and the quantity of the item you want. However, this card does not show any pricing and I for one did not see any pricing sheet/chart in the restaurant. So it seems to me they can charge whatever they want when you get your bill. Although the food and my experience at this restaurant was more than outstanding, not listing the prices for their items is not a good business practice and very shady. I could be wrong as they might have a price chart somewhere??? (again I did not see one), but not having one immediately in front of you when ordering is just not right.
