One of the best places to get ramen but be prepared to wait in line for up to an hour. Luckily, there's lots of cute shops around including Mikawaya. Nothing wrong with having dessert first! Once you're in service is friendly and the food comes quick.. . The interior is very small, which is why the wait is so long. There are a few booths and a long slim counter facing the kitchen. Very traditionally Japanese. You can peer over and watch the masters work their sizzling woks, inhale the aromas wafting over.. . Gyoza: pork filled fried sweet dumplings topped off with lots of scallions. Dip in soy sauce for that wonderful sweet and salty combo. My friend gave up meat a few months ago and still had to have some!. . Fried rice with fried egg and chashu: the rice itself is flavored beautifully. I swear they must pour butter over it, but it's not overly greasy at all. Simple perfection.. . And the meat of it all: Ramen. The thick, hearty pork based broth makes the dish. It's absolutely wonderful and creamy. The noodles themselves are firm and chewy. I actually prefer noodles a little softer, but I'll eat anything in this broth. Other toppings included a brown hard boiled egg cooked just until set and still really soft, crisp bean sprouts, chashu, sliced green onions. The chashu had chunks of fat adhering to the meat iself, which wasn't that tender. Would have preferred fatty meat, not fat stuck to meat. Fyi: you can order a smaller bowl of this. The regular is enormous!. . I thought you only left Korean BBQs smelling like your dinner. Be prepared to smell like ramen afterwards.
