Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you have nothing else to do with your time than to stand in line for hours to eat a hotdog with extra sh*t on it that you normally wouldn't find on a hotdog anywhere else, then this is the place for you.  Sorry if I've affended anybody but man I just don't get this place   It may have been cool years ago to go because it's been in movies and part of LA forever now, but if I had that much time to kill it wouldn't be spent there.
