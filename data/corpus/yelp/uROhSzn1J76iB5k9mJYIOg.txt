They give you big portions of food during dinner. I like the Comal with Chicken - very tasty. I had the Plaintain appetizer which was pretty bland. I also had the Pomegranite Mimosa which was just okay. People seem to like the Mojitos. The environment is okay - it can get pretty crowded but still feels somewhat intimate depending on where you are seated. . . I've been here for lunch and thought it was pricey for what you get and not that great during lunch. Dinner is your best bet. . . Expect to spend $28 for dinner and drinks per person here.
