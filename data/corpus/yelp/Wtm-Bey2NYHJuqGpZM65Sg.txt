had take out from here a couple times and its pretty good.  we'd get it again.  haven't dined in house, but have gotten a cucumber martini at the bar.  wow, was that a tasty drink.  its hard to find any alcoholic beverage that both my wife and i enjoy, but this was just right.  not too sweet, not too strong.  going to be back for that drink alone over and over again.  saw they had $5 pad thai for lunch on thursdays.  probably going to try that soon too. where can you get anything for lunch for $5 anymore!?
