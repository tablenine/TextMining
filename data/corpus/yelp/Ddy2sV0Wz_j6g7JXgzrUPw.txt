We were in Chinatown when the BF spotted this and he said it's really good based on the TV show Man vs Food. After coming here, it's probably the last time I'll ever let him make any decision in our relationship, food related at least. . . I've never even heard of this place before till that day...and I was surprised how many stars it has on yelp when I got home. $6 for a plain 6" beef sandwich...what's so good about it again? The sauce they dip the bread with is NOTHING SPECIAL. I also gave their hot mustard a try and it was YUCKY! It's just another plain sandwich with beef to me. Good thing I came here with no expectation or else I'd be highly disappointed. I'm sure you'll see me at subway more often than Phil.
