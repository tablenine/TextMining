Damn you, Tender Greens. Why aren't there more of you around? We could sure use one of you in Pasadena.. . I had a hot plate with the free range chicken and my simple salad of choice was the Caesar. It also came with some buttery mashed potatoes. So much fresh, good tasting food and all for $10. . . The chicken was juicy and tasty. The Caesar was fresh n crispy and had just the right amount of dressing and shaved Parmesan. Mmmmmm.  There was a small piece of bread on my plate that looked like it would be good and got quite excited as I bit down with glee. It wasn't.  It tasted more like a dried up, crunchy piece of rock that practically shredded the interior of my mouth. . . Glee gone. . . Back to the chicken and salad. . . Glee back.. . I often crave this place and since I have a buddy that lives close by, I can foresee frequent trips back. . . Well, unless I get a craving for fried chicken and Honey Kettle nabs me as I walk by.. . .
