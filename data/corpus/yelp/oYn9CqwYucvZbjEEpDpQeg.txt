This place is running a tight competition with Georgia Grille for best Southwestern in the city. Chips, salsa and guacamole are so good, I was licking the bowl. I ordered the tequila shrimp, which was plated with a jalapeno cheese grit cake and grilled asparagus. Delicious.. . Entrees were beautifully presented, and tasted just as good as they looked. Atmosphere is warm and inviting, as well.. . My experience at Agave was very close to perfect! I can't wait to return.
