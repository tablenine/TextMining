Category: Seafood
Once again, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but it's one of those places where the food is so good that you find yourself stuffing more food in than you thought possible. We went with the whole shebang, which is like garlic + butter + spicy stuff + pure deliciousness. Somehow, they found extract of pure delicious, and they tossed it in here.. . There's a long wait, but otherwise it's amazing, and really the long wait is just a testament as to how good it is. it's messy and I smelled like garlic for a couple days, but I also ate food that tasted like garlic, so it's all as you would expect. The sausage and the fries were great too. I drank a corona with my meal, which went perfect.. . High 5, Boiling Crab! Oops, sorry about the messy hands...
