This place oozes healthiness.  I am not certain how healthy it necessarily is, but the wording of the menu, the wood furniture, and the beverages in the glass bottles, just make you feel good.  . . Everything felt healthy, but cold at the same time.  The cafeteria atmosphere, made me feel that I could have gone to Souplantation, and could have been just as happy.  Only bonus to Tender Greens is that it is quiet.
