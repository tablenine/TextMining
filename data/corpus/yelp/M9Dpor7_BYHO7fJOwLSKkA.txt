What took me so long? I live within walking distance from this place. A friend from London described Donor Kebab as something the drunken masses would eat after a night out, and then feeling really sick from it all. Â So in all honesty, I was expecting a heavy, greasy, stinky, meaty mess. Not so the case. Decided to head over after a hike in the Angeles Crest Forest (five stars folks). The donor sandwich was like a pillowy dream...someone mentioned all the textures and flavors perfectly blending together...yes indeed. It did not taste or feel greasy at all. (Not even the sweet potato fries) I had a combo salad, which was so amazing and so huge that I had to take it home to finish off later. I know saving salads for later is kind of gross, but it really held up. So the chicken is a little bit not my thing, and I suspect I will be trying out the falafelite very soon...I will definitely be frequenting this place more.
