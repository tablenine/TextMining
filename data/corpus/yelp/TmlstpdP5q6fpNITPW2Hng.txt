Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
If you are fortunate enough to be near the south loop looking for a casual, enjoyable, inexpensive bite stop into the Eleven City Diner!!. . I stopped in with a friend for some coffee and dessert after a good lunch at Oysy Sushi, which is just down the block and around the corner.. . Honestly Eleven City Diner just felt like a great place - an authentic diner feel, with an intelligent layout and amiable service.  I have to say this is everything Ed Debevick's could be if it wasn't a super-cliche tourist trap.  In fact, I like Eleven City Diner so much that I feel bad about even comparing it to a place like Ed Debevick's that nowadays makes me want to gag in much the same way the thought of any Hard Rock Cafe does (gross!).. . Did not have a run in with the owner/host mentioned in Matthew B.'s review so can't comment.. . I highly recommend the Chocolate Cream Pie (different than the Chocolate Cake, which is probably great, but i didn't have it) - it was great blend of dark chocolate mouse with a high quality oreo like crust, topped off with a . more-than-healthy amount of whipped cream!  Thanks to the waitress who recommended it to me.. . And their bottomless cup of Lavazza coffee was oh-so-good.  One Negative here: buy some god-d**n real cream to go with that great coffee!  I hate those little plastic half-and-half things!
