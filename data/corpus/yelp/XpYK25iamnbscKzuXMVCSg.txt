Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Amazing prime rib!  Best of the best!  I got the Lawry cut, medium well.  So juice and flavorful.  The creamed cord was so good, the spinach not so much.  Mashed potatoes weren't that great either.. Bread and butter was so so.... But the prime rib is surely the star.. We went during Christmas time so carolers came to our table and sang a song of our choice..They also gave me and girlfriend free cake at the end of our meal for our anniversary.. Great service and great prime rib.
