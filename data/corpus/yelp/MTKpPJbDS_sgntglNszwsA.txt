I have only given a couple places 5 stars..this is DEFINITELY one to get 5 too.. The wait is long, but that's because they are so highly YELP recommended.  Sunday night at around 7:15 it took us about 30-40 minutes to get seated.  Smart thing they do is they give you a menu to mark down what you want to order so as soon as your number is called, you give them the slip, they seat you and then your food is there in a matter of minutes.  Order that juicy pork dumplings and also their pork chop noodle soup.  SO good.  . We ordered 3 types of dumplings (pork, pork/crab, fish), a sticky rice, and two soups...all for a mere $40.  We were all satisfied and it was all REALLY tasty.
