I finally made the trip up to Sun Wah...low and behold...on the (re)opening night! Having never been to the old location I can't compare, but the new digs are nice and big...a little bit of a flow issue though, perhaps? Trouble flagging down servers, but it was their first night in this new space.  When you walk in, you see the glass kitchen and lovely bits n things hanging on hooks, tempting you with their shiny goodness.  . . Now, my chinese-speaking friend ordered for our table of four...so I don't know the exact names of what we were eating; I do know that it was damn good.  Chicken and corn soup (with egg), steamed broccoli, a beef briskrt-esque stew with all the bits and bobs, a plate of bbq pork, and a half duck.  I was a fan of everything, except maybe the beef entree - it was super heavy on the five spice.  The pork was out of this world, the skin was SO crispy, it was like, well, extremely crunchy...mmm..porky crispy fatty salty goodness.  The duck was amazing as well, as you probably already know.  I knew it was going to be an inexpensive night, but when the bill came and read $37, I was uber happy.. . Next time I go, I am going for the whole duck and all of the goodness that comes with it! YUM.
