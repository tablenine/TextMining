Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
This restaurant deserves more than 5 stars, 10 would suffice.  A very good &amp; GREASY restaurant.  Clog your ateries type.  Just the type I love.  I had the charbroiled hot dog...excellent.  I also tried the Pastrami sandwich, also excellent.  Good and greasy!!!  The food, price, atmosphere, service, location...all good!!!  I STRONGLY suggest if you are down in, CC, check this place out.
