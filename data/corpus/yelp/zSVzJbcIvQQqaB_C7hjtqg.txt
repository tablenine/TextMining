Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Almost every single night i am dragged here by my girlfriend to stand in a long rediculous line for some food thats *%^$, i dont know what the line is for; the food is super bland, the meat is mushy, the guacomle and salsa taste like water, the last time i checked gauc was suppose to be chunky. Also the tito's boxes stinks so bad, i cant say it enough, but if you leave it in your car with the windows rolled up, your gonna need some air freshener ;/ the only thing ok here is the cheese, which you can probably get at home, and whats up with them only having 4 things on the menu. . I always ask my friend why in th world does she it this everday," because its simple food" ok i can understand simple, when your not in the mood for real mexican food, or greasy food, or even anything with taste but y do you have to stand in line for 45 minutes(not exaggerating). . Plain and simple the ppl that go hear are just going because of the hype that some1 with no-tongue posted.. Yuck!
