This place looked cute &amp; cozy when we first walked in.  It was busy on a late weekend morning, so we had to wait a bit for a table.  No big deal - that's usually a good sign.  But while we were waiting next to a table of 3 ladies (very small entry/waiting area), one of them sent her food back for being cold and the other sent hers back because it was too bland.  Uh-oh...not a good sign...  . . I ordered the chicken &amp; waffle and my husband had the cinnamon raisin french toast.  The waffle was completely generic (and I had to wait awhile to get any maple syrup) and the chicken was completely bone dry.  The hash brown was dry &amp; tasteless (also no ketchup anywhere to be found).  My hubby liked the top piece of french toast, but the rest was undercooked &amp; soggy.  . . Service was awful..except for one lady who looked like the manager/owner?  Never got a coffee refill or more sugar, and our waiter completely disappeared after we asked for some water.  The manager ended up bringing us a couple of glasses after I flagged her down.  No one ever bothered to ask how we were doing or how things tasted.  For the money - there are MUCH better breakfast spots in Atlanta.
