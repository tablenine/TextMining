Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
This is a cute asian-fusion (vietnamese) restaurant in silver lake where the food is pretty good (not amazing) but the atmosphere is great and the staff is super nice.  I ordered the tofu wok-tossed noodles which was mucho delicioso and sampled some of my friend's "gingergrass" tofu &amp; vegetarian noodle bowl which were both pretty good (nothing special).  I expected more out of their fried banana spring rolls but they ended up being just alright.
