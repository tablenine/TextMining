I was famished one night after work and a trip to Dr. Greco, and thought I would go grocery shopping at Trader Joe's, and pick up something yummy to eat for dinner. Remembering the sage advice that you should never go grocery shopping while hungry, I ducked into Metro Fresh in the same shopping center.. . It took me a while to decide, but I left with a smoked turkey, basil, and sun dried tomato sandwich and a quinoa salad that had black currents, mandarin oranges, and almonds. Everything smelled so yummy in there I had a hard time choosing what to order.. . I would recommend this place for lunch though - the salad was cold (intentionally), and the sandwich wasn't warm. It did taste more like a "lunch" than something I would want for dinner. Regardless, it was very tasty and left me full - I could have survived on just the sandwich.
