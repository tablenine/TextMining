I've been going to Sinbala for years now and it's one of the most consistent places I know.  I don't think I've ever had a negative experience there except for the wait during busy times.  The service has always been friendly and the food tasty.  I'm aware that they recently closed because of health department violations but that doesn't really phase me. I've never had a problem after eating their food and their shaved ice is perfect when it gets too hot!
