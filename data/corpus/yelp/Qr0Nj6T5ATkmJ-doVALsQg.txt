A nice gentleman took me here for lunch and I have to admit the atmosphere is inviting....unfortunately the food did not really deliver. I had the 1/4 white chicken and it was average. . . I say that because the chicken is called Wonderoast and we can buy it in grocery stores in Iowa so it seemed like nothing special to me...the mac and cheese was completely overdone and soggy. The cheese seemed to be a cheese flavor and they definitely did NOT use real cheese.... . . The sweet tea was days old with little to no flavor. The fact that they were so nice and that they don't let kids touch the jukebox give them the only two stars deserved....
