Went here for dinner last night and have to say I was a bit disappointed. The ambiance is nice, unique, well-designed open space and the prices were very reasonable, but I was not wowed by the food. We shared a bunch of appetizers and main courses. The scallops were bland while the crab ceviche was too gingery and you couldn't taste the crab meat. With the exception of the scallops, the flavoring of the dishes overall were a bit too overwhelming for my tastes. The high light was the hangar steak, really tasty at medium rare. Sea Bass was also solid. Dessert a bit on the skimpy side but we ordered tiramisu at a thai place...not sure why.
