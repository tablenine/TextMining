Restaurant: Sotto Sotto Restaurant
Category: Italian
My favorite restaurant in Atlanta, hands down.  Everything is perfect.  There are fancier, artier, more haute establishments worth trying, but Sotto Sotto is love.  The kind of love that secures it for anniversary, parents visiting, 'aw baby i'm sorry' make-up,  and otherwise celebratory dinners for years. . . The service is the best: seamless, informed, enthusiastic without any pretension.  I've never had a server that I didn't read as a fellow foodie or that I wouldn't want to chat and have a beer with.  It's about the food and wine, man.  No eighteen-hour corporate food trainings here.  It's all real-time culinary and oenophile fervor in this piece.. . The drinks:   The sazeracs are amazing.  The cocktail list is unassailable.  So is the wine list.  If you're going all out, try an Amarone.  You won't be disappointed.  . . The food:  Fuck yeah.  Share everything with your dining companions.  Highlights: the tuna tartare, the olive plate, the mushroom risotto, the whole fish with spinach and roasted potatoes.  Believe me when I say you cannot go wrong.  It will be good: moaning, eye-rolling good.  . . It's special occasion dining for sure.  That's what love is, after all.  You can thank me later.
