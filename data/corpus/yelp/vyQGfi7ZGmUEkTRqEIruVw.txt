Went here for my mother's 61st birthday (I mean 40th, sorry mom...).. . Great steak, superb service, incredible ambiance, but not even remotely economical, yet that's to be expected in the heart of Beverly Hills.. . To be perfectly frank, nothing about this place's food makes it any better than Mastro's.  There isn't any exceptional creativity and the quality of beef hits a ceiling after a certain point, and the only thing different between the two restaurants is the exorbitant price.. . Well worth the visit, just don't forget  your wallet.
