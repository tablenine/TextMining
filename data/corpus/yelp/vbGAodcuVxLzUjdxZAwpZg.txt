Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Hello cute waiter!  Ok I had to get that out of my system (what? he was cute!)  On my first day in Chicago after dropping off my luggage, we found this place right off the metro exit.  It looked interesting, and we were all starving so in we went!  After looking around the restaurant, I realized that all the paintings were kinda creepy.  Um.. really? A guy with a fish head?  Black nose? A guy breaking another ones neck?  PRETTY AWESOME!!!! I actually liked the creepy decor cause it gave the restaurant a totally oddball feel!. . For my order, red curry with chicken and brown rice- other orders were the spicy basil noodle (which turned out not to be so spicy), the hot pepper noodle which was good, and for drinks I had me a mango margarita.  I will tell you that it was nothing like a margarita except for the fact that it was tequila... I think they used mango juice, and salted the rim of a martini glass.  I requested it blended, I got it shaken.  However I will not complain, because that drink was SO good!  I hate tequila normally and I couldnt even tell with that one.  I was definitely happy with that :)  . . The red curry was really good- had a great kick to it, and the hot pepper noodles were good too, although I did like my red curry a lot more.  . . Great food, strong drinks, awesome decor and a cute waiter. What more could a girl want!
