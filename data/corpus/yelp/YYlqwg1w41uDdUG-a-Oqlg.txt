Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
Sticky Rice is my favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago. The Northern Thai goodness that they serve up is absolutely delicious. Many of the dishes on the menu are things that one does not usually encounter at a standard Thai place, such as fried worms and blood + intestine soup. They also, however, serve up familiar Thai classics like pad thai and curries. Everything that I've tried from here, exotic or not, is delicious. The green curry is the best I've ever had, and spicy spicy spicy. If you order your food spicy here, they really will make it spicy-I personally love that, but be warned. . My favorite things from here at the Northern Thai dishes, such as the Gang Nor Mai Ya Nang, a very hot, green soup with bamboo shoots and ya nang leaf, and the Gang Heart of Palm red curry soup. The pad thai from here is also really delicate and flavorful and fresh. The thai iced tea is wonderful. And, of course, who could forget the eponymous Sticky Rice!!! It has a wonderful texture and is fun to eat. The only thing that I've had here that I would not order again are the fried worms. There is a novelty factor there, and they are not bad, but they basically just taste like a fried shell with nothing inside. . This place is BYOB. Bring a six-pack-it will help with the spice factor. . Sticky Rice really is the best and most affordable Thai in Chicago. Go, go now!
