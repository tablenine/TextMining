Lauren bet that we couldn't finish the pancakes and we couldn't.  They were so big and delicious(thats what she said).  I love breakfast burritos and the mexican hangover burrito was the best burrito I have ever had EVER.  This was the most epic breakfast that I have had in a long time x 3.   EPIC  BREAKFAST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
