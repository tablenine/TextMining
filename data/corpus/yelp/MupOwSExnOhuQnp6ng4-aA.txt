Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Finally tried a couple hot dogs after watching my boy Huell go up there.. cause all they years in LA I couldn't bear to stand in the line.. was it worth it? mmmm ... yeah. The chili dog was great, the Guadalajara dog- soso.. unfortunately I felt like I gained about 10 lbs. ..still I love the dogs.
