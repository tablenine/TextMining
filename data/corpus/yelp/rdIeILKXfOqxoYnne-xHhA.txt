a great way to eat drink and talk a few hours away at this cozy tapas places.  patatas bravas and croquettas were the table's favs.  get there at 530 when it opens to guarantee a table.  they won't sit till the whole group is there.  we saw many a long face standing along the wall with coat in hand waiting for a table when we left.  but the food and service were good and fast.  a dozen tapas can disappear quick, so don't expect tapas to be inherently cheaper than a square meal.  dinner was still about $50pp.  but a good fun place to chat and eat and enjoy some wine.
