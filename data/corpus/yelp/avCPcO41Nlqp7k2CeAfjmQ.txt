Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
It's very telling when you've spent more $ on your booze than you did on the food. . . Went last Sunday for a late lunch. Sat outdoors got a small bit of  sun as it was quite brrrr....outside. . . Tried a pomegranate cocktail, well no I had 2, as well as my friend and we spent $50.00 on just the booze. . . Tried a fried squash blossom, which is essentially a poor man's version of what you would get at Mozza. . . We split a salad, which had pancetta, cranberries and lots of goat cheese. Next was a pasta dish, nothing spectacular, some linguini with olive oil, capers, garlic, roma tomatoes and shrimp. . . Too stuffed and too lazy to walk over to the gelato bar. Sadly the salad was the best part of the meal.. . I know it's not fair to try to compare this place  to Osteria La Buca, but yeah leave the authentic italian to someone else please!
