Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
We used to get Tender Greens a lot for work and I can honestly say I never got sick of it.. . Perks:. . -Nice big salads with interesting toppings (steak? beets? fresh cheese? sold.). -The "Happy Vegan" will make you happy, vegan or not.. -Mashed potatoes are made with butter, love, and crack. You'll want more, even if you're not a potato person.. -You watch them cook your food while you wait, so you know it's super fresh.. . Cons:. -I never order the grilled veggie plate and I always wish I had once I go down the line and see all the beautiful veggies on offer. But really, that's my problem and not theirs. . . They're great for when you crave comfort food (get the steak plate with Â mash pots and the hazelnut/goat cheese salad) or when you are trying to be healthy (organic locally grown grilled veggie salad).
