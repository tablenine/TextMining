Came here this morning to cure a hangover... and delicious food definitely does the trick!  I love the ambiance and it was pretty packed around 10:30, which is rare for a thursday.  But I guess it's just that good.  The place has a comfortable feel to it, I could probably sit there for hours and just relax but... limited meter parking.  what a downer.    . . They had a superb breakfast menu.  We got the Muscle Beach and the Old World, both were hearty and wonderful, both $7.95.  And with a side of potatoes or fruit, and toast!  Good deal?  I'd say so!!  I would definitely come back here more often for their breakfast food if it weren't a 20 min. drive.  But it might be worth it if I'm ever craving eggs... which I always am.  im a sucker for breakfast foods!
