Rating: 3
Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
The food was amazing, which is pretty much what every review of this place says.  However, the set up is AWFUL.  Waiting an hour for a couple of hot dogs is LAME, under any circumstances.  Based upon the food alone, it's definitely a 5 star place but their concept of making people wait FOREVER is deeply flawed and as a result, all I can must is a 3 star review.
