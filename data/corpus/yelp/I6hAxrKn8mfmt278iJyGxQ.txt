Overall 3.5 stars.  My gf and I stayed in Pasadena over the weekend and thought this would be a great place to check out for brunch given all the rave reviews on Yelp.  The service is friendly albeit a bit slow during the busiest moments.  There were a number of large and diverse groups dining together here on Sunday:  a group of senior citizens, two large Chinese families, and a group of 20-somethings valley girls spouting phrases like "oh my gosh" and "totally" over the din of silverware and other quiet conversations.  There were some other couples here and there, but large groups seemed to dominate the scene.. . The selection of food was not overwhelming by any means, but it was adequate presented.  There were a number of delicately prepared finger foods and sushi available to peruse and enjoy.  Overall, the food was pretty tasty, but nothing in particular stood out as a "wow."  I liked the miniature leek and crab chawanmushi and the bit of prime rib w/ red wine reduction I had was pretty good.  Overall, the quality of the food was pretty good, but the sushi could've been of higher quality.  I think the white tuna was the best out of the sushi they had out on Sunday.. . The dessert side provided a great selection... the mini creme brulee was quite tasty and rich.  Honestly, good coffee and creme brulee went together SO well... it's hard to find a better combination.  Yum!  The flan was pretty decent, and there was this raspberry tart thing that was really really good.  It had a sweet, crunchy top, with a raspberry filling... really tasty.  You would not know there was any raspberry in the darn thing until you actually bite into it.. . So yeah, overall the experience was pretty good... the fresh squeezed OJ was a nice touch as was the decent bubbly.  For $36, it's not a bad bet, but there are better places out there.
