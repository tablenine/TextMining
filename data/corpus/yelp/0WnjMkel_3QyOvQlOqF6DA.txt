It really is as good as it gets... I love you KATSU-YA, i wish i could afford you all the time... or one of my dates could..... they have a salmon dish with caviar on it,,,, yummy!!! they have an albacore dish w ponzi i think ut i ask them to put yellow tail belly instead and tey do... YUM OHHHH... geez what else... i cant think right now... im longing for katsu-ya so bad!!! Try everything, trust me, its the best you will find in my opinion. make reservations, or you will be waiting.. oh and parking is a bit of  a  pain in the ass..
