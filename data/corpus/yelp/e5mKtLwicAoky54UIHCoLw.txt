Review for the BAR area only. . . Hmmm . . . why do I have so many reviews of restaurants that refer to the bar area only? ANYWAY. Went here last night with a friend after work - fantastic! Stylish, upscale, modern lounge with cute and attentive bartenders. A couple of free appetizers and Barbarella on the TV screens embedded in the walls.  . . And men of Chicago? When two women are sitting at the bar with their heads together, talking, do NOT shove your hand BETWEEN them to place your empty glass on the bar. YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU, DUMBASS! Proper protocol suggests that you excuse yourself, and reach around BEHIND one or the other of the women to get rid of your glass - like the WELL MANNERED guy in your same group did. Watch his actions, 'K? He was also cuter and better dressed then the two of you lot. . . Other than the idiot alert, this is a great bar. It's attached to the James Hotel, which is always fun people watching. Trying to guess which beach-outfit-clad-after-five woman with ENORMOUS breasts are escorts is always fun.
