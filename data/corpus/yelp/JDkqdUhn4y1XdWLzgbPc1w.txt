Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
I was very enthused to try this cullenary delight. The atmosphere of Cemitas was very appropriate for what I was prepaing to eat. I tried both the carne and enchilada cemita. Both were exquisite but I would suggest the enchilada Â delicious! The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that the sandwich was quite small. Also I tried a burrito and they were nothing to write home about.
