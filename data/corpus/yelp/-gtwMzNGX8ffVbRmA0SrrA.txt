This place has all the possibilities of being great...but, unfortunately, it is just "ok." Salad...fresh ingredients...great location...cool employees should equal a great culinary adventure. But, when the deed is done, the flavors are very tentative and the ingredients (the flat iron steak and the ahi/nicoise, specificaly) were not that great. I've been to this restaurant a couple of times now and had different things...and the same story. I guess my recommendation for the owners is to take more care in flavoring-up the individual ingredients, and think about how the flavors work together more. I really want to like this place, and will continue to go in hopes that some day I will say, "that's GREAT."
