The best vegan food I've ever eaten! I had the December special- Mexico City tacos: two crispy tacos made with red chili beans, tempeh and vegetables, smoky chipotle cream, avocado, fiesta rice, and roasted plantains. TALK ABOUT DELICIOUS. The flavor of the taco mixture was out of this world, cumin delight! Paired with the chipotle cream and avocados, it was PERFECT. This is the kind of dish you want to eat every day; then again I am a mexican food addict. My bf had the club, with RFD's own tempeh bacon and breaded seitan. It was also very enjoyable, and apparently the salad was great too. We ended up taking a 'faux-stess' cupcake to go for our roadtrip back to SF. This baby was loaded with rich chocolate and was very very moist. Take that animal fat! Only downside is that lunch cost us $50 but damn is it vegan, organic and delicious.
