Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
As I sit in my tiny freezing apartment in New York and write my first Yelp review ever It all becomes clear where my heart lies. Los Angeles is a disjointed city. It's a place of stunning contrast. A place where everyone seems to think they truly understand it's vastness. I am not one of those people. After living in your midst for 34 years I realized it was time to say goodbye to L.A. Time to say goodbye to In-N-Out, Tommy's, The Boat (R.IP.), certain specific Taco trucks, certain specific noodle joints and Korean BBQ spots...aw who am I kidding. I need you L.A....I miss you sooo much. My stomach yearns for your comforts. My waist aches to grow back to it's optimized size. I will keep it short and sweet. "Manuel's" El Tepeyac is the first place that sprang to my mind when I looked at my newly created Yelp account and it announced that I had zero reviews. I can tell you that I was not surprised at all to see all the negative and positive attention that such an establishment would receive. It is a polarizing place. They serve ginourmous portions. They use lard. Their prices might seem a little steep, but I guarantee you that you will feel extremely full when you leave and I think this is largely what makes it a truly Mexican-American experience...an East L.A. thing. The flavors are perfectly placed and the textures...incredible from the delicious cubed meats concealed within their famously over-sized burritos or the delicate fried eggs perched atop my favorite dish "the Kiko's Special" inviting me to pick up my fork and free those yolks so eager and proud to be a part of a rolled enchilada masterpiece. And guess what? They have a bumpin' jukebox....the end
