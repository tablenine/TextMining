Delicious food and great beer selections! I can't ask for more... . . When I entered, the line was a bit long but I guess that's how you know you found a great food joint. You order first and then grab a seat in the back. They have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap and also bottled beer. The menu is pretty self-explanatory too. No surprises. . . I got the Sun-dried Tomato and Mozzarella with caramelized onions &amp; sweet peppers and my boyfriend got the Chicken Apple and Spices with caramelized onions and spicy peppers. I usually don't care too much for gourmet sausages but this place was pretty damn good! And it goes especially well with a beer in hand! . . It's open late and the people are friendly. The only complaint would be lack of parking spaces. We were lucky to get a close spot but, like most of LA, its all street parking. Anyways, it was a great way to end the day. But beware of food coma! I passed out afterwards...
