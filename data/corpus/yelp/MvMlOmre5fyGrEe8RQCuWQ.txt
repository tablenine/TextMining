Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Such good food and enough patio space for everyone!  I went here before I went to Argentina (not right before, but just before) and I think that the food here is better than the food we had in Argentina.  The food here (from what I recall) had some spice in it...or at least the option to add some of your own, while restaurants in Argentina do not.  So, yay for options!  Argentina has much more affordable shopping than the stores on Melrose though...there's trade-offs for everything.
