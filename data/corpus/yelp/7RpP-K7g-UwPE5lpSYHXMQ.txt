Give me some great chocolate cake inside a store filled with beautiful, handmade and quirky clothes and doo dads, line the walls with travel books, provide me with everchanging art shows and I'm pretty much yours for life.   Cozy, energetic, and glimmering with the attention to detail of it's owners and creators, it is the quintessential independent coffee shop.   Great indoors and out.  One of my favorite places to hang out.. Great people watching, too.
