The reviews were off the charts with this place. . I thought waking up in the morning, getting ready for my carb fest was going to be much of the same-an amazing pizza experience. . . I was deflated as soon as I took my first bite. . The Tricolore salad with anchovy dressing was very good. . We got the fennel sausage pizza, and I was so disappointed from there on out. . . It tasted like a bruchetta. Having been to one of the oldest pizzerias in Italy, I do know that this doesn't come close to an authentic pie if that's what Yelpers have been saying. . . I think the best part of the experience was sitting at the bar where you get to see the pizza dough rolled out and cooked in the wood fired oven. There are also some interesting combinations such as pineapple and jalapenos. I'll give them credit for the creativity. . . I will not be back here again. Call me too American, but I like sauce, cheese, the fixings so to speak that I am accustomed to.
