Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I had a pleasant dining experience with friends despite mixed reviews about Ugo. We started with some wine at the bar next door. Our selection was nice but we had a long wait despite reservations (I tend to get a little grumpy after a while).  Once we were seated everything was really nice. Our server was polite and on top of her job. She recommended a fantastic Sauv Blanc to go with my pasta, which was fantastic; I had the linguini with shrimp. The shrimp was fresh and flavorful- not fishy at all. My friend had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly with fresh and delicious vegetables. Our dinner arrived at our table in no time at all. . . The place may not remind you of mammas cooking back in Naples but I recommend Ugo to anyone who likes light Italian cuisine. It has that Euro café feel to it; it's loud and the tables are close. The crowd is hip and mixed. The location in downtown Culver City is wonderful! Ugo is a cool spot to bring friends or a casual date.
