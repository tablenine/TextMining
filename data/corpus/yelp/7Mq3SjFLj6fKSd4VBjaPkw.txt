Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I've never been here, but for delivery this place is awesome.  It's valentine's day and one of my best friends didn't have a valentine.  To remind this person what a great friend they are, I placed an order at Bossa Nova (a restaurant choice made strictly from Yelp reviews).  They special created a pizza with a smiley face of pepperoni along with mushrooms + fresh tomato's.  The guy only charged me an extra $1 for the individualized pizza and a hand written note.. I also ordered some of the Brazilian soda, which was highly recommended.  They delivered the goods within an hour of my order and my friend was nicely surprised and slightly embarrassed since I had it sent to their work.  Food for all!. Two thumbs up for the delicious pizza!  Next time I'm in LA, I will have to stop by.
