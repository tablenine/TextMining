TRADITION.....  Roscoe's is the spot after every Magic Mountain trip I've made.  Have no clue how this came about, but it's just the way it is and has been.. . After a long, exciting, and tiring day, I've always loved ending it with some good ol' fried chicken smothered with gravy and of course the renowned waffles.  . . This last visit was exceptional though.  They were closing at 10 pm and we were literally flying on the freeway to get here on time.  We pulled up on the driveway at 9:55 and I literally jumped out of a moving car to get in and make sure that we were able to make it in and eat.  . . We made it and they told me that they were only taking to go orders since they were about to close.  We were a party of 9 and that was perfectly fine with us.  Shoot, we'd eat at their parking lot if we had to at that point.  They started coming out with our orders in to go boxes and one of the servers was just so sweet.  She told us to stay in there, use one of their long tables and eat there while they were cleaning up.  Not only that, she was actually still waiting on our table making sure we had refills, condiments, water, etc.....    Service this time was amazing and of course, like all the other visits, I left this place in a food coma!
