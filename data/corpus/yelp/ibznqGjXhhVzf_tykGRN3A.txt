Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
I was so excited to finally be in Chicago to try the infamous Giordano's Pizza. It was listed the best deep dish in Chicago, so why wouldn't it taste good? Sadly, I can't say it  lived up to it's reputation. It definitely wasn't disgusting but I felt like the place was a little overrated.. . It took a full 60 minutes for our pizza to come.  Thank goodness we ordered the combination platter appetizer (so worth the $10.50) and a bowl of broccoli cheese soup or else we would have died of starvation. I don't know what the hell we were thinking, but between three adults we ordered a large of both The Special and The Spinach stuffed crust. Personally, the special pizza tasted just like Costco's combination pizza. I preferred the Spinach one out of the two because it had a lighter and fresher flavor. I loved how I could taste the fresh basil in it, how extra cheesy it was, and  how soft and wonderful the crust tasted.--yummo! I was stuffed after two slices.
