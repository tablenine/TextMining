i am thrilled i no longer have to mad dog people for their seat.  =) i love  the restroom setup. the red wall is beautiful. i couldn't help it . i stopped for a closer look and feel.  the food of course never fails in its wonders. oh and there's plenty of free parking!  expect lines... but not a terrible wait if you arrive early to miss the happy hour crowd.
