Category: Latin American
This was my third time here and this time I came with a friend who I wanted to take out for her belated birthday. We got seated immediately on a Saturday night around 6:30pm, and ordered drinks right away. I got the lemonade and my friend got the sangria since the couple next to us had ordered a pitcher and it looked yummy.. . The best thing about LaLa's is their chimichurri and their bread. It's SO GOOD. I could eat just that and walk away satisfied. It was my friend's first time having Argentinian food and she was amazed by the bread and dipping sauce, and we kept eating it throughout out meal even after our shared appetizers of an empanada and salad came.. . For our main course, we shared the Milanesa Napolitana which is basically thin breaded steak with melted cheese and tomato sauce on top. It's huge! We couldn't even finish it (after all the bread, salad and filling empanada).. . For both of us it came out to about $35, which I thought wasn't too bad considering that we were stuffed and the food was delicious. The service was okay (the waiter gave off a weird vibe to me), but the food was great, the atmosphere is great, and the price is great. I'm definitely coming back for more casual dinners and to try some new stuff!
