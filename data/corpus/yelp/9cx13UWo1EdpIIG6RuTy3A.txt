Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Milk is a great café for a small chain, at least in terms of food and location. The Milk locations tend to be in really hot areas, like on Beverly Blvd., a block from Susina Bakery, or on West 3rd St, near other famous bakeries like Joan's. . . In terms of food, too, Milk is great, especially for variety. You will find everything from ice cream to cookies, brownies, and cake. It's especially famous for the ice cream, which is supposedly some of the best in the city, though I'd respectfully disagree. I personally prefer Fosselman's or some of the gelato places in town. In general, though, the dessert quality is excellent. In fact, I can't imagine a better velvet cake anywhere (blue velvet in the case of Milk). The Molasses Cookies are also phenomenal.. . Some of the better things I've had: . . 1.  Ooey gooey cookie--It's like a soft, cakey brownie. It would have been very good if a bit warmer, but it was cold. It might have also been better earlier in the day. Still, it was falling apart good, and an awesome brownie-type cookie.. . 2.  Blue velvet--Mega Keeper! Probably the best thing in the house. Very well made. Extremely moist. Very BOLD flavor. Lots of blueberry in there. Frosting is right on too--great balance, great quantity of frosting to cake. Very heavy cake, but it's one of the best velvets I've had--comparable to or better than alcove. Stick to this! 9.5/10+ easily.
