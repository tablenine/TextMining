Unimpressed.  I held off on writing my review after my first time here about a month ago.  It was the end of fasting for me, and I showed up STARVING and grumpy...didn't feel that it was fair to write a review in that state.  But after time #2, I still feel the same.  . . I did enjoy the mix-and-match methodology, but didn't even bother finishing my way-too-dry turkey burger (topped with corn &amp; black bean salsa, avocado, and jalapeno jack cheese).  Maybe the "real" meat creations are better?  As mentioned in other reviews, the sweet potato fries are delish, as is the coffee shake.  But I'm not awarding more stars for the side characters, when the main attraction is so lacking.
