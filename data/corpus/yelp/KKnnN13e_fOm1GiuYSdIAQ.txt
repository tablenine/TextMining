Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Not much to say, but sometimes that's a good thing. In this case, I can sum up Fellini's in a few simple phrases:. 1. Tasty, inexpensive pizza by the slice. . 2. Pizza + beer + patio = My kind of afternoon. . 3. A staple for late-nights on Ponce. . 4. The white pie is bangin'.
