Restaurant: No Mas Cantina
Category: Mexican
We stumbled upon No Mas during our tour of lofts in Castleberry Hill. Entering the establishment, I thought that I was actually in a restaurant in Mexico. With their open-air patio and setup, I think it is a fabulous lunch spot.. . We were not too hungry, but we did have some drinks and some appetizers, all of which were very good. I would definitely recommend their guacamole, it was very fresh. Overall, we had a great time, however, our waiter was a little overwhelmed and we were there an excessive amount of time.
