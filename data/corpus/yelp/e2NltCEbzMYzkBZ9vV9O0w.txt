This place was very pricey but amazing! The lady had the scallops and I had the yard bird! Both were superb! 3 cocktails + 2 app + 2 first course + 2 entrees + 3 sides + 3 desserts = Happy 26th B-day to my lady!! Decor was super dope and the wait staff was charming. This place rules but it's no Rathbuns!
