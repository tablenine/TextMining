I returned here recently after a long absence. Food is still great, although I've mostly confined my recent dining experience to calamares, camarones and other seafood dishes. Parking is reasonably easy and the staff is still efficient and attentive, although the place can get very noisy. This food, obviously, is much better than what most Cubans eat in Cuba but it's also better than most U.S. Cuban competitors.
