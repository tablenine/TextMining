My girlferiends and I went to Devons on a Friday night so we missed the Happy Hour lobster tails at costs.  However all of the other appetizers and drinks were great and at a great price.  We spent 3 hours laughing our butts off as we ate and drank ourselves silly.  Valet is only $9 which is also a cool deal.  We plan to return for the lobster tails next Thursday.
