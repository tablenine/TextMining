I get excited just thinking about going to Porto's.  Like, unnaturally excited.. . Porto's potato balls might be the greatest thing on earth.  I'm just sayin'.  Just typing the words 'Cuban sandwich' made my mouth water a little bit.  I also love their baked goods, coffee mocha, and their IN-credible cheesecake with strawberries on top.  . . They are always insanely busy, but they operate like a well oiled machine.  It is shocking how they manage to get that many people moving through that place as smoothly as they do!
