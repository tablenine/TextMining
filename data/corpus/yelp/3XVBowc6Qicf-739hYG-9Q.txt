Versailles is great and I've been coming here since I was a kid.  I usually get the Famoso Pollo Versailles (Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken), which comes with a huge amount of chicken, fried plantains, rice and beans.  The chicken is super juicy and flavorful and the sweetness of the plantains is a nice contrast on the palate.  I also recommend the Yuca Con Mojo (Steamed Yucca with Garlic Sauce and Onions), but stay away from the fried yucca.  They have a bunch of cheap imported beers to wash it all down.. . ---. Take Big Blue Bus #12 or Metro #33, 333 or Culver CityBus #1.
