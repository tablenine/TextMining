Total disappointment!!!! After all the hype and pics posted on yelp I was super excited to try this place out... to bad the food was a little less than mediocre!!!. . I ordered the okie burrito, they should change the name to "ok" burrito cuz thats what it was, O-K!!! The enchilada sauce tasted like it was out of a can and the asada was loaded with fat!  I've had better burritos @ albertos!!  Guac was ok and horchata was nothing special... The only thing thats kewl are the huge portions.......
