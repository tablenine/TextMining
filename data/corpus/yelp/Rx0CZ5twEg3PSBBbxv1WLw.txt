We went there for my friend's bachelorette party dinner.. . Yes, the mac &amp; cheese with truffles is as amazing as everyone says.  We were seated in the patio, which was nice in a summer evening.  . . However, the service was terrible.  We kept on having to hunt down our waiter when we wanted to order, get our check, etc.
