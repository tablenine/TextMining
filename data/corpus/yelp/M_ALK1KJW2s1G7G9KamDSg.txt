Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Honestly the fried chicken here is good but it isn't the BEST it was just all over hyped. The waffles on the other hand though is what seriously i believe is the best thing about Roscoe's. Food a little bit pricey for some chicken and waffles but nonetheless still a very good place to eat!
