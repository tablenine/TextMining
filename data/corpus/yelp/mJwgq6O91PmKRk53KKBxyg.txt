I'm going 3 stars, because there was nothing really amazing about the place, despite years of hearing about it.. . I had a sweat pea soup, which was like split pea, but fresher. Nicely presented, but it could have used some more flavor.. . Then a chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado, which was tasty, but not $14 tasty.. . I kept looking at the menu thinking "where's the rest of it?"
