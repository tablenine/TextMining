we came here for brunch today and it seemed very hoppin rockin and many people were talking, mary poppins? she wasnt there, but the place reminds me of her flying on the rooftops.. .  it rained on and off, mostly off as we sat outside and was very busy circa 11am saturday.. . got the chorizo baked egg dish and a side of potatoes (which i was not supposed to be disappointed by the waitress assured).  also got the bourbon french toast with pecan. freakin A! the french toast is what i should have got, thought I.  but i permitted my company to finish the rest with great restraint. . the chorizo egg dish is pretty weak, its like a fragile smashed wafer cookie that was smashed to little itty bits when the big and burly jolly green giant said fee fi fo fummmm, ! i wouldnt get this again unless you wanted something that tasted rather unremarkable like all the people with iphones these days. it had a tortilla bottom and lots of onions/red bell peppers in a ratio of 10:1 and the 2 pieces of bread garnish on top, which were capital A - Absolutely necessary. . . the potatoes also were a bit sparse and decent, not bursting with flavor, so i added some salt which made my heart smile.. . will come back to try that salmon benedict and that pecan french toast unless i discover how to do it myself. . . service was average and outside was brighter and better than inside which seemed a bit dark and depressing given the rains of today.. .
