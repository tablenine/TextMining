Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place is hands down my favorite place for breakfast/brunch. I've been coming to Toast for the past couple of years and and have never been disappointed. The food is always good, the coffee is strong and the staff is terrific.. . There's a reason why there is a line and people waiting on Saturdays and Sundays - you won't find a better place in terms of atmosphere and food. . . The atmosphere - a very inviting place to sit , eat and relax. Not too loud and everyone is friendly. From the wait staff to Jill the manager, who is possibly one of the most personable and funny person I've had the pleasure to meet, they're absolutely terrific . Best seat in the house? The counter. Trust me. . . In terms of  food -. . If you're a sweets type of person for breakfast - the French Toast Orgasm(stuffed french toast filled with marscapone, chocolate and strawberry covered in yogurt, fruit and honey)  will satiate and possibly overwhelm (in a good way) your sweet tooth. By far my favorite thing on the menu. . . If you're a salt type of person - you can't go wrong with one of their omelets or the B.E.L.T sandwich. . . Bottom line - an all around great experience that keeps packing people in and bringing them back time and time again.
