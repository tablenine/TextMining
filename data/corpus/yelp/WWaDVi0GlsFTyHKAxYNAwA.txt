OMG! I have been here many times and don't know why I ever went back after the first. My best friend went when they first opened and had warned me that the service was bad and the owner, Brad Ruben was very rude. Each time I had been, I knew she was right. He is very very rude and the service, very bad. Believe me, this guy isn't giving anything away. He actually charges for mayo with a turkey sandwhich....are you kidding? Please don't insult me! I grew up on the North Shore and know good delis. The food is average and over priced! Most things don't come with fries either. He also charges Xtra for that! Can you say CHEAPSKATE! Oy Vey,,,,I would never recommend or go back!
