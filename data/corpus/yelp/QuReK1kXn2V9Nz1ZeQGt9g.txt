Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
I'm here at least 3x per week. Â My regular: the Eggs 2x4 with Chicken Sausage and Egg Whites, is always delicious and served fast.. . If you're looking for a diner atmosphere, but with good food and quality music, or if you're just looking to do some hardcore hipster hunting, Fred 62 is the place.
