Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
the decor is great, intimate dining areas with little turkish style tents and cute chandeliers. the food is tasty if you love garlic like me, they have a variety of choices you won't see anywhere else, like garlic/vanilla flavored ice cream.. everything is garlic. garlic flavored wines, garlic breads and spreads (which is amazing. you have to order it though). still, i feel its a bit overload of the garlic and leaves your mouth with a strange tingle by the time you leave the restaurant. also, your breath and BO will smell of garlic for the next 2 days.. remember to wash well and mint and fragrance it up!
