i really REALLY wanted to love this place, just like i wanted to love urban belly.  but alas it just was not meant to be.  i love bill kim's food conception, fusing korean with puerto rican flavors, but holy salt lick batman, my korean bbq kogi sammich was overwhelming on the taste buds.  whilst i enjoyed the familiar flavor of bulgolgi/kalbi + kimchee type fillings, it was just WAY too salty.. . my husband got the asian meatball sammich, he said it was pretty good, but nothing amazing.  i enjoyed the addition of mint and noodles in a sandwich.. . the tostones were tasty, loved the limey chimichurri. and you just can't go wrong with crispy plantains.. . for dessert we tried the bacon chocolate chip soft serve.  i was disappointed that these were toppings, and not mixed in/incorporated better.  but it all worked together anyway.  the more i ate it, the more i wanted. especially mindy segal's chocolate chunk cookies -- i wanted to take home a whole bag of these.. . even with the disappointments, i will be coming back to check out the other sammiches -- i also really want to try their belly dog, which is on their website, but not on the menu. i hope it's one of the "secret menu" items and not some seasonal thing.
