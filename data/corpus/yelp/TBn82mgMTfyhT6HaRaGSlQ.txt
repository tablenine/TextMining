I've been coming here for years. You know it's a fairly authentic spot to grab some Japanese food when it's frequented by Japanese in Atlanta as well as having nearly 100% Japanese staff. In fact, while learning Japanese I would practice with the staff and they were more than happy to oblige.. . The sushi is fabulous and fresh. I always choose Omakase (or Chef's Choice) and typically choose the second price tier. The chef always chooses the best cuts and varies the selection based on what is fresh at the time. Kyuri-su is also VERY good here. That is the cucumbers in vinegar - it's excellent! Most places fall short, but not at Hashiguchi. Other favorites here are the steamed mackerel, the miso soups (hot and cold), and the creative dishes that run on the daily specials. The specials don't always change from day to day, but it varies enough to find something new every time. Everything at dinner is virtually a la carte and can easily be shared, so I've never had the same meal combination twice - though I nearly always want the omakase!. . If you're looking for a good lunch, this is a great spot to go! The mennu is much smaller and consists almost entirely of bento boxes, but the pricing is great and the quality of the food is just as superb as the dinners.. . The waitstaff is always friendly and never forgets a face. I still get asked about my Japanese classes even though that was years ago! Two things to beware of: They are not open on Sunday (a day I often crave their food!) and while you can park in their lot to visit the stores in that strip, do not walk across the street to Lenox - you will find a boot on your car and pay a hefty fine to have it removed!
