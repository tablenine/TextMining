This place in my opinion is weird and pretty much sucks.  For the amount of money we spent on our meal, while edible nothing seemed very appetizing.  Service was great until we wanted to pay, then the waitress totally disappeared.  Oh and the grumpy old guy who sat us... why were you giving us a dirty look for choosing to eat at your restaurant?  Weird!!
