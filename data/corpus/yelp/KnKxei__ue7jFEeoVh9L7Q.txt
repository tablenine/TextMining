Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
The food here is just as good as any other Versailles!  I've been to this one and the one on South La Cienega and this place is a great date place to have a plenty of space to sit down and eat your ass off.  The other is just a fun place to run in and grab a bit.. . The parking lot sucks but what can you do for good food?  I say again order the chicken or the pork and you cant go wrong.  The food is just so damn flavorful.  Of course the menu does state the garlic chicken is great which I have ordered and loved but my garlic favorite is reserved for another garlic hot spot of mine..... . You'll absolutely just love the decor and the ambiance and the music... Granted I'm sure its nothing close to cuba but we americans can dream, no?
