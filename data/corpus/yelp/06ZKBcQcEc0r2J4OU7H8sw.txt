Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
Well, a girlfriend and I popped into Pure by default because Fritti was packed with World Cup viewers. I ordered the Torta Cubana sandwich based on our waitress recommendation and was pleasantly surprised. It was a very large s'wich and quite flavorful. I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich, but this was pretty darn good. My friend tried mine and she loved it too. I wasn't very impressed with the other menu selections, especially for this to be a Mexican spot. . . I thought their menu selections were a bit pricey for Mexican. I mean everyone knows that Mexican is CHEAP! OK, the chips and salsa were just average, nothing fancy at all. They serve the salsa in a very small container, much like the container you would be served at most restaurants when you order a house salad. Whatever happened to bringing out a small bottle of salsa so we don't run the h#ll out of our waitress. Two dips of that salsa and it's empty.. . Overall, did I like the first time experience at Pure...Yes. Will they be in my regular rotation.... No. Remember, I had a Cuban sandwich at a Mexican restaurant. The menu selection left something to be desired.
