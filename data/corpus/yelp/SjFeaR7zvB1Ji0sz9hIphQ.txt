i'm glad i came with friends who have been here before and knew how to order. we ended up getting a bunch of shrimp, crab legs and corn in a variety of flavors (all the flavors basically taste the same to me) and spice levels. we also got the fried catfish with fries and tartar sauce which was good. i felt like i ate a ton but didn't feel disgustingly full. . we got there at 12pm and there was already a line. they won't seat you unless your entire party is present so we were worried but we got in ok.. we went and got frozen yogurt afterwards. mmm...
