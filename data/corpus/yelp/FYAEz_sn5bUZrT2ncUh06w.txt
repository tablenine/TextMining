Restaurant: Cafe Sunflower Buckhead
Category: Vegetarian
Year after year, Café Sunflower always manages to win the top marks as Atlanta's best vegetarian restaurant. Because of this I find myself trying to like it, even though there are at least  1/2 a dozen better vegetarian restaurants in Atlanta. Over the last 3 years I've tried just about everything vegan on the menu. I have never been completely disappointed but then again I've never been completed inspired either, at least not with the entrees.. . I do have to admit that there are two items off the Café Sunflower menu that I will order, to go, every time I'm in the neighborhood - their Vegan Spinach Dip and the Vegan Carrot Cake. The serving size on the vegan spinach dip is much much smaller than what you typically would think of for a spinach dip. It is really an appetizer for one. Nonetheless it is perfectly creamy and cheesy and always makes me second guess whether or not it's vegan. There are no words to describe the vegan carrot cake. It is hands down the best carrot cake I have ever had. It was actually recommended to me by one of my omni friends who also thought it was the best carrot cake she'd ever had. But other than these two items I tend to be pretty unimpressed with the Café Sunflower menu. But, if you find yourself drawn there a couple times a year, as I inevitably do. Here are my recommendations:. . For full review head to . http://veganguineapig.....
