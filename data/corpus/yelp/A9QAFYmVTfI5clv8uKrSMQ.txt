Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
My friend raved about this place so I went with her [for my first time] and I wasn't particularly impressed.  Maybe she convinced me it was good so when my parents were in town, I took them here [but most places on Sawtelle weren't opened yet].  We all agreed that it was ok and that we'd probably not come back [and I haven't been back since then.]  It's a very nice restaurant, and service was good, but the noodles lacked that special something.  With so many food options on Sawtelle, this is not one of my favorite places to eat.  We tried a lot of different noodles here at Chabuya and none blew us away.  The prices here are also more than other noodle places in the area.  One time we stopped in to order take out and the wait was atrocious--I think they had forgotten about us and our order.
