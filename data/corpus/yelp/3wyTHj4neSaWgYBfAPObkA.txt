can be really good if you know what to order. for example, first time i went i ordered white meat. wrong decision!. white meat was pretty dry. second time i went i ordered dark meat and i never looked back! so moist and delicious :). . i really really like their fries too! and their mac &amp; cheese is good.. . definitely good fried chicken!
