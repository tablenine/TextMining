I figured Alcove would be a great place for great people watching when I came here for brunch last weekend.  But, when I got there I wasn't so sure.  I was hoping for at least the token celebrity sighting cuz this place is in that up and coming Los Feliz artsy hippie dippie neighborhood that I had heard so much about.  But, as soon as I got there I knew there wouldn't be a single, anorexic actress anywhere in sight, right???? Because the portions were HUGE!! . . And, so it goes I was surprised when I didn't see a single fat person.  I did, however, see your wanna be actress (AKA someone who actually looked like they eat 3 meals a day) clutching her little overweight chihuahua the next table over, which made for mediocre table conversation. . . Although the food was good, the charming, outdoor seating was by far the most pleasurable part of my meal.  I should have just ordered the latte and called it a day.  Because, THAT would have been the perfect experience at Alcove.
