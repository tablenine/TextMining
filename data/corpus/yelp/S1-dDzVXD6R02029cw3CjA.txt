Absolutely out-of-this-world fantastic food.  This isn't some place you go to often, but if you're looking for a yearly fine dining experience, this is the place to go to.  Everything is seasoned so well and fresh.  We made reservations for a Tuesday night but we probably just could have walked in since there were still a couple tables open.  The service was great and the place is not pretentious as others have been stating.  You're going there for a contemporary dining experience, it's not going to look or act like a McDonald's.. . I had the Carmelized Endive to start.  It was the perfect mix of burnt/smokey flavor combined with sweet blood orange.  Next I had the Fingerlings which were AMAZING.  So, so very bad for you but amazing.  Then I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli which was very creamy and cooked perfectly.  By then I was stuffed, so I had some Monkey Picked Tea (supposedly hand picked by trained monkeys) which I pretty much only got because it was called Monkey Picked.  I had a cocktail with dinner also, the Red Winter, which was surprisingly pretty good.  It was a red wine base with elderflower and cinnamon.  They used dry cinnamon which kinda stuck to the glass and didn't add too much flavor, but it was a nice touch.
