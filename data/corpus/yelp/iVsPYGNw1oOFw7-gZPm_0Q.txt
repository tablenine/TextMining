Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Stand up front and watch them make your dumplings, but don't stand too long because you will be corralled by those going in and out of the narrow entrance. I am not sure if I was in Arcadia #1 or #2-I was at the one with Wells Fargo Bank shared parking lot. Note: park in the lot if the bank is closed.. . You will have to wait when you go. Oh, and make sure your entire party is there if you want to be seated. They will seat you as soon as possible, but have everyone there.. . Hot &amp; Sour Soup = great way to open the meal. Steamed Pork Dumplings = MUST; extra juicy-read the instructions on the chopstick wrapper. Steamed sesame buns = yum dessert; looks intimidating. Fried Rice = good balance. . It was a pretty good experience. We were seated way up front, so the worse thing about our night was the lady at the front yelling out numbers. Oh wait, the worse thing was bringing a birthday cake and not being allowed to eat it-somewhat understandable. Not understandable is clearing our table off while we were still sitting there-I know they're busy, but damn kind of hurt my feelings
