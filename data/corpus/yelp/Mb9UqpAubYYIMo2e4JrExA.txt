Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I'm 50/50 on Kitsch'n. I go there a lot but usually only because it's right next door to my boyfriend's house. They have an amazing tuna melt, Wow BLT (with avocado!), and grilled cheese (pick your own cheeses!). However, most of their breakfast options are pretty bad. I had their Eggs In A Basket and it was terrible--overcooked and flavorless. A lot of it you can just cook at home for less than half the price. Dinners are yummy for the most part. I've only been there twice but I'd recommend a fish dish I had there. As far as service goes, I'd say it's pretty lackluster. I always have to wait to even see a menu--and this applies on random weekdays, too. The waiters aren't particularly friendly and don't seem to like working there. After all this jabber, I would say definitely give it a try, but come with buddies you can chum it up with so you won't get irritated if you have a bad experience.
