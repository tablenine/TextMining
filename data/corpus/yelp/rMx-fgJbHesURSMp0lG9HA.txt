I reeeeeeeallly liked the atmosphere of this place..I felt like I was in New York.  There's a bakery, deli, bar, and restaurant all rolled into one! We ordered the portobello fries (not crazy about), some salad (ok), pizza (very yummy), some other appetizer, and a yummy white wine.  Sorry for being so vague, but I went about a month ago and don't really remember.  I guess the reason for the high rating is the atmosphere...I really like it and I felt like I took a trip out of L.A.  and I loved looking at all the food and pastries...and good looking waiters:) To me, all that's worth 4 stars any day:D
