Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
The french dip sandwich ain't bad, possibly worth the calories, and thankfully not a huge portion. I was looking around on my tray for an extra cup of dip to actually dip the sandwich in, hence the name french dip, but apparently it's not served that way. They were out of turkey so I had to go with beef.. . Fat tire on tap is very much appreciated, although I was wary of ordering a glass of one of the higher-priced wines - re-corked for who knows how long? The diner-style desserts did not look very appetizing. Â Philippe clearly belongs on the list of places that people love just b/c it's been around so long.
