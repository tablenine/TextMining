Used my guest card from a magician up finally after holding on to it for 2 years lol. . . Close up Magic,  B (because they all expect a tip). Intimate shows for 20,  A+!. Medium sized room for 60, we were number 61,62, so on :[ so didn't get to see it. Yeah, there are lines for the shows so expect to wait in line.. Big show,  C (but it all depends on the weeks, different magicians cycle in and out). Dinner,  C - Unfortunately they probably won't improve the quality for their meats because it's a mandatory meal everyone HAS to order something around 15.00 dollars regardless. . Picture taking,  F- , They were very firm about no picture taking inside : [ . . I really doubt it's going to close anytime soon so don't believe the rumors : ] It's a special place but I doubt I'll go again.
