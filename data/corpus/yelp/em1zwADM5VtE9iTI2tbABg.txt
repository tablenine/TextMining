I've never had a bad experience here... sure it's touristy... sure the wait is long... and it's not exactly cheap... but when you have out of town guests, it's a surefire hit!  I usually have pasta and end up eating my leftovers for the next 3 days.. . About the wait... if you've got your little buzzy device, go out the back door towards the restrooms. There are benches that you can wait on away from the hustle and bustle.. . I docked them a point for the ludacris system they have for the line.  There is ALWAYS a line and it's in the busiest part of the restaurant in this narrow passageway.  They should move the check-in station somewhere more accessible.  That HAS to be a fire hazard.
