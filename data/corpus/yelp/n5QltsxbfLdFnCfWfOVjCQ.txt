OK...I guess.  But there are better options in the area.  Service is probably a D+ or C- depending on the day - adequate to barely adequate.  If you only like rolls, you might like this place better than I do - I'm more into sashimi.  For that, the fish is definitely fresh enough, but they don't know how to slice it - more like butchering for them.  And they served mine with warm plain white rice instead of sushi rice which really threw me off.  I do like their tempura a lot though.  . . Oh - for a head's up.  If you order a spicy tuna or something like that and they ask you if you'd prefer mayo or chili - the mayo is the standard recipe and for the chili all they do is squirt the fish with a ton of korean ketchup.  My buddy found this out the hard way.
