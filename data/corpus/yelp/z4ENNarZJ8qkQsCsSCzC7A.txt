I'd give this place five stars if it weren't for the terrible, terrible service. . . The food is absolutely something to die for, that I'll promise you. However, if you're looking for a quiet and relaxing place to grab a quick bite, this is not your dive. They are very popular and consequently VERY busy...at almost all hours.. . My only suggestion is to sit at the sushi bar and ask for Jeff. His suggestions are noteworthy and service a ten.
