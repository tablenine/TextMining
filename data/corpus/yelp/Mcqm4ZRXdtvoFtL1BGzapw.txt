This place is great. The pizza's are delicious - they call them "flatbreads" as an excuse to get creative with the toppings, and to pay homage to the world historically "putting food on bread."  The fact that all the ingredients are organic is a perk.  The flatbreads are individual sized and are so yummy that I rarely have leftovers. . . The pizzas are  are much more original and less greasy than those at  at Piece. In fact, the pizza style and restaurant atmosphere is so different there is really no comparison. . . The menu wording is a little silly in a playful yet informed way. The atmosphere works for a casual lunch date, or a place to bring the family and kids. We took our little nephew the other day and got to sit out side... It was lovely and delicious.  . . Try also the pulled pork sandwich and Italian sodas.. . Also- when we went with a large group, they were very accommodating and seated us pretty quick. They gave us one of those flashy-beeper things, so we could window-shop while we waited.
