My friends like it and i'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt but as far as their katsu curry goes, it's pretty mehhh, the cutlet is small and thin, sorta like milanesa rather than the thick chunks of pork that one usually gets. . what was even wierder was that the curry was pretty bland, lacking the flavor and kick that i'd been craving. I'm pretty sure i'll be back there though and i'll update on whatever else i get because it'll probably be better.. . they have ozoni, and my friend swears by it
