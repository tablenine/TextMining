Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I'm still on my quest for LA's Best Burger Ever, and after hearing about this hyped-up place for months from the blogosphere I finally got to try it! . . We found street parking on the street right before the little Umami Burger plaza since the little lot was valet only for $2.50, and it was like a 30 second walk. Interior was small and cute and pretty cozy, and the staff was really friendly when we asked them what was inside the burger.. . The food: I got the Umami Burger without mushrooms since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, and my friend got the SoCal burger. Both are basically the same except the cheese (mine had parmesan crisp) and hers had butter lettuce in it. Cooked to medium rare, the burger was SO JUICY and tender and perfectly cooked, with the oven-dried tomato, the Umami ketchup and the deliciously soft and buttery bun complementing every bite. We got a side of skinny fries and shared those, and when the burger first came out I thought it was really small but after all of that and the fries, I was pretty stuffed.. . Overall, a realllllly good place. Prices are $9/burger and like $3 for the fries so cost is reasonable and quality is great! I will definitely be coming back again for a burger fix. And you should too =)
