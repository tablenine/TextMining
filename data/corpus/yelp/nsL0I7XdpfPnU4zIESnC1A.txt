Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
Don't let the name fool you.  Yes, it's in Buckhead, but no, it's definitely not a diner -- at least not in the traditional sense of the word.  Stepping into this place is like flashing back to the early 1900s.  The servers are dressed accordingly, and the decor is such that it denotes images of old Hollywood.. . The Bleu Cheese Potato Chips are always a treat.  The rest of the food is far from where it used to be a few years ago.  Still a strong option for dining.
