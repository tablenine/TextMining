I gave in...I went on twitter and followed them ... I'm not a big twitter person, so I actually went and downloaded a twitter app for my phone so I can find the freakin' kogi truck on the go! . . Turns out they would be in front of the brig in Venice...on the same night as Carnavale in Venice...so I figure I might as well stay till the Kogi truck arrives. Plus my sasquatch has never tried it, so I thought he might like it. But he got too hungry before the Kogi truck even came so we grabbed a whole pizza pie from Abbot's and ate pizza while waiting in line for Kogi, is that bad? Anyways...the truck came and set up and I was surprised that the line was short. Is it because the hype has died down and now Kogi has other competitors or perhaps its because last time I came it was in the Greater Cerritos Area and there is a bigger population of Asian people than in Venice. Either way, I liked the shorter line. . . Minus one star for the kimchi quesadilla. I don't think I like it that much, I like kimchi...but I just didn't like the cheese with it, or perhaps it was too much kimchi for me in one sitting. . . Next time I'm sticking strictly to the tacos or perhaps I'll try a burrito. And there will be a next time Kogi!!! I'm coming back for more when I get that craving again. My Sasquatch liked the pizza more...but he's a pizza man.
