Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's hot dogs are excellent. If the dogs weren't skinny, this would be a five-star review. I've tried a few different combinations, although I can't remember which specific names off the top of my head, and all of them have been great. Anything with the chili on top is a definite must. . . Like everyone else will say, I'll tell you the line is long. Get there before you're starving to death and be prepared to wait. Make a day out of it by continuing down La Brea to the tar pits after you eat or something and stop complaining about the long lines. :)
