Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
DISAPPOINTED. saw man vs food. read the reviews. got hyped up and even dragged some friends.. I thought the food was ok. apparently, everyone else thought it sucked.. . Burritos are MONSTROUS (they'd better be for 9 bucks). the 5 lb burrito took 4 people to finish. . What they give in quantity, they definitely do NOT match in quality.. . Chunks of meat were decent, although everything tasted a little "off". I'm hoping it was just an off day for them. One friend describe the salsa as "ass-like". . i've had plenty of better tasting mexican food. tepeyac is a notch above your average taco truck, but that's about it
