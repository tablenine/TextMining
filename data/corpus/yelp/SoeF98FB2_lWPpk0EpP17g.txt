Brunch Review Only.. . There are plenty of good places for brunch in Wicker Park &amp; Bucktown, but I had been ignoring the one closest to me for some reason, and so I decided to go to Forno yesterday.  What a delight!  . . The Wait:. Getting a table was no problem, which for this area can sometimes be quite difficult.  If you have ever driven past Toast on Damen or Bongo Room on Milwaukee on the weekend, there are lines out the door, and the waits can be an obnoxious 45 Min's to 1:30.  No thank you.  So getting a seat right away was great (it was 10:45 when i went).    . . The Food:. I had one of the best brunch meals ever.  It was the Oviollol Diavolo (i probably totally misspelled that).  It was eggs, Italian sausage, pomodorro sauce and fried polenta.  WOW!  Best brunch meal i have had this year.  I also tasted the Eggs with Lentil beans which was much lighter but also very flavorful.  The rest of the menu looked great as well.  The three of us didn't drink, but we did have coffee, and the bill for the 3 of us was a reasonable $40 total.. . The servers were great and not pushy.  The noise level was low so we could talk comfortably.  And then what a great view of the neighborhood while you eat.  Next time I will try a different dish just to make sure i wasn't lulled into writing such a good review by the two dishes i tasted.  I imagine though that the rest of the menu is equally good.  . . Can't wait for my next meal there.
