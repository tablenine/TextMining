Clearly I have an addiction to Canter's Bakery. How do I know this you might ask?. . Simple. I have no other way of explaining how BOTH homeless guys who poach up on the late night tip at Canter's BOTH say in unison tonight, "Oh, there she is. Hey baby, how you doin'?". . When you're there so often the homeless dudes see you as one of their own, not someone to panhandle a few bucks out of, yea, you clearly have a problem. Now excuse me while I cope with this realization and dive into my bag of cookies and cheesecake ($10).
