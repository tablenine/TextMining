I recently went on a vacation to Atlanta and stopped here before heading back to the airport.  I only had an address and hours, no yelp reviews to give me a preview of what I'd find.. . Yes, they have vegan choices for breakfast (yay!) but it's a little limited in choice (boo).  Of the three vegan choices (I asked the waitress what was vegan), I had the Bionic Breakfast.  Loved the orange sauce!  It was easily one of the most colorful breakfasts I ever ate.  It's also inexpensive, this was a double plus as I was low on money on the tail end of my vacation.. . Service was ok.  Not unfriendly, but not exceptionally friendly either.  I loved all the bluebird tchotchkies, as blue is my favorite color.  It was a nice wrap-up to my trip. Should I come back, I'll definitely stop here for breakfast one day (though I still prefer R. Thomas for a vegan breakfast).
