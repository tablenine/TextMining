I have been here a half dozen times in the past year and don't think there is a better more consistent joint in LA. The quality of the beer and the selection is always great. It is more expensive but well worth it. The food is well prepared and tasty as anything I have had in LA. Â I am a true believer.. . That said there is some truth in what people say about the seating and service. If you are looking for a sit down or quiet experience this is likely not for you. I however always find that they have enough bartenders on staff so that there is little waiting. I have found that staff to be knowledgeable, enthusiastic and agreeable without being LA phony (pardon me). The seating makes the whole shebang very democratic and egalitarian for being in LA. It is like an upscale beer garden.. The burger is a great example of the genre. The more esoteric menu offerings are prepared with craftsmanship and style. Can't wait to go again.
