After reading such rave reviews about this place, I figured I'd give it a shot. The vibe is pretty cool inside and the people are friendly, but the food is bland and unimpressive.  I think the reason that vegetarians love this place so much is because they've forgotten what real food tastes like. I've tried a few things on the menu to give it an honest shot, but find myself with no real desire to go back.  It just isn't for me.   . **note: the sweet potato fries everyone is recomending are actually worth ordering.
