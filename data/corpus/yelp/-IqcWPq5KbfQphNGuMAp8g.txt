Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Hands down, my favorite steakhouse in LA. The off menu side of gnocchi and lobster, shaved truffles and cooked in truffle oil is the absolute best. The seafood tower is great if you have 4 or more. Service is always on par, at the very least. The bone in filet used to be one of their selling points. I personally prefer the porterhouse and have never forgave myself after deviating from it. The sides are what really distinguish this place from Arnie Mortion's. Mastro's sides are huge, can share between 3 or 4 depending on how many sides you get. Upstairs has live music (usually a poor excuse for Sinatra, but classic steakhouse). Kinda creepy the huge portrait of the owner located on the second floor. Bar both up and downstairs, both equipped with a couple TVs. I had my bday dinner there and sat over by the bar upstairs as the Lakers won the title last year. If only their chocolate lava cake was as heavenly as Morton's....
