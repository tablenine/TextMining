Wurstkuche.. . Do you know how long it took me to pronounce that right?. . Wurstkuche... pronounced as "worst cooch"... but not "worst cooshay" or "worst koochie" (((( UPDATE: a fellow foodie friend just told me it is more like "verse koosh." ok. now i know.. i still like "worst cooch" better."))))(((( UPDATE #2: according to Rick Wren if i want to get even more proper,it's pronounced  "voorst kooch-eh". sorry Wurstkuche! *smiles*)))). . But any how, I am a big fan of this place! Who would have thought that tube steaks, beer, and gourmet Belgian fries would keep me coming back? I had the duck/bacon/jalapeno and the Louisiana hot links so far and have been more than satisfied with both visits. I suggest getting the large fries and sharing so that you can get two of their dipping sauces. My current favorite so far is blue cheese bacon and the BBQ chipotle.. I also suggest you study the menu thoroughly before you go. This place gets pretty packed so their line should be moving like clockwork. Any lag shows that the person ordering is a newbie. Don't want to be that guy, nahmean?. . What makes this place awesome, I think, is that this is the place to get a bunch of folks together and just chill. Music is playing loudly by their in-house DJ. Drinks are poured generously. Lighting dim. Ambiance is great overall. Great place to take a second date. (Great for a first date if you go in the guise of "friends" and you are just checking each other out.)
