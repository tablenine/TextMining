Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
Great service! Our server was fast, welcoming, and gave good recommendations. The brushchetta was really flavorful and fresh. We also shared the large salad with gorgonzola and dried fruit between two people and it was really satisfying. The front tables by the open window were a treat, but they are very close together. I will go back to try to pastas another time.
