Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Been here three times.  Every single time I have been amazed at the freshness and quality of these sandwiches.  My favorite had smoked salmon, avacado, white cheddar, and chipotle chutney. SOOOOOO gooooooood!   . . The beer list is incredible.  Seriously. There have to be a couple hundred beers.  . . High in quality and kinda high in price...I still recommend Jerrys.
