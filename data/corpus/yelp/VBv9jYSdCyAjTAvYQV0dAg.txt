Best burger I've found in Atlanta thus far, make sure you read the rules, come hungry, and be patient while you slowly starve. I promise you it's worth it. The ghetto burger is fantastic, I'd skip the fries and save the room for the burger. My strategy: No fries, water, and you can finish the whole thing, provided you can put away some food. Oh. yes. make sure you and everyone in your party brings cash. You don't want to be the one paying for everyone else and getting cash back later because your company came unprepared!
