Ok, I have to revise my review of Hide upward.. . I've been there at least 5 times since I wrote my original review.  And the fish is usually great.  Sure, sometimes the fish is sliced raggedly/thinly, but I have never again encountered fish of such poor quality as I did the first time I went.. . The chirashi is still one of my favorite comfort-food dishes in town.  I've also since discovered the spicy tuna rolls - while I usually don't order spicy tuna (sushi snob!  :D  ), they are delicious at Hide - spicy, not too rich, fresh fish, big portions.
