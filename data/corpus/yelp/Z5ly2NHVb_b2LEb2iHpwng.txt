I may have only eaten here once, but it's definitely a place I'd come back to. . I tried the Filipino Maharlika, only because I was curious as to what it would taste like based on its name.  It definitely reminded me of longanisa.  I had a friend that tried the Duck, and another friend that tried the Rabbit &amp; Rattlesnake.  They both thoroughly enjoyed their meals too.  . . I accompanied a friend once who ordered a to-go meal.  Because we ended up waiting so long he said "I gave you guys an extra fry".  Me and my friend thought he was just being funny and saying he added an extra slice or something because he and his co-workers were acting a little loopy (possibly had a few beers while working hmm?) but when she opened the bag he had actually given her an extra set of fries.  What a nice guy!. . I would probably like this place even more if I enjoyed beer as everyone else that I hang out with.  I haven't gone here for a beer yet, but this place is pretty busy everynight.  The line can be absolutely ridiculous --going out the door down the street.  . . It's nice to know there's a hidden gem so close to school.
