Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
This place is awesome!  I saw somebody posting that they didn't like it.  They are of course wrong.  The owner of this place is super cool too.  . . Yeah, maybe the ladies working behind the counter have some crazy arm hair, but nobody's perfect.  They make bad ass fish tacos and shrimp tacos!  The only other place I've found so far that I like better is up in Ventura, so unless you're going up there, this is your place.
