Restaurant: Southern Sweets Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I found out via a friend of a friend that this is the place making some of the incredible vegan desserts I've had around town. Whenever I've asked, I only heard, "we have someone make them." . . Finally I found out it was Southern Sweets when preparing for my wedding a friend excitedly proclaimed, "THEY MAKE VEGAN WEDDING CAKES!" Alas, my problem had been solved, &amp; as a vegan, I wasn't doomed to have a wedding with no cake.. . Deni is the employee who talks to you when you walk in asking wedding cake questions. He set up a tasting for me, which was very impressive. He sits down with you while you sample their cake flavors, frostings, &amp; fillings. He goes over sizes, tiers, decorations, prices... the whole bit. The tasting costs a mere $20 &amp; goes toward your cake if you choose them. You take the leftovers, &amp; we ate cake for 3 days straight. . . My price for a 2 tiered cake for 40 (decorated) plus a 6" bachelor cake to save for the 1 year anniversary was a mere $158. A *vegan* wedding cake for that price &amp; quality is amazing. . . I was told the vegan chocolate cake is their top seller, of all the cakes. Oh - and not only are they a bakery. They have sandwiches, soups, etc. They're a stone's throw from the Dekalb Farmer's market off Laredo.. . 5 stars, no doubt.
