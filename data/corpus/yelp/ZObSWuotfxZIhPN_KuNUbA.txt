We went on a weekday evening and the line was short. The counter lady was efficient and nice - the double dipped beef was pretty good. The horseradish mustard can blow your head off. In a good way. The macaroni salad was tasty. But the best thing was the dill pickle. Really crunchy and tangy! I know Phillipe's is an LA institution, and I think for good reason. But is it the best french dip I've had? Not really, but I'd definitely come back.
