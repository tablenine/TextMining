This is a drink window review. . . The line was super long when we stopped by and I was like, "People wait this long for boba?". . Well, let me tell you that I learned my lesson!. . These gimungus cups hold a lot of sweet, sweet drink. I like watermelon lychee with boba. It was like the most perfect smoothie that I've ever had. . . Like the softest shave ice that you could ever find in Hawaii but a tad better with the natural watermelon and lychee flavor. MMmmm.
