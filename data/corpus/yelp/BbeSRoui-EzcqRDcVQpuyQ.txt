We came here at 2am and saw no line.  That is, until we actually got in line and realized that it circles back and forth a little.  The wait was bearable for first-timer me, since I spent my time looking at the menu and trying to decide what to get.  I finally chose the Guac Dog, which in retrospect was not the best choice, cause there is such a thing as too much guac and nothing else to balance it out.
