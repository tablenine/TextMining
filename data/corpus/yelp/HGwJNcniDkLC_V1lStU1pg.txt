Restaurant: STEEL Restaurant &amp; Lounge
Category: Asian Fusion
I have tried this place on 3 different occasions-- once for a date, and twice with a party of 4 or more.  Each time I went, it was like a totally different atmosphere and a completely different restaurant altogether (minus the physical building, of course).  On a date, I would say this restaurant was pretty great.  The tuna tataki here was FABULOUS.  I still think about it to this day =) On a different occasion, however, I was with a party of 4 and the service was not nearly as good as the first time we had been there.  On a less than busy Saturday night, we were seated at the booth closest to the door, which already was slightly annoying considering the obvious vacancy of some of the more desirable spots in the restaurant.  The waitress seemed pretty clueless and even ended up getting a few things wrong on our order.  She completely misunderstood our request for a certain type of tea and mistakenly brought us something completely different.  After about an hour of sitting in a relatively quiet restaurant, the hostess sat a party of 6-8 directly beside us in a high-top. It quickly became very loud in the section we were seated in and needless to say, we saw it as our cue to get up and leave.  All in all, the food at Steel was better than average but the service and the atmosphere was definitely a bit on the tacky side.  For the money, I'd say there are much better places to go in Atlanta.  Unless you get the Tuna Tataki.... mmmm ;)...
