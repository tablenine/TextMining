Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
oooohh my goodness gracious!!!!. . Roscoe's is de-freakin-licious! I have been wanting to try chicken n waffles for awhile now and I finally had the chance to when we were hangin out in Hollywood the other day. And can I just say, that I was 110% satisfied. I loved the atmosphere, it was friendly and loud and chaotic and wonderful. The staff was super friendly as well. . . We split 2 orders of Scoe's (i think it was either #2 or #3 on the menu) between 4 people and it was plenty of food. The combination of the fried chicken and the hot sauce with the sweet mapley buttery waffles was divine. I will definitely go back whenever possible! yeeeaaah.
