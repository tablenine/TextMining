This cute funky little neighborhood restaurant really brings home the bacon. It's right around the corner from where I work so I eat lunch there frequently with the hubs. It only took two visits and Randy considered us "regulars" He is hysterical ! I get a great lunch and entertained at the same time.. The sweet potato fries are too die for and it's the curry type dipping sauce that Â just sends them over the top. . Make sure to check out the specials, they've always been winners! Today we both had the jambalya, perfect blend of spice and heat with lots of yummy shrimp and sausage. . Oh and grab a glass of freshly brewed red zinger iced tea to wash it all down.. Try this place once and you'll be a regular too!. Next on the agenda is to drive in to Midtown on Sunday and have breakfast with the family unit!
