What a great place for brunch!  My husband I came on a Saturday at noon (prime brunch time) and were seating in five minutes.  We also found street parking almost immediately.   . . The service was friendly and the drink orders came out fast.  I got a coffee (delicious) and my husband got orange juice and a blended chai.  For our meal we got the blueberry pancakes to share along with the Kamil's Breakfast.   We had to peruse the menu twice before we saw this jewel.  The description read something like this "Pan-fried macaroni with eggs, cheddar cheese, garlic, bacon, and chives".   . . I'm not kidding when I say that the Kamil's Breakfast might be the best thing I have ever had for brunch  It's a treat to say the least.. . **The next day we were wanting to go to The Griddle Cafe on Hollywood for my husband's birthday.  The line at The Griddle was around the block.  I called Blue Jam and they said my party of 7 could be seated in 15 minutes.
