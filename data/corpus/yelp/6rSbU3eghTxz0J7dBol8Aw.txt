Warning: This review is majorly influenced by the GNO (Yelpettes out on the town!) last night. Oh my stars &amp; stripes what a wonderful time was had by all the lovely ladies of Yelp last night at HB. . . I could not have imagined a staff more accommodating that the ones at HB--seriously folks they were amazing. Although, I have to blame one of the servers for making me get up &amp; go to the restroom a billion times last night--he kept filling up my water glass--thus making Mandi say I had a childs bladder :-) . . Let's talk ambiance--if you are looking for a romantic place to take that special someone, look no further. The warm hues, candles, dim lighting, and cozy seating make for some uber romantic tones (hello date night!). The space is also very intimate, so you will not be drowned out in your lovey dovey chit chat by large crowds (unless of course there is a GNO going on). . . THE FOOD--my word it is extremely (trust me I rarely use that word) tasty. . The highlights for me--the bacon wrapped dates--like eating delicious candy.  I have to say the brown sugar they put on top is not necessary.  Also, the pinapple bread pudding---oh lordy--DELICIOUS!. . We were treated to the delights of a prixe fixe menu of: . starters...choice of... . ARTICHOKE AND EDAM FRITTERS with a roasted garlic aioli . ALMOND STUFFED DATES, wrapped in bacon and baked with brown sugar . MUSTARD CRISPED CRABCAKE on a white cabbage salad with old bay tartar sauce . BROILED HOLOUMI CHEESE with rose petal jam and rye crisped . DUCK AND TRUFFLE MOUSSE PATE with house made pickled vegetables, dijon, rusks . . mid-course . a mixed green salad served family style . . then..main course choices of . SLOW COOKED MOROCCAN STYLE CHICKEN COUSCOUS with root vegetables, spinach, savory broth . WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO with crumbed goat cheese, roasted tomato, truffle . CIDER BRINED LOIN OF PORK on red potato au gratin with braised collards, sauteed pears, toasted walnuts . SAFFLOWER RUBBED SALMON FILET on creamy polenta with roasted asparagus and a tarragon pesto . SHELLFISH CHOUCROUTE (our house specialty)...housemade saurkraut, with smoked sausage, tiger shrimp, mussels, and clams over mashed potatoes . . dessert... . CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHIP BUNT CAKE . GOOEY PINEAPPLE BREAD PUDDING with candied macadamia nuts . BLOOD ORANGE CREAMSICKLE MOUSSE . . Of course there was lots &amp; lots of sharing going on and that was greatly appreciated--it was wonderful to try all the different options. I would like to add that the portions were generous &amp; the quality was superb. I tried pretty much everything &amp; found fault in nothing. . . A word about the Staff &amp; Chef, they could not have been more accommodating, friendly, useful and all around wonderful if they tried. You can tell they love what they do &amp; they believe in the food they put out. The Chef came out a couple of times to make sure were okay &amp; that my friends is QUALITY! . . So all in all--GO NOW!
