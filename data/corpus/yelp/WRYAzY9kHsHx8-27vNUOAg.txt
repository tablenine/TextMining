Category: Asian Fusion
This place is so good it has practically ruined me of any other Asian restaurants. And it's so cheap! My favorite dishes are the Tofu Cabbage Wraps, Coconut Soup and the Massaman Chicken Curry. But I have had many of their items, and haven't ever tasted anything I didn't like. Love the healthy and vegetarian options. Wish there were more locations around the city, but this place is worth the trip!
