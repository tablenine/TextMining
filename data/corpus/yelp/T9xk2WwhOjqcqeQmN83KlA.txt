It's o.k.  Just too damn crowded.. . While I was in China, I noticed that not too many people were going to the Dintaifungs in Beijing and Shanghai.  Also, their Xiaolongbaos got nothing on the xiaolongbaos in Shanghai's Yuyuan Gardens.  If you ever get a chance to go to Shanghai, that's the place to go to for xiaolongbaos.  They got xiaolongbaos with freaking crab and shrimp meat!  And of course, everything is cheaper.
