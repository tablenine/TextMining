Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Greasy-ass, deep fried, expensive tacos piled mountain high with yellow cheddar cheese. The lines are so long you would think they are giving them away (which they are NOT) and the line is filled with ghetto-fabulous people and creepy molester types that are probably eyeing your wallet as you pay and planning how to mug you on the way to the car...... . Which brings us to the next problem: parking. It sucks. Just save yourself the body work on your car and park on the street next to the freeway underpass where all the hobos sleep.. . On the upside, this place proudly has the most inefficient system for ordering food in all of LA. (I challenge anyone to prove me wrong. Â Email me. I dare you!). Literally. No Joke. No exaggeration. The same person takes your order, prepares your food, and charges you money! - All on a counter large enough for 2 lines! And did I mention the lines are long? Yep. Long. And how!. . Their hot sauce.... hold on one second. Let's start over: Their sauce IS NOT HOT! Just blended tomatoes. Mild sauce from Taco Bell is spicier. Seriously.. . Oh, and good luck finding at table. Bonus points if you can find a clean table.. . Their food is edible. And I've been there several times, you know I think its at least ok..... and see I gave it 3 stars..... . Maybe I'm just trying to do MYSELF a favor and shorten those lines at Tito's. Hmm.... . PS: 5 tacos w/ cheese, 2 small drinks, and avocado sauce for $18 dollars. Do the math.... kinda pricey.
