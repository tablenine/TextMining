Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Went back to Mozza after being underwhelmed the first time and wanted to give place another shot.  But once again, I'd say the experience was just above average.... . The Pros: are that the antipasti really are fantastic, you could probably order any one and it would be good.  However, I was there especially for the fried squash blossoms which somehow they ran out of right before we placed our order, then got back right after we had eaten other dishes! Pizzas are good but you really need to order the right ones- I found the bacon and goat cheese pizza to be very dry  but the squash blossom pizza was great.  Another pro is that the wine list is well maintained and does not have any bottles over $55.. . The Cons: Parking is $10!  Totally outrageous, especially considering that you can just drive past the restaurant and park on the street.  Also, it's a hassle to get a reservation- typically a month's wait for a decent time. And the tables are REALLY close together, we had to shift ours every time someone wanted to get out of the tables on either side of us.. . Overall, food is a solid B but points off for the parking, the reservation hassles, running out of stuff I want to eat (and have waited a month for!), and me having to sit in my neighbor's lap.  I'd advise waiting for the hype to die down before trying Mozza.  As it is right now, I feel like the emperor has got no clothes (o.k., maybe some briefs) but people are oblivious.
