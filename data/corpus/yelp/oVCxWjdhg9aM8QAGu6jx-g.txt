I CANNOT visit LA without stopping by this joint... I have to thanks Cathy for taking me here and devirginizing me with CHICKEN, WAFFLES, and the SUNRISE... Â The food is great, the atmosphere is irreplaceable, and the service wait is never too long.. just enough to make your mouf-piece water while watching other people eat... I wish they had this establishment in the Bay Area... in the meantime, Meritt Bakery will do!
