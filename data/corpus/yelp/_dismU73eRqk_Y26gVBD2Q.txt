i've been maybe 10 times, always sit upstairs.  its cosy. once you do, you wouldn't consider the sterile 1st floor.  sushi is always great, service attentive, and its all reasonably priced.  . and they are open late, often until 2, so industry people can sometimes visit after work.. i always leave content.
