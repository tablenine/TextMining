Okay, so I'm on a burger eating mission 'cause I think Californians do burgers best and while I'm visiting this fair state I plan to conquer the land that brought us the wonder that is the Big Mac.  Helping me on my quest is my trusty best friend who insisted that I try the Oinkster burger and I have to say, thank god for best friends.  . . We split a cheddar cheeseburger with a side of fries and a Ube shake.  The ground is simply seasoned and juicy and I love the 1000 Island style dressing and the soft toasted bun.  I'm a huge fan of mustard and their homemade mustard is amazing and if I could, I will spread it on all my food.  The fries were crisp and not too salty and fantastic dipped in the garlic aioli and the chipotle ketchup. . . And now I must dedicate a paragraph to the Ube shake.  Let me get centred first because I really need to convey to you all just how friggin' mouth wateringly awesome this taro shake is.  I'm not usually a fan of that synthetic powdered taro flavour but it mildly flavours the creaminess and plays nicely against the sweetness and it adds an interesting twist to a quintessential diner burger-fries combo.  It is faneffin'tastic!. . I love Oinkster.  It is a special place.
