I LOVE GARLIC!. A friend said I should eat here because they have garlic everything, including garlic ice cream. So I got reservations from . http://Opentable.com.  and I was able to get seated immediately when we go there. We got the Banga Calda appetizer, which is garlic soaking in a bowl of olive oil set over a small flame, which tastes great with the bread. To even it out we got popcorn calamari, which was fairly tasty. Â My favorite was the Garlic Prime Rib...mmmm...I added a pint of Guinness to go with it. We were so full we didn't think about the garlic ice cream.
