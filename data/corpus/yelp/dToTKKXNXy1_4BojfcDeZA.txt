Sometimes the camel in me comes out on the weekend.  One meal a day is all I can squeeze  between my extended slumbers and late night antics.  So, if there is only going to be one meal, it better be a good one.  . . Fade to Coobah.  I was in the Southport hood Saturday and stopped here with my partner in crime, Lee, after missing most of the other brunches in the city.  Oops.. . This is a cute little place.  It was pretty dead when we arrived but  the service was great.  I had the jerk chicken sandwich with mango tomato sauce/salsa.  It was delicious - I could have eaten the chicken plain.  Lee had the crabs cake benedict but I don't do crabs (or any other shelled animal) so I didn't try it.  I did swipe one of her potatoes and it was very tasty (and not greasy at all.  I like that in a home fry)!. . The bloody mary (OK bloody maryS) were freakin' awesome.  SO GOOD.  I loved the spice factor, cheese garnish and the tall glassfuls -no skimping there!  LOVED them.  . . I was glad I was in the area to try out Coobah.  I don't know if it is my favorite brunch spot but those bloodies, DANG!
