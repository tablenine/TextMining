just got back from lunch here.  . . service was very attentive and a manager even came over to say hi and complement my friend on her cute baby.  . . food was good (i asked for spicy sushi and it wasn't that spicy at all), decor was busy, music was too loud, esp since it was a late lunch and there were like 10 people in there.  no need for it to be deafening at 2 pm on a thursday, you know?  . . my sushi came out sooner than my friend's salad, which is due to their two kitchens.  ooookay.  . . but they were accommodating to the stroller we had and they did have a high chair.  but no bathroom changing table.  i would go back and i hear they have good deals for happy hour.
