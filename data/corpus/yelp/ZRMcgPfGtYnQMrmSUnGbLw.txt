I went here for happy hour not too long ago. They have some pretty good cheap eats at that time. I think it's M-F from 4-6 but don't quote me on that. I had the $2 oysters, calamari, and chipotle shrimp. The shrimp was fresh and delish but I didn't care too much for all the chipotle flava going on around it. The oysters were very good although not the best I've had. Calamari was on point.. . I'd do it again. Even though my less than cool ex lives down the street from this place. I might have some bad memories if I walk down this stretch of Chicago again...fricken men. Â Type of guy that makes you wanna do crystal meth from time to time, cant believe types of guys like this exist, good thing I got out of that, Better have some awesome seafood and strong STRONG drinks to make me forget!!! Oops my social filter just got punctured with a huge hole!! sorry I shared too much!!.............end of review.
