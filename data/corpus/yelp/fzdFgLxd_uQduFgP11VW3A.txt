Restaurant: Roebling Tea Room
Category: Coffee & Tea
I would come to Roebling Tea Room strictly for the roasted halved grapefruit! Mmmmmmmmmm.... they've inspired me to start making this at home, and it's so good. I suggest you try.. . I have an essential fondness for this cafe because I briefly lived in this building ages ago (I'm pretty sure that my former bedroom is the side dining room of RTR!) I discovered it when I was walking by the old neighborhood and wanted to stop by for memory's sake, and saw that my apartment had become a restaurant! Â A good, good restaurant with comfortable decor, nice lighting, and a simple but delicious menu that's always made me happy.. . This is exactly the kind of restaurant that every neighborhood should have. It's welcoming, spacious, nice but not too formal and without any attitude; you can work here in the day and go out for dinner at night. So excellent.
