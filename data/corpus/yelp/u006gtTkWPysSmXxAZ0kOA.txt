Prix Fixe'd it last night for a special night ;) . . It was a last minute decision, so at 6:30 I called up to make reservations for 8:30, which they complied with...step 1 complete. . . The host did mention that it was BYOB, so I went and got my favorite lambic beer...step 2 complete. . . I got in the taxi, made it to the restaurant and gave my name to be seated at the table...step 3? Nope, not complete yet. The tables were all full and people were taking their time, which didn't bother me because I understand, plus the place is so small. The host did take the beer I brought and put it in the cooler, which was fantabulous. The weather was nice so we stayed outside and talked, since it's terribly loud inside. The wait was longer than expected so we were given complimentary bacon wrapped dates while waiting outside (not bad at all). Finally, the table opens up...step 3 complete. . . We order the prix fixe menu - an appetizer/salad, main entree and dessert. The escargot appetizer was very delicious and had a great flavoring to it. The duck and plum plate I ordered was interesting and definitely not my thing. It was looked like cat food, but I guess some people like this stuff. For me, I'll pass, though I'm sure it was cooked great for those who like it. Then the food arrived; I had the haddock, she had the pasta. Both were tasty and filling - not the best, but very good. Then the end of the meal came, which was dessert. We both had the bread pudding, but with different toppings. Yummy! Step 4 complete. . . All in all, a good place to chill, drink your own liquor with no extra fees, have fantastic service, and eat new foods...step 5 complete.
