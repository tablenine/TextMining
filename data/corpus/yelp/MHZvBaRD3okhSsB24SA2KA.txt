The egg sandwich I had for brunch this morning made me wish I was hungover so its awesomeness could cure me. The sandwich was a perfect blend of grilled sourdough, over-medium eggs, applewood smoked bacon, spinach and white cheddar cheese. That and two cups of coffee did me right on a rainy morning. Service was great and the place was nearly empty. It's not the first time I've been here, but the first time in a while. In my experience, it's much better for brunch than dinner. Go for brunch. It's crazy good.
