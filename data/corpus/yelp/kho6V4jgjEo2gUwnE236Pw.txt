Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If I have nothing nice to say, I generally say nothing at all. But after seeing the staggering volume of Pink's reviews (1,500 and counting), I felt that it was my moral obligation as both a hot dog fan and LA resident to contribute my own two cents.. . Like the reality TV "star" who is famous simply for being famous, Pink's coasts by on its reputation alone. In a town that has some really outstanding hot dogs, I'm baffled as to why anyone short of a sadist would wait in line more than five minutes, let alone more than an hour, for such a mediocre dog.. . Angelenos: stop perpetuating the myth. The Emperor's not wearing any clothes. Not only that, but he has c-cups and a hairy back.
