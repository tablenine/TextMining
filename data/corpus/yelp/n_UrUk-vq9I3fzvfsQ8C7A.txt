I'm sorry to drag the average star rating down but brain-dead servers are just a real pet peeve of mine.  It is too bad because there is so much going for this place.  Cool neighborhood.  Decent food. Strong drinks. The waitstaff are good looking.  Local art on the walls..and so on.  But that just doesn't do it for me anymore.  Any question about the menu smokes the confuser mechanism of the staff.  Water refills take an eternity.  Food shows up before drinks.  I can't take it any more.. . Me: What types of muffins do you have today?. CSC. Cranberry and Apple.. Me: Great, I will have a cranberry muffin.. CSC: (30 minutes later) Here's your banana muffin.. Me: I ordered a cranberry muffin.. CSC: We don't have cranberry muffins.. Me: Oh, bummer - maybe next time.. CSC: Do you want me to wrap that for you?. Me: No, I don't care for banana muffins.. CSC: Then why did you order it?. Me: I didn't.. CSC:  Yes you did, I wrote it here my pad..See "c. muff".. Me: Exactly. CSC: Exactly what?!. Me: Banana starts with a "B".. CSC: I am aware of that.. Me: Could you just remove it from my check please?. CSC: But I have already unwrapped it, are you sure you don't want it.. Me: So you unwrapped it, then walked over to ask me if I want it wrapped?. CSC: What's your point?. Me: Just the check please.. . I'm getting too old for this crap.
