"Ok, I'm going to be reviewing the "Big Three" Chicago deep dish style pizza places:  Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Gino's East.. . Second Place, Uno's.  Alright this a personal judment call, but I slightly prefer the sauce and cornmeal crust of Gino's to the doughier and more tranditional Uno's.  But I know plenty of people that prefer the latter.  So in the great debate, you will have to figure out which you prefer.  Uno's crust can really stand up to the loads of cheese and toppings that are piled on it, knife and fork required.  This is the original  chicago style pizza, a "meal" in a pan.
