Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
Spring is a fantastic restaurant.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the bar, because it takes up the entire 1st room.   The design of the bar is very eye-catching, it's minimal with many right angles.  The decor of the restaurant is minimal, yet elegant with a few small Asian touches.  The decor is fitting since most of the dishes on the menu are Asian fusion. . . My husband and I were at Spring for a special occasion, so we decided to go all out.  We ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu.  It was $70 each and consisted of 5 courses.  We also got the wine pairings for the  menu, which was an additional $45 per person.  The food was fantastic!  The menu got me to try somethings that I never would've imagined ordering on my own.  It turns out that I really like eel!   Each dish was served with fantastic presentation.  The portions for each course were perfect, neither of us felt stuffed to the gills after dinner.. . The wait staff was highly attentive.  I think our waitress would have bent over backwards if we had asked her.  She was very professional, as were all the employees who serviced our table.  I'd definitely go back.
