Finally had a chance to go and check out Feast for brunch this weekend and it didn't disappoint.. . My friend and I got there around 1pm for their Sunday brunch.  We checked in with the hostess and asked for a table outside.  We were told that it would be about 20 minutes and we thought . . .hmm . . .just enough time for one of their Bloody Marys at the bar.. . Well 45 minutes later we went up to see how much longer and the hostess says that she forgot about us.  What?  Isn't that the purpose of taking down our name and writing it in that book?. . Anyway- this small misstep aside, they showed us to our table outside.  Perfect!  A great day, a little bistro table on the sidewalk and good food.  I was happy.. . They also have a huge patio area.  Their menu included both breakfast and lunch items- some recommendations that our server made were the chicken sandwich for lunch and we ordered both of her breakfast suggestions.  The bartender was great- quickly filling drink orders and happy to share a word or two with those of us waiting at the bar.. . The service, while a little slow, was okay given we were in no big hurry and the drinks just kept coming out.  Once we ordered, I had the crab cakes Benedict- really good, and my friend had some kind of corn tortilla with chorizo sausage and scrambled eggs- it was good too.  . . There is valet parking if you drive or save the $10 as there is always plenty of places to park on the surrounding streets.. . All in all- a delightful way to spend a Sunday afternoon- people watching, eating and enjoying the weather outside.  I will definitely be back!
