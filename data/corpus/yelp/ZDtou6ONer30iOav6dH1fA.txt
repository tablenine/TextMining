Pastrami sandwich was just not very good -- a bit lacking on the meat side, and having onions in it was just not very traditional.  A good pastrami sandwich should just be tons of meat sandwiched between rye.  Add horseradish or russian dressing if you want, or maybe even a slice of swiss.  Sandwich was 2 stars.. . However, 1 star bonus for having Orangina at a reasonable price, AND "Dirty Potato Chips" which are notoriously difficult to find, but are the best potato chips on the market.
