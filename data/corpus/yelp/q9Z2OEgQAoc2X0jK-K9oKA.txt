Service was slow. Coffee was fair. I found a hair in my sausage. I gave it to the busboy who didn't even appologize...either did the waitress. Overall I thought this place was lackluster.. . The food was decent. I had the french toast with bananas and cream which was really good, but all the other food we ordered fell short (turkey sausage, potatoes and coffee)
