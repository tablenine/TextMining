A couple of my friends took me to Sepia for my birthday, and it was absolutely great.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting, which stars off with the host or hostess - nice, down to earth, not pretentious.  The space is super cozy, and I felt like we could relax and enjoy our meal and a drink or three.. . The menu has a nice variety, and our server couldn't have been nicer about answering our extensive questions (one of my companions likes to know exactly what he's getting).  She made some great recommendations for us, too.. . We each tried one of their craft/specialty cocktails before dinner.  The first sip is kind of a punch in the face (this held true for each of ours), but really mellowed out as you drink them.  Mine was delicious - the R&amp;R Smash I think it was called - but I'm not much of a hard liquor drinker, so I didn't actually finish it.  My companions were happy to help me out, though.. . We had a couple of appetizers - one was a sausage, the other a duck pasta, and we also got the duck fat french fries.  The sausage &amp; fries were great, the duck pasta desperately needed salt.  That's really the only complaint we had about the food.  Our entrees were the pork porterhouse, spare rib, and pheasant, and all were absolutely fantastic. . . We also lingered a bit over dessert and wine, and there seemed to be absolutely no hurry to get us out of there, which is always nice.  Definitely a place I want to go to again.
