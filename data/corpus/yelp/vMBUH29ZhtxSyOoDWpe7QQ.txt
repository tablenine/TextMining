I love this place.  Best burger on the eastside.  Plus they have Stone and Craftsman on tap.  I think they use beef fat in the fries which makes them extra tasty.  Remember when McDonalds had to change because of pressure from the heath food nuts.  No pressure here, keep'em coming please.  Has been getting really crowded, which sucks, and I'm not too into the TVs and lounge idea, but it's still a great place.
