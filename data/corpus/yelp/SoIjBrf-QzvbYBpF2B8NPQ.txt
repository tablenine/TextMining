Jon-. Magnificent. I've been going to the Boiling Crab since they've opened and the food is always awesome. The shrimp with the whole she-bang with sausage and corn on the cob is a must. So are the cajun fries. Last time, my friend Josh ordered the catfish basket, which was also pretty good. Sweet potato fries were just the right balance between not-too-greasy and not-too raw, with just a hint of sweetness. . . Jenny-. Boiling Crab totally lives up to its hype.  I live in San Diego, and this place is way better than the Crab Hut.  I wasn't sure if a 2-hour wait on a Saturday night was going to be worth the wait, but it totally was.  The corn-on-the-cob in the bag is so good, and I just couldn't stop eating the shrimp!   . . Jon-. $2 beers are also a great feature about this place. You can't beat some cheap Corona to wash down the buttery, garlicky, spicy goodness!. . Only downer is the incredible wait, which is a function of their tiny location. Back when this place was new, the wait was decent, but now you're looking at upwards of an hour or more. I'll ding 'em a star for that.  . . Jenny-. They were also out of crawfish at 6 pm on a Saturday night, which is surprising, but at least they had plenty of shrimp!  I saw plenty of people getting take-out.  We will probably consider this next time!. . Overall though, this place rocks our socks. We love getting in there and ripping apart delcious sea creatures with our bare hands and teeth, licking our fingers, and diving back in for more!
