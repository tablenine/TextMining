Rude rude RUDE bartender.  Went here with 3 friends on a Friday night about 11:00.  The place was mostly empty.  We all ordered beers which somehow came out to $36.00, after paying,  While the change was still on the bar while we were drinking our drinks the bartender comes and says,  "oh you can keep this"  as if we were not going to tip her at all.  I routinely tip over 20% if service is good, but we were not even given a chance, as we were still drinking and the change was still on the bar.  I wont be back.
