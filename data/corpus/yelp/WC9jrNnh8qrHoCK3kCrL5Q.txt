I love the Alcove. I used to live a block away and I have frequented this place more times then I can count. Its wonderful on a nice sunny day to work on your tan while eating some great food, don't get me wrong I've also been known to go there when its cold (they've got heat lamps.  I love how all sandwiches come with your choice of side. I'll always take the garden salad and for a side its pretty ample, and the homemade balsamic dressing is awesome  (the onion rings are also a great). . Faves: The alcove burger is amazing. More of a gourmet burger then a normal burger, fresh herbs flavour it up!. The Turkey Pesto Pannini is SO good.
