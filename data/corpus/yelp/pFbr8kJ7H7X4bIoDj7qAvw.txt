I came here to watch the CAL football game with my friend and bf. The place was mostly filled with Trojan fans, but we managed to sit next to a CAL bear fan section by the school bus.. . The food here wasn't that bad. We ordered their spicy chicken wings and their kobe beef burger. I guess I was pretty hungry, so everything tasted good. My boyfriend claimed that they had the best onion rings he's ever had, as he praised the batter on them. I liked how framboise was on tap (which is really the only beer I like), so I had a glass of that with my meal while watching the game. . . I have to give props to this place for having TV screens everywhere, and especially at your own table. Definitely a great place to relax and watch sports with your peeps...
