HB is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. This restaurant is everything you could ask for in a nice, casual, classy, tasty, fun night out. We went for the Wednesday night $25, three course, Â fixed menu. What an amazing bargain! You need to make a reservation a head of time though cuz it's popular and the dining room is small. The food is great and the service is the best I've had in a long time. The staff work collectively to make sure that people are taken care of. It's not one of those places (and there are a ton) where servers cover "zones" and will not help you if you are out of their zone. Chef Joncari spends a lot of time in the front of the house interacting with customers and making sure everybody is having a great experience. We had the great pleasure of chatting with him for a while. Upon discovering my girlfriend was French, he immediately switched over to speaking flawless conversational French. We talked about France and Europe and all the great food that inspires him. Upon discovering that I was Indian he launched into a bunch of Indian-related stuff. He knows a lot. Finally, after learning that I was on Yelp, he gave my girlfriend and I each a free glass of Spanish sparkling wine. Thanks!. . -ps: The bread pudding is the best thing on the menu
