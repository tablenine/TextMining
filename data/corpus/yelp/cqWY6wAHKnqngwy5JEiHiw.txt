Restaurant: Raging Burrito &amp; Taco
Category: Mexican
good service, salty chips with tasty salsa and pretty good burritos. we came here after traveling through ATL searching out the different areas. parked in the lot behind the restaurant and brought in our ticket in order to get validated which we did. the chips were super salty but the salsa was pretty good. i ordered a regular burrito with pinto beans and added sour cream. they didn't put the sour cream inside the burrito instead it was in a container on the side...i wish they would have put it in themselves as it wasn't as good putting it on with each bite. the beans were really good though and so was the rice and cheese inside. i would definitely return if i was in the area and craving a burrito though.
