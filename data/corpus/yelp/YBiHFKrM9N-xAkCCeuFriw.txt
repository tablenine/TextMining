I Avoided It As Long As I Could, But Zack E.'s Three Stomachs Had A Birthday Celebration Here.. . I don't do buffets.. . Nori Nori didn't change that fact, but it also didn't offend my delicate buffet sensibilities. I witnessed no one sneezing over the food or grody, mold spore-ridden  fingerprints on the glass and that's always a plus.. . The spread, like the venue itself, was intimidatingly massive.  I knew there was no way I'd get my $30 out of the experience, but I worked my way up to around $11.57 with three rounds of nigiri, rolls, skewers, salads, and whatnot.. . I didn't bother whispering into someone's ear to get the top secret Uni, but I tried a wide assortment of stuffs, all which I found mostly pretty food.  Some things were very good. Some things were not awesome at all.. . It's definitely an experience and while I don't foresee myself returning often because I don't throw down like that without naps in between, I enjoyed my visit.
