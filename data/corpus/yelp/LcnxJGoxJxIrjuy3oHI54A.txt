This place is great! I've finally found a place that is comparable to Pluto's in the Bay Area. They have delicious salads, sandwiches and desserts...the soups are eh. I've only tried the tomato bread soup with basil (already sounds like a win, right?), which turned out too sweet. It was odd.. . I particularly like the albacore tuna sandwich. YUMMY. The tuna is raw, wonderfully seasoned and makes a great summer meal. It feels light, but is very filling. . . I also got the toffee crunch devil's food cupcake, which was delicious. I definitely wasn't able to finish it all and needed my friends' help. The dessert selection isn't as big as Urth Caffe, but Tender Green's pastries are good.
