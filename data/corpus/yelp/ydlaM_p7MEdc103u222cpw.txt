Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Not bad, but somewhat overrated. Breakfast is pretty good and a lot of Downtown locals come by to enjoy a cup of 9 cents coffee and the nostalgia of the place. It looks like it hasn't changed since it opened it's doors in 1908 !. . Worth a trip for breakfast or their famous french dip sandwiches and a cup of 'joe'.. . Service can be very slow as each order is made while waiting. If you come here, be patient !
