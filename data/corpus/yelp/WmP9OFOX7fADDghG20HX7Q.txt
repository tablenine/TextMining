Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
Comme Ca... well was quite comme ci, comme ca.  It was packed on a Friday evening.  I have read a lot of reviews on this place about people being displeased with how noisy and loud this place could get... I actually didn't mind that at all!  Especially with the recession, I am really happy to see a bustling place with a light, cheerful energy.  The decor here is lovely, but a bit unimpressive from a restaurant design standpoint.. . We had a reservation but apparently weren't able to seat us for at least half an hour, which is unacceptable...  I sipped on some Sancerre at the bar while waiting for our table while my friend got a cocktail.. . Our food selections were the following:. . Split the Salmon Tartare with Lemon Essence and Potato Crisp.. This was excellent!  I loved how lemony and refreshing this was and had a great presentation.  I thought it could be garnished with a touch of Caviar - that would have been perfect.. . Maine Diver Scallops - The Scallops were ginormous, tender and very well seasoned.  This came served with a nice Celery Root Puree, then garnished with Carmelized Grapefruit.  Deliciousness.. . My friend ordered the Beef Bourgignon with Glazed Carrots and Fingerling Potato Salad.  Meh.  Not a huge fan of Beef Bourgignon, in general and I found the meat to be pretty tough and a bit chewy.  Heavy and totally overwhelming! . . I would love to come back here for Brunch - the menu looks amazing.  And when I do, I'm ordering the Croque Madame for sure!
