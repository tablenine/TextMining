Of the BL Restaurants, this is much better in terms of food and service.  My primary complaint would be the amount of plastic that gathers in that place.  I don't think I've seen that dense of a population of ppl with work done + spray tans in a long time.  People were a bit smug.  Definitely there to be seen.. . We were seated fairly promptly because it was a weeknight and it was not full capacity.    The food didn't disappoint.  . Apps: Blueplate (pot stickers, calamari, tiger shrimp, and spring rolls).  All were equally good.  Apparently, some of the dishes were spicy, but I'm a bit numb to spice.  And, I expect a chef married to a Thai woman to know what spicy food is.. Main: I had the Tuna Steak on the somen noodle cake.  (nothing special, could have done without the soy glaze, way too salty).  Liked the Grouper with Masaman Curry.  Got to try other dishes.  Generally, good food.. Dessert: sweets were sweets.. . In conclusion, the food was good, but the ambiance and stuffiness of the restaurant was such a turn-off.  Not impressed.
