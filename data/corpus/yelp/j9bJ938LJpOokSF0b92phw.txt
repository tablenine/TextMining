Believe the hype. The Office Burger may be a reason for me to move to LA. Their burger presents the basic beef dilemma. If you get it medium, the meat is perfectly juicy but it bleeds pink meat-juice on the bun. If you get it medium-well, the burger is a bit dryer but your bun stays dry. I prefer medium-well, and the boyfriend said he liked medium better. Either way the burger is definitely 5 stars. . . We get here early, so we haven't had to fight the crowds. That's why it's a 5 star experience in my book. The sweet potato fries are really good, but I'd rather fill up with another beer. Get one of those fancy pants expensive beers. You only live once. Now I just need another excuse to go to West LA.
