A great place for brunch! The food is always solid. The chilaquiles are excellent, so is the vegetable quiche. Coffee is good and they give it to you in BIG cups so you don't have to refill every 2 minutes! Great mimosa flights, great service every time and a great atmosphere. Have only been here for dinner once and it was also very good. About the only think I would NOT recomend is the beef brisket sandwich. This is definitely not the place for BBQ.
