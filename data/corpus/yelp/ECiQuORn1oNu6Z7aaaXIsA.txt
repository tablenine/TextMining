After helping some friends move we were starving and checked out Clarke's. As soon as we were seated they asked about drinks. I ordered hot tea. When the waiter came back he brought a pot of hot water and a big wooden box. I'm like "ok"? Opened the box and found tons of tea bags. LOL. Different flavors and such. I thought it was funny. I was freezing and the tea wasn't helping because it got cold pretty quickly. I realized the fan was on too high and was blowing cold air. We asked the waiter if he could turn them off. He was so kind and said "sure". . . Ok so after laughing at my giant tea box and almost freezing my butt off I decided on what I wanted to eat. I ordered a veggie burger with swiss cheese and veggie chili. Everyone else ordered breakfast...meh. I don't like breakfast food. I get my chili first. I was ok. Very thick and paste-like. tons and tons of beans. . . Next was my burger. It was pretty sweet. Big and stuffed with veggies as well and fries on the side. Nice. Onions, tomato, lettuce, and extra mustard on a wheat bun. Just veggie burger love. I liked this lil diner. Great place to just talk and eat food at a reasonable price.
