Houston we have landed....the decor is amazing in this place. All creamy with splashes of red. We tried a little bit of everything...crab rangoon (excellent), chicken gyoza (excellent), cucumber salad (beautiful). . . My entree was a standard good thai restaurant dish. Mussaman curry, it is very easy to mess up or just be average....this was the best I have every had. I am a Thai food expert and have had this dish hundreds of times. This was THE BEST I have ever had.. . A little confused when they did not have Thai iced tea. Why? Why? It is a favorite...also: get some real menus! The quality of this food deserves better than standard fare Chinatown menus with grimy 1980's photos. Seriously, you need some big boy menus! . . The prices are really dirt cheap for the neighborhood, too! I want this place to take out some of the tables in the back and turn it into a late night dance spot because the music was really good too...
