I'm not vegetarian, but this place is great.  The caponata and mushroom saute over creamy polenta are go-to dishes each time my fiance and I go.  The wine list is small, but it's all that's necessary.  The ca' de solo sangiovese is a perfect compliment to any of these small dishes.  I will definitely be back to see if I can finish my quest to try anything on this menu.. . Also, if you are in San Francisco, Terzo Restaurant in Cow Hollow is very similar with some carnivorous options on the menu as well.
