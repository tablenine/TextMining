Restaurant: Big Star
Category: Mexican
Big Star rocks. The drinks are delicious and the tacos are very tasty. They are a little expensive for tacos, but the ingredients are nicer than the usual taqueria offers. Also, the Queso Fundido was the best I've ever tasted. This place was pretty busy on a Friday, as I assumed it would be, but there was basically no wait to get in. Getting a table was an altogether different story. If you are in the mood for good music, good drinks, and good food, you cannot go wrong with Big Star.
