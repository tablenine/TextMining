Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I've been to Father's Office a few times for drinks but never for the food. Came here after furniture shopping on a rainy Sunday afternoon and grabbed their specialty burger along with fries. The burger was very delicious, very rich. I ilked that it wasn't a regular burger bun. The fries were good too, but they don't offer ketchup. I'm ok with that, but some might find it weird to not eat fries with ketchup. :). . No waiter service, order everything at the bar and remember no substitution on the food!. . I'm not a beer person but they do have wines as well.
