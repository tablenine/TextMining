Beer, Beer for EVERYONE!. . Do you like Beer? Do you like food? Do you good beer and good food? Then the Yard House in the Paseo Colorado complex, Pasadena is the place for you. Whether you're going on a date or in a big group the Yard House has the right atmosphere and a quality staff to ensure you enjoy some good eats and have a great dinning experience.. . With 148 beers on tap, in the largest keg-rooms ever, it might just take you longer to decide what you want to drink than what you want to eat! However, don't worry, the menu is quite hefty, too - with offerings for everyone.. . From pizza, to burgers, to steak - the Yard House provides your standard comfort food and a number of gourmet meals. The fair is complemented by the friendly and fast staff - never will you feel out of place or left out. Yard House understands service and regardless of time of day they don't seem to be understaffed. Rest assured, your table will not be forgotten.. . Honestly, I feel a bit funny giving Yard House a perfect score - but they truly did a great job and I think it is well deserved. Give them a try when you're in Pasadena - you won't be disappointed.
