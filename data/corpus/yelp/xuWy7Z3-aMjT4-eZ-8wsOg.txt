The name is fitting if based on a per-visit rating scale.  My first time there lingered in my mind as a brilliantly tasty and eclectic experience yet my second time proved dismal and unworthy of the word-of-mouth advertising I'd been providing to the place pro-bono.  That's all I really have to say about that.
