Your Yelp search should begin &amp; end at Bab's.  We were in from Chicago to check out Atlanta for a job relocation.  We prefer to dine at locally owned restaurants that offer something a little different on their menus or ambiance.  Bab's delivered on both accounts with a little help from Randy.  Many other reviewers have commented on his "presence," and he delivered indeed.  We were there on Saturday morning and while there were several tables occupied, it was no-wait around 10am.  Had the Crispy Omelet and Sunday brunch at Bab's is definitely on our culinary bucket-list.  See you SOON, Randy!
