Restaurant: ilili
Category: Middle Eastern
Been going to ilili since they opened and love this place.  Many people are put off by the smaller (mezze style) portions, but the quality and unique twist on traditional Middle-Eastern dishes is enough to keep me coming back.. . Refreshing departure from many restaurants with similar cuisine that feel like you're eating in someone's old basement.  The decor is superb and service matches the prices.. . Try the Lebanese wine, especially red, along with the brussel sprouts and kebabs.
