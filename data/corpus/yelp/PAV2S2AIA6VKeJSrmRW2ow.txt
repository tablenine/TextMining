Re-visited with a bunch of Yelpers (Jang C, Addy C, Jennifer L, Amaryllia L, Mina C, and others) for a Cobb UYE yesterday.  We ordered a lot of dishes including:. . Fish coriander rolls - small and cigar-sized. Dan Dan noodles - noodles with pork drenched in a tasty hot and numbing oil. Hot and numbing beef rolls - giant rolls with lettuce, cilantro, and thin slices of beef marinated in their hot and numbing oil. Dried fried eggplant - my favorite, slightly crispy, served with cilantro and plenty of Sichuan peppercorns. Shredded crispy beef - sweet and tasty. Mongolian beef. Sesame chicken. Chicken with scallions. Twice-cooked pork - fatty like bacon, but very good. . We ordered a lot, maybe one dish too many because we couldn't finish it all.  The general consensus was that all of the dishes were quite tasty.  Service can be spotty at this place, but we had such a large group and made a reservation in advance, so that may have helped.  The timing of the dishes was a little bit off as we got the hot and numbing beef rolls at the very end of our meal, when it's supposed to be an "appetizer."  The portion sizes for these rolls are large, so I wouldn't really call them an appetizer.. . It seemed everyone really enjoyed the dried fried eggplant.  I also liked the Dan Dan noodles.  Be prepared for spicy food when coming here.  Also, you get 10% off your total bill if you pay in cash.
