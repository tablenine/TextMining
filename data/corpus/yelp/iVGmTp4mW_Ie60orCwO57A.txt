Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I have to agree with the reviews so far, Jerry has really good choices - it all looks fresh and tasty. We could eat something different everyday of the month it seems!. . Unfortunately the kinks are more than you would expect. It was very, very slow, our waiter was not too enthused or maybe the fact that I may have been sitting in there when fellow Yelper El R was in attendance. I saw too a manager rip the waitstaff a new one - embarrassing for the owner I would imagine. I would never put up with that as an owner or a customer. . . We'll wait to go back again in a couple of months and give it another chance.. . REVISED REVIEW: Okay, we had to go back based on all of our friend's reviews. And they were right. The service stand-up and the food was as good as the original location. The prices are very reasonable, the quality of the sandwiches are better than most. I'm a total fan of Milk &amp; Honey, but I'm glad there's more options on Division for a fresh and imaginative sandwich.
