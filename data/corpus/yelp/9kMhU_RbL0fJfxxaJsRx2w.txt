Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
On vacation to LA, from NYC.  Yamashiro was recommended to me as a restaurant with stunning views of LA and yummy Cal-Asian cuisine.  We made a 7pm reservation so that we would be there for the sunset. It was nice to watch all of LA light up as the sun went down from our view from the top of a hill, where the restaurant is beautifully situated.. . To start, we had Miso soups and shared a special appetizer of that night.  it was a "Napolean" of spicy tuna and crab salad.  It was basically spicy tuna and crab salad in between large fried wanton crackers.  It was a yummy and interesting dish.  For our main courses, we shared a (recommended) Darth Vader Roll and the Sweet and Spicy Shrimp (with bok choy, snow peas, scallions, and steamed rice).  A Darth Vader Roll is a black roll composed of spicy tuna, spicy sauce, cucumber, avocado, black rice, seaweed, and covered with black caviar.  It was yummy and the fish was fresh.  The caviar was not overpowering.  The shrimp was cooked well and in a yummy almost meaty sweet and sower sauce. It was good and the vegetables were nice and fresh.. . Our waitress was really sweet and we even had a (minor) celebrity sighting!  haha!  Overall, a nice place to come for a special occasion or just a nice meal at a restaurant with a beautiful view of Los Angeles.
