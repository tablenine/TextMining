Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Bomb-fucking-diggity. You can be shit face pasted, painfully sober, hungover as hell, or high as balls, and this ramen will unfailingly hit the spot. it will pulverize the spot. it will show your spot the true meaning of fear as it inflicts a culinary carpet bombing of devastation and utter subjugation.... it's all SORTS of good.. . it's close, parking is a cinch, the wait isn't hideous, service is great, the food is reasonably priced, they serve alcohol, and the staff screams at you in japanese when you arrive and when you leave. trademarks of awesomeness. you can refill your noodles for 99 cents. you can specify soft noodles, strong soup base, strong miso, and every successive bowl will taste just as awesome as the first. a variety of toppings are available, corn, spinach, more chashu, etc, so you can create your own masterpiece. and their spoons are specially designed NOT TO SLIP INTO YOUR SOUP! (a tear just rolled down my cheek) . if these people were any more thoughtful, they would be spoon feeding you.. . i'm getting emotional. go. eat here. thrive. screw downtown. screw parking in shady ass side streets and aggressive hobos.. . appetizers can get bizarre, fried rice is solid. normal noodles are too hard for most people, strong soup base doesn't get diluted through extra noodles.
