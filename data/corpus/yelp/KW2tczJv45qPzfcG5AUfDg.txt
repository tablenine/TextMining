I thought it was across the board excellent.  The food was not very spicy, but I guess that is how Vietnamese food is.  We got:. . shaken beef, mango chicken, some kind of flat noodle dish, some kind of dish that was chicken with a bunch of cold cut up veggies, where you spoon the sweet vinegary sauce over it.. . It's all good, I recommend squeezing the lime all over the shaken beef.. . It was all very fresh tasting, the portions were pretty big--larger than pretty much any similar Thai/Chinese/Asian type place I've been to, and all of it came to 35 bucks.  Much of it is in the $8-$9 range, when it'd be more like $11+ at other places.. . The service was excellent, there were quite a few small kids around, and the acoustics drowned out our screaming 9 month old.  We'll be back.  I'm curious to try the do-it-yourself springrolls.
