There's always a line. I've gotten it in downtown L.A. before.. I just look up when they're gonna be in the Long Beach area. I've gotten tacos from similar food trucks but I've gotta say.. I'd rather wait for Kogi. I can't get enough of the darn Kalbi tacos. Love the flavors. I definitely recommend if you've never tried and you happen to see the Kogi truck.
