This is a place where you leave your diet at the door. The food is awesome and it's worth the splurge. We waited about 20-25 minutes. . We got the Scotch on the Rocks pancakes and they were so tasty. It's almost like a cake. The portions are HUGE. It's definitely plenty for two people to share. Then we had their version of huevos rancheros. This was a great dish too. The chicken sausage had a great flavor and a nice kick. This place is worth the wait. Next time I want to try the burgers. I saw so many people get that. It looked awesome.
