Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!. . My new favorite Mac N Cheese!. . I loved the Southwestern spices in the mac and cheese.  The mild chile in it was really great and lent a whole new flavor component.  I loved it so much and there was something nice about it being a regular ol' elbow mac instead of these fancy pastas people are using for their mac n cheese.  (Alton Brown fans will know what I'm talking about). . As for the other stuff I had, I thought my iced tea was fine though an extremely odd price of $2.03.  In fact, all the items were of odd amounts like that.  How...quaint.. . And then I had the Cali California omlette which was filled with an abundant amount of chicken sausage, sundried tomatoes, a couple of generous slices of avocado and GOAT CHEESE.  Mmm, yummy, yummy goat cheese.  It's just too bad the omlette itself was kind of weird, bouncy and tasteless.  I suppose it was supposed to be a mild foil against all the other ingredients but I just left it alone.  I did ask for a side of salsa to try to perk it up and was given a large dish of pico de gallo which was fine, if a little tart (extra $.50).  . . I saw someone having a red velvet cupcake which I'll have to try the next time I go.  And mac n cheese.  Can't forget about that yummy mac n cheese (which heated up nicely the next day).. . ---edit 4/21/08. . Ahhh, the fried mac and cheese balls are great!. . But I possibly have found a new favorite salad presentation.  The Thai Cobb salad is great.  . . I do recommend though to get the chicken soup with rice instead of noodles.  The noodles are spaghetti which was a bit hard to eat.  I had to eat them ramen style with chopsticks and a spoon.
