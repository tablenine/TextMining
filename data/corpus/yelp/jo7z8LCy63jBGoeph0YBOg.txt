Yes, all hail the mighty cinnamon rolls - they were delicious. However, the eggs Benedict could use a bit more attention.  Wife wanted to come here  in search of Swedish pancakes, which were decent, and I went with the Benedict because it's hard for me not to order that when I see it.  A giant piece of ham eclipsing 2 tough-to-saw-through English muffins, eggs overcooked and a stingy serving of hollandaise made me envy the other 5 selections at our table.  On the plus side, the side of fruit went above and beyond - usually you just get cantaloupe and honey dew (the government cheese of fruit), and maybe a grape if it's your birthday or something.  This fruit had strawberries! Raspberries! A blueberry or three!  Couldn't save the meal but it was a nice surprise.  Finally, the restaurant itself was chaotic, pre-Cubs game, waitresses running around all frantic-like - good bustling atmosphere.  I'd come here again but would try something else... maybe just a plate of cinnamon rolls.
