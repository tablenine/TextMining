I love fake meat, and I love Buddha. The service is stellar, and the atmosphere is lovely. The vegan options are so good here that I usually leave overly full from stuffing my belly with steamed dumplings, "shrimp" lo mein, and sesame "chicken". They're open late too, so it's perfect for grabbing a bite after a show. Â My only small complaint is the covered parking deck feels a bit unsafe, so I probably wouldn't go there alone at night. But once you're inside, let the good food and the great service win you over.
