Ramen + Fried Rice Combination = Heaven.. . Even though the wait BLOWS (I've waited anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour and half) and the parking SUCKS (street parking can be hard to find), the food always makes up for it.  On occasion you might get slightly undercooked batch ramen or a slightly overcooked egg, but that has never stopped me from coming back.  Easily my favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo.
