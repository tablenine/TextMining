As a beer-rista (sorry - nothing quite so sexy sounding as say, a sommelier or wine steward for connioisers of great beer), you'd think that I'd truly be a huge fan of the Yard House. . . And don't get me wrong, I really do appreciate the fact that they have nearly 130 varieties on tap. Really. Though, from time to time their selection is limited to well under that number, and the brews are not always fresh. Just like good wine, beers have to be stored and served at the proper temperature, and sometimes the Yard House stuff is a bit stale tasting. Keeping that many beers fresh in a place of this size is truly a science.. . The slightly overpriced food and so-so service just doesn't always cut it for me, though I do like the enjoy atmosphere from time to time, especially with a large group of friends, provided we don't have to wait for over an hour to get seated, which is often the case on weekends. Still, I appreciate that they serve more than the typical pub fare, and though no specific meal or dish stands out, I've not had a bad experience with the food.. . It always puzzles me how establishments like this can offer such a wide variety of quality beers and somehow NOT educate their servers on some of the basic nuances of the good stuff. They don't all need to drink the stuff regularly or be experts on every single brew, but it'd be nice for them to know the basic difference, say, between sweet, malty beers and the more bitter, heavily hopped ones.. . Still, after reading fellow yelp-er Tony C's review of the Spicy Chicken Breast sandwich, I'm tempted to go back soon to give it another go!
