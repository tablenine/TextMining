Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Miss V said I had to go here, so off we went! Crazy long line of people outside, which is usually a good sign. Just a basic taco place where you get the impression every one working there is related somehow. Got some tacos and a bunch of salsa and sat down to chow down. Super tasty tacos! The bonus was the huge amount of cheese on them and the really yummy and fresh salsa. It's not spicy but it's still just incredibly good and flavorful, nearly drank that stuff. Oh! and they give you the really good crushed ice when you get a soda, extra star for that.
