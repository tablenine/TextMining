F you to Father's Office and your elitist attitude. Right, your menu is so special that a picture of it is so forbidden. Give me a break, not like there were cooking instructions on there. Then I have to deal with loud, sometimes drunk people crammed into spacing that is non existent and having to buss my own drinks and table. . . The burger itself while good, to me, is not worth what you have to deal with to get it. I don't really like the texture of the pan fried meat either (Lets point out that I think it is random that they don't allow you to customize what is on the burger, but they allow you to pick how you want the meat cooked? Isn't that a form of customization?). Mine was actually pretty liquidy where on the second half of the burger, the bottom bun was completely soggy from sitting a bit.. . I also had a CRUNCH when I ate some of my burger. Apparently there was some cartilage or bone in the grind. Gee, I guess that lets me know it is real freshly grounded meat then huh. Everything did taste fresh though; I do like the high end ingredients and sweetness of the caramelized onions even though it could be quite sweet on some bites. . . I say to get this burger, you have to deal with too much for it to be worth it. No thanks, I will not be visiting this Office again.
