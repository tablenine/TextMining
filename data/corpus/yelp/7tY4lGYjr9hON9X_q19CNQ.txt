Toast is one of my absolutely favorite brunch spots to hit up when I am visiting my friends in LA.  Great outdoor seating, delicious brunch fare!  I went here this time just for some non brunch snacks (steamed artichoke, zucchini fritters) and I'm happy to say that it was just as delicious as breakfast.  . . I also had an amazing red velvet cupcake here.  Their frosting was superb.. . But still, the best thing I had here was an eggs benedict with smoked salmon.  Probably the best breakfast I've ever had.  Seriously.  My stomach growls just thinking of it.
