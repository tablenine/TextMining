Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Vegetarian Vietnamese food? YEAH!. . I guess I've been burned by too many Vietnamese restaurants that make it a point to treat vegetarians badly, as in complete refusal to provide non-meat (and non-meat-stock) options. Even most steakhouses will accommodate vegetarians, albeit with boring dishes, like a steamed veggie platter. So I'm always on the lookout for dining establishments which aren't prejudiced against alternative culinary lifestyles.. . I've eaten at this brightly lit orange-and-white cafe three times, and the vegetarian cold noodle dish (with the egg roll) is so good that I can't talk while eating. You know what I mean! The vegetarian pho is also delish, and if I could have it my way, I would want a small bowl of pho to complement my cold-noodle dish--this combo goes together well.. . The only thing that sucks is the parking, but this taste is worth walking a block for.
