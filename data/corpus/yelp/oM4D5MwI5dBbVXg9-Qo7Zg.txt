You can hardly ever be a culinary sinner when bbq sauce is involved.  This place has top notch sauce, deliciously scrumptous smoked meats, and yes, the sweet potato fries are from heaven.  Beer selection is average, with a few nice draft micros (currently Lagunitas Brown Shugga and Mojo IPA) and the usuals.
