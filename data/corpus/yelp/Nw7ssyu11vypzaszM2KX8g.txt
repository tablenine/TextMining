Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I thought this place was simply called Gladys and Ron's Chicken and Waffles (haha)! Never even knew Ron's last name! Â This is a great spot, especially when I have a craving for chicken and waffle squares. There is no other place in the city to get this combination all day long, morning to night. . . The only problem is the wait. On a busy night you can wait for almost two hours for a table. The location of the restaurant doesn't leave many places to roam or waste time either. There is free parking in the back, which is an added plus in this downtown location.. . If you don't feel like meat and sweets for a meal the restaurant offers other breakfast and lunch alternatives.
