Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
Though I do not officially imbibe alcohol, I do need the occasional de-rusting.  This is my favorite place to do so.  I love a keg of primo Belgian golden ale (not the ale, just the keg, of course!)  And the Brunswick Stew is phenomenal; I get the "Volcano" coming out of sour bread.. . Brick Store reminds me of Band of Brothers... not sure why.  Maybe the time other people spent in England during the war... oh Brothers - I know your sacrifice!  Too many have we lost.  Too many.  *Hic*  ...far too many.. . Autobots - ROLL OUT!  But first, *Hic* call me a cab.
