Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
This is one of those places that when you grow up with it (eating on the patio by the pit at 3am) just feels like you'd miss it if it wasn't there.  The pastrami is good, but not excellent.  The atmosphere is one of a kind, nostalgic.  And the waitresses, they make the place special too.  I've been coming here for over 25 years, and I'm happy to still recognize some familiar faces.  So give this place a chance.  Each time you come, you'll enjoy it more, and you'll feel like "you'd miss it if it wasn't there".
