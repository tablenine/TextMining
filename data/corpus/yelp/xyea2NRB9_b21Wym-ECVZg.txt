It's been a while since I wrote the first review of Holy Taco so it is long overdue an update.  Mostly, because Holy Taco has won a place in my heart, and its pork belly torta, dripping and oozing with goodness, has become my last meal on earth, if I am fortunate enough to have advanced notice.  SRSLY- how can you beat three, thick pieces of pork belly, nestling with lettuce, tomato, radishes, jalapenos, and an amazing sauce (I think crema, but not sure) on a buttery, toasty torta.  It is fantabulously fantabulous...and as a straight guy, I have a limit to the number of times I can use "fantabulous" in life and BAM! - there's three.  Worth it.. . I at first did not like the chips (thick, greasy, salty), but man...they've grown on me with a fierceness- kinda like jock itch but more delicious!  I now CRAVE them!. . The staff is great, the menu is incredibly varied and offers something for everyone, and they've gone out of their way to become an integral part of the EAV.. . ¡Viva Holy Taco!
