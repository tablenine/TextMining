Oh dear David Burke, I really want to write a raving review of all that you have to offer, and I simply cannot in good conscience do so.. . I had been waiting for a good reason to dine here and finally got a chance to treat my family right the other week. We decided to go all out except dessert -- we simply couldn't find room for it.. . We had the 55-day aged steak and chateaubriand for 2 were great, but not spectacular. Funnily, my husband who had the 55-day aged preferred our chateaubriand, and we his. The other plus was the cheesy souffle popovers.. . Sadly, the compliments stop here. The French onion soup was all right, we've certainly had better in less impressive cities. And our three choices of sides -- mac and cheese, chorizo mashed potatoes and broccoli spring rolls -- were highly disappointing and bland. The broccoli spring roll was a sad ensemble of mashed broccoli stuffed in a spring roll wrapper.
