Restaurant: Lula&#39;s Sweet Apothecary
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I was so excited to try Lula's out, so my boyfriend and I went on an outing to the city. We got there and tried a bunch of flavors, the cake batter soft serve was grainy and melting in the sample cup. I settled on a soft serve flurry with sprinkles and gummy bears. The guy who made my flurry had apparently never made one before and what he handed back to me was a cup half full of ice cream with 5 gummy bears in the bottom. My boyfriends nut-based lemon ice cream was pretty good though he couldnt finish the cone it was so filling. I was disappointed and honestly feel as if i was ripped off. I have faith though, I'll be back to give them another shot.
