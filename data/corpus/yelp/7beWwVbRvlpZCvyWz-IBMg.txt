5 stars without a doubt! They had duck w/ orange, duck w/ cherries and duck surprise! (That's duck w/o orange or cherries) If you don't like duck then I'm afraid your rather stuck! Haha, ok I drunk right now and that last part is from a British comedy call Fawlty Towers. I didn't do it justice but check it out. It's very funny ...Anyway! This place has excellent Peking duck. You get is sliced at your table and served with sticky buns, plum sauce and sides. Then, they take it back and make a soup out of it. Then! They take back again and make a stir fried rice dish. It came to $110 for 7 people, not bad and it was more food than we were able to eat. It's byob so... byob! Go, enjoy, thank me later.
