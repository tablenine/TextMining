Wow, this place is simply amazing. For two excellent reasons- fresh, delicious baked goods + very low prices. This is a great place to come if you ever travel from Burbank Airport; it's right around the block. Porto's has an amazing selection of pastries, croissants, empanadas served nice and warm... I also had an iced caf√© con leche. The capuccino they use is strong and smooth. I love this place!!
