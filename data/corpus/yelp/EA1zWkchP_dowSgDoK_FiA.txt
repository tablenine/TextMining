When you look at the menu you think to yourself, "finally something different!!!"  But what ever I have ordered, I have been almost always disappointed.  I don't like the outside seating because it just feels dirty since there are often many pigeons and insects flying around.  I wanna feel comfortable when I'm eating.  This place didn't do it for me at all. . . Also, quite pricey for pretty low quality food.
