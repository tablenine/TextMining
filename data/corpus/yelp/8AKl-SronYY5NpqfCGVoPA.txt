Restaurant: No Mas Cantina
Category: Mexican
I had a good time at No Mas.  I enjoyed the decor.. reminded me of Olde Town San Diego.    . . The food was the traditional mexican that you would find at "Mexican Restaurants"... which is what makes it good.  we ate the chicken special mango/spinah something and the shrip tacos... they were really good.. It was much different than we expeceted.. but I will deffinitely go back..   It was a tiny bit bland.. but thats ok.. . . yummy cheese dip with jalapenos... (we took it home and added a little more milk which made it perfect)
