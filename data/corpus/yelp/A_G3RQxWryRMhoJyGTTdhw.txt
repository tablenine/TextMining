Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I came here on your referrals and one from a great friend who lives in Roscoe Village... maybe that's why she likes it so much. I just thought it was ok. For starters, our server disappeared right before we got our food (to serve a big group in the back I think) and nobody ever came to check on or help us other than the girl filling coffee cups. We had to ask for the check and no one ever asked us if everything was ok.... and unfortunately, it's wasn't really... It was ok, but it doesn't leave me wanting more.. . I told the waitress that I wanted to try 4 different dishes and for her or the cook to pick the best one for me. They chose the *Fried Chicken and Waffles. I hope this isn't the best they have. The chicken was so tough I had to use the boyfriend's steak knife to cut it! And of course, dry from being that overcooked and/or left sitting out. On the good side, it was well spiced and tasted good, as well as the honey ancho chili sauce. The half of a waffle was room temperature, but I know some places do that on purpose.. and the fresh fruit, though I would typically love it, had many bruised and bad fruit bits in it. I also had a side of gravy. I think you can judge any restaurant by its sausage gravy and... I wouldn't get it again.. . The meat-and-potato man I eat with got the *Steak and Eggs. He said it was just ok. Asked for the eggs hard with cheddar and they weren't hard. We never did find out if there was just so little cheddar that he didn't notice or if it wasn't there at all. He said he'd get something else next time... me too. He got garlic mashed potatoes as a side and didn't like the burnt top presentation (I did) and said he thinks they were just instant potatoes! Gross. For some reason we have decided there can be a next time though. I'll update if it happens... not in a hurry though.
