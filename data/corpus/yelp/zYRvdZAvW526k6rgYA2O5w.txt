There are only 2 or 3 choices for super late night sit down eating in LA that are not Norms or Dennys. Those places are the brite spot and freds. When I first moved out here Freds was my go to place, but after a long period of time of very solid service I had numerous awful experiences at freds that made me not go back for over a year. However I'm not gonna get into it because I think those days are behind the place now. Which is great, because I really like bossanova waffles and pancakes and BBQ brisket! Â Freds has great eating atmosphere and the staff doesn't make you feel like they want to to eat and get out and they don't go out of their way to ignore you like in other places (Britespot!). The times since I've started going back to freds the food has been very high quality and the service has been good too. My only complaint is the food may be priced a little high for what amounts to mainly easy to whip up meals and there are no good places to drink around it so I'm usually going out of my way to get some good food after boozin' (but the place can't be faulted for that). I'll continue to give Fred's my patronage and I look forward to updating this review because right now I'm being real conservative and cautious.
