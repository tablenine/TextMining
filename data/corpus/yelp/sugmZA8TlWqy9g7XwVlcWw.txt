the line is SSOOOOOOOOOOOOO long!!!  i was debating if i should wait or not, there were more than 80 people in front of us...so we decided to go to the front of the line to check out the food first...good thing we bumped into my bf's friend and he helped order for us.  We got the short ribs tacos and the burrito.  it was sooo delicious!!!  i love the pickled vegetables they put in the tacos and burritos... However, i dont think it is worth to wait over an hour or two even though i thought it tastte good... maybe you should wait when all the hype goes down...esp this the new "trendy" thing of taco trucks...so wait a couple months to go try it cus im sure Kogi will still be around.
