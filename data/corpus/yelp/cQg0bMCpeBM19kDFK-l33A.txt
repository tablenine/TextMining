Restaurant: Chef Liu
Category: Chinese
This one is a very visible hidden little gem. Chef Liu is one of my favorite places to dine. It's not classy at all. However, the price for product ratio gives all reasons for you to try it. Located in the middle of a parking lot off Buford Highway in Atlanta, this thing looks like a shed with a couple of lean-to's built onto it. The dining area is small and you have to walk outside to use the restrooms but it is all worth it.. . Chef Liu is northern Chinese. They serve buns, dumplings, and noodles. Don't expect to find rice here because you won't get it. My friend (executive chef for a Restaurant Works concept) and I went here for lunch today. We split beef noodle soup between the two of us and ordered steamed pork dumplings with some sesame bitter melons on the side for lunch.. . The beef soup is always amazing and the dumplings burst in your mouth with flavor as you bite into it. This is as authentic as you can get and you can tell the difference in flavor. This place is not your regular Chinese takeout joint as you can see the blank looks on first timer's faces when they find out Chef Liu does not serve rice.. . All together plus two soft drinks and an extra order of fried pork buns for our friend, the total came out to only be $23.. . For those on a budget, a couple can split the noodle soup and a large order of buns or dumplings with water for somewhere around $10 and you will walk out of there with a very happy stomach. Chef Liu is a must for everyone to always keep in consideration when going out for Chinese.. . . http://twitter.com/10_k.
