Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
How can you go wrong with Chicken &amp; Waffles??? You can't. . . On our quick trip to LA, the one place I really wanted to go was Roscoe's. Mostly because I had never gotten to try it the previous times I've been to LA, but also for the shear nostalgia. . . We hit up the eatery on our last day for a late breakfast/early lunch. I ordered nothing other than the fried chicken with 2 waffles and a side of the cheesy eggs on recommendation from my friend. I was anxiously awaiting my food when it finally arrived. As I tore into my chicken I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor reminded me of the fried chicken my grandma used to make when I was a kid! . . Then came the waffles. I love waffles, but these waffles were not lovable. They were limp, luke warm and not even butter and syrup could give them life. Needless to say I was disappointed. Thank goodness for cheesy eggs! They totally saved the meal from being as bad as it could have been. Nice fluffy eggs with ooey-gooey cheese and onions! . . Roscoe's I gave you a chance, and you didn't quite follow through. That's okay though, it's not like I have to eat there everyday.
