I've been coming here for a couple of weeks to get lunch when I get bored of eating dinner leftovers. The food is really great - the sandwiches are nice, the salads are AMAZING and the cupcakes are quite yummy as well.. . I tried bringing my husband here for brunch on Sunday, but we merely drove by, as it appeared that West Hollywood had exploded at Toast and people were coming out of every crack in the building. We though we'd better head to the less crowded FARMER'S MARKET.. . I guess if you want to taste their amazing (yet slightly pricey) food, you should do what I have been doing so far: phone in your order and eat it back at home.. . I recommend the Asian Salad and a Swirl Cupcake for dessert.. . Hm... yummy!
