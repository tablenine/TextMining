Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
Ask any of my friends -- I have some serious issues with high-concept "One-Word" restaurants....  Crust, Piece, Coast, Yolk, Toast.. . Piece, in actuality, was pretty good.  This place is not.  . . Decor was nice but nothing remarkable, the service was good but not spectacular, the pizza was fine but not amazing.. . The list of ingredients was really exciting, but, when it all showed up on your table it pretty much just looked and tasted like any other restaurant-type pizza.  Also, I think the menu offered 8 different kinds of pizza -- i would expect more options (maybe more outlandish fare?) from a place that has named itself after everyone's least-favorite part of a pizza.. . Actually, the pizza was REALLY greasy -- which was a huge suprise.  Organic, sure, but organic grease doesn't really get me any more excited.. . The place is dissapointingly blah.
