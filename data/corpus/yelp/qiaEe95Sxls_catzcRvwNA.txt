I am adding one more star from my last review because:. . 1) I finally saw whole pieces of Pork in my noodle. . 2) Bf likes them, saying the broth is good and it's a good hang over food. :p. . 3) We wrote down our names and then went to Little Tokyo. Since there were two party of 6 ahead of us, so we figured we probably had to wait for an hour or so.  When we returned after about 50 minutes, they already called our names and a few more.  A staff was right there when we were wondering what'd happened.  Then she said "there are two stools at the end of counter available, you could go right ahead"  WOOHOO!  I love them for letting us in even we missed it at the first time, instead of having us wait longer.   Thank you!. . I think it is better to get there earlier, like around 6 or 7.  There are less people and seems like their service (or at least the seating arrangement) is better around that time. . . P.S. They improved to a grade B now.
