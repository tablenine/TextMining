Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
I was pleasantly surprised with Fraiche as all restaurants in Culver City seem to be quite mediocre.  Came here early in the evening and landed a table out on the patio.  My friend was gracious to bring in a nice bottle of Pinot Noir... Corkage here is $20.00 for the first bottle then $10.00 for the second.. . Wasn't too impressed with the bread and accompanying tapenade but ordered some remarkable first courses:. . I ordered the Wild Mushroom Salad which was great.  An abundance of porcini and chantarelle mushrooms came tossed in arugula, fresh parmesan cheese and a light lemon vinaigrette.  Order this!  My friend got the English Pea Soup which was great as well.  Came prepared with a hint of creme fraiche.. . Entrees - we both decided to go Italian, so I ordered the Tagiarini Negri (Squid Ink Pasta) which came with bay scallops and basil tossed in a delicious light broth.  Both the texture and flavor of this homemade dish were excellent.  I would go back just to order this dish again.  My friend opted for their Lobster Risotto which came folded in with asparagus, cherry tomato and fresh basil.  Decadent!  Though it's kind of hard to screw up Lobster Risotto in general.... . Dessert was a Flourless Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter Gelato.  Think of a more sophisticated and fun version of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup...  Dense, decadent and totally horrible for you.  Could not  resist pairing a chocolate dessert with some red wine, one of the most excellent combinations out there!. . Service was courteous but not crisp, as a pleasant French waitress waited on us and gave some nice suggestions.
