Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I didn't eat.  This place is too disorganized.  They have some issue where they want to pretend they are a bar and not a restaurant.  . . I'm not going to stand around like a vulture and then race 3 other people to a table.  I'm not going to enjoy my meal while other table vultures are standing over me waiting for me to get up.  I'm not going to order a burger at the bar without a table, and I'm not going to sit and hold a table with people giving me evil eye because I don't have any food or drinks.. . You barely have to pay waiters, they work for tips!  This location of Father's Office needs to hire a host and waiters.  A burger isn't worth the hassle as it is.. . edit - I went back on a Sunday afternoon when it wasn't crowded.  The burger does live up to the hype, and I got an Old Rasputin off tap and it was great.  I think the secret ingredient on the burgers is sauerkraut.  I still hate the way they run the place and won't go if it's a time there won't be free tables available.  The sweet potato fries aren't worth the $7.  Veggie Grill's are better, and VG's chipotle ranch sauce they come with is better than the aioli FOs serves.
