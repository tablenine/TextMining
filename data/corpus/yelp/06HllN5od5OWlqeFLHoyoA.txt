Restaurant: Seasons 52
Category: American (New)
Seasons 52 was one of the first new restaurants I tried in Atlanta.  I really liked it and couldn't believe how few calories went into each dish.  The service at the bar was spectacular.  They have an incredible wine called Woop Woop that is to die for.  Very good prices also.  I have to go tomorrow night for a work dinner.  I'm pumped to get to go back and try something different on the menu besides the flatbreads (which were spectacular).
