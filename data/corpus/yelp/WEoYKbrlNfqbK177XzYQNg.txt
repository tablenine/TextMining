Street parking... If you are up to wait for 30 mins or so.... If you like cozy .... younger crowd.... I liked this place, if only I didn't have to wait out in the cold. Japanese pub feel. The service is fast, servers were very attentive. Prices were reasonable.  We loved the buttered Enoki. I definitely suggest to come here in a group, fun  and cozy for groups.
