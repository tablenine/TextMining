Restaurant: Uncle Julio&#39;s Casa Grande
Category: Mexican
For festive fine Mexican dining try Casa Grande on Peachtree.  I went with my boyfriend a few months ago and was shocked to see so many large groups. Casa Grande is very accommodating and ideal for super groups of 10 and 20. Whether you choose to sit indoors or on the patio overlooking Peachtree, you'll enjoy the flavorful food. Try one of Julio's Margarita's, especially the frozen swirl. The sweet frozen swirl blended well with my warm and spicy chips, salsa, chicken enchiladas, rice and frijoles a la charra. . . Casa Grande can be a little more expensive than the average authentic Mexican restaurant; however it's worth every penny.  There are daily specials; they offer Sunday brunch and a Kid friendly menu.  Casa Grande is not the best place for a date as the music tends to be loud.  If you're taking the kids, don't go on Friday or Saturday evening. Additionally, Casa Grande doesn't accept reservations but the service is fast and friendly.  For more information visit . http://www.unclejulios.... .
