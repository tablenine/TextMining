My boyfriend and I came here for dinner the other night.  There was about a 5 minute wait, and the place was full of people.  . The service is great, our waiter brought us bread the second we sat down constantly checked up on us and refilled our drinks.. First of all, the complementary bread is delicious, if they don't bring you any, be sure to ask for some.. The menu is pretty big, i remember just flipping through all the ages unsure of what to get.  I finally ordered the chicken lasagna, which was randomly on the menu, but was really good.  My boyfriend ordered steak with a side of rice black beans and plantains, which he loveedddd.  . Our bill ended up being really reasonable for the quality of the food and the great service.. Also! the parking was limited on the street, but the valet was only $3.
