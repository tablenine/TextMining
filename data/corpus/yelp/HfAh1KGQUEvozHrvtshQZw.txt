Sunday evening, mostly empty, candlelit, Massive Attack playing-- "very appropriate music choice" is a good way to describe the ambiance.  The Hi Hat cocktail (muddled grapes and basil) was delicious.  To boot, the waitress came over when the game (final score: Yankees 7, Phillies 4, hah!) was just about to start and asked if we'd prefer the volume upped on either the music or the game.  This is probably because there were only 3 other customers there, but still, definitely a nice gesture.  . . So alas! to the lukewarm Yelp reviews: I liked it.  Will be back to Fat Cat for food and a beer.  Oh, that's another thing-- the beer list is awesome.  Curse my love of craft beers!
