I heart Rodan. The decor is minimal with clean lines and there is artwork projected onto the walls. I've been to Rodan twice and I still can't get over those tasty little nubs of bread that they bring to your table. Love it. I ordered the tofu coconut curry with the herbed rice and it was absolutely delicious. We spent under $48.00 with two drinks, an appetizer and two entrees. I'll definitely be back.
