Dropped by on a Thursday afternoon and had no problem finding parking at all. The place wasn't packed so we were seated immediately. I wasn't a fan of the iced tea nor did my friend enjoy her lemonade. However, we loved the calamari appetizer and the Cobb salad was amazing. Lastly, I loved their red velvet cupcake! . . Our waitress was sweet and a hottie, and the the overall service was great.. . I still need to try the breakfest that everyone raves about. I love this place.
