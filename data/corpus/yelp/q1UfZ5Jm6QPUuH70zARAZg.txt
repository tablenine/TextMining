Finest Tacos in Chicago! Paul Kahan and crew continue to amaze us with their culinary expertise and remind us that we can eat our favorite foods without guilt, because they are made with the finest ingredients. Everything is made fresh and in house. The chips, the tacos, the sauces,etc...The only thing not made in house are their excellent selections of the finest beer, tequilas, mescals and more. The service is great. Its a saloon atmosphere, so don't expect to be pampered. Relax, kick back and sit at the bar if your a couple. You will look like freaks eating at a booth set up for 8 people. The bartenders are awesome people and never stop serving you. Enjoy the finest country western sounds I have not heard from when my father played Roger Whitaker on the 8 track. Writing this review is kicking me to get up from my desk and drive down there and feast again. We can all enjoy eating tacos without Pepcid. Thank you Chef Kahan. Thank you Big Star. Thank you.
