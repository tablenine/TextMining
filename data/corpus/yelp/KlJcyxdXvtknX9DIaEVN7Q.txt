Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
Chicago pizza can never be replicated, no matter how hard Uno tries to replicate itself across the country. The pizza here is amazing, and I certainly tried them all. But Uno was my first and my favorite. I love the crampted atmosphere of the original. It's just very Chicago. The pizza is perfection in a dish. I'm a pig, but I couldn't eat more than two slices.... . We also spent some time at Due, Uno's less famous cousin, but I liked it better at Uno. Try them all and find your fave, is my best advice. It's a lesson in Chicago history while you eat amazing pizza.
