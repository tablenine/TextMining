I LOVE PHO CAFE!  The food is really great!  You can get Coca-Cola, 7-Up and Orange Crush in glass bottles here... yum!  Trust me it is worth the indulgence unless you want a Vietnamese beer.. . The lighting is stark and decor is minimal.  There is usually a wait on the wknds, but you can do take out instead.  The lot gets full quickly, but there should be parking within a block or two.
