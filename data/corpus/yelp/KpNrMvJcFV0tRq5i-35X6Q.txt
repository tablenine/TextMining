Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Yum!  I love Ding Tai Fung!. . I've been to several of its locations: Shanghai, Taipei, and this one!  They are super busy at all times of the day, so you should really try to go there at least 15 minutes before they open if you don't want to wait that long.  . . I've tried all of their dumplings, but my favorite by far are the original steamed pork dumplings.  I don't need the flavor of crab or fish interfering with my pork dumplings.  . . If you've never had "shiao long bao" before, you have to give it a try.  . . Steps:. . 1.)  Mark down the number of items you want on the order form and hand it to the waitress.  One order comes with about 10 dumplings, which is enough for about 1 person.  . . 2.)  When your order comes, start eating immediately!  It's best when it's HOT.  . . 3.)  Gently pick up the dumpling with your chopsticks, dip it in some soy/vinegar/ginger sauce (whatever your fancy), and place it on your spoon.  Try not to pierce the delicate wrapper because you're going to cause all the pork juices to flow out (and that's the best part)!  . . 4.)  Take a small bite of the dumpling and drink some of the pork juices (careful, it's HOT!) as it flows out.  Then take a larger bite of the dumpling, using your chopsticks to assist you.  . . 5.)  Repeat &amp; enjoy (and order more if you must)!
