Gelato!!! Now... I need to first assert that I did not eat anything other than gelato. Many of the other reviews discuss the cupcakes (which did look amazing), cookies, and other deserts. But since I had just eaten quite a bit of food I restrained myself to gelato.. . In honor of my ex I ordered strawberry gelato, paired with a sugar cone. Both of which were quite good... The gelato did not seem particularly over-priced to me... I believe under $4 with the cone for a single scoop. Not sure where others are eating their gelato but that seems about par.. . Milk was ok, but the Venice beach gelato shop (near the skate park) actually is better, and in the South Bay you should try 22deg. in Redondo Beach... prebiotic and funky flavors rule.
