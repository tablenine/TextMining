I've only eaten breakfast at this joint.  It's one of my favs.  No wait &amp; it's good.  If the waits too long at Yolk, I come here.. . Suprisingly breakfast is dirt cheap.  Only 7 bucks! We always get the same things -- basic breakfast.  I've tried their omelets, but too different for me -- feta cheeses, aparagus and shit (trying too hard).. . I want to try out dinner
