This may or may not be blasphemy, but I don't even like beer but love this place. Well, okay. I'm just extremely particular about beer. It's extremely rare that any place has beer that I like. Generally speaking, I only like white beers like Hoegaarden or Blue Moon. They also had cider (think Strongbow, but even more delicious), which is awesome. Their pub fare is delicious too. Now they just need to open one closer to me so I can develop a nice beer gut.
