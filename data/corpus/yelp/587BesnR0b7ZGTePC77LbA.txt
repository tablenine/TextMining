Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
This is pretty much my restaurant of choice for special occasions!  . . The bone in filet is amazing and pretty much unbeatable!  I know everybody raves about the lobster mashed potatoes, but they taste a little too salty for me; I prefer the Mastro's mashed potatoes.
