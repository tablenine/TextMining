Came here and got the fried chicken for lunch today -- I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the fried chicken, as was one of my colleagues.  This was probably because we got the "last two plates" of fried chicken they had left for lunch, so the chicken was just not good.  It was overcooked, and very dry on the inside.  . . There was potential for this fried chicken, but really, they should not be selling the fried chicken if the last few pieces aren't cooked perfectly -- not a good representation of this place.  . . The mac and cheese, and the string beans were both good.
