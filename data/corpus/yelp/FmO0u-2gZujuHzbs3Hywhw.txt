Good, but not great.  I ordered the meatball sandwich and Korean BBQ and both were solid, but probably not worth the 15 minute drive.  The menu is a tad limited for now, but hopefully that changes a bit.  Unique flavors and the bread was great, but there isn't an immediate wow factor.  I wish it were a little warmer on the day I went so that I could try the ice cream, but had to pass on account for the temp.. . The interior decor is pretty cool - an industrial feel - making for a good atmosphere.
