Made the mistake of meeting up with some friends here on the recent holiday weekend to grab a few drinks.. . Note to Self:  . . Self- if you are looking for a place with people over the age of 30 and not a bunch of college looking frat boys, if you don't like standing in line outside for over 45 minutes while legions of "regulars" get in in front of you, if you don't want to have beer spilled on your feet while they are in your new cute shoes or have to scream to be heard- DO NOT GO TO STANLEY'S!!. . There.  I said it.  With that being said- I took my adult self to a different bar with adults and waited for my feet in my very stylish shoes to dry out.
