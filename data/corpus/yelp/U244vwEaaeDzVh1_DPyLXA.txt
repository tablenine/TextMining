This place was pretty incredible, but I'm not sure I could say I would have ever gone there if it wasn't on the company dime. They offer a $75 prix fixee dinner and the drinks were a bit (expectedly) overpriced. . . That said, the experience was great. As other reviewers have mentioned, we were often brought out little surprises as 'gifts' from the chef in between our courses. It was a thoughtful touch that definitely adds some sincerity to your experience (of course, knowing that they do that for everyone maybe sours it just a little). . . No complaints about the service, and the meal was fantastic. I had the duck entree, but really what stood out the most to me was the oyster appetizers. Easily the best oysters I have ever had in my life, and I'm usually a pretty hard sell with oysters. I was amazed to get such a great dish of them here... in.... Atlanta. . . Bacchanalia's definitely worth the trip if you don't mind shelling out the cash. It's an experience to be remembered.
