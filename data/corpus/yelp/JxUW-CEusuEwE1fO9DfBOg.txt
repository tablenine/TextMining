I had never had peruvian food before coming here, but i must say it's quite good. Alot of interesting menu choices, but most contained familiar ingredients which usually makes trying new foods easier. Also, you must have the sangria here. It tastes like bubble gum. I'm not even kidding, it's amazing.
