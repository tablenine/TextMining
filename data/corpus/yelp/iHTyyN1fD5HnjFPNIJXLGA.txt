Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
Best experienced on an expense account, Comme Ca is one of those LA places with a stellar design, average food and unnaturally friendly actor-servers.  . . My dining companion had a disappointing salmon and I had a steak which was quite nice although rather short of game-changing.  The culinary highlight for me was the roasted beef marrow and oxtail jam, which came with little ticks of toast.  It was not quite like anything I've had before... salty and somehow more carnivorous than simply eating a cut of beef.  I mean those are parts of the animal that tend to end up on the cutting room floor, so to speak.  Eating it felt one part forbidden and one part debaucherous and wholly delicious.  You might imagine Parisian royalty consuming it in 18th century France, with their strange makeup and funny dances.  In fact all of Comme Ca had this slightly wanton, seductive, gratuitous feel to it.  And it was entirely easy to give in to it.  I brought the spoils home for my pooch.  He doesn't get a $14 bone very often.  . . We ended up seated next to the CEO of the company that owns the restaurant.  He offered us appetizers from his table and I fully expected him to pick up our tab.  No such luck, even after I lied about how good my meal was.  Ah, well.  It's Los Angeles.  What's a couple of bucks?
