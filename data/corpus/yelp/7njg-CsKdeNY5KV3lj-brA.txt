YOWZA.  I no longer need to go to NY... . Two weeks ago, I stuffed myself silly with Katz Pastrami sandwiches *twice* during our short stay, thinking it may be years until my next fix.. . And then I went to Langers today.  Omigod, what took me so long?. . Thick hand carved pastrami and corned beef that defines the word succulent.  It's so tender that I don't even think chewing is required.  . . But what really sets this sandwich apart from the rest is:  THE BREAD.  I never even knew I could like rye bread as much as I did these.  The bread is warm and soft on the inside but the outside is perfectly crusty...  You know, to the point where the roof of your mouth gets a little roughed up with each bite??  Heavenly.  I'll never be the same.. . The matzo ball was light and fluffier compared to alot of others places, but the broth is warm and comforting.  My husband gobbled his up before the sandwich and kept wondering why he was so full.  Duh!. My borscht was okay but I found the broth to be a little too tangy for my liking, but adding the sour cream did help to tone it down a little.. Skip the cole slaw, I think the one at KFC is better.  Potato salad was similar to Canters but not as good.  Pickles were edible (I like half sours and these were WAY sour), but I've had much better  :-(. . So great, just what I needed:  a place to drop $15 for a pastrami/corned beef sandwich. ($11+ for a regular pastrami).  It sounds absurd, but that's what makes Langers great!!
