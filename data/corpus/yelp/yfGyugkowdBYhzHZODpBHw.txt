Went there for a late breakfast, was fairly crowded but it's a little place so it probably fills up quick.. . The french toast was awesome and the waitresses were super cute and nice.. . I was enamored by the wall of photos of chickens. . . They were playing Tom Waits when we were eating, then Devo. +1000 Dave points for music. . It was awesome and delicious.
