This place is great. It's a little pricier than other places in town but you're getting what you pay for. The home made tortillas are AMAZING. I always order cheese and onion enchiladas (a classic and a favorite of mine) and never leave unhappy. My family goes here whenever we're all in town because it has consistently great food.. . Oh yeah, and try their swirl margarita it's great, but be careful, they make them a little strong.
