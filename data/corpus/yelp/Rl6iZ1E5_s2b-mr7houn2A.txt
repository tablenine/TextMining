As a Silver Lake homeowner I have always liked LA Mill.  But, at times, it's been difficult to decide it's appeal for me and my life style.. . I went to the opening day and got the ONE egg Dungeness Crab cocotte which was savagely trounced on Chowhound.  Luckily, LA Mill rethought that idea and has added another egg.. . Since then I have come to appreciate the option of having a place to stop for dessert and fine coffee after dinner. Or dinner itself!  One should enjoy the pleasures of coffee prepared by siphon at your table ... or by the Eva Solo.  Sit back, relax and take it all in.. . The beverage menu is extensive ... about 20 pages I'm guessing.  Most of it coffee.  You first chose your extraction method, then chose your coffee variety.  Both method and variety will affect the cost of your beverage.  There is a effort to provide tea options which I find wholly inadequate,  So I stick to the coffee.  There is a separate limited menu for food.. . Having tried all of the seating arrangements from the small counter to the faux ostrich to the croco or the dark banquette against the wall, I'd say avoid the banquette.  It provides no support.  You simply sink in and shrink against your dining guests!. . Finally, I am a BIG fan of the decor.  I think it is truly inspired.  A wonderful space.  This one's a winner!!!
