Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
As far removed from mexican food as Tito's is, I still love the place for its' uniqueness. You can always spot when someone is carrying around the brown box. I can list all the things sooooo inexcusably wrong with this place, but, my predecessors have already eloquently done so for me. I will, however, point out the oft cliched question, where are the pigeons out on the patio??? . . But, I digress. I lean toward the burritos more so than the tacos. I always get a large cup of the salsa, even if I order only Â a burrito or 1 taco. That thing must have crack in it. I can honestly say that I can eat that thing all day til I threw up. The quacamole is watered down and I don't believe there's any avocado in it. Its still got a good taste though. . . Don't be fooled by the long lines. The little ladies behind the counter turn out goods faster than you can run to the bathroom after eating here. Good times!
