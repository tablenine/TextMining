This place is just lovely, and they must know it because they don't try very hard.  I went there early-ish in the morning and the slice of cake I got, though quite large, was completely stale.  My chai was meh.  The service was poor, far too slow.  Also, although the outdoor area is large and was nearly empty I had to change tables twice; once because our table was sticky and once because a busboy was standing on a chair right behind me, fiddling with an umbrella.  Annoying.. . Finally, their prices are far, far too high, even if what they served tasted as good as it looked.
