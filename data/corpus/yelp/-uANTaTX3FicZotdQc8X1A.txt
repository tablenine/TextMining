I have heard that the kogi truck occasionally shows up by the frat row at UCLA. Although the hype that my friends built up on almost convinced me to sacrifice my time to wait for the truck ; the trouble that I had to go through (long line and 2 hours of waiting in the cold, driving to the frat row and the hassle of finding parking )just to savor by then the unknown taste of the Korean taco dissuaded me. However, they were present at an event (Film Premiere  of "Song for Ourselves" by Tad Nakamura)  at Little Tokyo, so I finally had the chance to try the talked about tacos. We waited for 3 hours in line;  everyone at the event was pretty much hungry and the taco truck was conveniently located right outside the theater. We were at the end of the line so by the time we ordered, they ran out of the taco that my friend suggested. I don't remember what I had but I do remember that it didn't live up to my expectations...
