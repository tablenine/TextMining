Key members of my posse love this place, and it's hard not to see why.  The space is amazing.  They have huge indoor and outdoor areas, and three separate bars, all with slightly different vibes.. . The drinks can get really expensive, which is a bit of a drag.  The crowd can be a bit stuffy, but you can easily zone out and repeat the B-Bar mantra of "It's cool.  I'm drinking outside in a nice space, so none of this crap matters...  It's cool.  I'm drinking outside in a nice space, so none of this crap matters...  It's cool.  I'm drinking outside in a nice space, so none of this crap matters...  It's cool.  I'm drinking outside in a nice space, so none of this crap matters..."
