What a Burger..  I was in the ATL on business and I remembered seeing this place on "Man V Food" (Travel Channel).  I visited the Midtown location and ordered the Bacon Blue-Cheese Burger.  The patty is high quality meat and tastes excellent on its own.  One of the best burgers I have ever had (Top 2 for sure).  The Beer selection is great.  I have never paid less that $6 for a Peroni anywhere else.  It was only $3.50 here.. . Anyone who likes burgers and is nearby a location should check it out for sure.  A meal of a burger, fries, and a couple of beers is around 15 bucks.. . The only caveat is that smoking is allowed.  Per ATL law, any establishment that allows smoking is age 18+.  Sorry no kids..
