Order the Turkey Sandwich! Wow. I was seriously impressed.  The meat, tender and juicy, and extra juicy with the au jus dip.  My eyes are always bigger than my stomach of course, so I ordered the following:. . Roasted Turkey in au jus. Pickled Beets (a tad too sweet). Pickle . Cherry Pie. -------------------- = for about $12 bux.. . I really liked the pickled beets, but they had too much sugar in them.  The flavor of the beets alone would have been nice with the pickled onion that's in the mix.  . . The pickle was $1.00 and they quarter it for you, I gave most of it away because they're kinda big.. . Cherry pie, wasn't impressed.  The crust seemed mass produced, and the filling was most likely canned considering the fake jelly like consistency.  I will try the Banana Cream pie next time.. . And, I'll definitely be getting the Turkey sandwich again!
