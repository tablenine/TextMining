Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
BELIEVE THE HYPE.... Pink's is for real.  Their dogs are GREAT.  They have a certain snap to 'em that I personally like in a dog. Hoffy dogs, right?  Stop complaining about the line, it's always gonna be there.  I've actually never eaten at Pink's before 10pm.  It's definitely a late-night spot... Perfect for all those after bar/club food stops in the Hollywood area.. . I've had a native New Yorker straight-up tell me that Pink's is the best hot dog he's ever had. A NEW YORKER... He said it was better than a Gray's Papaya. Better than Nathan's... He said it. No lie.. . My usual order: Nothing too crazy. 2 chili cheese dogs, chili cheese fries and a cream soda. Good good stuff. Tried &amp; true...
