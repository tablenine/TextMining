Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
The first time I came to Sticky Rice, I ordered the Papaya Salad 'spicy'. I've been to lots of Thai places and I've noticed that asking for 'spicy' doesn't really mean that the dish will be spicy so I end up pouring the spicy red sauce all over the dish to have that effect. SO I was not prepared for the truth of the word spicy when spoken in Sticky Rice. My eyes were tearing, my nose running, and tongue burning while trying to consume that salad which I couldn't finish. I loved it. I loved them for having a range of spiciness that's real, that makes you slightly nervous and excited when you order spicy cuz you don't know if you can handle it. . . Yesterday, I ordered Pad Thai. Spicy. Cuz sometimes I enjoy the pain. It makes me feel alive ;). . Anyways, it was delicious and I survived!. . So you should go and find out what spicy really means too.
