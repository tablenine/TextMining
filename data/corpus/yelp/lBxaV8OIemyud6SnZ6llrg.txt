The menu is huge and diverse. Unfortunately, I got an egg salad sandwich, which was only ok. My friend's pastrami sandwich looked incredible (and she confirmed that it was), but being a vegetarian, I didn't sample it. I guess they're famous for their pickles, but I wasn't super impressed with those either. The service was pretty good, the atmosphere was nice (they have an incredible ceiling), and the deserts looked amazing- especially the strawberry cheesecake. They are open 24 hours so we had planned to return for desert, but unfortunately, never made it. I would go back again, but I'll definitely avoid the egg salad in favor of something a little more exciting.
