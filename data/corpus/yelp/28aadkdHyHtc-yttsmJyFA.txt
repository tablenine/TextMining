Restaurant: Canton House Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
The Canton House is quite a sentimental spot for me, as I grew up eating Dim Sum there with my family, along with my mother's best friend, who is from Hong Kong. . . My favorite Dim Sim dish is the turnip cake--a white, gross-looking square comprising chopped radish, dried shrimp and dried mushrooms. Other favorite Dim Sum treats that the Canton House prepares phenomenally include Har Gow (a delicate, translucent dumpling filled with shrimp); Gin Doi (a big ball covered in sesame seeds, filled with bean paste and fried); and the Slippery Noodle (pretty much a flat, long version of the Har Gow--and it will slip right out of your chopsticks!).. . The last time I chowed down on some Dim Sum, the bill came to $20 for two people--and that included lots of Dim Sum exploration and chrysanthemum tea.. . The Canton House always will be dear to me.
