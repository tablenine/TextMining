They do dumplings, and they do dumplings well! I was here in the Arcadia area after Coachella, and my friend told me these were the best dumplings around. We went and we ordered just that- lots of dumplings.. . The only other place I had dumplings was at HC Dumpling up in San Jose, and so I had only one thing to measure them against. As far as what I was looking for in a dumpling, if you call it a "juicy pork dumpling" I expect to have delicious pork flavored juice spill in to my mouth when I bite in to it. They don't disappoint on that part. The skin was thin, the pork was indeed juicy, and the flavor was fantastic! The price was decent, although I remember similarly delicious Xiao Long Bao in Chinatown NYC that were a fraction of the price. This is California though, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better dumpling meal for the price.. . I'm definitely requesting we return here the next time I'm down in southern CA.
