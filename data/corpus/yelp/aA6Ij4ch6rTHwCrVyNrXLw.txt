In the past, I'd had a hard time getting into shows here (when it was Buckhead Backlot), prob because of the small size of the theater - it was sold out 2 times upon my arrival and i had to leave. Kind of annoying. I'd suggest to anyone to purchase advance tickets online to avoid this problem, since even with the renovation, it's still a tiny theater. . . Looks nice inside, the layout leaves much to be desired though. There's not a whole lot of room for moving around once you're seated. Anyone that had to get up to use the restroom during the movie (happens a lot in a place that beer is served by the pitcher) bumped into my chair. Also, there was a couple in front of me who were both in wheelchairs and they had the most miserable time getting in and out of the place even though it is technically handicap accessible. . . On the plus side, good movies, good beer selection, nice bartender. . . Negatives - waitstaff is miserable and rude (they must not be paid tips) and my food was served cold. It's hard to mess up a pizza, but they somehow managed. . . Ah well, all that being said, I'd prob still go again just cause it's fun to go and have drinks during a movie.
