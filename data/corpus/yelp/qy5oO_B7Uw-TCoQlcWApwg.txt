Wow.. We were in NYC and had Katz's deli.  My wife &amp; I made the mistake of thinking it was the same as deli thin-sliced pastrami places (like the Hat).  We ended up getting a beef brisket instead.. . Well we wanted to redeem ourselves after Langer's was featured for their #19 Pastrami with Cole Slaw on Best Thing I've Ever Ate.. . I can't imagine Katz's being any better than Langer's.  The whole sandwich was so perfect.. . The bread was better than Katz's.  And the cole slaw was the perfect complement to the saltiness of the pastrami.  And did I mention the rye bread is amazing?  Nice crisp crust.  Not the kind that cuts your mouth, but perfectly crisp.  And so soft.  The whole sandwich just melts in your mouth.  Wow wow wow.. . Note:  They are only open M-SAT (until 4pm).
