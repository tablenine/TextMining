Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
I treat myself to the Majestic only one morning a month, and I so look forward to the egg, cheese, and turkey sausage sammich on wheat, maybe with a side of well-done hashbrowns. Mmmm. Yeah. . . You'd think, from the hipster staff, that service might be too... well... hipster, but they're all great. Many have worked there for a good long while, at least on the morning shift. Really what a diner staff should be. . . The late nights I've spent at the Majestic have always been surreal. Strange folks, sometimes, and lots of drunk-dining. Good stuff.
