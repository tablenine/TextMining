Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I've been eating at this place ever since I was in my mother's womb, literally!  Honestly, the only thing that's changed is it's prices.  I absolutely love this place!  When I go to sit down and eat, I ALWAYS get is their taquito plate.  SO DELICIOUS!  My job is close by, so when we have parties we always get the Manny's special.  This burrito is sooo huge.  It says that it can feed 4 people, but my department is made up of 8 people and we still have left overs.  I really enjoy eating at the restaurant.  Once in a while you'll get a visit from Manny, the owner of Tepeyac.  He walks around like everyone is his friend and offers each person a free shot of tequila.  How could I not give this place 5 stars?
