Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
I bought:. . -5 cheeserolls . -5 potato balls. -1 spinach danish. -1 chicken empanada. -1 chorizo pie. -1 apple danish. -1 midnight sandwich with potato ball. -1 steak torta sandwich. -1 coke. . Bill came to $26. . Was in a massive long line, ordered my food, ate it, and was out in all but an hour. You need to have your partner find a seat while you're waiting in line to order. I was new at this, my first time. . . I wanted to buy everything I saw. But that would have given me a heart attack and an empty wallet. The service was surprisingly fast.... they obviously are experienced at this.. . The sandwiches were delicious. My favorite pastry is the cheese roll. Oh dear. You could get high cholesterol just eating that alone. The potato ball was really good too..... . Other than the long line, I really don't have anything bad to say about this place except that I will come back many more times and don't give a damn if I lose my figure from eating all this butter and sugar induced food!!
