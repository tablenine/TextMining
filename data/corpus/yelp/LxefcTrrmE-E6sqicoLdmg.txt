Restaurant: Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant
Category: Breweries
I have been to Gordon Biersch quite a number of times by now. Live next door so easy to get to. This is a micro brewery / bar w. a bar type menu. It used to be pretty good food and a great place to celebrate TGIF or sports events. Recently this location has seen a serious reduction in food quality. . . The place is always busy and they have both indoor and patio seating. . . We have had beef frites, burgers, new year strip steak and fish of the day (talapia) here. Their garlic frites are now so sprinkled with garlic that they are bad for your stomach. I love good garlic frites but this is waste of garlic. We went there recently and had calamari for starters. They were not properly fried - this is not rocket science. Everyone could see that they were not properly fried -- poor quality. The talapia came with DRY rice - a lump of "glued" up rice. Again poor quality. . . We used to go here as the beer is really great and the food was pretty good. The beer is still fantastic but the food is no longer of good quality. We have also been to the Gordon Biersch in Buckhead and the kitchen is much better at that location.
