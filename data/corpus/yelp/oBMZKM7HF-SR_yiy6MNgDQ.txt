Im not into curry except what my mom and aunt makes.. . But my oh my, this place changed my mind. the Yellow curry was amazing! . . down fall was their soup was only sour, dont remember which one (hot n sour maybe?) and their chrysanthemum tea tasted like iced water with color. . . Service was great, and a fun singer on stage. Loved it here!
