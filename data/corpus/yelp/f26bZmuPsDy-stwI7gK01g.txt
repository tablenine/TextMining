Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
No doubt the food is SUPERB! Love the thinly sliced meat, the fresh veggies, noodles and mushrooms. The SAUCE is a bomb! Love the peanut sauce. . . Due to the VERY LONG wait, I entertain myself by watching the cool japanese tourists who are also waiting in line. Everytime they come here, they show off their hi-tech cellphones, digicams, futuristic hairdos and rock star wardrobe. They hold their chopsticks different from chinese and koreans. The finger movement is more fluid.. . Aside from their jamming shabu-shabu, I like their UCC iced coffee. I also call their female servers lucy lu and they answer to the name.. . Don't go here when you are starving. Snack a little because the wait is long.... but so worth it!
