Parking is horrendous. I came here for lunch and got the last parking spot in the back. It's nice inside, though, the environment is very relaxing, the decor was understated. The chefs were very friendly, people seemed to be having a great time. This was actually one of the first places I visited for sushi after I got over my "ewwww, wtf I'm not eating raw fish" reaction. I wasn't very adventurous, I only got the rolls (tuna, spicy tuna, spicy albacore), and was sufficiently impressed as a sushi novice.. . Sakura will always hold a special place in my heart, though. This is the place I will forever remember as the sushi bar that introduced me to the buttery, silky, fantastically delicious wonder that is scallop.
