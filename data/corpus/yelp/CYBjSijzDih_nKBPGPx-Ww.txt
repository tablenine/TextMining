I waited at Kogi for over and hour. My poor friend who was Catholic, broke his no meat on fridays for this. All because they decided to take a break at 11:50 pm.. hahaha. . Anyways, I ordered 3 short ribs tacos, 2 spicy pork, 1 chicken and 1 tofu.. . For some odd reason, being a meat lover, I really enjoyed the tofu. I do agree that the cabbage/relish whatever they have on top is a little over powering.. . The food isn't bad. I wished the spicy labels on the tacos were actually spicy. I really wanted the kick, especially because I was waiting in the cold for over an hour.. . I hated this even more when I noticed people cutting. I even saw some of my own friends walk all the way to the front of the line. *shakes head* thats a no no. Don't cut. Makes Daisy mad. really really mad.. . So overall, not bad, unique, but I rather have mexican tacos. lengua baby!
