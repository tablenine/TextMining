I was treated to a lovely belated birthday dinner at Pricci and the experience was average. This being my second Buckhead Life Group restaurant, I anticipated pretension in the air, but wasn't greeted with that at all. . . I agree with the reviews regarding the dipping sauce for the bread - the goat cheese and marinara combination, I just couldn't get enough of...even IF the bread was blah tasting. . . I ordered the Tortelli, which had waaayyy too many pine nuts for my taste. The waiter probably thought I was doing the girly thing by picking at my food, but seriously, the flavor from the pine nuts overwhelmed my taste buds. Once I removed about 40 of those things, the pasta was great! The arugula salad was fresh. As for dessert, I wasn't feeling glutenous so tasted the Flan-type dish my friend ordered...yuck! It may have just been me - he polished it off haha. . . Overall, I think the place is ok....to be in the 'heart' of Buckhead, I am surprised at how dusty this place is...or maybe its just me being a neat freak :)
