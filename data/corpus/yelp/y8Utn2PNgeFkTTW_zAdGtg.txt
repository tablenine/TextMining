Not much to say that hasn't already been said or printed in publications. Absolutely killer food...inventive, fresh and robust with flavor. The complexities of flavor grab me every time. Â 5 stars for efficient professional service; 3.5 stars for friendliness during peak hours (they seem bit rushed and a bit impatient if some in your party ask lots of questions about the food). High prices, but well worth what you get. Would eat here 2x/week if I could. Ambiance is WONDEFUL and Nancy Silverton really is a Goddess with bread. Love it!
