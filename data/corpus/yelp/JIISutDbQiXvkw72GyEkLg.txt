Very good food, just waaaayyyy too much....... but flavorful nonetheless. French Toast is a must!!!!  The best way to "experience" this place is to go with several people and everyone order something different, so you can taste. A place of sheer torture when you're trying to lose weight.  Keep up the good work guys.
