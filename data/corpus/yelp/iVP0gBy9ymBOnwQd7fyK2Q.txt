Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Lala's is one my favorite restaurants ever! I love the casual ambience but truly the food here is amazing!! their chimichurri rocks! I usually always ask for more but try to leave room for the food but can really just eat bread with chimichurri alone.. . I have been here for lunch and dinner and have taken several friends and they have come out with great comments about it.. . I prefer dining in the patio than inside because inside it can feel a little bit crowed since there isn't too much room and plus I enjoy the candle light setting during dinner outside :). . Everytime I go I leave happy and wanting to go back....I live far from Los Angeles but when I am in the area it's almost sure that I'll stop by.. . I LOVE IT!
