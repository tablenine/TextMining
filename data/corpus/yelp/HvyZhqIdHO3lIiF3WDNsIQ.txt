Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Delicious fancy flare. I wouldn't say this is a traditional Argentinean Grill but more of a fusion restaurant, because this place not only sells chorizo, but also penne alfredo. So you can probably get something you like even if you're not in the mood for Argentinean food. Order their mashed potatoes they are delectable. . . The service is ok here the male waiters seem like they're bored, but the one female seemed happy. . . So even though it may not be 100% Argentinean, the food is really good. Check it out. The one in Studio City is really good too.. . Enjoy.
