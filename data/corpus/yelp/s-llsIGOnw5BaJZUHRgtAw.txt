Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
When I was a medical student at USC, I probably ate at El Tepeyac once a week.  One time, I downed an entire Hollenbeck burrito right before I had to jump onto the elevator at University Hospital.  Oh boy, I think all the blood was in my stomach digesting that burrito goodness and the quick upwards ascent in the elevator pulled the remaining blood from my brain.  I almost blacked out!!!  . . I can honestly say though that I've never eaten inside the restaurant.  We always went to the side window and got our orders to go.  Gotta love those crunchy tacos and the thigh sized burritos.  Definitely worth a special trip just to experience those flavors again.
