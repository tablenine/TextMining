Found Mana from the a la card deck, and was very impressed.  It's kinda pricy, but portions (even the smalls) were decent and surprisingly filling for mostly raw food.. . The Watermelon Sake Cocktail was an ideal refresher on a hot Summer day, with a subtle flavor that wasn't as crazy-sweet as most fruity drinks.  . . My favorite dishes were the Sweet Potato Pancake with Pear Chutney (OMG yummm!) and the Red Quinoa Salad with Almonds and Tangerine Dressing.  . . The Mushroom-Rice "Slider" had good flavor, but the generic bun was squishy and didn't really work with the equally spongy patty (I know they were going for White Castle authenticity, but a whole-grain rendition would've been better all-around :). . Service was very friendly and efficient.  Seating was somewhat uncomfortable and cramped, but on weeknights the crowd wasn't quite as bad as I've seen it on Fridays.
