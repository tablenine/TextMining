Good but a bit of a letdown for a happy hour.  . http://DiscoverLosAnge....  recommended this as a high end happy hour (other places included Chaya, Katana, Zucca), so I was expecting something real grand and gorgeous.  Well, beats me what is meant by 'high-end' because Fraiche was alright.. . It's a quiet spot, at the end of the Culver City downtown.  Evidently, its French-Italian, and the decor does strike me as a cross of both cultures.  Outside patio with couches and tables seems French, the interior which features a stone wall and dark, wood tones seems Italian.  I wouldn't call the restaurant an example of excellence as a restaurant layout, but its alright.. . Mixed drinks were ok as well; the fraiche fizz was a nice house speciality.  Foods such as the fondue, shrimp cocktail, fries were all familiar, I wish I could say more, but that's about it.  The only thing that I did like was the innovative meatball slider.  That was something a little different that still quelled the taste buds. . . In the end, Fraiche was an ok spot for a happy hour; if you're looking for a place that is subdued and gentle, then Fraiche would be a good choice.
