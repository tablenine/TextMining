Meh.. . This place seems to get mixed reviews...so here's mine!. . We ordered a deep dish and I was expecting much better for all the hype this place has! Nothing really stood out about this pizza: sauce was ok, cheese was ok, toppings (well, fillings) were ok too. It was just ok. . . It got the job done, we walked out full but I definitely didn't have the "WOOO, I just had the bestest Chicago-style deep dish pizza evAr" feeling that I was hoping to get. Not going to be telling my friends to check this place out, but hey, I guess I've tried real deep dish now.
