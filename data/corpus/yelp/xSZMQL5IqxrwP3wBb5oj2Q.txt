Bad service doesnt intimidate me. Food is awesome and that is why I come. You may need to wait long, but know there are plenty more Korean joints further north on Lincoln Ave. I like the smell of bbq'd meats. Galbi and the seafood pancake are my faves. If you don't mind your clothes smelling like the grill and having the table next to you smell your body odor, this is one for you.
