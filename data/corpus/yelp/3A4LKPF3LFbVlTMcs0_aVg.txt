The chicken was scrumptiousssss! Smothered it in the gravy and I think I just swallowed the chicken whole. The waffles were good too but I didn't think they were anything to special. I expected more from this famous combo of chicken and waffles. I think I like my chicken separate from my waffles though. I ordered a side of mac n cheese. Don't bother, it comes in a bowl the size of my wrist -_- but DO come here for some chicken!
