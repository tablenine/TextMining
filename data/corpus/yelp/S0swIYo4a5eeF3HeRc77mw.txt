Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The line is intimidating and so is the menu. So many different options, too small of a stomach.... . We went to Pink's on a Sunday and the wait was about half an hour, but it was fun to be able to experience this bit of Americana for the first time.. . I opted for a modified version of the Ozzy dog (yes, it's named after the always amusing Ozzy Osbourne)... a spicy Polish sausage served with nacho cheese, tomatoes and grilled onions. It usually comes with American cheese along with the nacho cheese and guacamole, but it seemed like overkill. I skipped the American cheese and guac and added bacon (yes, I upped the artery-clogging quotient). . . The food I saw being served while I waited was ridiculous- a double bacon cheeseburger with chili AND a spicy Polish sausage. I watched a tiny Asian lady delicately attempt to consume a gigantic hot dog piled high with sour cream, sauerkraut and other unknown ingredients. Waiting for her to drop it all over herself was liking watching an Olympic event.. . I looked over at my bf, whose face was covered in chili cheese- nose, mouth and chin. I was so busy being entertained by the sight of everyone eating absurd looking portions that my own eating extravaganza became secondary.. . I won't say it was the best dog I've ever eaten, but my modified Ozzy was very spicy and tasty. The shock value of the gigantic creations being shoveled into faces made it a great experience.
