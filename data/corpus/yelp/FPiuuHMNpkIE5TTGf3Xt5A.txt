Matt's list of things that are good:. . 1) patios. 2) whiskey. 3) tequila. 4) tacos. . having the four things on my list and doing all four very well? 4 stars for you, Big Star! . . I have to say, the pork belly tacos were excellent, as was my seafood tostada! That staff was incredibly friendly as well. All around a very pleasant experience. I'm sure i'll be back on my next visit to Chicago.
