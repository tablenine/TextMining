What can I possibly say about a place that has been yelped over 200 times that you haven't heard before?. . Ah yes, a viable outline of the Bottega:. . 1) in the heart of downtown, but surprisingly unshabby and chic. Dim, romantic lighting and open space with marble....oh, yeah, that's ritzy..... . 2) Relatively great prices for delicious food.. . 3) You must...must....MUST order the meatball sliders. all that delightful marinara with cheese and the meatball, enveloped between two delicious wheat buns....and, let's not forget the side of garlic fries, with so much garlic, you will reek of the spice for days.. . 4) please stay away from the sparkling water. yeah, it's sounds all NYC Carrie Bradshaw trendy...but the taste isn't worth it. . . And, there you have it. . . The most concise review you will EVER read.
