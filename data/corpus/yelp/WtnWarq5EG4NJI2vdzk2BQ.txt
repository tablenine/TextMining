I stop here every once in a while when riding the Blue Line home form the airport. (It's right off the Damen stop). I like the Chili Noodles with Beef. Awesome. I've tried some of their rolls and maybe it's just me, but I don't really like rolls that are served cold. That's the only reason this place doesn't get a 5.
