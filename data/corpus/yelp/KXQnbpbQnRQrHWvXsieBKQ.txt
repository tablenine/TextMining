Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
My hubby and his family LOVE Tito's.  Personally, I don't get it.  I think it's kinda gross and I feel unhealthy after I eat it.  Like, I might have a heart attack any minute after taking a bite of their food.  My brother-in-law claims that if you're from LA and grow up on Tito's, you love it.  I guess you could call it LA comfort food.  To me, it couldn't be more uncomfortable.
