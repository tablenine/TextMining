We got delivery and had to pay a little extra because I'm 'out of the delivery area', but it was worth it.  The banh mi are a good price here, and it's probably hard to find them in this area.  (If you know of other good places in the neighborhood let me know!). . The sandwiches are so juicy they might soak through the paper, but just grab a couple of extra napkins and you'll be in for a delicious treat....
