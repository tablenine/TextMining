Had a wonderful dinner here the other night. Due to my outrageous company, I shreked in horror as a prank text was sent on my behalf, I'm sorry if any of you were there that night and heard me. Back to the food, I ordered the flat iron steak salad, I wish it was on baby greens or spinach, the butter lettuce was overpowering to me and I wasn't too into the dressing, it was a bit sweet. The steak slices were great though, flavorful seasoning and not overcooked. We also ordered the seared ahi hot plate, a chicken cesear salad and a spinach salad. The seared ahi was great, they really let the meat/fish shine by knowing how to not overcook it. It came with some mashed potatoes and a small portion of a spinach salad. I liked the chicken cesear salad, they piled plenty of chicken on and the dressing was spot on. The spinach salad was tasty too. . . Decor is simple and clean. Service is attentive and fast.
