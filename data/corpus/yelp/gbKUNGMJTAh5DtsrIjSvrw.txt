I like this place and it does live up to expectations. . . There are a couple of draw backs though. Due to the local climate, the dough here is not as tasty as the one in downtown Taipei. However, the food is way better than the one in downtown Tokyo. (The Tokyo one was awful.) . . I personally favor boiled dumplings over steamed dumplings, and that's why I'm giving it only 4 stars.
