After many attempts of trying to catch the Kogi truck I finally did this past weekend in Venice by The Brig. Arrived at around 11:30pm and waited for about 45 minutes, the wait didn't seem that bad and time went by fairly quickly because of all the people I was surrounded by. . . Since I had a feeling this was going to be my first and last attempt of getting Kogi, the BF and I decided it would be best if I ordered a bunch of different things so I get to sample most of the items on their menu. We got:. . Korean Short Ribs Taco ($2). Spicy BBQ Chicken Taco ($2). Spicy Pork Taco ($2). Korean Short Ribs Burrito ($5). Kogi Sliders (two pieces for $5). . Okay I must admit they were all very tasty but it's so not worth taking a long drive all the way over to a Kogi location, wait in a ridiculous long line, and pay for some over priced tacos, sliders, and burritos. Yes, I think they're overpriced! At a regular "taco" truck you can get more for your money. People hyped it up so much that I was expecting something amazing, when it actuality it was average. But if the truck was in an area that happened to be where I'm at and the line wasn't so long, maybe I'll get a taco or two.
