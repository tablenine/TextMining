Restaurant: Yard House

Bottom line: their happy hour is amazing.. Half off selected appetizers and fairly cheap drinks.. The food is great. The prices are cheap.  And it's twice a day most days.. 3-6  M-F and 10-midnight Sun-W. The place is huge and the people there are really great. We got excellent service by everyone there- serves, busers, hostesses, etc. . . And if you ever are down in Orange County, go to the yardhouse at the Irvine Spectrum. A guy stole my coat from there once- well, he tried- until the bartenders and manager CHASED him down the parking lot and retrieved it for me. I didn't even ask them to, they just noticed the guy lurking around me and my friends and when we left asked where my coat was, when they realized it wasn't there they took off to track him down. SO SWEET OF THEM.
