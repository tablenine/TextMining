For a gourmet burger this is your spot. However, bring your bib, latex gloves, and terry cloth to towel off afterwards because that ish is messy. I'm not much of a fan of raw bars, but for those of you who are, I hear that this is tha place. I give it three stars, not because the food is bad (the food is phenomenal), but because I want to give it another chance before I give it the almighty 4 or 5 stars. The prices are a bit ridiculous but come on, there is a buzz about everything that Suzanne Goin does, and they are not stupid.
