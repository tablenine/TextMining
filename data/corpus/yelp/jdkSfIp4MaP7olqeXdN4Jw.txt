the clark kent of eateries.  Appears average at first glance, like any typical joint....until you sit down and your hit with the first shocker, the menu.  The menu is a double sided...small font....filled edge to edge with items that will knock your socks off.  Each dish with it's own witty name along with a description of each item that comes on your plate.  Every dish is a combo on its own.. . For my cherry-poppin visit, i ordered the "Mr. Mention" which includes jerk oxtail, beef-a-roni, eggs, and toast.  . . The jerk oxtail was tender and easily separated from the bone.  The flavor had a kick of spice, but nothing that was too overwhelming.  It was perfectly balanced by the fluffy eggs and meaty beef-a-roni.  The beef-a-roni was a mixture of ground beef and pasta.  a perfect side of tasty carbs.  This dish also comes with two slices of toast.  Maybe it was because i was starving...but i really believe that even their toast is better than the average toast.  Their toast isn't the hard toaster type, but is more of a buttery toast that has been warming up on the grill.. . I also tried the pumpkin pancake which was fluffy, perfect amount of pumkin taste and came with your own mini-bottle of real syrup.  Delicious!. . It's a relaxed environment, big portions, quality food, and you can find the owner/chef sitting out front chatting with his patrons.. . The hours make it difficult to dine here, but it's worth the extra effort if you can manage it.
