So I wake up Sunday morning without a hangover and I'm thinking GREAT!!!!!! Let's drink some more. I tell the boyfriend " let's find an outdoor spot so we can dine &amp; booze."  We turn to YELP for HELP and find ALCOVE.  . . We get there and it's so pretty that I'm afraid now because I think  "ugh...... Pretty spots usually equals bad food." That's been my experience anyway.  We ordered : Bison Chili fries, Buffalo Wrap &amp; two beers. BC fries sucked. Too sweet. I had to add that Cholula hot sauce to it and  a LOT . The wrap was even worse. All I could taste was the hard tortilla and an overload of cheese. If I wanted  a stale quesadilla, I would have gone to taco bell. The side salad &amp; the beers were the only highlights. Maybe I should have ordered breakfast???
