This is what my friend declared to me upon eating the lukewarm cup of roasted red pepper soup:. . "It tastes like the base for Progresso Vegetable Soup.". . And the more I thought about it -- the more I realized that Soup had been microwaved in the cup because only part of it (the bottom left) was warm -- the more I realized she was right.  My friend is usually right.  It's why she is my very wise friend.. . We each had a salad afterwards: she the beets and greens and I the warm mushroom.  Overdressed.  And boring.  Her beets tasted like mush.  My warm mushrooms weren't warm.  I liked the pine nuts in mine.  Actually, I ordered it for the pine nuts.  But both of us wish we hadn't ordered either of our overdressed, boring salads.  . . With all the places in LA -- with the fact that Canters, La Brea Bakery, Urth, and even Toast (though I can't deal with the crowds there) are within spitting distance of Blu Jam -- I'll spit my way by Blu Jam.  Not literally.  Just trying to extend a metaphor, although poorly.  In the same way that Blu Jam advertised vegan soup to me as tasty and it was a sham.  Sham!
