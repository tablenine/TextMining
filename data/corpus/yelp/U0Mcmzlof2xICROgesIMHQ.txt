Last night, after being told the wait for Crust was over an hour, my boyfriend and I decided to stroll down Division, to find something else. We came across this, which was a huge find.  . . I ordered the Veggie Burger, which was amazing.  It did take a while to come out, and the sides were a little charred, but the taste was great, and there were lots of chunks of actual veggies in it, which is good. They've got a lot of veggie sandwiches as well, plus a make-your-own option, so I will definitely be back to try different things, and maybe find (or create) the perfect veg sandwich in Chicago.. . Not only do they have a huge menu, their beer list also takes up a 3-page menu, complete with detailed descriptions, which i love reading.  . . Our service was kind of spotty, but very friendly.
