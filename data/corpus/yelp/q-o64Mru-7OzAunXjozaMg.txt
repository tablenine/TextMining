I tried, Fred.  I tried a number of times.  Maybe because of your cute little kitschy decor, maybe because you're convenient, but no more.  . . Your food is overpriced and completely boring.  . . Your service....well, let's talk about that for a sec - how is it you think one waitress can handle almost all of your tables at once?  I mean, yes, you're not that big, but no one could handle that many tables at once.  Even if they were really good at what they do, which they are not (at least the ones who have waited on me and my compatriots).  They are extremely cranky as well, and I can't even really blame them.  . . You get by based on location, but in these times getting by may not be enough, Fred.. . Think about it.
