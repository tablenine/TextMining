Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The short take: Comfortable atmosphere where breakfast is king, prices are reasonable, and families are welcome.. . My wife and I have been going to Kitsch'n on and off again since they opened and while the food may not be quite what it was there's still a lot to speak well of this neighborhood stalwart. I'm not alone in thinking of Kitsch'n as primarily a breakfast destination and with the exception of a few standouts (chipotle ribs: sweet, spicy, and decidedly nontraditional but lovely all the same) it's your best bet. Eggs are always done well, the portions are generous, and there's a good mix of sweet and savory choices available. The chilaquiles and the huevos locos have great heat without being overpowering, and the crab cake benedict is indulgent. More traditional fare: pancakes, eggs and toast, are done well and the eggs are super fresh. I find the french toast to be a bit too sweet for breakfast, but it might be lovely to share with friends over their coffee: an Intelligentsia house blend.. . 70s and 80s kitsch is the theme with Barbarella and Billy Dee Williams on display amidst more personal items from the owner's childhood. At your table you can usually find a magic eight ball or an etch-a-sketch, a welcome distraction for fidgety kids. The staff is generally welcoming though I feel like it misses the presence of an ever busier Helene and Jon. Service is laid back though still reasonably attentive, and we've really only ever had problems in the heat of the brunch rush and then only on rare occasion. The patio is lovely during the spring and summer and heated in the winter for a unique outside feel on a cold winter morning. If you find yourself in the neighborhood in need of a bite, or are looking someplace the family can get a bite without feeling like second class citizens, Kitch'n is an excellent choice.
