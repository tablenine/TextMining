Restaurant: Koronet Pizza
Category: Pizza
IF: your main criteria for a slice are that it be over-sized and cheap, and IF: you think you'd enjoy pizza whose taste and crust mouthfeel approximate sheet rock left out in the rain slathered with Ragu and Polly-O mozzarella, and IF: you are heinously hammered, craving grease, and have just emerged from the subway on 110 and Bway and Koronet's lights resemble an oasis in the desert, then by all means grab a slice here. . If, on the other hand, as a NYer you relish your proximity to myriad quality pizza places and wish to exercise a modicum of discernment, go elsewhere.
