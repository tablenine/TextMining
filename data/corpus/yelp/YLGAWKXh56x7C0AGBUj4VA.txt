Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
I know I shouldn't say anything but I'll let you all in on a little secret: while everybody was getting imbibed at Apotheke, I snuck out and went to Mei Lai Wah to get a few baked pork buns. Luckily, everyone I left at Apotheke was plastered out of their minds to even realize I was gone for 30 minutes.. . So after leaving Apotheke, a few of my fellow debauchers were hungry and someone suggested Great NY Noodle Town, which was right around the corner. Mind you, I was still rather full from the siopao at Mei Lai Wah. But went I did, and ordered I did. . . It's called Great NY Noodle Town for a reason, right? Which means they must specialize in noodles, right? Exactly! So I got chicken with soy sauce over white rice (Okay so I'm not a real Asian because I hate noodles. My Asian privileges were revoked a long time ago when I made the mistake of saying I preferred baked ziti over sinigang). . . And the food came out hella quick! The words "chicken with soy sauce over white rice" barely left my mouth when the food suddenly appeared. It was as if our waiter pulled it out of a magic hat, but instead of a white rabbit he pulled out my chicken and white rice. . . Did somone say "cheap?" How about between the four of us at the table, the bill came out to $20, INCLUDING tip? Dude, this beats having to spend $15 for the same size portions at John's Shanghai around the corner.
