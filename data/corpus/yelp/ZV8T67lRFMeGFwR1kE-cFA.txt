I think this place has gone downhill since they expanded. Why, in my day, they didn't serve mixed drinks, and the service was faster! We walked to school barefoot through the snow! etc. etc.. . Seriously, though, I don't go here very much anymore because I hate waiting fifteen minutes for a table, ten minutes for the server to show up, twenty-five minutes for an order of potatoes, ten minutes for a refill, and however long for the check. I really got spoiled by the awesome staff that was there six or seven years ago. It isn't really the fault of the people who work there, all the time--as a former waitress I know there's no good way to work eight tables at once. Being understaffed is a management issue. Maybe it's changed since I was there last, a few months ago, but for now, I only go back for the North Shore potatoes since Pick Me Up is a quick walk away and almost never has a line to be seated.. . Funny story: several years ago I was sitting by the window and saw a huge rat outside. I thought it was a dog at first, and it looked like it was trying to steal a bicycle.
