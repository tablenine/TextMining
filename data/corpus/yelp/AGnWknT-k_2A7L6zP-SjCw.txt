Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
Rosa's is the place that my family always wants to go to when they are in town. Their guacamole is awesome, they make it right in front of you however you like (and always with a smile), and their food is great. But MOST of all you absolutely MUST try their frozen pomegranate margaritas! They are probably the reason that I don't even remember the first time I went to Rosa's and discovered them in the first place... but that's OK! They are worth it and will make you as happy as can be. . Perfect place for dinner/drinks before a concert/opera at Lincoln Center, but be sure to make a reservation.
