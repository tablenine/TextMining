I really appreciate having Dunlay's within walking distance from my house. They have a really great brunch, including some of the best hashbrowns in the city, which are really creamy and addictive, even better served on the patio out front. The burgers are pretty great, and at half price on wednesdays are hard to pass up. Pizzas are surprisingly really good as well. They have a pretty good selection of TV's to catch a game, which I was thinking about doing this evening, as it's NCAA tournament time. The beers aren't cheap, but they have a pretty good selection, including Fat Tire on tap. . . To all the complainers out there, who act like it's freaking TGI McFunsters, not a local business with solid food, don't eat here. Whaa whaa whaa (a la Debbie Downer).
