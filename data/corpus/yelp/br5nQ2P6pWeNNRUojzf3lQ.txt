umm.... yeah it's a pretty place. . didn't try the food, but i'm sure it's just jap fusion crap and funky rolls (please, those are not sushi by the way. and they're not japanese) that i hate. . . things i liked: . 1. bathroom area. 2. efficient layout of bar area - spacious bar, island counter that you can put your drinks on while standing, and lounge area. . things i hated:. 1. playing crazy japanese tv shows on the wall is pretty stupid. almost embarrassing... and i'm not even japanese. 2. overuse of japanese characters and tacky pics on the wall. 3. a white girl walking around dressed like a geisha. ridiculous. . 4. overall atmosphere... it's like a nice irish pub in somewhere in seoul or tokyo... japanese girl wearing blonde wig, tshirt with english words like..... 'destiny' 'heart' 'friendship' something like that. . 5. weak drinks
