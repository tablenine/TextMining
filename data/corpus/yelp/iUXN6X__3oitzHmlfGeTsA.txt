OK, the burgers here are NOT all that great. I think people like them because they get caught up in the atmosphere of the place. Â The outdoor patio *is* lovely, esp. as it begins to grow dark and the waitstaff comes around to light the candles on the tables. It's a great place to while away a summer evening getting drunk with a group of friends. The indoor part is a pitch-black lair that smells of grease and smoke and should be avoided unless it rains.
