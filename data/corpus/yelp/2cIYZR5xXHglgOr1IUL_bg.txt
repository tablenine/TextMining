Restaurant: The Nook On Piedmont Park
Category: American (Traditional)
Okay, so this place is probably nice if you live nearby.  Or if you're drunk.  Or if you want to get drunk, have a great time, and you live nearby.  And/Or all of the previously mentioned + you have the munchies.  . . It's great if a place is crowded, which means it's popular and the owners are making a killing.  However, when it's so crowded that you can't move 3 feet without bumping into 10 people...?  Then when you finally make it to the restroom, well, let's just say it's not very accommodating. . . The totchos are great... I will give them that. . Parking?  Well, it's limited of course, and there is the valet.  It all depends on your patience with the area.  My suggestion?  Go dine at Einstein's on Juniper and park with them, then walk to the Nook for some after-meal drinks and socializing.  . . If something wasn't right with your order, then you may want to message me, as I don't think it's appropriate for me to post it on here.
