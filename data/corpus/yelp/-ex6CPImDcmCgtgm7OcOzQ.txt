Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I love Roscoe's. The waffles and fried chicken are the best! When I go, I get the Carol C. with a side of beans and rice. The greens are pretty good as well. Â The waiter service is always great. . . I just don't understand how there's a KFC right next door to this Roscoe's location...doesn't make sense because the chicken just doesn't compare.
