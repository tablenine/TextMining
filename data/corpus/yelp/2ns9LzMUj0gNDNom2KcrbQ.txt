Restaurant: Orochon Ramen

I guess my review is slightly biased because... I don't like spicy food. I know, super spicy Ramen is this place's selling point. . . So, I ordered a Miso Ramen #7 (no spice). The bowl was really huge with a good portion of soup and noodle. Oops... but I couldn't find much meat. I like my protein, especially during dinner time and was surprised that only a small amount of ground pork in my bowl. I had to order an extra order of egg. The soup is tasty, but overtly salty. . . My friends who liked spicy/hot food did like their bowl of noodles. Almost everyone at my table was wiping off sweat from his/her forehead. The waitress was nice and the atmosphere was quite lively as well. All in all, I think I don't mind coming back with my friends.
