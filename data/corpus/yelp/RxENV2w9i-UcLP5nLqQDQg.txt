Restaurant: La CrÃªperie
Category: French
Great little restaurant to hit up before catching a film at Landmark. We went last night before our movie and were seated inside right away (there was a 30 min wait for the patio). . . We've dined at La Creperie three times now and have enjoyed each. My favs are the Ratatouille crepe and, on the sweet menu, the Pomme (apple) crepe. Hubs likes the Tomat and Jambon. For drinks, I was in a wine mood so tried the Les Fontenelles, which is a French Pinot Noir, slightly fruity with a nice, spicy finish. Hubs was in a cocktail mood and ordered a Sidecar with Maison Surrenne cognac. He's a total Sidecar snob but was impressed with their execution of it.. . A review of La Creperie would not be complete without mentioning the amazing Europeanesque quaintness of the place. Five stars for ambiance.
