If you can, park on Franklin in the block or two east of L. Ron Hubbard. As you walk toward Square One, check out the creepy back side of the old Cedars of Lebanon building (now Scientology headquarters). It's a 1930s medical complex dipped in waxy blue paint. The uppermost tower looks like a fort some kids might have built out of trash. . . This stretch of Fountain is buffered by tall buildings that front Sunset, making Square One seem tucked away in a quiet residential bubble. The wait last Saturday was about 30 minutes. There is a simple, airy indoor dining room and a sprawling back patio with about 10 tables of varying sizes. We sat in the patio and were served quickly by a sweet waitress who checked on us frequently without interrupting conversation or being overbearing. . . The patio is bordered by a tall, green fence and has sparse decor to a beachy effect. A few large canvas umbrellas strung with red lights shade the tables. The sidewalk edge was lined with scrawny plants. . . Our food was basic but well made. My B.L.A.T. (bacon/lettuce/avocado/tomato) on whole grain was big but not too sloppy, with apple smoked bacon and fresh avocado that actually had some flavor. The bacon was about a quarter inch thick in parts with a salty-sweet taste that went well with the subtly sweet, slightly toasted bread. We were there for my friend's birthday and shared brioche french toast with cr√®me fraiche, nuts, and fruity (apricot?) syrup with a candle. I would go back just to have another one of those!
