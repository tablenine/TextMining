this is hands down my favorite restaurant in la.  i looked threw some of the reviews and noticed one reviewer say that garlic noodles "weren't that great."  i want to fist fight that person.  are they crazy.  the garlic noodles are like fricking crack homey.   place is upscale though.  i was wearing sneakers and they tried to stop me from dining in the main room, but luckily i had my velvet playah dinner jacket in my car.   you can dress down, but you gotta eat in the bar area.  . . when you go, get the cracked dungeness crab off the An secret recipe menu, whatever the house chard is, the molton lava cake, and of course the garlic noodles.  do it!
