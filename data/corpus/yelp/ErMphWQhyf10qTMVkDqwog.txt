You know, there are lots of delicious things to eat here, but there are also some mediocre things.  Just be careful.  Anything ice cream-related is a good bet (including their sandwiches and bon bons).  But once I got a brownie and I swear it could've been a Little Debbie.  One thing I like is their foodie gifts.  Like vanilla scented sugar--it makes a great hostess gift!
