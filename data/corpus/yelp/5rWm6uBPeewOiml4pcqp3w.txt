This restaurant is not bad.  I came here with a group of friends for LA restaurant week.  The place is pretty nice.  It has a very trendy/modern/upscale feel, with a very mellow vibe.  The lighting is very easy on the eyes so I liked that.  . . Because it was sunday, they had their Tapas menu out.  I really enjoyed the empenadas and the macilla sausage.  The lamb was really good too.   The white sangria was tasty, but I've had better sangria.  For a place known for their tapas, they were not bad, but I'm curious to see what their main dishes taste like.
