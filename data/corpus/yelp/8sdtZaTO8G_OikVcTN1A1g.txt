Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Wow, I can't believe I haven't written about the Cheesecake Factory yet. This has been my unofficial favorite restaurant for probably fifteen years now, if not more. I remember when it first opened in the Hancock building, I was in maybe second or third grade and I read about it in the Chicago Tribune Kids section, KidNews. And I begged and begged my parents to take me. And ever since then, I have loved it. This Hancock location is definitely my favorite but I have eaten in Cheesecake Factory's all over the country - seriously, any time I go on vacation, I always end up there because I love it so much. I almost always get the Chinese Chicken Salad - oh so good. Their burgers are also delicious, as is the pizza. The last few times I have gone I have gotten this Meditteranean mahi mahi special that is just delightful. The strawberry martini - heaven. And of course the cheesecake. My usual is white chocolate raspberry but I had key lime last time and it was also wonderful. Everything can REALLY add up though - I try not to go there too often. I always end up splitting an app, plus an entree, plus a cocktail (or 2), plus my cheesecake and coffee.... you can pretty easily spend $60+ just for yourself! I have heard complaints about bad service and stuff but overall I just feel that people have crazy high expectations of servers. I have thought this even before I WAS a server but being a server solidified my feelings. Anyway, I truly don't see how you CAN'T like the Cheesecake Factory unless you don't like chain restaurants or something, which I don't understand that either.
