Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Delicious, healthy food, in a nice setting reminiscent of a classy, clean Hamptons kitchen.. I love Joan's. Probably my favorite place to have lunch when working.. Their couscous sides are delicious, and to tell the truth, I never had something I didn't like there. When I am in the mood for putting my diet in jeopardy, I just go for the grilled cheese sandwich... not to mention their cupcakes and cookies.. They also cater, or you can order food to go. The service is quick and the staff is very nice, which is always a big plus for me.
