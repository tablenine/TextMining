Delicious.  Cheap.  Great service.  Unpretentious.. . The owner has always come by to say hello at the end of our meal. . . I love this place.  You can't go wrong with really anything on the menu.  . . It's hidden away in a strip mall on Venice which honestly is part of its appeal.. . Oh.  And I forgot.  The horchata is delicious.  Addictively delicious.
