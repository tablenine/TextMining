Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
The first time I tried it I thought it was nothing great.  Then for some reason I started craving it.  Every time we are in Southern California, we make it a point to eat here.  It's almost always the highlight of our trip.  . . We don't mind the long wait because it gives us an excuse to eat some salmon skin roll from the Japanese restaurant across Shabu shabu as we wait for Mr. Yoshi to call our name.. . The best shabu shabu ever.
