Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
Comme Ca has nice and clean decor, very bright and open space for such a small space! The pomme frites are very very good here! You have your choice of tap or sparkling water (House made sparkling water! not Perrier) The creme brulee is pretty darn good as well. Parking is tough on weekends, but on weekdays it's pretty decent. I haven't had a chance to try anything else yet because every time I'm in the area I've already eaten or will be eating soon, but I sure do stop by for some sparkling water and pomme frites!
