When I moved back from New York, my heart was broken because I would be leaving behind my beloved pastrami sandwiches from Katz deli.  Their pastrami was so tender it melts in your mouth and piled so high that you would dislocate your jaw if you tried to bit into it.  But then I discoverd Langer's and I feel somewhat whole again.  Although the pastrami isn't piled as high here, it's still tender and tasty.  Parking is convienent and the service was great.  Big ups to Evelyn for being the sweetest waitress I've ever encountered!!
