Ok, let's be honest.  Lots of places in Chicago can manage to put together a decent hot dog - they are not exactly the hardest things to make.  But this place KNOWS Chicago and they KNOW Chicago dogs.  And this from a girl who considers herself pretty knowlegeable about the city herself!. . The service is hilarious.  Be prepared, this is much more Ed Debevic's than Charlie Trotters, and I doubt they are even as nice as at Ed's.  I was getting pissed at some guy, and they were like, "Oh no honey, he did not!"  Ahhh the joys of dating.. . Go. Eat. Get yelled at. It's fun, I promise.
