Great customer service. While waiting in line, servers will come outside and give samples of the food - fries, cookies, beef sausage, coffee, etc.. . I highly recommend the french fries and the horseradish dipping sauce. The fries are crisp and flavorful. I also recommend the beef sausage. They put lemon juice on top and it's very yummy
