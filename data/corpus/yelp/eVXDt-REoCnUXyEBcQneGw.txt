Restaurant: Pio Pio
Category: Latin American
All the makings of a great dining place without pretentious prices or service. . .  An entire pio is less than $10, and most sides cost less than $5.  The chicken is moist.  Need I say more?  . . Try the saffron rice and the salchipapas (potatoes with french fries).
