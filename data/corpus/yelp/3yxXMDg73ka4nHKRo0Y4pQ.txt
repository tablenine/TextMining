Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
There's lots of places to eat around this area and thought I'd try this place since I was craving a salad and the name fit... Tender Greens.. . I ordered the Tuna Nicoise and the Rustic Chicken Soup with Lemon Thyme, just to try. Both were delicious, the salad came with a big piece of seared Ahi and lots of greens. The soup was hearty and filling with big chucks of chicken and a hint of lemon.. . I got there as they opened, 11:30 and there was a line already. The format is production line. You order, then follow the line to receive your order and pick a drink and of course, pay.. . I'll for sure be back to try more items on the menu.
