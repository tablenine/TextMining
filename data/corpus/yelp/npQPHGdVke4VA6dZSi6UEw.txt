Ai que delicioso!!!. . The couple of times I've been here has been excellent.  The food is always spot on, the service is good, the sangria is yummy, the atmosphere is great... there's really nothing more I can say!. . I'm going to Argentina next month so I'll tell you how it compares!  =)  Now THAT'S the real test!
