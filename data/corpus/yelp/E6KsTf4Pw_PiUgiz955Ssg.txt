Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
My thoughtful husband picked this restaurant because I LOVE mexican food.  He heard of it from a friend and decided to try it out.  Just by judging by the trendy decor and high prices - I was thinking, the food would probably be good.  Boy was I wrong.. here's what we ordered.. - Duck Nachos - we got 5 chips that was covered with cheese, duck, sour cream and guac.  It was actually pretty good, but the duck was a bit dry and why would you only get 5 chips??  Most of the time I was just eating the stuff on top with nothing.. - I ordered the cheese enchiladas - YUCK.. it was edible, but not very good at all.  It really wasn't covered in sauce like what I'm usually used to plus the sauce wasn't that good. - My husband and sister order the 8 taco platter - . Tuna - YUCK. Strip steak - Great. Catfish - Good. Pork - OK. Chirizo - OK. - Also, since we were celebrating my brithday - got a pitcher of magarita :)  It was OK, but I wish I tasted a bit more tequila.
