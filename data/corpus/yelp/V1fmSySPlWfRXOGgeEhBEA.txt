Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I stopped by to see what all the fuss is about this hot dogg joint. The lines are long but ok. I orderd a chilli cheese hot dog and mushroom cheese dog with orange crush soda. The place is good for what it is. It's not best hot dog nor is it the worst. I would say it's really overrated. Maybe it's the name or the long lines or the advertisements but they sure know how to create a buzz for this place. Great Marketing if you ask me. The Food is good. I wouldnt go out of my way to go there but definintly a repeat customer...
