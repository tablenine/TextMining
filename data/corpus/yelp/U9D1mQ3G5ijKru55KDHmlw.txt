DISSAPPOINTING :(. I guess I have been blessed because I have had quality french cuisine and this was a horrible attempt at americanizing it.  What a sad waste of commercial real estate.  . . The service was fine and the atmosphere was above average.  . . Unfortunately,  the food should have been advertised as american with an insult to french cuisine, e.g.  Duck confit over french fries lol.  I made the mistake of bringing a date there before actually eating there and let me just say if it wasn't for the company the experience would have been ruined.  The food is overpriced for the lack of flavor and care with which it was obviously prepared with. . If you want good food at this price point you would do better going almost anywhere else.  . . I give 2 stars due to the atmosphere(its saving grace) and unfortunately the after thought was obviously the menu.
