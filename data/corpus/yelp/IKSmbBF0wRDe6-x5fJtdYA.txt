Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
This place is AWESOME! You start off by telling the doors to open... OPEN SESAME! Then we had a tour of the castle! After the tour we were seated for dinner... Why did i give this place a 4 rather than a 5 if i think it's so awesome? Because the food was, well, mediocre. HOWEVER, the magic castle house wine is very good. . . What was mediocre about the food? The salad was good (house field... yummy tomato dressing), but the mashed potatoes that came with my filet mignon were not so good. I felt like they might have been made from a packet. Â The filet was okay... not very well seasoned. However, it was cooked to the right amount like i asked (medium). The cheesecake was pretty good... but not great. For the food portion of the evening, i would rank it at a 3.. . BUT FOR THE MAGIC, A 10!!! (If possible). I'm pretty skeptical of stuff... so in reality, the big performances where i'm not close to the stage tend to leave me dissatisfied. However, the close up shows were AMAZING! Because I really have NO IDEA how those coins/ cards/ marbles/ sugar kept disappearing/ reappearing/ changing. It was AMAZING! . . And the shows aren't the only place where magic's happening! It's EVERYWHERE! Ask people (when you go... and you SHOULD go) if they are magicians... your bartender, your tour guide, your waiter. Because many times they ARE! And they will totally show you! . . We were walking around because we missed 1 show... and we just RAN INTO a guy doing card/ coin/ whatevs magic! It was pretty freaking cool!. . Here's the breakdown on money for this place... because it's not a cheap evening. . . Glasses of house wine: $7.. Valet Parking without tip: $8. Entrance: $20. Filet Mignon: $33. Salad: $7. Garlic Bread: $6 . Cheesecake: $ can't remember! HA!. GOING TO A MAGIC CASTLE... PRICELESS! (JUST SAYING!) . . If you have the possibility of going here, PLEASE DO! Definitely worth the money and the time! (Plan to spend lots of time here... got there at 5 pm, stayed until 1 am).
