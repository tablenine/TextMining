Had dinner here before a show at Nokia last week. Everything we ordered was delicious. We got a bunch of small plates: Peruvian Ceviche, mushroom empanada, black corn tamale with shrimp, tres leches cake and some sort of raw yellowtail thingy. Great combinations of flavors and textures! Service was good and we got our food really quickly. (We had reservations for 5:30 so perhaps we were there before most people). Not cheap, but I would definitely recommend this place.
