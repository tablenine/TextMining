Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's gets 5 hip-hops! I've eaten here on many hungry nights and I must say that their Prime Rib is one of the best... Make sure you order it medium or medium rare for optimal tastiness. I usually order the Lawry's Cut Prime Rib with a Pair of Atlantic Lobster tails. Its the ultimate surf -n-turf meal. Dont forget the sides of creamed corn, and the skillet of mushrooms. It's a bitch if you dont reserve ahead of time, so make sure you make some reservations.
