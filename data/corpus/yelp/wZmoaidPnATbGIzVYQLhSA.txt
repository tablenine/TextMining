Philippe! Who hasn't been there right? Well Philippe is another place that I seemed to miss yet everyone ventured out too so one evening my friends and I went to pick up some grub.. . We got inside and I was AMAZED. Is it midnight? Are we at a packed Hollywood club? I was told it's always like that. Packed with people waiting in line to get some mmm mmmm goodness. We waited in a line and got served by the really tall European lady.. . Roast Beef dipped sandwiches. Mmmmm. There is nothing wrong in that fragmented sentence. LOL We got sandwiches, cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni salad, and pickles. Oh! and the mustard! YOU MUST PUT A LITTLE MUSTARD ON THE SANDWICH. MmmmmM. What an awesome dinner! . . OH! REMEMBER IT'S CASH ONLY. I didn't know until I got to the front but thank goodness I had cash left over from clubbing the night before. :) Yay!. . Man! The sandwiches are FILLING. I got to about half and was full but knew I couldn't save it since it was dipped so I ate some more. LOL oh well. It was worth it!
