I went because I saw the ad on TV and the food sucked.  Nothing special and expensive.  I rather eat at "The Hat".  And what the heck is with seating with tables for only half of the building.  When it's cold who wants to sit outside? Don't waste your time here.  The fries were horrible.  Better at "The Hat" like I said.
