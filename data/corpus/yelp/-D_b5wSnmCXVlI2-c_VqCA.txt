Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
All my friends say, "Oh no, not Lola's again!"  . . I really like Lola's.  The bartenders are cute to look at and can talk about interesting things.  The food is decent; t he mac and cheese is excellent.  I'm not quite sure what people are expecting when they go to a bar to get food.  Its a bar and should be rated on its barness!. . That being said, the bar is pretty amazing.  They've got a truly awesome selection of martinis.  They may be expensive, but the bartenders make these puppies strong!  One or two usually has my head spinning.  I think the first time I went there, the room actually spun in a 720 when I stood up.  I had always thought room spinningness was a metaphor!. . For non martini drinkers, there is also an excellent selection of scotch, which is my personal favorite, and they also make an excellent bloody mary.. . Not sure whats up with the line, guest list thing going on on the weekends.  Go on a weekday; its quieter, you'll get a chance to play pool and you can ogle the bartenders a bit more.
