Restaurant: Carroll Street Caf√©
Category: Bars
When I used to live in Atlanta, the only time anyone would go to Cabbage Town was to try and find the guy selling dime bags. Now the area is brimming with cute little places to grab a drink or a nosh. Weird how 15 years will totally change a place. Anyway...Carroll Street is cute and artsy, with a full bar and a nice menu with yummy salads and sandwiches. I'm pretty sure they change their art installations monthly, and feature mainly local artists. I don't recall if they serve brunch, but sometimes a weekend lunch with a bloody mary is okay too. It seems like it would also be a nice place to have a mellow cocktail or 2 on a Friday night. The only negative - the staff was not so friendly. Not really mean, just not very warm. But if you're with good company - who cares? I would definitely go back.
