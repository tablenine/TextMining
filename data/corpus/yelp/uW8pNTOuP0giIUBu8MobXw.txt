My girlfriends and I meet in Atlanta every year for a weekend get together.  This year Bones was recommended to us by a lady we ran into, so we decided to try it. It was amazing. From the moment we walked in the door, we were warmly greeted and immeditaely escorted to our table.  One of my girlfriends had just found out she was pregnant, we we mentioned it to Richard our server, as we were ordering. At the end of the meal, Richard surprised her with the Mountain High Pie.  It was soo sweet and unexpected it brought her to tears.  Throughout the meal Richard was attentive but unobtrusive. . . The food was amazing, we ordered the crab cakes, the mixed grill and a filet. All of which were delicious. The mountain high pie was a perfect ending to a great meal.   Definitely check bones out next time you are in Atlanta, and ask for Richard to be your server.
