The pastrami was good, but was that sandwich worth 17 bucks?. . When I think pastrami, I think a huge pile of meat.  Larchmont deli does that and I love it.. . Langer's is different.  They give enough meat, I guess.  But the bread wasn't toasted, there wasn't any special sauce, and well.... . it's freaking expensive.. . Having said that, the pastrami is unique.  It's thicker and sweeter and more tender than most cuts.  Maybe it's worth a taste if you've never had it before.. . Maybe their sandwiches are designed not to overwhelm the flavor of the meat.. . Maybe someday I'll suffer from heatstroke and think it's worth it...
