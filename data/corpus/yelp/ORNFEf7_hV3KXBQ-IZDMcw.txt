So my wife (who I share a yelp account with) may not agree with my rating, but I'm going at it first so I win. :)  She would probably go 4 stars.. . We went to Sola last night (a Sunday) to enjoy a nice dinner out.  And a nice dinner it was, but the nice guys never win, do they?  It wasn't spectacular. . . Tracy had the Cobia, I had the Pork.  Both were good but not great.  Sola seems to put all of their effort into the sides that accompany the main dish.  If I could have a plate of nothing but the excellent sounding sides, for example the Bacon Bread Pudding, I'd be happy.. . Service was fine, but not great.  Ambiance was fine, but nothing special.  On the whole, I enjoyed the experience, but am I in a hurry to go back and pay $140 to relive it?  No I'm not.. . The best part for me was the dessert.  The sesame brittle icecream that sat along side the soft center chocolate cake was great.  Tracy was moaning in an eerily suggestive manor over the chocolate cake, but I had similarly erotic thoughts about the ice cream.. . Beer / drink selection was good, the fries are way overrated.. . So yeah, if the meal was $50 less or the main courses were far more memorable, this would have been a 4 star review.. . For the record, I am glad I went, and I did have a nice time.
