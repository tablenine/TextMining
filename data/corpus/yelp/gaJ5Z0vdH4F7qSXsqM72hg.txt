My new Salvadorian family RAVES about this place. The garlic-slathered chicken is pretty good. A little too much late-night indigestion for my taste, though. The plantains were not too sweet and the beans had a nice blend of flavors (and while it may seem easy to make plantains and beans, I've had some pretty nasty ones in my life.) . . I only go when my family goes and have never thought of going to Versailles on my own accord. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't good, just that it is perhaps not my taste in food.
