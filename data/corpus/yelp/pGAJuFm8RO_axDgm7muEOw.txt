The weirdest combination of a restaurant, yet it WORKS! Dark meat Hainanese Chicken please and one order of Escargot. Who order that? That's rite, ME! That's my order. . . I was shocked to see the menu list, I mean it's all those pasta and then there's escargot for appetizer, but if you asked around, the best thing here is their Hainanese Chicken Rice, better it be white or dark meat, it's all good and the ginger plus the orange spicy sauce, yumm.... . . Gotta admit, parking sucks, but hey... go with your friends, he/she drops you off and let the driver takes care of parking :) and since it's residential, most of the time it's free, just be careful not to park at the 20minute green curb parking, otherwise, you're good. Price is darn affordable, who shall complain? Nobody! I said, nobody! Hainanese Chicken luvaaa, you gotta eat here!!!
