Really, it's 4 for the novelty and 3 for the food.  I said I would only try this truck if it happened to be around and it was to my surprise by my work.  like a good korean i eat lots of korean food. like a bad korean i dont know what its called i just eat.  i also eat alot of tacos eastside with lots of hot sauces... whatever they have that burns the hell out of my mouth. this is what i would consider to be a novel idea, but the two together is just kind of bland really.  i wanted more spice, i imagined it would be better with siracha or some form of really spicy asian-style hot sauce.  id say get rid of the korean dressing... like i stated, i don't know what its called but i believe it has sesame oil, sugar, rice wine vinegar.. etc.  its usually on shredded red leaf cabbage (my experience) and I HATE VINEGAR.  so maybe it's more personal for me.  and really, tacos are normal size, no smaller no bigger.  i had a chicken burrito... and rib taco.  taco was overpowered with the dressing and needed hotness to offset it.  burrito, was alot better imo... weird but better.  still though,  korean+mexican should equal something really spicy.  i'm still going to stick to korean bbq at the korean places and tacos off the streets of eastlos.
