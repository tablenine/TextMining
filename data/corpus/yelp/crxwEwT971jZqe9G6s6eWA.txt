Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
The 4th star in my review is because of drool. Let me explain.. . I arrived here around 6pm with my mother, and we took a seat at a sidewalk table. We placed an order for a bottle of wine and a medium deep dish 'Lou' pizza with butter crust. This specialty pizza has spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms, with a blend of cheeses. . . The wine was brought to our table already open, which was highly unusual. The waiter later explained, after we brought it up, that the bartenders inside always do this. Not a great policy for $20+ bottle of wine, in my opinion. On that note, there wasn't really much ambiance to speak of at Lou Malnati's; they seem to be primarily focused on their pizzas, which actually is not a bad thing.. . The pizza itself was quite good. The toppings were fresh and flavorful, the crust was flaky and delicious, and the tomato sauce was just right. The price was reasonable, too, especially compared with other deep dish joints around town (see my other pizza reviews). We were content after eating 4 of the 6 slices, and I happily took the leftovers home with me.. . The next morning I topped my leftover slices with some fresh chopped spinach and popped them in the toaster oven for a few minutes. I sat myself down with the pizza in front of me, and as I brought the first forkful to my mouth I experienced again the pleasantly complex aromas of the sauce, the cheese, the toppings, and the crust, and I drooled just a little. . . Any pizza that does that to me deserves 4 stars.
