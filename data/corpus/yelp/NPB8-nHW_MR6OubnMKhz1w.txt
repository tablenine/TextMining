Yeah, sorry F.O. but your famed "Best Burger in L.A." just isn't. What's up with the no substitutions, no deletion rule? Plus this cheeseburger is so rich, it's hard to finish. Tasty, but not worth the price tag or the restrictions. Extra bonus: A fabulous draft beer list. For more info: . http://bestlaburgers.w.... /
