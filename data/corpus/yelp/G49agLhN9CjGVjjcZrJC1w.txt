Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Pro: Good and servicable ramen place with a lot of options. Wait times less than Daikokuya. It's the one place hot and spicy addicts can go, as they have tons of spicyness options. You can take the Special #2 challenge, which is like drinking liquid fire, but you do get your picture taken if you can do it.. . Free parking with 1 hour validation.. . Con: Broth isn't as refined like a place like Daikouya, down the street. Their sides are average-- although their gyoza is surprisingly good. It's not like the slices of pork at Daikokuya-- there isn't a WOW factor, but it's less expensive and less commitment than Daikokuya.
