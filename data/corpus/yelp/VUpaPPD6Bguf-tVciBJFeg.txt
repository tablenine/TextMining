Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
This is one of the most authentic Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at in Chicago. It's very casual, so it's a good place to go to with friends. Â Some of my favorite dishes are Yen Ta Fo (noodle soup with seafood), Mussel Fritter, Eastern Sausage with sticky rice, and Yum Neur (beef salad). Only downside is that they can be very slow, so if you're really hungry, you might be waiting for quite a bit.
