Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
My first trip to Bottega Louie was for a quiet breakfast this morning. They serve breakfast on weekdays in the smaller area of tables and chairs just to the left of the front door. It's a friendly, casual atmosphere, and I was surprised at the extremely reasonable prices for their limited but ample breakfast menu. . . We enjoyed great service, great coffee, and a warm, welcoming environment. Though we stayed for a good hour and a half, we were never rushed by the staff, even though it got fairly busy towards the end of our stay. I had the New York Breakfast Sandwich, which was fairly standard, but satisfying nonetheless. I am not a fan of American cheese, and I would have preferred a sharp cheddar, but I didn't mind it on this sandwich. It complemented the delicious, crisp bacon, the perfectly cooked egg, and the soft bread nicely. . . Overall, my trip to Louie for breakfast was a pleasant one. Not sure I'm ready to try this place during the busier lunch and dinner hours, but I would definitely do breakfast here again.
