I was suppose to have breakfast here but they don't serve breakfast. Although you can get a coffee and pastries but I was looking for eggs. So after dining at Lulu's Cafe we went to the Bev Center. All that shopping got us pretty hungry so we decided to go back to Milk for ice cream. They make their own ice cream, drumstick, and ice cream sandwiches. I got the lady bug which is a strawberry shorbet sandwiched with two macaron shells half dipped with chocolate so it looks like a lady bug. I really like the macaron shell and the shorbet, but I did not care for the chocolate. My sister got a scoop of sweet corn ice cream on a sugar cone. That one had good flavor but the texture was grainy. While enjoying out ice cream we got to see some of the food people ordered and it looked really good such as sandwiches and salads. Since this place is called Milk there were a lot of Milk items such as milk shakes, teas, and coffee. I'm kinda curious to try their Thai Tea as well as their shakes. So gotta go back!
