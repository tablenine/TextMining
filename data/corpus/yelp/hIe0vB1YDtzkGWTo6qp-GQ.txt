Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I'm a little torn about the Alcove. The Alcove's baked goods are out of this world, but their lunch and dinner menus are hit or miss. I've had a couple great salads, but their soups are always lacking, in my opinion. I've only had breakfast there a couple times, but they've all been great. It's a really cozy place tucked away from the street. There is a great wine and cheese shoppe next door. . . Try not to come too hungry, it can get VERY packed and you can wait for your food a good long while.
