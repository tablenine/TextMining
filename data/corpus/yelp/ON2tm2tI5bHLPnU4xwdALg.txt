I didn't get the corned beef.  I know.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I just wasn't in the mood.. . What I did get (pastrami), however, wasn't bad.  I had it with a side of beets, which were also quite tasty.  All in all, the food was good.  Granted, I expected a bit more based on all the rave reviews.  But not everything can be as good as everyone says.. . What bothered my about Manny's was the general atmosphere and set up.  The place is designed like a cafeteria.  You stand in line until it is your turn to grab a tray and pick what you want.  This is not a bad deal in and of itself.  It was just a little confusing.  . . The line was long and no one really seemed to know where to go to get what.  The folks behind the counter weren't exactly helpful in this respect, and just kept barking orders at the costumers.  I think it may be part of the whole experience, but I wasn't really impressed.. . if I go back, I'll be sure to make a beeline directly for the corned beef so as to avoid any traffic jams and dirty stares.
