This was my first time at a Japanese ramen place and what an experience it was! I was with a friend from the east coast - who was born in Japan- he gave it the thumbs up for authenticity and commented that the stuffiness and heat in the restaurant Â was exactly how you are suppose ramen in Japan (it was a hot summer day and i was def sweating).. . Depite how large that bowl was, i managed to put a huge dig to it!. The combination is the way to go! For about $12 you get more than you can eat with variety! Great food with a great price is my kind of meal!
