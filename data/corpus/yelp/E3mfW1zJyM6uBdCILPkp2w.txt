I had the mish mash soup and it was pretty good! I had it on a rainy day with my friend. But it's not something I would eat on a normal day... definitely looks like the soup I would get if I was down with a cold. The service was definitely so good! She was an elderly lady who was very cheery and patient with me being a noob at the restaurant. Bagel chips were awesome! I dipped them into the soup (which made it much easier to eat) and it was good. :]
