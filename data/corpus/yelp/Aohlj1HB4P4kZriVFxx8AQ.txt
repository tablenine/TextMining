Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
My hubby and his friends tried to replicate Roscoe's one night by subsituting deep-fried turkey and frozen Eggo's for their famous chicken and waffles...yeeeeah...not so much.. . Back to my review. After an hour long wait, we were seated by our friendly waitress. It was tiny inside but cozy. We both got the Carol C. Special Â (waffle + chicken breast) with a side of mac-n-cheese. The chicken was juicy, flavorful with crispy skin, the waffles were delicious with a hint of vanilla in them, and the mac-n-cheese was some of the best I've had. Lip-smackin' gooood!. . Definitely a must-try if you're in the Hollywood area!
