more like Duck Walk-right past this place!!!!!!!. . Ordered food from here numerous times. Every time the order was messed up in some way. Gave them the benefit of the doubt and still ordered food. The last straw was the night they screwed up the order, brought the "fixed" order two hours later, and again it was wrong. Perhaps they need a quieter environment to answer the phone and take delivery orders. I will never order food from here again. I don't understand why I thought it would get better. It only gets worse. Don't waste your time on this place.
