Restaurant: Gibsons Bar &amp; Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Gibsons is situated on Rush Street, lined with Ferraris and Lamborghinis so I thought to myself as I stepped in, I was going to be stepping out with my pockets empty.. . To my surprise it is on par with most steak houses.  I ordered the Chicago Cut and a baked potato (which was HUGE), medium rare.. . I'm a steak lover and have been to quite a few steak houses in my life (mostly for free thanks to my old career as an investment analyst where mutual fund wholesalers try to shmooze you). . . To match with the price, the steak was on par as well.  It wasn't mind blowing uber elite ninja food, however it was good.  The steak was juicy albeit it did seem a bit cold and tough by the time I was done (I am a fast eater).. . The service was great however, classy, fast, welcoming. It should be for a $70 meal.. . If I go to Chicago again, I'll probably check out other steak houses, it doesn't mean I will won't be coming back though.. . 3.45 stars because I don't want to round up.
