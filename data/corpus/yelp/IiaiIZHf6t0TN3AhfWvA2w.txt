This review is for the food since last time was for the drinks.. . We had no reservations but were seated immediately. They have about three rooms for seating but the first room at the front of the restaurant is primarily for bar food/drinks.. . The menu changes every two weeks so dont expect any particular signature dishes. The restaurant supports local farmers so the food is very fresh and you can taste the difference.  We werent very hungry so we ordered three appetizers.  We had the goat cheese and spinach dip, the vegetarian chili, and the tomato bisque soup.  Everything tasted delicious!. . Service was great.  The prices for our dishes were reasonable but the entree dishes can be pricey.  I wish they had a better selection of entree dishes. Maybe in another two weeks when the menu changes the entree selection will be better? Parking in this area can be difficult.
