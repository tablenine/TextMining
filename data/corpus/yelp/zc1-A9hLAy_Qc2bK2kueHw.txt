Came here for a Twitter mixer. Yes, a Twitter mixer. It's gotten to that. Didn't try the food mainly because it was pricey but also based on the bad food reviews on Yelp and other places. So I'm sticking to drinks. Good idea. About 10 beers on tap including Hoogarden, a Sam Adams seasonal and some other good stuff. About 20 bottles I suppose. Tried the Chocolate Martini and it was pretty good. I'm not a big martini drinker so when I do it's of the sweet variety based upon my overloaded massive sweet tooth. And this is what they're known for. Decent bar, good service but wouldn't rush back unless there's a Yelp Event (and there has been) or the next big social media fad mixer.
