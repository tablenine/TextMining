Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Within the intimidating facade of this landmark Hollywood eatery, you'll find food that could kill a shaolin monk.. . Why is this?. . Simple -- fried chicken in quantities such as this can kill.. . I only had the the namesake chicken and waffles once.  Half of it came home in a box.  It was just too much for my teeny, tiny tummy!. . This place is really amazing.  Part hole in the wall, all bad ass chicken and waffles.  Cool :)
