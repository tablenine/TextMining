The original French Dip!  Right smack between Union Station and Olivera Street is this LA institution where prices are frozen in time.  These bite-sized french-dips and de rigeur "Au Jus" sauce are absolutely phenomenal and worth the trip out to this part of town.. . Great for a snack or a meal...  I've eaten 4 (FOUR) in one sitting.
