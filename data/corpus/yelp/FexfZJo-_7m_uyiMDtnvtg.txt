Visiting Atlanta on a business trip wanted to try some good local food. Great comfort food, excellent service, and a nice, relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommend the fried green tomatoes and the grilled pork chops. Great selection of drinks, their fresh lemonade goes very well with the meal. The breads are very fresh and warm, I really enjoyed eating here. . . For desert we had the peach cobbler which was served warm, very tasty!
