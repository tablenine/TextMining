The Hainan Chicken is really tasty. Its a bit more of a Hong Kong style in the sense that its a bit oily. If you have ever tried Hainan Chicken Thai style and like that....This may be a bit oily for you. The minced ginger on the side and the rice is also what makes the dish complete. I like the dark meat with skin but the white meat without skin is also good.. . Parking and lines may be difficult but its well worth the wait. I recommend calling in and picking up the food.
