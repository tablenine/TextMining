Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
I debated on how many stars I could give Dunlay's. Not that my dining experience wasn't excellent--it was. I just have a few issues.. . Let's start with the good news: I liked the atmosphere, the ambience, the decor. I felt good sitting in there, and I liked everything I looked at. Plus, they played really good music. Like, Electric Light Orchestra (not "Xanadu", unfortunately. But some goodies). The food--delicious. Caesar salad--gigantor, amazing. The gooey cookie skillet hellacious dessert deal--yummers! It made me feel all disgusting inside. My mouth kept saying yes but my torso was screaming no. I listened to my mouth. . . Here are my not-so-greats: The menu is small, and not a lot of selecsh. Everything looks good, but I like to have a lot to choose from. There was only, like three sandwiches and salads, and everything else was something I never would have ordered. (i.e. ribs, pork tenderloin, etc.). Another minus is the prices. It's kinda expense! I mean, I only got a salad, a diet coke with lime and split a dessert and ended up paying $26. WTF is that? That's sort of a lot for a Monday night impromptu dinner with my gays. I'll be eating Morningstar mini corn dogs for the rest of the week to salvage my bank account. Seriously--OUCH! I can't be spending those kinds of benjamins in these dire economic times. Even though I do. and probably would again because this place was damn good.. . All in all, I think Dunlays is a wonderful place for a Friday/Saturday night dinner with friends, a great first date locashe, but a Monday night bite with some queens is best at somewhere like Chipotle.
