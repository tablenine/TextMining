Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Uh, guys...this is bad pizza.  Seriously.  Batali partnered up with the woman from La Brea bakery to make this restaurant and the "pizza crust" is made from the brea bakery bread dough.  And that's just not how pizza is supposed to be.  Please don't think this is pizza the way it is served in Italy; there is a difference between bread dough and pizza dough.  We had a mixed antipasto of different cold cuts and they didn't give us bread, which is unusual.  You are given thin breadsticks (grissini) which are cute, and seem super-trendy and cool, but are actually way-cheap.  The pizza was a disaster- I've already mentioned about the crust, but it was also poorly cooked.  Yes, it's a nice looking place, but super-crowded and I detest any restaurant in which the staff attempts to act like they are better than you.  It's so boringly LA.
