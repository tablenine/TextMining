Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This place was OK, but I don't think I'd go back. It's pretty expensive ($200 for two of us) and the food is fine, but not worth the price. The restaurant has dim lighting and pretty decor which makes it romantic - but the size of the restaurant (it's quite large) kind of takes away from the cozy feel.
