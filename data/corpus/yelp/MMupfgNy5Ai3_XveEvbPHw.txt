I've been coming here since ages ago but I'm happy to review it now.  It's a good establishment.  Authenticity and freshness are great combo for a sushi joint; Sushi-Gen embodies these two elements which makes it easy for me to come back to.  . . With a lunch outing with my aunt, at 11:30 we waited about 20 minutes to get seated.  Seriously at lunchtime, 20 minutes is practically like no wait.  There's always a wait here, so if your in a hurry this might not be the right choice.  I ordered the Salmon Lunch Special which comes with grilled salmon, sashimi, miso soup, mini tofu, rice and mini salad.  I say for under $20 this is a good deal. . . The grilled salmon took 20 minutes to cook (which the waiter told us while ordering).  Once it came out, it was amazing! the flakes of salmon came off the bones and really it melts in your mouth.  The fish was fresh and well cooked.  The sashimi was amazing! I had 8 pieces from tuna, halibut and salmon.  Really a melt in your mouth experience.  The service was good, the waitresses were constantly refilling my water and my iced green tea.. . For lunch, I think it's really worth it if your willing to wait.  It's a good price for great fish!  I can't wait till I go back again!
