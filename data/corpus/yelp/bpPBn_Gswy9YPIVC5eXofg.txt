my friend was bragging about this place for sometime now...she claimed its the best ramen place ever...so i finally caved in and decided to go there and check out this best ramen...well, its good...but definitely not the best...i had better tasting ramen...there were just way too many bean sprouts on my ramen...and the noodles looks like it came from an instant noodles...the broth was alright...this place is just ok.
