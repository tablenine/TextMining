I've long avoided the hype known as Kogi.  The idea of standing in an hour-long line repulses me.  . . The truck was just outside my work today, and I figured the hype would have died down by now + it was 2:30pm, so most of the lunch-time crowd should have dissipated.  It was time to finally see for myself what this fuss was about.. . The scoop:. -  the order taking process is incredibly inefficient - helps explain the long lines!  With the volume they've been serving you'd figure they would have found a more efficient way by now.  . . - The Kimchi Quesadilla was tasty but incredibly oily.  Heart-attack oily.. . - The Short-Rib Burrito was pretty disappointing.  The egg was bland, the cabbage was overwhelming, the meat itself was sparse.. . - Extra star and props to them for having their truck outfitted w/ ALPINE speakers and subs, pumping Power 106.  Nice.. . All in all, disappointed.
