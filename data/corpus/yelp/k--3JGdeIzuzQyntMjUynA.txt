Restaurant: Sepia
Category: American (New)
Sepia - vintage, rustic, shades of brown - great ambiance, the decor is unique and inviting, with an earthy feel.  We decided to hit it up for lunch.  The service was superb, dishes were explained thoroughly and there was quite a bit of knowledge behind these explanations.  Service was quick, yet un-rushed.  . . We started with the applewood smoked bacon flatbread, which was served on a piece of natural wood.  The flavors lingered and the smoky tinge remained in my wouth til the entree came.  The amish chicken was sweet and juicy, there was a salty finish to it as well.  The salmon was tasmanian and wild, with darker flesh that retained great flavor.  . . The desserts were impressive also.  The chocolate crepes were decadent with pistachio ice cream and figs.  The mini-brown cake was sweet and savory, with a buttercream topping.  . . The food at sepia is truly unique, all served with the freshest of ingredients and the meats are of the best quality.  So far, best lunch.
