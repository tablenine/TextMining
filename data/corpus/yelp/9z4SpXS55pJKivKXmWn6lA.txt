I love Savoy's Hainan chicken!  I haven't had it anywhere else unless you include the nasty Hainan-like chicken I had at Banana Bay..but thats my fault for ordering that at BB.  At first I wasn't interested in trying this dish just because it looked so plain jane to me, but once I finally tried it.. oh dear.  Like hot pot at Happy Sheep, I crave Hainan chicken from Savoy.  I like eating there instead of doing to go b/c you can have as much ginger &amp; hot sauce as you want.  I think service is good, but I've only gone when it wasn't busy and sat outside.  . . Hainan chicken &amp; shrimp rolls : yum yum yum!. . Pasta and the bread that comes with it: yick. . I've head their curry is really good to, but I don't know if I'll try it bc once I like something, it's hard to get me to order anything else.
