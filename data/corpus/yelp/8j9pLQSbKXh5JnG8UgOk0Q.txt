Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
sadly. i do not like this place. the chicken was not seasoned well. and there was a difference in moisture content between my chicken and my friends chicken. mine was dry like the desert. i also used a lot of hot sauce to ameliorate the lack of flavor.. . the waffles were nothing special and almost reminded me of leggo my eggo waffles. i personally like Vans. and the entire time i was eating the chicken I was craving mashed potatoes!!!. . i also accidentally ordered the wrong plate for my friend which they brought out and graciously took back. there is also a guy who stands outside and brings you all the way in to a table, from which we decided to move and then he came in later and gave me the evil eye. the service was friendly.. . at the end of the meal i felt rather gross like post in n out gross. its not really healthy and maybe you can call it "grub" good for after the club rub a dub
