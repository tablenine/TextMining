I went here a while back, but I might as well review it before I forget about this place completely.  The seafood itself was alright.  It's not like they just caught it from the ocean and cooked it for you.  The spicy seasoning is awesome though!  That's the main reason it taste good.  I hope you enjoy spicy like I do :-)
