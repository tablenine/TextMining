Restaurant: Spitz
Category: Sandwiches
Another great addition to Eagle Rock. Spitz is a casual lunch spot with great sandwiches. I like the classic with fries. The pita strips are good too, but a bit too greasy and salty for my taste. The menu has only a few options but they are all tasty. . . If the weather is good, sit outside and enjoy the view of the foothills. The traffic is noisy but thats just part of the experience! I don't mind.. . Clean, fast, good service.
