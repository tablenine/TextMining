Blah....... fraiche is not so fresh......... The beat salad looked like 5 day old tuna, and my meat was cooked poorly.  This place was pretty bad for the price they're charging which isn't SUPER high but isn't cheap.  It's not worth your money, there are many other places in the area that have excellent food.  My favorite within walking distance is Akasha.
