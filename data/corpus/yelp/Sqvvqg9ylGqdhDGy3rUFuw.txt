I'm going to give this place a solid "meh". I will qualify my meh with the following: I eat meat, but very rarely cook it because I'm lazy, so I eat vegetarian frequently and vegan when I am able to ween myself off of cheese. . . While I appreciate their effort to be creative and use the fake meats, I think it really falls flat. Look, I'm eating, by choice, at a vegan place. I'm reasonably bright and don't expect to get a steak sandwich for dinner, cook me up some tasty veggies! Most of the options consist of the fake meat and the others are veggie bowls. The fake meat is rubbery and flavorless at best. The sauces are just as heavy as you would get at any fast food place (1000 Island dressing, ranch, etc). The veggie bowls were tastier, but more effort could be made in terms of spicing them. They really just tasted like slightly over-steamed veggies. Everything had too much salt. I can do that at home myself. . . I know I'm going against the grain here, but if you're vegan or vegetarian, I'm sure there are better places out there. I could cook you a nice veggie meal (again, vegan if I leave out the cheese) that tastes better for less money in my kitchen. . . Would love a recommendation of a better vegan/veggie place if you have one!
