Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I may be giving a biased review, as I grew up eating here, but I still think Tito's deserves the praise it's gotten over the years.  They make traditional Mexican food and the place is a fast-food type eatery, so if you're expecting some magical out-of-body experience, you're likely to be disappointed.  I won't argue that it could be a bit cleaner, but it's hard to penalize this place just for having long lines.. . Whenever I come to Tito's, I get the tacos with cheese and the meat burrito.  Can't go wrong there.  I'm a lifetime Tito's customer and it's unlikely that will ever change.
