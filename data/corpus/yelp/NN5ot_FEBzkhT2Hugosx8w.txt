Adding this to my list of good dinner places in parts of LA that I don't frequent. Ended up downtown early for a concert - decided to head to Little Tokyo for some grub. Since it was already after 9 pm, only a 4 minute wait for a table. Got the yellowtail belly, the freshwater eel, the scallop sushi  - plus some crab sunomono, some veggie tempura and cucumber rolls. Everything was very good - the scallop sushi was just divine. That slighty sweet and fresh taste that great scallop sushi has. YUM! The cucumber rolls were the most authentic cucumber rolls I've had in North America - with that great wasabi kick. Not many places put wasabi in their cucumber rolls. . . We came in with no expections (despite the raves Sushi-Gen gets) and got a great dinner. The price was okay - about  $60 with tax and tip - not supercheap sushi, but the quality was good. Not OMG, eyes-rolling-back-in-my-head Azami good - but good. Definitely worth another trip!
