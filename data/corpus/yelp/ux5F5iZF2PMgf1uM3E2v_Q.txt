When I rolled up to the corner of this place it made me think of new york, with the tall windows and bright interior. The ambiance is bright and classy and the kitchen is remarkably open, almost to the point where its on display. . . My gf and I each started with a salad, I had the Italian and she the arugula, Both of which were very fresh and flavorful, however the Italian really stood out (if you're tired of being bored by your chop salad, this is the answer). next I had one of their pastas and she had the salmon baked in parchment paper. Each dish was bursting with flavor and extremly delicious. . . Pros: reasonable price, amazing food, reastaurant that aims to please.. . Cons: Service is good but unpolished, dessert is average.
