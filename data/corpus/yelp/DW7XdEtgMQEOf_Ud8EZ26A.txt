Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Oh, goodness gracious me, the Apple Pan. Because LA is such a brand spankin' NEW kind of town (meaning "oldest restaurant in town" is 1919), anything that is remotely redolent of retro-kitsch-history is exceedingly appealing. And if they serve on of the absolute best burgers in town, WELL .....so much the better.. . The place is always packed- you will usually have to cool your heels for a few while waiting for a seat at the circular counter. You'll get a gruff waiter who has been there a good solid 20 years (they have great stories if you charm 'em out of the gruffitude) and a minimal selections of a couple kinds of burgers, a tuna sandwich (I think), fries, drinks, pie. I go for hickory steak burger with fries.. . Everything comes in paper wrappers or el retro plastic holders. The meat is top-quality (and I am a girl who usually does not touch red meat- basically if it is not Apple Pan or In'N'Out I am in the world of tofu derivatives). Super fun place to take the same kind of person who would have loved the old Farmer's Market.
