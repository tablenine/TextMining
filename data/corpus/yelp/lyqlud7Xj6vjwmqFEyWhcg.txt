this place is like an upscale version of any run of the mill pho #(insert a random number) in the city. i like it because it feels clean and the food choices seem slightly more exotic than at pho # (insert another random number) but it also feels less authentic. i'm on the fence with this place. that's the reason for the 3 stars. i can't fault the food because it was quite tasty. but i also wasn't that thrilled with the staff and customers.
