Cafe Selmarie, I have been your friend for the 21 years I have lived in Chicago.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on you.........can it possibly be that I have never frequented you on a Saturday morning, to experience those delectable Cherry Pocket Danish and Blueberry Pocket Danish?  SO moist, so full of fruit and cream and flaky goodness and..............I was told you only serve them on Saturdays - thank god or I would soon weigh 700 lbs.
