I LOVE THIS PLACE. LOVE LOVE LOVE their crab &amp; avocado salad, wow. Happy hour has been extended from 5 pm - 10 pm. It doesn't include alcohol anymore, but all appetizers and rolls are half off, which is amazing. Rolls have gotten significantly smaller, so if you're looking for a quick and cheap sushi fix in Westwood, this is the place to go. Love the ambiance of this place - it's super spacey and there is seating both indoors and outdoors. Definitely a staple in Westwood.
