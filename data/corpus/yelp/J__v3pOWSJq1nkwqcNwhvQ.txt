I drive 17 miles, pick up a huge box of delicious baked goods, hand over a shy Hamilton or two, and drive another 17 miles in the opposite direction.. . I do this often, and half of the time knifing through the ridiculous LA traffic that ruins your mpg no matter how fuel-efficient your car is. . . Sorry, poor Earth. Global warming ain't gonna slow down if you got Porto's luring people to make plenty of longer trips from all over the southland.
