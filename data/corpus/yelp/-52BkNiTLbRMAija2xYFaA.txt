Just home style food, pretty cheap and always decent. . . The horribly fattening mac and cheese is scrumptious, the couscous is kinda boring, but made right, the sweet potatoes that they always have on hand are great. Â Turkey meatloaf rocks! But the green beans leave more to be desired. :P. . They offer half a jerk chicken and have a full pasta bar with your choice of sauces. The coolest part is they don't have any pork or beef in the whole joint. . . Cheap and good - especially when I'm too lazy to cook and on the way home from work.
