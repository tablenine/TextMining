YES!  WONDERFUL!. . My boss (a winemaker) was in town the week prior to my husband and I being in town, and he had been part of a "feast" here.. . I had looked at the menu online, and knew my husband would enjoy it.  If Bacon/Pig/Pork was a religion he would be a devoted follower.. . We were staying in midtown, and wanted to get a late dinner so we took a quick taxi ride down.  YES! YES! YES!. . I had the hanger steak (one of my favorite cuts of beef), it was perfectly cooked, and the creamed spinach that it was served with was awesome. . My husband had the special, which included lots of pork!  He was stoked.... so stoked.  I hadn't heard him rave about a dish in a very long time.. . We saw that they host "feasts" if you have 8 people.  Pick and animal and eat away!  We are trying to plan another trip to partake in this!  . . Stop in here!  YUMMMMM!
