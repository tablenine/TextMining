Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
I am a Friendship fan. In my constant quest to not stray too far out of my comfort zone when ordering off a menu, I was able to find the dish I like and am comfortable with, but that is a nice slight change from the normal Chinese Dish.. . Say Â hello to the Spicy Peppercorn Beef. Nice chunks of beef with big florets of broccoli and small bits of red pepper and onion. The topper is the amazing peppercorn sauce that does the job of literally spicing up the dish but never too much (as pepper often can do). The negative of this dish is that it is not actually on the menu anymore but I was able to order it anyway.. . Other than that, we had the Bourbon BBQ Ribs, Veggie Spring Rolls and Seafood Spring rolls - all crowd pleasers. The Veggie rolls were partiularly good compared with other Chinese restaurants. . . The other three at the table shared 3 different seafood dishes that all seemed to be cleared from plates, i.e. eaten in full.. . The dessert was probably the weak spot - not because it wasn't good, but because all the choices were pretty small (not great to share) and overpriced at $8 per dessert.. . I love the atmosphere and decor and it was a great place to go on a Saturday night that had a good crowd yet we could still sit at our table and talk for hours without being shooed out.
