Awful. Just plain awful. The fact I even have to give this place one star to be able to post isn't fair. People, if the only positive comments a restaurant (i.e., a place that serves FOOD) gets is about the strength of its margaritas: Beware. After being away from the area for five years, I thought hey, it couldn't still be that mediocre? No, it's worse. Any vaguely pleasant memories about the place ended when two mushy entrees were placed in front of us. Or I should say "incorrectly placed in front of us". The tortillas for the enchiladas were soggy. The filling was bland and tasteless. The tamales were a crime against food. Seriously, how hard is it to make decent tamales? You can get better on a roadside in TJ. And don't even get me started on the "Black beans or pinto?" question. These are my choices? Really? The other side, rice, was about as tasty as paper. So yeah, go for the drinks if this is your idea of fun. Either don't eat or drink yourself senseless. Still, the fact that this place is still in business means we get the type of "food" we deserve.
