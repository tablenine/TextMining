To be honest, it boggles my mind that this place (which I've tried twice) should have 4 stars, provided its hundreds of reviews.  The three factors which all rated poorly for me:  taste (in general), authenticity (lack thereof), and service (consistently rude).  To further color my review, it seems as though the cold, impatient service was--by not-so-clever design--intended to complement the restaurant's contemporary, minimalistic ex/interior. But I digress from more subjective commentary. Basically, the pho soup is strangely sweet, dark, and does not taste authentic at all (nor good!). The Viet coffee is watered down. The lemongrass beef does not go with their embarrassing attempt at fish sauce.  I hesitate to pull out the Vietnamese card, but for this place, I must.  Pho Cafe is Faux Cafe.
