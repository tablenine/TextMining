I loved this place!!  Went here for breakfast and had the oatmeal with blueberries and a biscuit.  Both were delicious.  I actually liked the biscuits at West Egg much more than the biscuits at the Flying Biscuit.  The service was excellent.  We also grabbed some cupcakes to go and I had the red velvet cupcake.  Initially I was surprised that they were so small and $2.50 each.  But, I can say that it as totally worth it.  The cupcakes was awesome!  Cozy atmosphere, great food and great service. I'll definitely return the next time I'm in Atlanta.
