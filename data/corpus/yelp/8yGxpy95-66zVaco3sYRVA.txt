Category: Delis
A few weeks ago I had spent some time in NY and Katz's deli was recommended to me.  I was skeptical but man, the pastrami sandwich was the best thing ever.  I never knew two slices of bread, meat, and mustard could taste so good.. . So coming back to Chicago I was craving a good deli sandwich.  Heard about Manny's from yelp and friends so I went for Saturday brunch.  It wasn't too crowded and the servers were friendly and polite even though I wasnt sure how the whole cafeteria worked.  I saw a picture of a happy Obama eating the "presidential meal" so since I was feeling presidential I got that.  Corned beef, potato pancake, and cherry pie.  It was pretty good (tho expensive, $17 total) and I would go back again when I'm craving a good sandwich.  Sorry to say though, definitely no Katz's...
