Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami was recommended to my by a fellow Yelper after my review on FO.....so I ended up here with a group of friends for lunch on a Sunday.. . To start you may need valet parking if you don't find any on the street but I found parking no problem. The place is very samll about the size of my apartment but the place looks warm and welcoming.. . Now to the most important part....the food. I got the Umami burger with salad plus a bottle of Dr.Pepper in a glass bottle made from real suger (it was amazing) which tasted nothing like Dr.Pep you get at Vons. The burger was excellent, cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Its almost as good as the FO burger but unlike the FO you have many to choose from. My friends got fries and onion rings as sides and were very happy with their choices. I ended up with the salad and was little more then let down, it was bland and not worth $4. After all that we got some ice cream sandwiches which finished the meal perfectly....so check Umami out you won't be disappointed, just don't get the salad.
