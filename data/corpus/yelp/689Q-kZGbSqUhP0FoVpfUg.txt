This place was everything I thought it would be and then some. The staff was extremely friendly, we never had to ask for much since they were always around refilling our waters, making sure we got cuts of meats we wanted. The food was delicious, if I may say so the Picanha was the best!. . The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they didn't have chicken heart. :-( When I think of churascarias I think chicken hearts.
