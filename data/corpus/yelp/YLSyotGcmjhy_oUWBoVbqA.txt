Have an office in the complex so I tend to eat lunch here when in town.  Seems you can walk in anytime and eat at the bar without reservations, which is nice if you tend to have a fluid schedule.. . Bar staff have always been friendly and helpful, the food interesting and tasty.  Lunch is served promptly, which is important.  Interesting wines available by the glass.. . Not much to fault, I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in town.
