I love this place! The staff was all very attentive and friendly. The mussel appetizer is light and savory. I had the ribeye which was so flavorful, it made me want to take a cooking class. The chamomile creme brulee was perfect without a hint of burnt Â on the sugary crust. Just be aware they allow smoking at the tables outside. But outdoor seating is so beautiful I wouldn't want to miss out on it!
