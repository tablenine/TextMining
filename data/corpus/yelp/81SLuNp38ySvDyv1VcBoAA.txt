This is my favorite place for juicy pork dumplings.  It is a must go place for me whenever im down in southern ca, but be sure for a long wait especially on the weekend.  My wife and i ate an order each (10 xiao long bao per order).  At first i only wanted one order, but my wife want two cause she know it wont be enough for us to share.  She was right.. . You must dip the juicy pork dumplings in the vinegar sauce with ginger before eating.  I dont really recommend adding soy sauce because it over powers the sweet pork soup inside the dumplings.  Becareful of the soup inside the dumplings before eating (its hot).. . Weve tried the sticky rice and pork dumpling, that wasnt good.  So i dont recommend anyone to order that.  For dessert the red bean dumpling was good, but i think order the juicy pork dumplings is enough.  The crab pork dumplings is very good too, but we didnt get to try it this time.
