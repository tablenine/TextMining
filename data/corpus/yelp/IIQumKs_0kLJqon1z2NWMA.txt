I really enjoyed this place. The meat was of good quality and the service was very good. The amount of food we received was enormous and I left very full. . . The side dishes were a wonderful addition to the meats that we ordered. I just wish I could have gotten more of certain side dishes and less of others. I'm sure if I had asked, I could have gotten more. I especially liked the sauce that they gave us to dip the meat in. It was so good!. . The restaurant is also very clean and they give you a sweet tea at the end of your meal that is very yummy!
