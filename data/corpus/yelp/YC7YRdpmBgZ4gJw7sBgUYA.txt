What is so special about this place?  I was disappointed after all the hype.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special in any way- the food, decor, atmosphere, service.  I had the chicken sandwich with green salad.  It was served very quickly and was decent.  Not worth the money though.  I am tired of overpriced hipster joints that charge an arm and a leg for mediocre food.  I know, I know, it's my own fault for hanging out in these areas.
