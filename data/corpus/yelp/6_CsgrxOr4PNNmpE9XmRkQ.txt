A relatively small pub this establishment is a good stand by when I cannot get into other places in Lincoln Square.  I like their burgers very much and portions are plentiful.  . . In addition, they do a good job with beer selection and serve Fat Tire by draft.........so you say, "who cares if they serve Fat Tire via draft?"  Well, it seems a lot of places serve it in what I call the "White Boy 40", which is a 22 oz bottle, so I hate ordering it as I feel like some rapper drinking a 40 and "big pimpin" in a bad music video, so when I can find I can get a glass of the amber ale I'm thrilled.. . Though outdoor seating isn't out just yet, it should be soon so look out for it.  . . With plenty of TVs, you can get your game on anytime.  FYI, and a tad out of season, but never sit by the door in winter, even though they have a cover for the cold weather, you'll freeze to death from the breeze...trust me, because late in the evening seating can be a challenge as the bar fills up so I've sat near the door and was cold the entire time......regardless of the amount of shots I did *wink*.
