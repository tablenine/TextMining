Category: Thai
My buddy (and frequent Upright Citizen Brigade crowd member) Robert wanted to grab a bite to eat before we caught the Asssscat and Human Giant shows at the theater. Since he is vegetarian, he is somewhat limited to his choices so I agreed to come with him here. It really wasn't that far of a walk from the theatre on Bronson and Franklin. . . Wow I was impressed not only was the place spotless but run like a machine, as the staff was all on headsets. Not really servers, more like order takers but it went with the flow of the place. . . I don't branch out much in the Thai food realm, thus stuck with the usual Pad Thai was was great. Portion was good and the food was flavorful. I shall return.
