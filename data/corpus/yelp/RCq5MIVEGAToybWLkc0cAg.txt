OK, I know.  There's a lot of hype around this place.. . It's hip. It's happening. The decor is funky/sheik/unique and the music keeps it lively. You also feel like you deserve some street cred for walking down to 3rd and traction as if there were a secret society for digs that are on the other side of Alameda.  Kind of like that episode of Beverly Hills 90210 where you're suppose to bring an egg to get into the party.... . And there's plenty of beer. Major plus.. . Walked in here with a buddy  about a month ago.  Went straight for the exotics and had the duck and bacon sausage and my buddy had the rattlesnake something or rather.  Order of fries on the side.  The service was genuinely polite and helpful.. . Honestly my sausage tasted a bit dry and overcooked and my buddy had the same exact notion. (Maybe it was because it was late at night?) Knowing how flavorful duck is, knowing how flavorful bacon is, and knowing how much kick jalapeno has I was ready for an explosion in my mouth.  (Oops- that sounds kind of wrong.)  Anyways, all I could taste was sauerkraut and chewy meat. The fries and were actually more flavorful as was the pesto mayo.  I was hoping for a bit more as we had prepped ourselves by going to a scotch tasting before hand and I wanted to give my belly a taste of two European countries for the night.. . I tried to take Ron E. to give this place a second try this past Friday.  I was ready to do some beer sampling.  The line was a bit too much for me, a grumpy old man. That and a bunch of kids were congregating outside for a group bicycle ride.  We decided to retry the hype another night.. . Looking forward to giving this place another try- if I can get in without having to wait while watching kids on fixies do leg-over-the-handle-bar-skid-stops for more than 45 min.
