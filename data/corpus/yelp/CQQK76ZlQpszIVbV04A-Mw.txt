If there's one thing I love it's gonna be great service. The food was delicious. Me and my g/f had enjoyed an order of calamari ($7) and I got an arnold palmer. Both were prepared well. The calamari very fresh. Than my g/f order the shrimp penne which was perfect about 6-7 big pieces of shrimp. I order the pork chops which were perfectly cooked. Very juicy and not at all dry. After that we ordered the peanut butter tereanne. I think that's how you spell it. The bill came out to $46. This was for dinner. The food was great the service fantastic and the Space itself was awesome. . . I truly felt like I was in NY and it's a nice open space with very friendly staff. I can't note how great the staff was. Â Impeccable on the service and time to receive our food as well.. . It grabs all 3 attributes in my concept of good food good service and good price. Great place! Please check out my photos for better idea of the place!
