I never knew ramen could be so good!!!  My sister-in-law introduced me to this place and I've been addicted ever since.  Make sure you're ready for a wait in line as this place is super crowded.  I recommend the combo which comes with  regular soup and chicken donburi.  I would consider this asian comfort food at it's finest.  And it's sooo much food you're guaranteed to be super super full by the time you're done.
