Quality! Went there in the recommendation from my boss for a nice glass of wine and great enviornment. It was that and more, much much more! The place was elegant, no lie. Wine list was pretty extensive. Let me rewind a second before i ramble and ramble. We opted to park across the street, in the garage underneath mellow mushroom. 1st hour is free and for the two extra hours that we indulged ourselves to this lovely frrrrrench brasserie, we onnly had to pay $5 for the three hours of parking...could be worse.. Recommendations; any of the soups, french onion or white bean in truffel oil but also ask for the garlic confit in oil to go with the french rolls! the coq au vin was masterful. skirt steak was in no need of sauce and actually is able to be cut with a fork. Forget about the cote de boeff and filet, try something cheaper but equally as good! the foie gras was an interesting try. Knowing that I can't create this delicacy on my own, I had to give it a whirl. Interesting to say the least. . As you can see, 5 stars! Even without the wine enhancement it would have been a great experience. But I can't see myself going to a Frrrrench style place without a glass of wine to accomadate.. You will tell your friends and co-workers about this place. There is a lot of extra space upstairs for parties.. Bon appetit
