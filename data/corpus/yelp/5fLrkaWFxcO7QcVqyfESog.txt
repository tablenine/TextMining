I love this place. I've been going to this place since it's opened and now that i live in SF... I MISS IT!!!! I miss it badly enough where the next time i go back to Alhambra I'm going to order 5 hainan chickens to go and take it on the plane! I've never been a huge fan of curry or the pastas, but i definitely love the hainan chicken and salad. the pizza's good, but it takes a long time. I'd rather get the chicken served to me 2 seconds after ordering. . . FYI: you can switch things up by requesting the hainan chicken to be half chicken and salad, chicken w/ half rice and salad, or light meat only, or dark meat only, or you can even ask them to take off the skin for you! =)
