Came here with a girlfriend after dinner at Moonshine. We sat at the bar and had a very enjoyable experience. Our bartender was very knowledgeable on all the different kinds of beers, and even let us sample one or two before we committed to buying it. We never sat with empty drinks for more than a minute before being asked about a refill.. I enjoyed the atmosphere a lot. Large bar, tons of tv's with many different sports games and not too loud where you can't hear yourself think.
