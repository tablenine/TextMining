We finally got a chance to eat at Fogo de Chao!. . The first time I heard about this place, I looked it up to see how much it was. For $48.50 per person, this isn't really the place to have a spontaneous dinner.. . So I told hubby that we'll eat here either (1) on our birthday or (2) I get a good job, whichever comes first. Well on April 12th, I got a job offer (YAY!!!) and hubby and I were off to Fogo de Chao for dinner!!!. . Everything was cooked so good! My favorite cut was the rib eye, and the next time we come here, I'll specifically ask for that, and not waste my belly space with the chicken (although the chicken was still good... but it's chicken). I have eaten in a gaucho style environment before, but not like at Fogo.. . You have to turn the disk back to red, a few minutes after flipping it to green, because all of the meat bearing servers will flank you, and your plate will be covered with meat! They will also fetch you what meat you would like to try.. . The lamb chop was also good. My favorite cuts were the prime rib, lamb chop, filet mignon... everything. Hubby isn't really a big meat guy, so he got tired of it after a few plates.. . All in all, we paid $150 for two of us (with tip). Hubby had red wine, and I had champagne.. . We will come here again, maybe on our anniversary :)
