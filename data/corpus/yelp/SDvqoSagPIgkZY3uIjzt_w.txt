Best french dip sandwiches in LA...p no actually probably California! It is a downtown staple and cannot be underestimated! But you have to get the sandwich double dipped and with a side of chips and their lemonade!That makes the perfect lunch on a budget and I love the casual atmosphere..the hay on the floor..the long tables it just reminds of you the lunch tables when you were in grade school!They have a really good chocolate pie too as well..if you can fit in dessert!Phillipe's definielty beats Cole's on Main and 5th which claims to be the best and first french dip subs in L.A. umm no.I really don't care about the recent reviews and media coverage about it being closed down for a few hours..because to be quite honest we never know whats going on at any restaurant or deli behind the counter and if Phillipe's food has people coming back for almost a hundred years they must be doing something right!I love it that it is close to home but you know if you come in a peak lunch time hours your going to wait in line because it is that good! An old boyfriend of mine used to live across the street in the apartments at Union Station and everyday that I was there I HAD to have Phillipe's!The french dip sandwich lives up to it's name!And the waitresses still dress the same and have been there for years!There is sufficient parking in the back and when you set your money on the little plate, don't forget to tip the waitress!Worth every penny!
