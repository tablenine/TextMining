I feel like a two year old. I really do. I'm sucking on my thumb, gazing with glazed over eyes at the gray sky, reliving the memories of the tasty meal I just had. I was super hungry. My hunger up until then, gone. Nonexistent. Yet, after picking up Rocky B and her co worker, my appetite started to announce its arrival. As we made our arrival down to Humboldt Park, my heart skipped a beat or three as we walked in. Nothing makes me smile like some good Mexican food. The guilty pleasure of not so healthy food crossing my gullet makes me feel a little naughty, ahh screw it. I'm hungry. . . I looked up at the large menu, now, if you don't have a clue about what anything is, just grab one of their handy paper menus on the side. Explanations and less of a neck cramp are all available. I went with a double helping of tacos and a Cemitas. I went with the chorizo and Gov. Precioso, (chorizo and carne asada... mmmm... meaty!), and a carne enchilada Cemitas. A Guajillo marinated pork chop. The tacos were tasty, but to fend off my need to feed I would probably need about two more. Onions with held, I went with the simple cilantro, (beware Erin P), and of course some tasty but spicy hot sauce. No need for any cheese or other toppings to mess with my tortilla wrapped boys. But for the main course of my Cemitas, think a toasty sesame bun, slathered with avocado, chipotle mixture, cheese and low and behold some very tender pieces of very flavorful pork. Nothing chewy, just pure satisfaction. To wash it down, a cold Mexican coke. Was I stuffed when I left? Nope. I was pleasantly full satisfied, yet sad. My meal was gone, nothing but memories and my fingers that still hold a touch of flavor. Oh wait the thumb is all used up, time to move to the next one...
