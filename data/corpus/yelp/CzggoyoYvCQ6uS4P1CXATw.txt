This place - the name of which is pronounced roughly as "Vuhrst-Koock-uh" - is phenomenal.  They keep it simple with delicious high-end sausages and french fries and a great selection of beers on tap.  The space also has a warm, inviting atmosphere, with communal seating and cool music playing in the background.  The crowd is hard to pin down, seems to be lots of loft-dwellers from the neighborhood, as well as lots of families and USC students.  I'm glad to see this place doing so well.
