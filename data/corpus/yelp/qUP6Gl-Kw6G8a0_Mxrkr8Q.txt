Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
i went here with a huge group of friends for DineLA restaurant week.. . the garlic bread you get started off with is so crispy and fragrant. our meal came with a salad and i got toasted walnut and gorgonzola salad. i wasn't too big of a fan. i also got to try the greek salad and it was way too sour for me.. . our food came and the chicken kebabs were AMAZZINGGGG. i've never had such moist chicken. boyfriend's beef kebabs were good too but weren't as good as mine, he wanted to steal my food hehe! i also had a few bites of the risottos that a few friends ordered, which was melt in your mouth, buttery goodness.. . our meal came with dessert and i got the creme brulee. i usually like creme brulee, but i didn't like it here! it was really too rich and had an odd flavor which i can't seem to pinpoint. the sorbet was delicious though! i stole most of my boyfriend's dessert. tiramisu wasn't that special and everything else was too rich and sweet. i've never been a dessert person, so you shouldn't take my word for sweets.. . i would DEFINITELY, no question about it, come back here for the kebabs. it was delicious and so healthy. it's clean and the service is wonderful. the waiters are so freindly and helpful. the atmosphere is romantic too. it's not so dark, but definitely not entirely lit up. it's perfect for a special night out.
