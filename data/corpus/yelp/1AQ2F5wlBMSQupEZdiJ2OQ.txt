Went for lunch.  Very swanky.  Loved the bathrooms!. . Hummus plate was tasty - came with pita &amp; large chunks of Italian bread (a little buttery), olive oil, and olives.  . . I had the sonoma salad which was delicious.  Great mix of leafy greens, cranberries, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and grapefruit with a light dressing.  The grapefruit made the salad - juicy and cold.  . . I also like how they give you a large bottle of water for your table - I'm always needing refills.  I'd love to check out a happy hour sometime, the downstairs lounge looks great for a swanky night out.
