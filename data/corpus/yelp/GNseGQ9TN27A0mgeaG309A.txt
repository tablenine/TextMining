Restaurant: Social House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Social House just recently opened, it was once a philly cheesesteak restaurant on Howell Mill. This is a breakfast/brunch type restaurant. I believe they close at 3pm. There's lots of parking to the side and behind the restaurant, so parking isn't an issue - but if you go there for Sunday brunch, it's tricky to get out, as there is a church across the street from the exit...and a lot of side street parking on both sides. The ambiance is very nice...Bright white and light blue walls with hardwood floors. Intimate seating, and nice decor with torch singers and standards as background music. The menu is very southern. They have grits with shrimp and andouille sausage (which was very good), or pork chops or even tilapia (I had never heard of that combination before). They also have a signature dish that they have been working on - fried green tomato crepes, but unfortunately they didn't have any when I ordered. The biscuits are amazing, and there are a lot of vegetarian dishes as well, so no one is left out - and if you're more of a lunch than a brunch kind of guy (like my husband) there are a few items on the menu that will tickle your fancy. Price-wise I'd give it a $$. Friendly staff and free weekly newspaper/magazines such as Creative Loafing and SK!RT are provided.
