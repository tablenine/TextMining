Seeing as how they're parked in front of a bar in Venice a couple nights a week, I think they benefit a little from the bacon-wrapped hot dog phenomenon.  At least when in Venice.. . All the same, 5 stars!. Absolutely genius in premise - you have to wonder why Korean kalbi tacos have not happened sooner in Los Angeles.  Seriously, do you know how many tacos and koreans there are in this city???. Not only that, but they are flawless in execution.. Also, don't be afraid of the line, they churn out those tacos faster than they can take orders.
