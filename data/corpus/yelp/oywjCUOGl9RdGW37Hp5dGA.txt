Great example of a name carrying a place. This place is awful. Overpriced and mediocre food. My husband and I went there once and got their special to be shared with 2 people. It was 1 fish split in half and stuffed with mashed potatoes and served with a side of mashed potatoes. WTF? For almost $60!! Had they been clear on what the special was we would not have ordered it. Â The service was awful and the atmosphere isn't that great either. Stay away!
