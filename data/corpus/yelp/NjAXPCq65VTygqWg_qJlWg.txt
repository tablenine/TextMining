4 stars because i LOVE the grasshoppers! chocolate dipped mint macaron ice cream sandwich. these are so good they were even sold out once. . . i used to go here every sunday, then realized i was outta control and and had to rein it in. i enjoy their sandwiches, but really come here for the desserts. have had: milkies, butterfinger ice cream cone, milky way shake, red velvet mini's, and toffee ice cream bar. ALL were good. . . i am curious about their pasta, and will try that next.
