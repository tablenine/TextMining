I love this place. It's crowded from open to close and I haven't had anything here I didn't like. I have to make a stop here whenever I visit my friends. I bring them back to the bay and last time I brought back 3 dozen potato balls.. . What I really like here are the potato balls. It's like a breaded mashed potato ball with a bit of meat filling inside. What's not to love? Then you top each bit with Tapatio sauce (you have to ask for it).. delish! A few of these can be a meal. They used to leave the sauce out for everyone but you must ask for them now, and they're shady about giving you a lot. My potato ball to sauce ratio is 1:1 so the handful they give me is never enough for the amount I buy. Kinda sucks but I don't mind, I can buy my own sauce if I must; just makes it easier on the plane ride.. . The other thing I really like here is the mariquitas (plantain chips). Yum! Better than any other chips and addictive too. I don't like the garlic oil they give; I eat them plain and their perfectly fine. They are light, crispy, and not too salty.. . What else have I had? I've tried a few types of the strudels and they're all good. I've had their meat pie which is good but it's not on my regular rotation. Your eyes will be telling you what to order because everything looks good. I don't think you can choose a wrong item here. . . The lines are long but the workers are pretty fast and efficient. You can preorder potato balls but they come in a smaller size.. . Suggestion #1: put placards for each item because sometimes it is hard to decipher what things are.. . Suggestion #2: expand to the bay area please!
