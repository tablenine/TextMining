Tasty Sushi = Happy Camper!. . Hide (pronounced Hee-Day) Sushi is one of those places you do and don't want to tell your friends about. I am a big stickler on how sushi is made and how it is served, and I will have to admit, that I was thoroughly satisfied by my stumbling upon this place.. . This place is always packed for a good reason. Once you get in, expect to wait, but let me tell you, the wait is definitely worth it! Once we were seated at the bar, we loaded up on a barrage of sushi, from uni to eel to toro to octopus and then some. The each tender piece that entered my mouth brought me happiness and made me want more.. . I know this Â place is $$, but be ready to spend $$$ because you just want to keep going and see what else they have in store. With that in mind, bring cash! No plastic here folks, just good ol greenbacks. So if you are looking for some sushi in West LA/Sawtelle area, definitely make the time for this small hole in the wall for fresh sushi, you will not be disappointed!
