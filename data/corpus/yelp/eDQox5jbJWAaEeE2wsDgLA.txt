I feel a little silly reviewing a place with so many reviews already, but I want to put it on my New York list.  Needs must.. . I was really impressed with this place, since it is clearly playing into a stereotype.. The homemade gnocchi was good, not great, but really good.  The sauce was nice, and bright.. But what really shone were the fresh cheese appetizers.  Fresh ricotta and mozzarella and an excellent salad.  Followed by skate (which I love when it's done well, and this was) with lemon and capers. An excellent meal, good service, nice atmosphere and it didn't break the bank.. Thumbs up!
