This place is a must stop whenever I am within 20 minutes of Burbank.  Potato balls, meat pastries, deserts, sandwiches this place has everything and the prices are great!. . Super clean and classy building, parking isn't the easiest but I've seen worse.  Staff is super friendly, the layout just makes you want to eat eat eat. . . Love it!
