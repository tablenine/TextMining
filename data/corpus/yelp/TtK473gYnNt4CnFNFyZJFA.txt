Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Everything about this shack is real. . . It is how you see it. Nothing fancy. Not trying to impress. Just good ol' southern BBQ. One of the best ribs I've ever had... It's so tender that it just comes right off the bone. So be prepare and roll up them sleeves, cuz that's how you gotta eat them ribs! . . They barely have any light inside, so we dined on the neon light signs that were hung on the window. Loud live music with a crowd that wasn't terribly fun or in the mood - I guess cuz it's Wednesday night and not on a Friday or Saturday night. And you can see various kinds of people dining in there. I like it like that.... . Just keepin' it real! =)
