It's so entertaining to eat here, just watching Kenny, Zach, and the regulars.  First of all the menu is amazing, its overwhelming but amazing.. I came here for lunch on a weekday and all the tables were full by the time we were seated.  I had to try the slutty cakes of course because it has pumpkin in it!  They are basically pancakes with pumpkin, peanut butter, and pistachio baked into it.  My friend got the Junior which was pulled bbq pork, scrambled eggs, mac and cheese with a side of baguette.  The food was yummy and the portions were enormous, we were basically stuffed eating less than half our plates.  Zach commented after on it, "Good work girls."   And of course took the leftovers home.
