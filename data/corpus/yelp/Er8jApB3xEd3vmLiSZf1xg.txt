Many fond memories of this place at 4 am.  Great all night eats, not necessarily cheap, but for LA it's par for the course, especially 24 hours.. . Every stoner snack or drunk delight you could ask for from toast and honey to pancakes.  . . Bring your friends after you get kicked out of the bar.  Also acceptable if you left voluntarily.
