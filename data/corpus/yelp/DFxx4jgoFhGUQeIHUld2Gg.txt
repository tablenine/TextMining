Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
What you need to know: You will wait in line about an hour (less if your lucky). Bring only cash. Know that you are going to consume about 1000 calories (hot dog alone) OK this last one is a slight exaggeration but if your on a strict diet steer clear from this place because trust me the smell alone can convert the strictest vegan into a carnivore. FYI there is no beer or modern soda brands (No school like the old school right lol). . . OK with these things being said now my review. I had the Chicago spicy polish, chili cheese fries, and an orange crush. I enjoyed everything. The only critique about this place is the hot dog buns. I was forced to eat my hot dog like some snotty brat with a fork and knife because my bun fell apart. Besides the wait and lousy buns this place was delicious.
