Standard brunch fare, with a few surprises in a beautiful, sunny, rather large restaurant.  We had a group of five and waited about an hour on a busy Saturday morning.  By the time I got in, I was ravenous.  . . I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich which came on a bagel with pesto.  I also got fresh fruit on the side.  The size of the portion was not impressive, but it was solely because of my order.  The rest of the table got other things that were served in ample portions.  The egg frittata was huge, the strawberry and nutella crepes came four to an order (and they had an entire crepe menu), and the "South Beach" (yogurt, fruit and granola in a hollowed out pineapple) was amazingly presented.  . . Although the portion of mine was kind of small, the flavor sensation was spectacular.  Our server was also very gracious and sweet, and even brought my friend numerous glasses of ice and decaf coffee to make her own decaf iced coffee.. . Overall, a very pleasant experience.
