I really like this Bin SOOOO much better than the one downtown. The ambiance is better and I suppose so is the crowd. There is nice exposed brick and art paintings throughout. The layout is nicer, as I always thought the one downtown looks like a glorified dixie kitchen. The flights are well paired and showcase management's good knowledge of wine. We love the cheeses and small food selection, it is enough to whet the appetite! If you are tired of the downtown scene but want a good wine bar to go to, this is it.
