I visited this new Chicago hot spot last Friday night with a bunch of friends. I had a really great time and realized this is where all the cute girls in Chicago have been hanging out. It was pretty crowded, but we still managed to get a table. Â Fortunately, we got there early enough to avoid the long lines as well.
