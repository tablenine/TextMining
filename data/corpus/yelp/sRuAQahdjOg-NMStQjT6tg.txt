5 Stars from me.  This is as good as I've had.  Granted, I haven't tried them all (Malnatis included) but eating at Giordanos was a satisfying culinary experience in every sense of the phrase.. . I was traveling on business so I ate there alone.  The smallest pizza you can order, aptly named 'small', was big enough to feed me twice.. . I ordered the special - green pepper, onion, sausage, cheese, sauce.  It was done perfectly.  The crust, the sauce, everything.  The balance of cheese was awesome - there was certainly a lot of it but it just seemed right.. . Tip - if you're looking for draft beer at the bar, get a pitcher.  $11 for the pitcher vs. $4.50 per glass (domestic).. . Can't wait to get back!
