Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
This place has fantastic sandwiches. We've gone for lunch on the weekends a bunch of times and have always had a good experience. The wait has never been too bad--the longest we've had was 20 minutes at the lunch rush during the Do Division street fest (other times, no wait at all for two).  The menu is endless, and every sandwich we've tried has great, fresh ingredients.  The beer list is also a plus: includes lots of tasty, interesting microbrews.  During the summer, there is an outdoor patio, too, so that you can enjoy the people-and-dog-watching experience along Division Street.
