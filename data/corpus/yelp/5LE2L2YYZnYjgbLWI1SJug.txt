Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
As I sit here in Chipotle writing this review, I question why I even go to places like Pure to pay twice as much for food whose quality, locality, and sustainability is often not even close to Chipotle's; but I do go and here's the verdict: Meh. . . While you of course get more choices at Pure than Chipotle, does that really matter when all of those choices consist of conventionally raised and processed ingredients? The food is decent; and absolutely nothing beyond that. What can I say...nothing really stands out at this place except maybe the space itself, which is laid out well. . . They did get my girl's veggie quesadilla order wrong (which btw isn't on the menu as are any veggie options), bringing her a chicken instead. . . One plus is that they do use corn tortillas instead of flour. Point right there. But, their margaritas taste more like soda syrup than anything else. To say that they're weak would be an understatement. . . All in all, an acceptable place to watch the US choke against Ghana; just make sure you don't choke on the food.
