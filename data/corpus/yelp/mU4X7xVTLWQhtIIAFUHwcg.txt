Huh.  I've heard quite a bit of hype about Fraiche and I think my opinion suffers from it because of the high expectations.  For sure, the setting is quite pleasant if a tad "cheesy" in its attempt to recreate a French Brasserie in Culver City.  Don't get me wrong, the food was lovely, and the menu varied and interesting.  It attempts at innovation with self-consciously "different" dishes like the albino "baby beets," but doesn't pay off in absolute addictive deliciousness.  It's not enough to draw me back again and again, but  I do look forward to using this as a nice place to grab drinks and a cheese plate outside during the summer.  For that very special meal however, I'll stick to old stand-bys like Lucques or Mozza.
