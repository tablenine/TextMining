Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This is one of my most favorite places to eat when I am visiting. Being from Hawaii we do not have a yummy dumpling house like this. It is a must visit when I am there. Usually when I go to Din Tai Fung, there is almost always a wait, but it is soooooooooooo worth it (note: while waiting, go next door as they have really good BOBA drinks.). Back to the food, the dumplings are made just right. They are juicy and very delicious. Honestly, I haven't tried anything on their menu that I didn't like. The service is fast and typical of any Chinese Restaurant. The prices are reasonable. You just need to check this place out for yourself.
