Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
This place represents my ideal for quick service (even when there's a line) meets casual dining &amp; takeout in Los Angeles.. . The food, both the bakery items AND the hot/prepared foods are consistently, exceptionally good. Their fruit juices and coffee drinks are superb. . . I'll stop in here for pastries to take to business meetings, lunch with friends &amp; family, they cater my kids parties and their spectacular, reasonably priced cakes adorn the table for every celebratory event in our house.. . Porto's staff is sweet, helpful and quick. If lines are long, they hand out tasty samples.. . These guys just do it right.
