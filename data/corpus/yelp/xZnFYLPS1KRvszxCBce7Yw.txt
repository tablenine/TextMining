Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Ok, I must say that the food here is good but the wait times are so bad that I had to knock off a star.. I've never waited that long to be seated in my freaking life. Anyways, on to the food.... . It was pretty funny that they simply dump plastic bags of food on the table with a roll of paper towels. The table is your plate and your hands are your utensils. Felt so barbaric!! It was awesome.. . King Crab Legs (**) : Good, but nothing new. . Shrimp (****) : A little overcooked, but I didn't expect to have "perfectly" cooked shrimp here. It was so full of flavor (in a good way), that it made up for the rubbery texture. It was better than the crab legs.. . Extras: Corn on the Cob &amp; Sausage (*****) : These extras came in the bag of seafood goodies and as a result, were saturated with the same flavorful seasoning. VERY good. . . Fried Catfish with Cajun Fries (***) : Very much like the crab legs... good but nothing new.. . FYI - prepare to have your fingers smell like Boiling Crab for a good 3-4 days.
