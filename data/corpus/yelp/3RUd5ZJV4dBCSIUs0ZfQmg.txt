When I leave Kogi, I am happy. No matter how my day was, I am happy. It is a truly fantastic feeling.. . I highly recommend the chicken taco. It's really really tasty. The combination of flavors and really tender meat is delicious. Plus, there's a slight kick to it that adds some complexity. The pork taco doesn't taste much different, which is a little peculiar--it just tastes a little more fatty. Usually, I would not give five stars because of this lack of variety, but , in this case, it really doesn't matter--the chicken taco is THAT good. The tofu taco also tastes basically the same, but is just slightly inferior to the chicken and pork. . . Also, KIM CHI QUESADILLA! I am not the biggest Kim Chi fan, but I am a huge fan of this quesadilla. SO good. . . It's also nice that they have unlimited free lime slices, radish pieces, and orange wedges. The flavor of the tacos is complimented nicely by some fresh-squeezed lime and radish pieces. And, the orange wedges are a nice end to the meal. . . Plus, prices! Very reasonable.. . Unfortunately, the line is getting longer every time I go, but it's worth it.
