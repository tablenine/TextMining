Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
This Jersey boy was craving some hand tossed pizza and hit up Coalfire for carryout. While it would never be confused with Lombardi's (NYC's best) or Pizza Regina (Boston), we had a couple of solid pies. Charred is how you'll get them here and it makes the pizza tasty, albeit overcooked for me. Simple combos and lack of toppings saddened me. Really, no garlic?!?
