I had a chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich. The cookie was way way way too sweet and the ice cream was just so so. I had such a wicked stomach ache after eating it.. . It was disturbing to see the cookies right at the counter where the cash registers are. I dropped my change by accident right into the basket holding those little flaky french cinnamon sugar pastry things they sell for Â 25 cents each. Yuck.
