Sometimes I like pretending like I'm one of those ladies that lunch and Canoe is the perfect place to play that game.... . These days I'm too busy for nice lunches so a gorgeous restaurant like Canoe is a nice change from the peanut butter sandwiches, tortillas and cheese, and the popcorn I usually whip up in my condo back in Chicago. While the outside garden was  calling my name the 105 degree report from the weatherman was telling me to stay inside because ladies who lunch don't have frizzy hair and sweat running down their face. Right?. . Ladies who lunch probably also don't eat every last bite on their place, but when served the best chicken tacos in the world (seriously) I had no choice.  Our waitress tried to take my plate away several times, but I was determined to get every last drop....and it was beyond delicious. . . If I had access to Canoe year round I may just become a permanent lady who lunches.
