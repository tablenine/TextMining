I'm a meat-and-potatoes kind of girl, especially when the meat is a hamburger and the potatoes are belgian fries.  And even more especially when the hamburger is topped with gruyere and the fries come with aioli on the side.  The burger is so juicy yet wholesome that I can't make myself try anything else on the menu.  My husband favors the chicken dishes; I can't relate.  Whenever we eat at some fancy place that disappoints, we say, "We should have gone to Oinkster."  My only quibble is the seating -- blinding sun creating a greenhouse effect on one side, and a weird would-be lounge area with Ikea LACK tables (too low to eat off of) on the other -- but I'll put up with some eyestrain and back pain for my cheeseburger combo.
