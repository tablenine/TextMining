Delicious food, super cute store, friendly people. All an A+ in my book... but why not 5? Its a bit pricey, and at night when I went, they our desserts were a bit dry from sitting out. Apparently they cut a slice of blue velvet cake and leave it on a plate so they can just hand it to people... kinda sucked, but hey, I didn't mind after tasting its deliciousness. I also got the Media Noche without pickles. That was pretttttttyyyyy good, but a bit over priced. Their homemade salad dressing was amazing. I wish I would've gotten a salad.. Another cool things worth mentioning; they serve coca cola in old school coke bottles (that were made in mexico, which is better because they use actual cane sugar i guess), and other neat-o sodas as well. AND you can actually watch them make and bake the goods in back through the plexiglas window hallway. Pretty sweet. I'll be back!
