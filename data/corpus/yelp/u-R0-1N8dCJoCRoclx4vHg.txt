Restaurant: Pura Vida
Category: Tapas Bars
I experienced Pura Vida for the first time with high hopes. Hoping it might out-do some of the other tapas restaurants. (I'll keep this short). . . The service was so slow! We were immediately given water (from the "water guy") and our waiter did not come over to take our drink order, let alone acknowledge us until 15 minutes later. BTW...they were not busy, a good crowd though. Maybe they were short servers. My boyfriend &amp; I were starving so we ordered numerous small plates, thinking the food would be plenty! We ordered; an olive plate (the best tasting item we had), calamari ceviche (tasted too fishy), smoked trout (uh...ok), hanger steak (decent), rib burger (good but it came back up all night long - belching), chicken  empanadas (very good), The food was sub par and the portions are small, even for tapas.  Also, I went to Puerto Rico a few weeks ago... the sangria there needs to give this restaurant a mixology lesson or two.. . There are only two restaurants that I have eaten at in the last few years that I would give a one star to, unfortunately, this is one of them. Very disappointed.
