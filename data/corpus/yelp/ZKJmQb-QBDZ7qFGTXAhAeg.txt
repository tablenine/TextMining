Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I live nearby and never went to Roscoe's, but I finally decided to see what all that hype was about.. . Meh.. . I really wanted to love this place, but it didn't live up to the hype.  The chicken was pretty good, I can say that, but the waffles made me sad.  I've had better.  And the cornbread wasn't that good.  It was, dare I say, dry and flavorless.  Maybe I had a bad batch?. . I really want to like the place, so I will give it another shot.  I'll stray away from the claim to fame and try something else on the menu.  If not, I will ask Marie Calendar's to save me some of her cornbread.
