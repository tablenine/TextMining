Category: Barbeque
Completely terrible. The food was poor quality and the service was just as bad. Even though it wasn't crowded, our waitress ignored us for the first 20 minutes. Then she forgot half my order and never brought us silverware. They also charged us for the food they forgot to bring out. The toilet was broken in the bathroom. The chili was bland and flavorless. Will not eat here again.
