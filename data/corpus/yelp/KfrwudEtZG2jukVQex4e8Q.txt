Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
"Stinking" is right.  For the price, the food stinks.  If the food cost about 1/3 as much, I'd say it's worth it.  It wasn't horrible, but it is most definitely overpriced.  . . We started with a small cast iron skillet full of garlic cloves in olive oil.  This was meant to be spread on bread.  It wasn't even warm.  It was as if they nuked a metal can full of garlic cloves and then poured them in a cold skillet filled with unheated olive oil.  Crappy.. . I had ribs, which were tender and tasty enough but they weren't garlicky.  The mashed potatoes were good and garlicky.  My Mom had a portobello mushroom on roasted vegetables.  She said it was good, but not that garlicky.  . . If you are going to a place called "THE STINKING ROSE" - a garlic restaurant, you expect the garlic to be damn good AND damn strong.  Am I right or am I right?. . Service was extremely blah.  Usually when you go to one of these theme restaurants, they try and at least explain the CONCEPT of the place to you.  Our waiter couldn't have been less interested.  It took forever for him to come take our food order after we had ordered our drinks.  . . Oh, and another thing -  I ordered an apple martini that tasted as if it had absolutely NO G**DAMN vodka in it whatsoever.  Plus, it was $10.  Oh heeeellll no.  When I want my alcohol, I want my alcohol.  And $10 for plain old green apple schnapps ain't gonna cut it.. . All in all, I was very disappointed.  For the price, I expected a lot more. I won't go back.
