can't beat the BYOB. they put our beer and wine on ice the moment we walked through the door. i tried the vietnamese spring rolls (awesome), inari (very small), tofu pad thai (delicious) and the chicken cashewnuts (delicious). great portions, great prices. did i mention they brought us fortune cookies and free dessert?
