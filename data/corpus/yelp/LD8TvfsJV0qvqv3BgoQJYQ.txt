I really want to hate on this place. Really badly want to hate on how hip everyone is and how much of a scene this place has become.  I want to hate on the flirty waitresses who wear ripped stockings, I want to hate on the booths that are made of old 50s car seats.  But I can't hate on how the food is pretty good, with a big menu and all kinds of specialties: the waffles, the pancakes, the milkshakes.  I love their salads like the Thai Cobb and the SWS.  But my favorite is the New Amsterdam: Bacon, scrambled egg, hashbrown in a nice toasted bun.  With the side of onion rings you have yourself a substantial late night meal.  Look, I really don't like trendy places or going to hang somewhere just to be seen. But the food is pretty good, I can't lie. The price is reasonable and as crowded as it gets I've rarely had to wait for a table. . . 4 bloody stars.
