Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I do love me a brooklyn sandwich, but what I've come to realize on all my recent deli visits that what sets Canter's aside is the bakery.. .  I just went to brent's, Nate n' Al, and Fromin's and none of thier bakeries impressed me at all. A few black a white cookies, maybe some cake to go but that's about it. Canter's bakery had more items at the bakery than all of the three aforementioned combined. They have cupcakes, macaroons, rugelahs, cheesecakes, and many other items I couldn't identify without asking what they are. The poppy seed rugelahs are amazing and I've never found another place that carries that flavor rugelahs.. . Canter's has many great things about it, but the two things that set it aside from the rest of the LA delis - #1 24 hours #2 The bakery. So after your brooklyn or your O'malleys, hopefully you didn't order the brisket, make SURE you stop by the bakery and get a chocolate macaroon...you'll thank me.
