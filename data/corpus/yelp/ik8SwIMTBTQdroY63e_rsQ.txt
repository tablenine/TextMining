Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
well, i remember coming here years ago when it wasn't as crowded..and the customers were mostly korean.. now it's blown up. i went on a thursday night!! and it was packed! dont even try getting in on a weekend unless you dont mind long waits. as mentioned by others, the service is slow when really crowded. . . there are a lot of gringos (non-koreans) now like every other korean bbq restaurant that starts gaining popularity.. they all are amazed at this place. but it's not that great. not that it's bad, the meat is pretty good, but there are dozens of better places around socal. it is all you can eat for $17 per person.. ask for garlic and dehn-jang(dip).
