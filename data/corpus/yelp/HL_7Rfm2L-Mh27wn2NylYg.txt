we never leave this place unsatisfied by the food !. . picanha [ soooo good !! ]. giovanna's pasta [ i never order pasta at restaurants but love this one ]. any pizzas.. anything really.. . huge portions + totally worth the price !. . 05/28/10 UPDATE: food was not as good as it usually is + our server was too busy trying to flirt with some 18 year old girls that this was a total bum out experience. hate the sunset location. HATE IT. the WLA location is better.
