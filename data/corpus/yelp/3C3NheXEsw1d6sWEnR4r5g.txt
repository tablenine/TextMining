NO NO NO! I'm so turned away by this place based solely on the horrific service. 5 of my friends and I came in last Sunday night around 9pm. It was a lovely night and the patio was close to dead. We were in the mood for some light food and nice cocktails. Service is such a large part of dining out and they need to get their act together over here because there are plenty of other sushi spots I would rather dine at.. . I was the first to arrive, so I took a seat and relaxed. It wasn't until 10 minutes of relaxing went by that I started to get anxious. I had yet to be approached by anyone. I had been seated by the hostess and servers were all around me, but nobody bothered to make eye contact, say hello or ask me if I would like a cocktail. This is huge. Another 5 minutes go by and finally someone comes over and I order my cocktail. 10 minutes later, I finally get this cocktail.. . The turtle behavior didn't stop there. Once all my friends arrived, the same thing happened. I think everyone was sitting there for a good 20 minutes before our cocktails even got delivered. The sushi was boring and nothing special (by the time it actually came out). We kept wanting to order more, but nobody was around so we got frustrated and asked for the bill. This took another 15 minutes. The bill was around $250, but I'm sure it would have doubled if she had checked back with us more often. That's their loss. I'm over it!
