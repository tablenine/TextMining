I love this place! It is quite pricey for bottles...or half bottles...or even glasses....which, really, makes it just expensive....but I gotta say, I still come monthly on a special occasion. . . If you're going to go all out, I would say split a bottle of champagne on a date or with friends. You're likely to spend more than $25 by ordering single glasses if you stay for more than 30 minutes or have more than 1 glass. . . The staff has always been superb and the atmosphere is very homey and seems exclusive.
