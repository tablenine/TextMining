it's been years since i've been to the old location, mostly because it was a very tight space and the wait was also 45 mins +.  they've recently moved down the street into an old coco's.  much nicer and bigger! wait is still long, so consider coming prior to 6pm before the mad dinner rush. the seafood is scruptious, but the other stuff is good too!  the service was surprisingly good!  our waiter was entertaining.  he even led a happy bday song for my grandmama! :)  the staff came around many times to refill drinks and to change plates.   overall, good experience and highly recommend.
