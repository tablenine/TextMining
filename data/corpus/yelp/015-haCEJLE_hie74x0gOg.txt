Cajun?  I think not.  All they give you is bag of grease with tons of garlic.  Get sick after you eat a few pieces.  Service sucks of course.  I went there one day and the dumb a$$ hostess decided to give my spot on the waiting list away since she didn't "SEE" me waiting outside.  My friends requested for the "MANAGER" and all he could say was, "go talk to the hostess".  WOW O_O.  They need a new staff.  Anyhow.  I've been to New Orleans and that's REAL cajun food for you.  Asians shouldn't claim anything if they never really tried the real deal.
