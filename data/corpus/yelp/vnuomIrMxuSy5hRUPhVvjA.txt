Love this place! Parking in the rear. Same as the rite aid or whatever that pharmacy type store is next door. I have tunnel vision when my mind is on those yummy treats I'm about to consume inside the Griddle Cafe! MMMMMMMMMMmmmmMMMM!! Actually parking can be a MOFO at any time during the week even in the lot. And,yes, the wait is not short. But I'm never in groups larger than 3 and usually it's just me and one other person. So I have rarely had to wait more than 15 minutes. But I did one time wait for about 45!. But all will be forgotten after to take the first bite of breakfast HEAVEN!!! Trust and BELIEVE!!!. . Mama's french toast is hands down the best "regular" french toast I've EVER had! I order it without the powdered sugar. cuz, for me, that's just a wee bit excessive. Sugar AND syrup? Um...no thanks...But most others seem to just take it all as it comes.. . If I order pancakes I always just order one pancake. Didn't know you could do that until I had been there a few times and wasted my money and TONS of food by ordering (and not being able to even come  CLOSE to finishing) a full stack of three! They are the size of frisbee's and a good half or 3/4 inches thick!!!!. . They also have alternative meat options like chicken or turkey sausage. That's plus for me because I won't go anywhere near anything with pork on it!. . Not cheap...but you could conceivably get two or three or 4 regular meals  from one order...really.
