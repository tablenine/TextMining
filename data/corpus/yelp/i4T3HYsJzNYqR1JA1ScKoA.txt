GREAT wine selection !. . This was just a quick visit but I had a great experience... The bar tender was really knowledgeable, she suggested that I try the mussels and fries and that was just enough with my glass of wine(Anne Ameie pinot grigio)... which was a great start to my long evening.... . . I will be trying this place again for dinner.
