Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I loved this Katsu-Ya before the other Katsu-Ya was cool.. . This is my must-go-to restaurant when I'm in LA. and the one to which all other sushi restaurants are compared.. . I know it's been too long since I've been down (that's what she said). when I have dreams of Katsu-Ya.. . They have the most amazing dishes you could imagine.. Crispy rice or crispy sesame w/spicy tuna? . Girlfriend. . You have no idea.. . The beer and tuna always taste better here.
