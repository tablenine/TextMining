We came here a few weeks ago. Their wine selection was pretty good. For appetizers, we had the pork belly/gnocchi which was great and a sort of yellowtail (hamachi) ceviche which actually didn't seem very fresh. The steelhead salmon with chanterelle mashed potatoes was absolutely exquisite! Our waitress, Tory, was very friendly. Utterly amazing experience.
