My Singaporean hubby is very picky about chicken rice and my in-laws would take us to visit various famous chicken rice stands when we visited Singapore.  I had high hopes after reading the reviews but I have to report that the chicken rice here is just OK.  It's still pretty good chicken rice.  But it is not in the same league with the ones I had in Singapore.  Though It is pretty good for LA standard.  . . My son liked the pizza quite a bit.  There is always a line during meal time and the place is small.  But the line is probably a testimony of the goodness here, although I don't really get it.  Don't mind eating here if I don't have to wait but not worth the wait, especially with hungry kids in the gang.
