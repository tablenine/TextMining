Two Words - ROASTED OLIVES.. You MUST try these, they are delicious - brought to you sizzling on a hot ceramic dish bathing in a touch of balsamic, a generous amount of olive oil and seasoned with dried chiles and orange/lemon rind. SO GOOD!!!! I'm not an olive person, but these, i really enjoyed.. . I also tried the clam pizza and the tomato basil pizza (loved the clam b/c it had a ton of garlic and a touch or red pepper flake). Both were super duper good -  the crust was thin and crispy, yet chewy and flavorful.  . . We went at an odd hour, 3:30pm on Saturday. The place was half-full, fully staffed and very comfortable at the bar. I don't think you'll be dissappointed.  . . Oh, and they have an obscure italian wine list (tried one the bartender recommend and it was great. they're generous on their pours too, they fill up your glass, and also fill up a carafe, so in actuality, you get a glass and a half).  And before i forget, their house prosecco rocks!!!!  mangi bene i miei amici!!!
