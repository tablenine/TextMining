Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Great beer selection, and a nice neighborhood spot.  It's nice to come into a place as authentic as Manuel's.  It's just a friendly place with the same friendly faces.  I'm very impressed with the quality of the service and the integrity of the bar.. . It loses a star simply because I'm not a fan of the food, really.  But, then again, I'm also not really a fan of bar food.. . When I came in the other day, I met with my friend and overhead conversations at the bar.  The quiet and social atmosphere was very pleasant, and the server/bartender was very attentive.  I am very pleased with this place, and I'm proud that places like this one exist in Atlanta.  I hope it's around for another fifty years!
