This "used to" be my favorite ramen and gyoza place in LA. I used to go there almost every week after work. Nice place to eat my ramen and read their Jumps and look at the yakuza look alike chef making ramen. (the guy with all the tattoos, if you have been there a while back, you know whom I am talking about) This was 3-4 years ago. Now the wait is insane, it's about a 20-45 mins wait. They no longer put out new Jumps. The soup sometimes feels like watered down. The gyozas sometimes are too soft. And I havent seen my Yakuza chef for almost a year. I am extremely sad that popularity has taken my favorite ramen joint in town away from me. Sigh~~. If you are tired of the wait, try the Japanese diner Shuehiro or Mr. Ramen next door.
