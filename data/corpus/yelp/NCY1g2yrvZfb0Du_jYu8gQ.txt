Category: Diners
Once called our waiter Fred with no idea of the restaurants name. haha. But Fred, you never seem to fail me!  Great late night spot with so many too many choices... Plus they have an entree named the Paul Bunyan Steak which I am very curious about since it sounds promising!  My best friend always gets a bowl of fruit wherever we go and let me tell you I've seen bowl's of fruit like no other.  So now I judge a restaurants fresshness buy these bowls.  Now let's go dancing and hit up this joint for an amazing bowl of fruit.
