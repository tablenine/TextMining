Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I'm a sushi head and Hide is my go to spot. Is it the best in LA? No. Urasawa and Sushi Zo are the spots for the best omakase. . . Hide is a no frills, reasonably priced place where you can dine on a regular basis and be happy with the basics. . . The hamachi and salmon are always on point here. They also load up the anikmo high as well as the spicy scallop if you order those. The cuts of fish are always generous.. . Downside is they often don't have toro and when they do it's not memorable. But that's the point, this is not a place for toro and onakase...this is the place to get full for a good price with the usual staples of good sushi.. . Stick to the following and you'll be really pleased with hide:. Hamachi. Salmon. Ankimo. Spicy scallop. Hirame with ponzu. Aji. Ika. . My other comparable place when I want a no frills good price sushi meal is sugarfish.
