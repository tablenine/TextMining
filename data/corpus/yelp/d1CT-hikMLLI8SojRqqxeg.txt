this place makes me happy.  i think ice cream should be its very own food group.  along with fantastic ice cream concoctions, they have some pretty tasty baked goods, too.  there are these double chocolate cookies that are so fudgy delicious... i always have to buy a couple.  the molasses cookie is pretty kick-ass, as well.  . . it can be pretty busy, but the line moves swiftly.  more importantly, they bring out your order quickly.  and all the people who work there are very sweet and patient when you ask them questions about the desserts or request samples of the ice creams.. . this place is supposed to have some pretty good regular food, as well.  i wouldn't know, though, because i never make it past the desserts.  this place is jam-packed with so much yummyness, i always feel a little overwhelmed by the excitement!  ice cream... mmmm...
