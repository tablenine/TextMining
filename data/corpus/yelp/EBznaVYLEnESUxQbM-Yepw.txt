Yummy!. . Went here with a group of 5.  Our (fabulous) waiter suggested 2 dishes per person, so we ordered 10--perfect amount of food.  Don't miss the asparagus or the sweet potato fries.  At 7:30 (we had a reservation) the place was bustling and fun.  When we left at 9:30 it seemed a little too loud for comfortable group conversation.
