Wow.  Yelpers were not lying when they said that the servers here are all good-looking!  Not only are they cute, but I think they also had to meet a certain "charm" requirement in order to get hired.  Our night was a whirl of dazzling smiles, charming exchanges, and direct eye contact topped off with a few winks.  . . Okay, okay...before you go off about how shallow I am for giving Bottega Louie 5 stars based on their hot servers, let me say this: their food was pretty hot too.  Wow...I really planned on writing more about the food, but now that I think about it...I don't remember all that much except that everything was good.  Oh, the flat apple tart stood out in particular.  . . Damn, I am shallow, aren't I?. . As we walked out, we were given a couple more smiles (go figure) and a "See you girls again soon!"  ...Oh yes, yes you will see me again soon.
