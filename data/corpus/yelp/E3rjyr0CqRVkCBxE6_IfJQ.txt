Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
#7 w/a side of rice and gravy and a lemonade.  That's my standard meal at Roscoe's.  My boyfriend gets the #3 - all wings and I usually steal one of his.  "Mama" is always annoyed by the fact that I don't get chicken and told my boyfriend she would stab him in the eye w/a chicken bone if he shared with me.. . In spite of the threat of violence.  I really love Roscoe's.  The only problem I have with it is that now that its "famous" the prices have risen dramatically.. . Back in the day my boyfriend and I could eat for less than $20 total.  Now its close to $30.  But despite the fact that the prices are out of control Roscoe's is a winner.. . Its also a great place to bring friends from out of town b/c you never know what celeb you're going to see.
