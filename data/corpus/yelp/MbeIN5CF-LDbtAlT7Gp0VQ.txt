I will truly miss this place when I move away from Los Angeles!! . As a warning so you don't think it is ridulous:. 1. It's at least an hour wait (there's plenty of shops around go walk around). 2. Don't expect a fancy smancy environment. 3. Parking sucks. . Food: . Amazing broth mixed with chewy ramen noodles cooked right in front of you! The pork melts in your mouth! They don't offer a huge variety of ramen it's very cut to the chase. I recommend the combo with fried rice. Â If it's a hot day order soup and noodle separately. . . Service: . I guess I'd consider this a hole in the wall Ramen restaurant. For a hole in the wall it's great service =).. . Environment: . I love this type of environment. Great eat while you're drunk place. Definitely not a 1st date restaurant....maybe a 5th date one. This place make me feel like I'm in the 1980s. Seating is very limited. . . Price: . The price is fair compared to other Ramen restaurants. Considering the ramen is the best I've ever had they can raise the dang prices 30% and I'd still come! Maybe that'd shorten the wait!. . Food: 5 (The best) . Service: 4. Environment: 5. Price: 5
