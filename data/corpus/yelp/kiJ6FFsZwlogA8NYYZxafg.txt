Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
Pure Crap.. . The only "taqueria" where I've had to valet park.  Not very "authentico".  The meal was overpriced and the tortilla chips were stale. Even the rice and beans were messed up - the rice was undercooked and the beans were bland.  Our waiter was twitchy and kinda "cracky".  Total waste of time and money.. . For good tacos, just go to Taqueria del Sol.
