Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
After about 50 failed attempts (The Counter is always so busy!) I finally got the opportunity to experience this place....and I'm in love!. . Pretzel Rolls!  Choose your own sauce out of like a million sauces!  Grilled pineapple as a burger topping!  Sweet Potato Fries!  Good god, it doesn't get much better than this.. . Our service was fantastic, and the restaurant is kinda casual chic with a nice bar and flat-screen TV's, making it a great place to grab a made-to-order burger and watch the game.  On a nice day there is outside seating that is always very coveted and competitive.  . . I'm coming back to The Counter, and I'm bringing my whole family.
