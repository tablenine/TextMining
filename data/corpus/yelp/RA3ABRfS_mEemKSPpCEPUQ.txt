Restaurant: The Bagel Restaurant &amp; Deli
Category: Bakeries
What could make this a perfect five star experience? A Bloody Mary to go with my brunch. But since that's not going to happen at this north side deli- let me tell you why The Bagel is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to get my favorite meal of the day. . . This bustling diner deli is not fancy, with movie posters on the walls, stainless steel stools at the counter and booths along the walls. The servers are quick and bring you a dish of the most amazing pickles within minutes of you sitting down. The menu offers up all of the expected breakfast favorites. . . I ordered an omelet made just the way I like it (ham, cheese and tomatoes). There are many meats and cheeses that you can choose from to create the perfect omelet or just order one of their creations. It comes with breakfast potatoes and is huge! Eggs not your thing? Try their pancakes, french toast or even the lox and bagels. All very tasty! My friend had his niece and nephew in tow the last time we were here and they were able to get all the things kids like (chicken fingers, fries, etc) along with cream soda, a special treat! . . Service was terrific and we were in and out in a reasonable amount of time given how crowded it was on this Sunday morning. Hard to believe but there is even a free parking lot across the street (I suspect someone will be building something there one of these days- but for now, it's a great asset!) . . Next time you get a craving for that perfect breakfast in a timeless deli- check out The Bagel. Your tummy will thank you!
