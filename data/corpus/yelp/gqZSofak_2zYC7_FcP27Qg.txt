Well I went to Spoon today, for the 2nd time and really do like the cuisine.  I first had the Cashew stir fry with chicken and really liked the flavor.  I went back and thought I would try an appetizer.  I ordered  the cheese rolls (like crab ragoon) and the shrimp/coconut soup.  I really enjoyed both, my only complaint is the soup portion was a little small.  I think this is a cute, relaxing place and would definately recommend it to someone who wants to dine in, or have take out.
