Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
This is my favorite Chicago restaurant, bar none! .         I was walking down Clark St. one afternoon when I was whisked into the restaurant by the owner, Germain. He told me that he had seen me walk by every day and wondered why I never came in. He bought me a glass of wine and a plain dessert crepe and won me over with his sharp wit. The personality of the owner and the chatty, arty staff won me over the first time and it just gets better every time!.            I have tried many things on the menu-my husband's favorite and IT IS OUTSTANDING is the Chicken Curry Crepe. So good. The goat cheese/broccoli one is my standard and I love it with a Sauvignon Blanc. So crisp and light- my idea of the perfect dinner..          The outdoor seating is great for a date-they often have live music and Germain plays trumpet with Jerry King on accordion, a Chicagoland fixture with great stories if you have the chance to engage him. My perfect mix of personality and great food.
