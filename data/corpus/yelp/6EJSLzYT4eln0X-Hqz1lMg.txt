Great place for lunch.  I had the chicken, bacon, brie sandwich (good) and the bro had the short rib sandwich (really good).  . . Didn't care for their iced tea or their Chinese chicken salad (too many fried wontons, fried chicken, just too greasy for a salad).. . Their Snicker cake is good too.  Would definitely go again to try their cheese selection, which you can buy by the pound to take home!. . Street parking only, limited seating but turnaround is quick and didn't wait long for a table.
