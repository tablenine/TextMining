I've been going here on Saturdays or Sundays ever since I can remember.  It's a cool place, especially for people who aren't around here.  My parents are members and whenever they have a chance to take someone here, they will.  Don't get me wrong.  I love this place, I have been here countless times and I have never had a dull moment.  If you have friends who have never been to LA take them.  It's different and memorable.  Also, if you have friends who are members and you aren't ask them either how you can become a member or sometimes they have passes where you can get a reservation.  Come here if you can! You'll have a great time.
