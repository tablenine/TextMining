Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
I have now dined at Comme Ca on three different occasions, and I like it more every time.  I will admit that my first experience at this Melrose French bistro (or is it a braisserie?  I never know) was disappointing.  My table was so close to that of the group next to me that I had to struggle not to eavesdrop, which is a challenge for me.  Also, the noise was ear-splitting.  . . I gave it another try, and lo and behold it was much improved.  Last night was my third meal and I am smitten with the food, not to mention the adorable waiters.  The noise level is also vastly improved.  In terms of food, I stuck to two of my favorite French comfort dishes...a lovely frisee salad and steak frites.  My steak was just slightly too salty, but I devoured everything they put in front of me.  Delicious wine (a blend of three California reds that was delectable) and a warm, inviting atmosphere make this restaurant high on my list of favorites.  And to think I almost wrote it off after the first visit.  That'll teach me.
