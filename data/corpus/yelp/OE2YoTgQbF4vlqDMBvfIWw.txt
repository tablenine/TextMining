I'm probably a little biased when writing this review as I recall I was uber hungry coming here and we were lucky to be seated for fast for a Friday night for a party of 5.. . Between the 5 of us, we had Basil Chicken, Pork Chops, Grilled Chicken, Sauteed Pork with Pancakes, and Beef Cubes.  The salad was ok.  The main dishes were very good BUT I recall tasting a bit of MSG.. . Because some of us didn't have cash and requested separate checks the waitress was a little bit aggravated with it, but I was hungry and wanted to get to the ordering so I simply volunteered to put it on my card.  When my dish came I blurted to a friend who was asking which dish I ordered because of pancakes and I mumbled 23 or some number on the menu.  The waitress quickly asked to confirm if it was indeed what I ordered.  So basically the staff is not the most friendly, but they try to be certain everything is right and orderly.
