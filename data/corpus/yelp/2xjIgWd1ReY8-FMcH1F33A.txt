Delicious, fresh food. The tempura vegetables, excellent. The South Carolina Peach with proscuitto, blue cheese and honey, mouth watering!! The fresh baked cookies...they really are fresh baked and yummy! The service was great as well. . We had several small plates and it was very filing. The atmosphere is like a big warehouse. However, the noise level was fairly low. This place would be great early or late.
