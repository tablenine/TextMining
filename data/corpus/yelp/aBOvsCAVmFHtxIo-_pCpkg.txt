Dave C: "Hey Sarah, I have giftcards to this awesome vegetarian place, so we are going.". Me: "Vegetarian?? I don't like soy chicken or soy cheese....ever since that one vegan place I can't do it ha". Dave C: "Trust me this place is really good and you get Â a lot food too for what you pay and it is all healthy! And come on I have giftcards!". . So we went and I am more than ecstatic to report that this place has VERY VERY good vegetarian!!! I love meat, and always will, no doubt about it, but the food we had here made me realize how good vegetarian food can be!. . We shared an order of their sweetheart/sweet potato fries which came with this tasty chipotle ranch sauce and I got the Grillin' Chickin' Sandwich with chickin', avocado, lettuce, tomato, red onion, cilantro pesto, and chipotle ranch all on wheat roll. Sounds pretty good, eh?? And for fake chicken I would definitely eat this again on any day!!! I couldn't get enough of the cilantro pesto taste and everything was so fresh!!! My side of coleslaw could have had a little more seasoning on it though....but the sandwich more than made up for that! Dave C got the Carne Asada which was a grilled veggie steak with mexican spices and vegan mayo and he finished his up faster than mine!! He upgraded his side to kale, and you get much more kale for your buck than coleslaw, so a little fyi there.. . Overall, this place give vegetarian food a good name. So meat eaters, take a break and try this place!!!
