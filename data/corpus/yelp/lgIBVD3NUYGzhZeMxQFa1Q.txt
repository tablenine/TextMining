Waiting for a Kogi Taco from the taco trucks is an adventure that you must experience at least once, just to see the hype.  The great part about waiting is that if you grab a few friends, you can definitely make it a fun outing.  The trucks have everything, from the different tacos, quesediallas, tortas, fries, and chips.  It even has the special of the week.  . . The tacos are absolutely my favorite.  In fact, it would be my last meal on Earth.  The pork is always a must for me just because I like the spicy kick that it has.  The flavors and the slaw just packs so much flavor (damn my mouth is watering right now).  Their BlackJack quesedilla is one of my favorites as well.  Cheese, kimchi, and pork with their verde sauce makes it way better than their regular quesedilla.  . . Usually I head out for Kogi when it is in Gardena or around Venice since I'm around a lot of weekends.  The wait at Venice isn't bad at all but when it is in Gardena... oh man expect to wait up to an hour.  Sometimes they come by at lunch too but I never have enough time for that since I only get 1 hr for lunch.  Boo.. . Definitely just try it once... some feel it is too over hyped and it is just Korean BBQ in tortilla, but to me it is more than that.  There have been a lot of imitators and I still think none can do it as well as Kogi.  Plus, gotta give props to the truck that started the whole craze of mobile food scene in LA!
