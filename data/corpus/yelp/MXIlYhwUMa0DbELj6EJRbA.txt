Mojitos here are top notch, and really, what is more important in life than a top notch mojito?  (They're on special for $5 a pop on Wednesday nights!)  There's a wide variety of delicious Latin American choices here, and you can eat either expensive or cheap, depending on your last paycheck.  The brisket tacos are a good choice, and who doesn't love a heaping bowl of guacamole for their chips?  This is a great place to sit outside and get real tipsy with good friends when the weather is nice.
