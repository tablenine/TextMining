Babs, a great little spot for people to gather! I had lunch here on Monday with some friends and really enjoyed it. Bab's is located in a great spot in Midtown right next to the 805 building. The interior has a great urban feel to it that gives you a sense of relaxation the minute you walk in. The people are very friendly and the service was excellent. I had a BBQ-pork wrap that was amazing! And they also serve sweet potato fries that are very interesting. I recommend trying any of the specials as most of the foods are prepared fresh for the day. Â All in all, I liked the place and would certainly go back.
