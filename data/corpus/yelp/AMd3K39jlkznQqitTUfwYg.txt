My dearest porkchop,. . I've loved you ever since I was little.  We practically grew up together and I can hardly remember when we've been apart for any extended period of time.  It seemed like I spent every moment when we were together savoring you, and dreaming about you when we weren't.. . Remember the time when I was 5 and I wouldn't eat because you weren't there? . . Oooh, or the time I had my braces tightened?  My teeth were sooo sore, but I still had to have you.. . I'll never forget that one time I woke up with you cradled in my arms.  I don't remember what we did, but there was a huge mess in my bed and I had to wash the sheets. Twice.. . Ha ha, ha ha, ha.  Oh, the memories.  Sigh.. . But, alas, I recently realized that it's just not healthy for us to be together at so many meals and eventually I'm just going to be hurt.  More importantly, I know what is best for me going forward and I have to go.. . If you want to find me, look for me at Native Foods.  Their "Soy Amigo", which is a vegan taco salad with salad greens, cabbage, soy taco meat, salsa, tortilla chip croutons, corn, cilantro, green onion garnish and creamy chipotle dressing ($7.95) is mmmm, "soy" good, especially with an avocado ($1.25).  . . I also love their "Save the Chicken" Wings.  Soy chicken, battered and fried with Ranch on the side.  ($6.95)  Whatever did I see in you that this new relationship could not give me--other than lower cholesterol and a few more years of a healthy life?. . So sorry, my dearest.  I will miss your tenderness, but I will never forget you.  Maybe we'll get together once in while at lunch or an occasional dinner.. . Love,. -EJ
