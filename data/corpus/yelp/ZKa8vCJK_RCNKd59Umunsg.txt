We had noted recent reviews commenting on poor service, but upon walking by decided to eat at Fraiche anyway and we were glad we did. The service was fine and the food was excellent. I ordered a risotto - it was creamy, delicious. Our table shared two salads - the burrata and speck was fantastic, don't fail to order it if it's on the menu - and the farro was very tasty. It isn't cheap, nonetheless the four of us were unanimously pleased with our dinner.
