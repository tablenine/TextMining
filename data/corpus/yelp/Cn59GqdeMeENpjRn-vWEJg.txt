Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
There is a concept in psychology known as 'social proof'.  It means that people in unfamiliar situations assume others know more than them, and thus imitate the actions of strangers.  In short, herd behavior.. . It is social proof that gets people to join cults, wait in line at 2 AM in the Wal-Mart parking lot for Black Friday, or make married men suddenly irresistible to women.. . This is why I usually avoid popular restaurants in Los Angeles.  If it's mobbed, it's usually because it's filled with people who don't know any better.  The same forces that compel 900 people to suck down poison Kool Aid in Jonestown* are also at work in the lines at Pinks or the lobby of Bucca di Beppo.. . Not that Mozza is even in the same class as those aforementioned establishments.  This place isn't bad!  The pizza has killer crust--although it can be so thin it may be a little flavorless depending on what kind you get.  I'll have to try a few different types of pizza before I give it an extra star.. . (* Ok it was actually Flavor-Aid, and not everyone drank it.  They gunned down the rest of 'em)
