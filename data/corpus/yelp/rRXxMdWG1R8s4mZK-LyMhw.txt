Love this place.  good munchies (fries.  I love fries. these were great), good beers of all kinds, nice bartenders, and a decent amount of seating.  . . Haven't tried their sausages myself, but the bf tells me they're good.  I'm a little disappointed by the fact that wurstkuche has been taken over by hipsters.  was cooler when it was less crowded.
