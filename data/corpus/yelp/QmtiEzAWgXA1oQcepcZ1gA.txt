I had read a bit about Sushi Toro before trying for the first time - I knew fellow yelpers raved about the place and I also learned that Chicago Magazine ranked it as the best sushi in 2007.  But, oh my, is this place phenomenal.  Wow!  Wow!!  Wow!!!. . The fish is fresh and served in healthy quantities.  The service is great, very genuine.  Ask for suggestions, there're rolls not on the menu.  . . The only drawback, the place is tiny and a bit cramped.  Expect a bit of a wait, and don't go with a group.  But, do go!
