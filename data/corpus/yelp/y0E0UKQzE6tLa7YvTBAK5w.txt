Would love to love this neighborhood place, but will not go back after having my heart broken too many times.  My husband and I have stopped in on not-very-crowded weekend afternoons and sat at the bar, counting on unobtrusive, yet efficient bar service.  As good as the wine, beer and food menus appear on first glance, the service and execution is consistently disappointing. . Most recently, we ordered a cheese plate accompanied by dried fruit, bread and pistachios.  The meager slices of cheeses were accompanied by a handful of chewy, stale pistachios and rock hard slices of baguette.  We explained this to our server, who shrugged and walked away.  No "sorry about that", no "I'll look into it", no "can I bring you something else". He turned on his heels and just gave us a look that said "you must be crazy or dumb to think nuts or bread could ever go stale".  If you leave it out long enough, it goes stale, my friend, it goes very very stale.  . . Our 2 other experiences were similar, with the haughty, abrasive attitude and mediocre food crushing any bit of charm offered by the space, the wine/beer list or the menu concept.
