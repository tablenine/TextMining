This restaurant has to have the best Mexican food in Chicago...very authentic and not greasy.  The wait for a table can be pretty long sometimes, and there is usually a wait no matter what day it is.  However, the hostess usually overestimates so the wait may not be as daunting as it seems.  And you can always head over to the bar area to grab some margaritas and munch on some tortilla chips while you're waiting for your table.
