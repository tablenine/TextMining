Restaurant: Soul Vegetarian 2
Category: Vegetarian
I love this restaurant and the people who work there. I haven't tasted everything menu, because I am addicted to getting the county fried steak (which is actually kalebone, their gluten based vegetarian . meat") with mac and cheese and collards. . . I have also had the jerusalem rice dish, which is fabulous. . . The ginger drink is very strong, but good. Be prepared! . . Split pea soup also good, but very garlic-y. Make sure your evening company eats some too so they don't notice your breath later in the night. . . They have an "egg"salad sandwich and a brunch that I have always wanted to taste, but haven't gotten around to it yet. . . I really like the people who work there, too. They make me feel very comfortable whenever I go in.
