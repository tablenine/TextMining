I would love to actually review the food at this place, since it was so highly regarded by most of the yelpers, but alas it was not to be so.  I went there last week  with a friend.  My friend actually worked at the downtown location, so he could not stop raving about the food.  We sat at our table for 10 minutes without any attention from the waitstaff.  I saw one server on a cell phone. I saw another one standing around looking bored, and I saw another server, actually working.  We sat, hungry and thirsty for 10 minutes.  Then we got up and went next door to Andie's, where we were attended to promptly.  . . Such a shame when service costs a restaurant its reputation and REVENUE.  . . I'll only go back if I'm on a diet or want to be ignored.
