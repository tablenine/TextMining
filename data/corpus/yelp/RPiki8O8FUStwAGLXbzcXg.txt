I was last at The Little Door a mere two weeks ago and already  I'm writing with another 5 star review.  The second date was somehow even better than the first.  I think it's fair to say I'm infatuated.. . Shared the "mezze" appetizer which I raved about previously -- mediterranean/middle eastern assortment -- and had the RIB-EYE for my main course.  It was exceptional.  I'm usually more of a filet mignon person - and indeed, this ribeye was a little fattier than I am used to - but it was perfect.  The crust and seasoning were mouth-watering.  No smothering sauce to detract from the steak's intrinsic deliciousness.  Cooked perfectly, expertly salted, and easily the best non filet mignon steak I have ever had.  (Which may be surprising at a French restaurant - but trust me.  It's great).  It comes sliced by the way.  Not sure what the rationale is, but I don't care because it was a 5 star piece of meat.. . If you are a chocolate lover, for dessert you must get the chocolate pot.  It was decadent.  A little thicker than a mousse, but not really a pudding either.  Whatever it was, it was amazing.  I want another one right now.  Garnished with berries.  Aagggh.  Had the chocolate molten cake last time, but this was significantly better.. . Oh, and our charming waiter brought us out complimentary mint moroccan tea with dessert which apparently they make in house.  It was delicious.  And if you read my reviews regularly you know I LOVE TEA.  so, that was a nice touch.. . Add two fabulous glasses of some smokey pinot noir I can't remember (and didn't write down, like an idiot) and I am off to bed very happy indeed.. . Watch out Little Door, date three is already being planned.  This could get serious.
