Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
after all the hype about geisha house, all i have to say is: surely you jest. no really, are you kidding me? i don't mind paying for GOOD food - i don't mind 80 dollar steaks or 20 dollar rolls whatever, i love to try new things and i go into the place with the mindset that i will be paying through the nose. . . the problem with geisha house is the food was only decent. exorbitant prices for average food does not a happy helen make. and seriously? the sauce you're going to give me is sriracha? thanks, i'll pass. . . atmosphere is okay. there are comparable places with better food. if you're only coming here for drinks, then by all means. (which is why it's 3 instead of 2 stars) sake is excellent, but expect to pay hollywood prices for them.
