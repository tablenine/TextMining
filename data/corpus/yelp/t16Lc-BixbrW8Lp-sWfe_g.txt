I went here this evening with my dad.  I never realized how close this was to me!  Great burgers and the onion rings are a must.  The fries though are a failed attempt to be different.  I had the "Manly Burger" and it was pretty tastey, they use thick bacon and it happens to get stuck in your teeth and the don't provide toothpicks... bummer.. . I would give this place a 5 stars if it wasn't quite as expensive.. . Go here now.
