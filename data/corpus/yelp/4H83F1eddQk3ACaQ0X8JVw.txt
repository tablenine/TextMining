This review is for Craft Bar, which is where my good friend and I had dinner last Saturday.  For the most part, everything was excellent, from service to the food, I had a great time.. . We really liked the hush puppies and definitely sampled much of the menu.. . While this place was a great time and had great food, it is a place you say you went to.  It doesn't come across as a place that I would visit frequently.
