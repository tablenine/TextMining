Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Hide (Hee-day) is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Los Angeles right now. . . The service was great - 5 stars. We sat at the sushi bar and the chef was very entertaining and friendly. He had been teasing me and my boyfriend and said, "I make sushi... and trouble." Made me laugh. . I had heard that there is sometimes quite a wait, but I did not have to wait at all on a Friday night. The sushi was very yummy - I highly recommend the Monkfish Liver. I know, it sounds "gross," but it is very flavorful and savory - not to mention I have yet to see this item anywhere else. I wouldn't call the sushi cheap, nor would I call it expensive. It's right around average. . . Take note: parking can be very difficult in that area and they only take cash. They do have an atm inside the establishment, but who knows what the service fee is.
