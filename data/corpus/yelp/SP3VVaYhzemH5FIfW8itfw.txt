Not sure about you, but shopping on a Sunday afternoon makes me hungry. Considering I skipped lunch, I am extremely hungry and it kind of takes from my concentration. My vegan lioness is very excited to introduce me to this place, Real Food Daily.. . The ambiance is welcoming, with the brown and blue through out against the white walls, adorned by abstract expressionist art. Skylights add, along with the sun setting through the storefront windows. As the blonde hostess, with killer bangs, seats us, I spot KCRW host, Nic Harcourt. Yeah, I got a little star struck.. . Our small table towards the back gives me a great view of the crowd. A lesbian in a pink jumpsuit sits closely to a girl finishing ice cream (most likely soy ice cream). Behind me is a guy who can't stop playing with his Blackberry and introducing himself to people. Next to the window is a couple, both with Â sleeve tattoos. Closer to the front are waiters on break, talking about the day. Kristen B. and I are just glad to be sitting. Being the economic saviors of the day, we deserve a nice, well rounded meal where no animals are harmed.. . For our appetizer, we order the nachos, which are SOO FUCKING GOOD! Black beans, cheese-like stuff, sour cream-like stuff... it was big enough for three, really. I washed it down with a huge glass of soy milk. For my meal, I ordered the Bella sandwich, with a portabella mushroom, pesto sauce, and peppers. The bread truly made this. Sounds corny, but it's rare when you can actually focus on so many flavors at once.. . Our server was also very helpful and knowledgeable about the foods. Lucky for me, there is a glossary on the back of the menu. I'm looking forward to returning. There's nothing better than a place where you can get healthy food and still stay true to your principles; especially if that principle is eating delicious food.
