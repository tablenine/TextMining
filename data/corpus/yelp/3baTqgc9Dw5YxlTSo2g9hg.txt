Moments like these, writing review #1170, I think of my own mortality and the insignificance of existence.  There are just so many of us here on earth, and when we die, what is the best we can hope for? A flat, faux-marble monument that will be crowbarred up in a 100 years, at most?  Eternal repose in a converted landfill?  Our lives are meaningless.  There are just too many of us to count.  . . Which brings me back to the line at Porto's.  A customer at Porto's who is not picking up a preordered cake will have the feeling of a steer in an industrial feedlot, sweaty sides rammed up against the sides of other sweaty steers, competing for light and air.  The staff at Porto's has gotten a lot better in the last few years about abandoning the deli-counter-take-a-number model that tortures and prematurely ages food lovers from here to Bay Cities.  Still, it takes FOREVER to get what you need here.  And as you wait, you will be surrounded by fat people who don't smile.  I dare you to try it.  Try smiling at one of the customers.  Four out of five times a sad, sad individual will respond to your smile with the vacant stare of industrial beef.. . This has nothing to do with the fine family and staff at Porto's, who I accuse of nothing but making a superior product and selling it at a very low price.  One word: REFUGIADO.  Two dozen.  That is the only reason I am here.. . They're opening up shop in high-class Downey soon.  I grew up in Huntington Park and let me warn you: those Downey police officers will kick your ass for anything.  So be careful out there, folks.
