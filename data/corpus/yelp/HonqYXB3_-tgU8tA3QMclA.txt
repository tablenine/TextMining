Thoroughly impressed by this West Loop gem!  My meal consisted of:. . - bbq pork belly. - rack of lamb. - childhood favorite dessert. . All of my dishes were well presented and tasted amazing.  The atmosphere is swanky but the service is casual, which I appreciated.  Great place for a business dinner or a first date.   . . I look forward to coming back.
