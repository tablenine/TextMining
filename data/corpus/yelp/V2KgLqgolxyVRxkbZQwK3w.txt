Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
So this was my first k-town bbq experience...pretty interesting I would say.  It was a friend's bday dinner shindigg and she chose kbbq.  This place is a meatlovers dream!. . Manna seems a little odd at first because parts of the restaurant is outdoors and like some other reviews say..smoking is allowed but I dont think that was a problem last night. $16.99 for all you can eat with the traditional small plates that comes with the bbq (kimchi, veggies, steamed egg, rice, salad...etc) . So the server comes to your table with lots and lots of meat ...beef, chicken, pork...whatevs and then the cooking begins!  . . i couldnt eat much...i was full by the time i got to my 3 serving of meat and by then my stomach start to hurt :( but anyways...food was pretty good and i love kbbq for the fact that its a total socializing/cooking experience... i think the only downside would be service being a tad bit rude.. . This place is great for large groups....especially if you're planning on celebrating a birthday.  If you bring in a cake, they'll bring it out with this funky techno bday song (which is so embarassing) and they'll also give you a bottle of champagne...or rather they'll drench you in champagne.  This poor girl last night got soaked but it was quite funny.. . Be prepared to leave this place smelling like the person next to you.
