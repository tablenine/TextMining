We love the Fried squash blossoms with ricotta, Bianca with fontina, mozzarella, sottocenere &amp; sage Pizza, and Fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions Pizza. Service is good. Dining room and bar area are pretty small. Reservations are definitely required, or you'll be waiting a very long time on the curb. Wish they would open up other locations. We usually make reservations for off hours, like Saturday or Sunday around 2pm.
