My god a macaroon ice cream sandwich. I felt like Homer Simpson when i saw it, and for a hot sunny afternoon walking around Melrose it was well deserved. As a side dish i also got the Carrot Cake, and just sat in the air conditioned store for a minute to enjoy the treats. . . I ate about a quarter of the carrot cake and took the rest home for a dinner dessert. Which was still great.
