Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This is Mediterranean French fusion place.  The restaurant literally hides behind a rustic wooden door.  I've been to the Little Door a couple times. The food was very good. I recommend the pistachio new zealand red snapper or the royal lamb stew. The ambiance is beautiful, we choose a table inside near the fire place, the patio is beautiful but gets loud and the wine bar fills up.  . . Behind the little door is a replica of a hideaway on the Riviera, the romantic courtyard, under a retractable roof, featuring a fountain and candles flickering in the breeze, makes you feel you have escaped on vacation somewhere near Nice.  Overall, I think the ambiance is better than the food.
