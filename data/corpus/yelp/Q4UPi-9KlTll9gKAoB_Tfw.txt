Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
The freshest cafe food around. Their original and creative dishes come at unassuming prices for the high quality ingredients they use. Funky decor and eclectic and friendly staff makes this a weekly favorite. They excel in everything breakfast, but I also love their Turkey Burger for lunch and their Coca-Cola Glazed Salmon for dinner.
