We went during the week pretty early for the prefix menu.  It was really nice b/c it's anything on the menu! . . Sadly,  we weren't blown away...and the topper was that service was a bit slow even though we were the only people there. When we asked to open our 2nd bottle of wine the waiter said..."let me check- there might not be enough time." We didn't enjoy getting kicked out of the restaurant!! . . Winners: . Duck risotto!! SO good! The girls I was with got the dates and the fritters which were both good but not as good as the risotto. . . The desserts were also great! We got a peach crumble, blondie and ice cream and one of the bread puddings. All great. . . The entrees were good but not amazing.  A plus is that there are HUGE portions so it was very easy to share/sample each others which was nice. . . My party's overall conclusion is that we wouldn't pay full price for it...but BYOB is great and the prefix was a pretty good deal.
