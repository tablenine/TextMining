My friend Lisa and I had lunch here today.  The place is happening - I know it's a cheesy word but it fits.  It's a great Downtown LA place to see and be seen but not in a pretentious, sort of typical LA way.  The people who work there are good looking (and so are the customers) to say the least but everyone was so warm, friendly and helpful.  We felt like we were having lunch in NYC.  A great place to have lunch - we both said we felt like we weren't in Downtown LA.. . For lunch we shared the Fettucine Belmondo (House made pasta, cherry tomatoes, garlic, arugula, extra virgin olive oil and Reggiano parmesan), the Roasted Tomato soup and Chicken Milanese (thinly pounded, breaded, pan sauteed with arugula and checca).  The food was great - perfectly seasoned and just tasted wonderfully.  However the soup was very thick and reminded my friend and I of tomato sauce.  I generally like to have my tomato soup to be of a lighter consistency but still the flavor was good.  It was a lot of food for the price but we didn't feel overly stuffed after lunch.  Also they have a great little bakery and pre-made food that you can get on the go.  Oh I forgot - we had a brownie for a little treat and it was big enough to split between two people - so so yum yum.. . I've never been here for dinner but if the lunch crowd is any indication, it's a good bet to come and enjoy.  It's definitely worth it to make the trip down to check this spot out.
