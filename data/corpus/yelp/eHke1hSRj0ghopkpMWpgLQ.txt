Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
this location is very small and i can imagine it being super busy during peak hours. my prissy friends and i went right when it opened so we were seated immediately. we ordered 2lbs of crawfish, a dungeness crab, one basket of fried shrimp, and another basket of cajun fries. everything other than the crawfish tasted yummy, though the ambience perhaps did not fit the bill for everyone in our party. and to make matters worse, one of my friends splattered sha-bang sauce on our other friend during her zealousness to get to the crawfish tail. hahhahahaha...no, i mean, dang, sorry you have sauce splattered on you. and funky garlic fingers is not sexy for everyone. perhaps i picked the wrong location for our meet up.. . but ahhhh, boiling crab. how you've disappointed me in another way!! when i heard the word frozen crawfish, i SHOULD not have ordered it! even being smothered in the whole sha-bang sauce did not cover up the funk that frozen seafood has. they did warn us though, so it was my fault for ordering it. no wait, it's your fault boiling crab for letting me order it!. . i had a 5 star experience at the garden grove location and had a 3 star experience here. i'm quite sure these stars had to do with many factors. i guess that means i'll have to go back and give this place another try before i seal these 3 stars in yelpie cement.
