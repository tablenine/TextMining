Well, I finally decided to try this place, and it is actually really good!  Some of the other new places reviewed recently haven't lived up to the hype, but I really liked this place.  The wait was alittle long, and since I had not eaten anything, that was a little rough but I definately would recommend the wonderful burgers.  I ordered the Euro which had swiss cheeze, mushrooms and mayo and mustard-wonderful!  I also ordered a root beer, and the onion rings.  These were different, they had a crispy breading, and were not greasy like the carnival fare.  Next time I plan on trying the chili and the cowboy burger!
