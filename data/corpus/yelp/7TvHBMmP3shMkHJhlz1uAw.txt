My lovely boyfriend took me to Yamashiro for my golden birthday last week.  As we traveled up the hillside to the restaurant, I was first taken away by the beautiful view of the city lights and then by the actual structure of the the restaurant itself.  Once inside, we were seated next to the koi pond in a room where the ceiling can be opened or closed depending on the temp outside.  Since it was a nice evening, the top was open as we enjoyed our dirty martinis and their delicious lump crab and heirloom melon salad.  The salad had the perfect mix of savory and sweet with the parmesan crisps, white soy dressing and tender melon morsels.  ON a side note, I just learned that white soy is made by roasting the soy beans instead of the grain..unlike black soy where the grain is roasted.  Anyhoot, for dinner I had the blacked cod dish; a perfectly cooked, mildly flavored fish sitting on a cloud of wasabi mashed potatoes.  YUM!  After din din I was surprised by a festive s'more birthday treat, which my beau and I demolished promptly.  To cap off the evening, we shared the Jun 'mai chilled sake and giggled our way outside to enjoy the view as we waited for our cabbie.  Definitely a spot worth checkin out!
