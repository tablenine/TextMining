I have been to the Burbank store 4 times now and I have tried a variety of sandwich's and bakery items.  I know the prices are good but the taste of the food I tried was of low quality.  The meat in the sandwiches was chewy and dry plus the bakery good were very greasy.  I don't understand why this place is popular.  Just my opinion.
