I was extremely satisfied after my first tasting at Toro in Lincoln Park and my expectations were exceeded!  It was really crowded when we arrived and they were a little slow to serve us, but besides that the food was AWESOME!  You don't get that 'not so fresh' worry you get at some of the other smaller sushi hole in the wall spots in Chicago.  The fish is really fresh and the price is perfecto.  We loved the twin tower roll (spicy tuna with asparagus).  Their Maki list is one of the longest I've seen and I cannot wait to go back and try some new stuff!
