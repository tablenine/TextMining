Wow, usually I don't differ with yelpers this much.... . to me, Lola's only positive is their girly drinks. If you want good food, an attractive interior, to be able to hear your companions without yelling (and I tend to like loud places!), or to know the prices of your drinks before you order them, this is not for you.. . Pros:. -Girly drinks. Lots of different kinds of martinis (though the menu DOESN'T LIST THE PRICES, which are different for different drinks--one of my pet peeves and a warning sign of a place waiting to rip you off).. -Nice wait staff.. . Cons:. -Shabby interior that they attempt to hide by turning the lights down so low that at our corner table I instinctively reached for a flashlight in my pocket to see the menu. I eat out a LOT, and this was the darkest I've seen at a dinner place for quite a while.. -Loudloudloud once the place is full. They should really put up some sound damping--it seems like they're at least attempting to be classy, and having to yell across a small table to be heard over dinner ruins whatever class there was.. -Food is standard--definitely not something to go out of your way for, and WAY overpriced for the quality. If you pay $25 for a small halibut steak and around $9-15 for an appetizer, they'd better be at least pretty good instead of merely standard.. -Unnecessary weirdness, like the herb-encrusted butter slice that you're evidently supposed to stab with the skinny bread sticks they give you. I'm all down with innovations, but not with ridiculous steps backwards.. . Overall, I would never suggest going back there, and if a friend of mine suggested going there I'd fight it. If I was dragged back here against my will, I'd stay away from the overpriced food, focus on drinks and ask the prices for things beforehand.
