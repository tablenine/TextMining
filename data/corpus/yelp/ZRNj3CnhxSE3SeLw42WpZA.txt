Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I've been going here for YEARS.  Taking friends from out of town to late 1 AM dinners after a night out doing God-knows-what.  Anyways, one finds many of these late night places just because the joint is open for business when everyone else is at home getting a good nights sleep.  Not Canters.  The fact that it's open 24-7 is a huge bonus for a restaurant that I would go to all the time anyways.. . Try the 7-grain pancakes.  Not what you'd expect to order at a deli - but they're AMAZING.
