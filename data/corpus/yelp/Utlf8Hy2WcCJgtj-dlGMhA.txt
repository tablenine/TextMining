One of my favorite places to eat in the city. You can try a whole bunch of tasty treats and walk away without your wallet smoldering.. . Anything on the menu with mushrooms in it will be great. One of my favorite things is the ceviche de hongitos. I would have totally passed that one up if it wasn't for a friend that swore it was amazing. He was totally right.. . Duck mole... mahi and chorizo pinchos... empanadas.... you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Another plus -- the presentations are beautiful.. . Drinks are affordable and tasty as well -- $24 for a pitcher of awesome sangria, I think it's only $4 more for a pitcher caipirhinas.. . Great atmosphere for a casual night out! Make reservations though, because every time I've gone the place has been decently busy.. . I heard they do brunch but I've yet to try it.... looking forward to it though.
