I am a forgiving customer. I'm okay with basic service as long as my needs are met. . . The food was good. Our server was not. He was terrible in the "I don't give a rats arse about you" kind of way. He kept ignoring my friend and myself for no reason, mumbled everything with no eye contact and kinda just threw the check on the table when we were done. . . It became comical it was so bad by the end. I even thought maybe we were on some kind of hidden-camera show. Not the case (unless it's being aired abroad).. . This was a few months ago and since it was my first experience here in a long time, I will give it one more try, but honestly, I was so unenthralled by everything else here after such awful service, I don't think even a second visit will even help.
