Category: Vietnamese
It's a great place to eat, especially for visiting out of towners.... less so about the food and more about the "fun factor."  Joy Yee does have a touch of the schitz, with so many item choices and Asian food types available, but fortunately they do a decent job with all of them (at least of what I had).  . . We had some sort combo with Korean glass noodles and tofu soup, which was nice on a cold rainy day.  There was also a chicken/shitake mushroom dish with rice, and a beef/ginger/mushroom rice dish, both served in a hollowed-out bamboo log.  Finally, some Korean short ribs, which were just ok... missing that grilled-over-charcoal essence.  I guess I've been spoiled.. . It was pretty busy, and the servers seemed a little... spacey.   I think I had a passionfruit frozen something or rather, and I think I liked it a lot.. . And in re: credit card theft... *I* didn't have my credit card used to buy airplane tickets.  CC numbers can be stolen... and used... anytime, anywhere.  False logic is dangerous.
