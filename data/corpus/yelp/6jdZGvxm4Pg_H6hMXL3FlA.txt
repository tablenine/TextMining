All three stars are for the bakery! I've come here countless late nights to pick up some yummy pastries and cookies for late night munching and next day chowdowns :) If you have 2-3 people, I HIGHLY recommend buying their 6" cheesecake! One of the best! Unfortunately, I don't really care for the food in the restaurant.... I've been for breakfast + dinner, and have always left disappointed. Luckily they have that bakery, which rocks! :)
