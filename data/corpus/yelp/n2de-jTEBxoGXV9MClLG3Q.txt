I love this place, and not just because it's cheap, though it's really really affordable! I love to try everything and I was so excited to find a Thai place that doesn't just serve the standard pad thai and penang curry. In fact, I fucking hate pad thai, it's gross and overly sweet (though I've been told by a a Thai friend that it's not supposed to be sweet at all, maybe I've just had bad Americanized versions?). . . We split Thai sausages, sour catfish curry, and some other curry with blood and pork. Oh my God, the thai sausages are AMAZING. They are slightly spicy, curryish, delicious. My bad ass 9 month old was in love with them, tears streaming down her face from the heat and begging for more. The sour catfish curry looked uninteresting at first and I was a little sad that I ordered it because it was just broth, fish, some celery like veggie, and tomatoes, but it was DELICIOUS! It had the best flavor, I was practically drinking the broth up from the bowl! For such a light dish, it was extremely satisfying. The blood cake curry was the least interesting, I would probably not order it again, but it wasn't bad. It was just kinda muted compared to the POP of flavors from the sour catfish and the sausage. I can't wait to go back here, I want to try everything on the menu. Hot Doug's should sell Thai style sausages on a bun, they're amazing. ;)
