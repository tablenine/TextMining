Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Taste very delicious. Can always add more noodles till your belly pops. You will always feel satisfied and full after eating there. The only bad is that because it is a great place to eat, there's usually a long waiting line during peak hours. But so worth it.
