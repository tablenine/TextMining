First, great idea.. growing up we used to put left over Kim Chee and wrap tortilla around it and ate it for fun.. But, I was not smart enough to make it a business... WOW...taco truck (aka roach coach) serving Korean-Mexican fusion food.  So.. I went down to the Golden Gopher and had few beers waiting for this exciting new food adventure.  The line started to form before the truck got there and everyone in line was raving about how it's the best taco ever... So.. I waited and waited until it was finally my turn.  Ordered 4 tacos and a burrito... Korean spicy pork and Korean beef.. yummy... but, after the first bite...soon I found out that it's just a taco.   Don't get me wrong, it was good but it did not live up to the hype.  Maybe I needed some hot sauce.. BTW it was not offered..  anyway, I think it's awesome for someone way more creative then me to come up with his idea.. but at the end the food was just OK.. not great but OK..
