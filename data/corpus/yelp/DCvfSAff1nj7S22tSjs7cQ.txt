At Yamashiro, you're really renting real estate of table and chair and the ambiance.  Be prepared to spend all your money on so-so food and valet (and probably weak drinks) for an awesome evening of romantic views views of the sometimes unromantic LA.  i think lunch would be great too, especially to check out the Japanese garden. . the architecture makes you feel like you're eating at someone's house in Japan, if you were in a Hollywood movie maybe, much like Magic Castle next door takes you back to ancient times (not really).. . we skipped cocktails because none sounded all that interesting and we rather eat with the money.. . the three of us shared the following:. -shrimp and vegetable tempura. $14.  in little tokyo, the tempura would come with sushi and miso soup and rice and an entree. . -crispy chicken with rice cracker coating, apple-cabbage slaw, crispy potato ribbons. $13.  probably my favorite out of the 5 dishes. . -Hawaii Five-O spicy yellowtail, mango, macadamia nuts, toasted coconut, soy paper, kaiware.  $13.  cheesy name, tasty roll, expensive though. . -Crabby Pants softshell crab, grapefruit, pancetta, honey-mustard ginger sauce $17.  the grapefruit doesn't jive with anything else but once you peel that off, the rest of the roll is pretty good. . -Darth Vader tobiko caviar, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, black rice, spicy mayo. $15.  the caviar isn't the best i've ever tasted.   in fact, they had a strange after taste.  i rather eat salmon roe (the tiny orange ones) and these.  the dark roll fits its name but another cheesy roll name going on here.. . You don't come here with the intention of getting full - you'll go broke.  You come here for the views and a relaxing good time with good friends.  That's where the 4 stars come from. . .
