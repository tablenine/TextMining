I've only eaten here a handful of times, but have loved it each and every one.  The first time I was there, I had the Apple Jacks encrusted Talapia with green beans and red potatoes, soup and salad.  All of which was delicious.   And I'm not a seafood fan.  Other times, I've had breakfast (fresh veggie omelette... yum!) and they're chicken salad sandwich.
