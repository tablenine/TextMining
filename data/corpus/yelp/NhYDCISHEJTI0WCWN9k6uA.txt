I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but I didn't expect it to be so bad.. . I understand that the quality of food is usually inversely proportional to the scene and ambiance but the scale doesn't exist here.  Imagine supermarket sushi in a club and that is Geisha House.  The only thing that we enjoyed was the cowboy roll which is made with Kobe beef.   . . The bartenders, waiters, and wine list are the only reason for the two stars.  Go to Katsuya if you're in Hollywood and are looking for Sushi.
