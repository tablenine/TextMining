Alright maybe a 4.5. I don't know why I forgot to review it since I've been here so many times I'll give it a boost for the Thai Elvis and the fact their Thai tea uses half and half for the creamy part. Yeah, dude, that's how it's done.. . What prompted me to review the place was that no one mentioned one of my favorite items on the menu: the deep fried trout with mango fish sauce. Pad thai this, curry that, sure it's good, but this dish annihilates the Gordon's Fisherman. Trout fried till it's crispy then topped with a sweet and sour and salty fish sauce with chunks of slightly green tart mango. SO GOOD, my Mom says Vietnamese people also add green mango to their fish sauce, but it really adds a new dimension. Peanut sauce here is also notable and really makes their chicken satay.. . The food decent to great and it's affordable especially by Hollywood standards, it's bumped up in price a buck or two since they moved from their smaller location but not having to wait in a HUGE line is worth it IMO that and the $2 valet parking isn't that bad of a deal.. . Things that were mediocre: the soups, the tom yum and tom kah I've had better elsewhere but it's still good. Their pad thai is also good but sometimes I feel like it's overly gooey from the sweet sauce. Service isn't good but it's still a relatively authentic Asian restaurant, I normally don't go into these things expecting to notch service, you can flag down anyone you want to get a refill though and they move my plates. I am satisfied.
