Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
Who knew there was a 24 hour Mexican fast food restaurant in Atlanta?  After living in this city for eight years I went to Taco Cabana for the first time recently.  We ordered chicken cheese nachos and washed them down with grapefruit soda and it was pretty good.  Not knowing what to expect, I was shocked that this fast food Mexican restaurant had beer and drinks.  Although it was kind of a dump and we were harassed by a homeless man, I'm not against going back for a quick snack and drink on a Friday night.
