So, I took the wife out on a Friday night.  Fraiche is a place I'd heard about so thought I would give it a try.  I ordered the monkfish and the wife ordered flat iron steak.  We also had a foie gras and scallop as an appetizer.  The foie gras was superb although when is foie gras not superb?  My monkfish was nice and tender and there was a potato puree that was excellent.  The wife's flat iron steak with compound butter is just awesome.  Perfect medium rare made it very juicy and the compound butter just added so much flavor.  Also had the cheesecake with blueberry sorbet for dessert.  . Somewhat disappointing as it was  a very small portion and I thought way overpriced at $11.  I highly recommend this place.
