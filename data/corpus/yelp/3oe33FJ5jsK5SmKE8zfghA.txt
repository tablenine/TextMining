Restaurant: Taqueria Del Sol
Category: Tex-Mex
You call that a fish taco, Taqueria del Sol!?!??!. . I came here for a quick bite, and yes it's cheap, and yes it's fast, so I should have known what I was getting myself into.. . . But for the taste, they should lower it to $1.99 at least.. . I got the carnita which was halfway decent, and a fish taco that was terrible. Maybe it's because I picked off the jalapenos since I don't eat jalapenos... maybe they made the entire taco amazing and I just took the amazing off of it so it was my fault.... . No, I think it just sucked. It's basically just two fish sticks with some sauce in them. I would have liked a little more things in it.. maybe some veggies? I didn't ask if we could add these things, so maybe you can and I'm an idiot.. . It was hard for me to finish eating the fish taco. And that may have affected my judgment on the carnita taco but I still didn't think that was anything special either.. . And what the hell is up with the wait?! It made it seem like this place was delicious.... . This place is nothing special. I'd rather pay more and have enough for a second meal at Chipotle!
