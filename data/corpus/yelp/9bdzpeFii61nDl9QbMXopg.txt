Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
this place is GREAT for a date... normally, i would never recommend that anyone go on a date at a pizza place.  but since this is a nancy silverton and batali affair, you know its good.. . the salads are all good.  ive had about 5 different pizzas here, and i think the fave is the sausage and fennel.  but even as i say that, its not like "HOLY CRAP THIS IS SO AMAZING" pizza.  its just good.  so if you expect a mind blowing meal, its not going to happen.. . however, i LOVE the bone marrow here.  i order it at a lot of diff restaurants, but i would say for some reason its the best here.
