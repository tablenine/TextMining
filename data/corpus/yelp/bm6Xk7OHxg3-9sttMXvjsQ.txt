Great place to impress a date!  Amazing views.. . The food is not cheap, but the service is great.. . Steak - good.. . Hold off on the sushi... it's definitely not horrible, but with LA you have so many sushi options - this shouldn't be one of them.  Plus, when having sushi, it should be more of an intimate experience between you and the chef... you won't even see them here.
