Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
Since I've moved back to Chicago, Pick Me Up Caf√© has become a regular place for me to eat. I mainly come here after concerts or a night out on the weekends for "breakfast" as this place is open 24 hours on weekends and until 3AM during the week. I love their Hummus, the Vegan Mac &amp; Cheese is OK, and I will never get the Vegan chili cheese fries again. Their breakfast items are always very good and you can have breakfast at any time here. I do love this place [especially since it's open all of the time] and it's my #1 late night place to eat in Chicago.
