Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I don't know much about southern food, but I do love me some Roscoe's waffles. They have a hint of cinnamon and must use a ton of cream in the batter, because they're deliciously sinful. . . The chicken is okay, but I go for the waffles. Four stars for waffles!!
