Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Been coming here for a few years after a few friends turned me onto this hidden spot in Downtown. I am a wimp to spice still, and if you are too you shouldn't shy away, the ramen is delicious and it is a great place to eat with friends. Come hungry and treat yourself to some extra goodies in your soup.. . After, walk it off by exploring the bookstore across the way, and search for the 3rd floor entrance to Kyoto Grand's beautiful rooftop Japanese garden.
