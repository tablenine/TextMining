Umammmmmmmmmmmmmmi burger is mmm-mmmm, good.  Limited menu, meh atmosphere, but hey, when you're good at what you do, what more fluff do you need?  Delish burgers elicit mouth-watering dreams and the meat sweats - yes, I said it.  Heads up to guys that 1 burger is probably not quite enough, but 2 might be too much.  I suggest ordering an extra burger and splitting it, but that's just me and my bottomless stomach talking.  . . I will go back, oh yes, I will...
