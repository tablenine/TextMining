Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Interned on the Sony lot last year, and whenever the production company said "Tender Greens" for lunch I quietly, in my mind, celebrated. Why?. . The Tuna Nicoise.. . Yum. Delicious fresh tuna with a savory peppery crust. Roasted yukon gold potatoes. Tender greens (groan, I know). It always hit the spot. Enough protein that you weren't starving a few hours later, but light enough to chug through the last four hours of my internship.. . Good, good fuel. It's a pricey salad, but because it's so good (especially for a salad ... I'm not a big salad guy) I'm happy to spend the $$ on it. Unless, of course, the prod. company where you intern foots the bill. Always a bonus.. . If you're in Culver City and need a good (but busy) place for lunch ... go to Tender Greens.. . Oh, and they have a nice assortment of bottled sodas made with real can sugar. Love, love, love a soda made with real cane sugar.
