I've been eating at Bite regularly since I moved down the street in 2003.  Love the food, the BYOB, the price, the lack of pretension.  After reading through some of "hipster" comments in the reviews below, I'd like to add that (1) I am over 40 and not hip and (2) I have brought my dad and stepmom (over 70, not hip) to Bite.  I own not a single ironic T-shirt.  But the folks at Bite cook and serve great food, regardless of what they wear, so lighten up folks, and enjoy yourselves.
