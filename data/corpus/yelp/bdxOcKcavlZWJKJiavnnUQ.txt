Why the hell is the food at this place so expensive!? It doesn't make any sense! I've heard people rave about the fish 'n chips, the tuna melt and the burgers, but what if you don't want to eat those particular things? Anything else I've tried has been completely unimpressive. On this occasion I went late one night with a friend to sit and eat. . . We sat outside, the only downside being that the lighting was so dim we had a hard time reading our menus. I ordered the Tower of Power (turkey club sandwich) with salad instead of fries and my friend got a patty melt and a salad. With two drinks, tax and tip, the bill ran us about $40. . . The service leaves something to be desired as well. Â I like to give servers the benefit of the doubt so I'll just say I think she was having an off-night. She just seemed like she was having one of those days where you would rather be anywhere but at work. I understand, I work at Starbucks and there are days when I would rather be doing ANYTHING but slinging lattes. We asked for two sides of ranch that never showed up to our table but did on our bill, I asked for a water refill that never showed, simple stuff like that.. . I gave the place a 2 because its consistently unimpressive, service aside, and way too expensive for what it is.
