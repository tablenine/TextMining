HO CHIAK!  Which means, delicious, in a non-descript chinese dialect.   Hit me up if you knew what it meant without the translation.. . We ordered the tom yu chai, the House Special Chow Mein, the House Special fish -- half fried, half steamed, the beef with kailan, and the mapo tauhu.  I would've skipped the noodles, but everything else was super yum-o.  I think the check came out to a measly $100 for a group of 7.  And mind you, the fish we had was SUPER gimoungous and SUPER fresh.  The food here reminds me of the chinese joints in SE Asia -- a good, great thing.. . The folks here are teo chew from vietnam, I think, so it helps if you speak the language.  Service is friendly and fast.  Friendly, is NOT something you expect at a chinese joint.  So a plus for that.. . Would've given it 5 stars if the damned place wasn't an hour and half drive from the Westside.. . Get there before 6:30 -- the place is uber popular.
