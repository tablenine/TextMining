Restaurant: Bocado
Category: American (New)
Bocado had been on my "to go" list for quite some time, so I was excited to finally make it there for dinner.  Went with a party of 6 on a Wednesday night. . . I'd sum my experience there with an exaggerated shoulder shrug and an "eh."  . . the service was great, no issues there, but they seemed extremely eager to clear our plates and rush us out when we were done, and it was only about 9:30.  i know it was a wednesday night, but come on.  . . i sampled a couple of the specialty cocktails and they were good, but not horribly interesting, i'd take h&amp;f or top flr any day.  . . for eats i tried the artichoke salad, roasted brussels sprouts, mussels, crab fritters, and the veal cheek.   the 2 veg dishes were good, but nothing i'd go back again for.   the crab fritters were tasty but overpriced -- $10 or $12 for 3 two-bite patties served over a meager matchstick carrot salad and a generic spicy remoulade type sauce.  the mussels were the biggest disappointment -- totally bland.  one of the great joys of mussel eating is sopping the delicious broth up with bread at the end, and to be denied that pleasure... blasphemy.  other people at our table tried the steak and the flounder entrees, and they found the food similarly fine but uninspiring. on a positive note, there may have been one exception -- i stole a bite of the veal cheek from my table neighbor and it was actually quite tasty; it was smoky and tender and melted in your mouth.  i think it was the only dish that got rave reviews from anyone.. . so, while bocado was totally okay, there are too many restaurants in Atlanta with better food, drinks, prices and atmosphere for me to keep it on the "to go back" list.
