Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
MMMMMMMMM. . This place is "WOOHOO! As good as it gets!" because its freaking cheap ($1.50 - $2.00) per taco and is freaking good. That is all you need to know folks.. . It's a little hole in the wall, you order, you watch someone freshly fry your goods, wrap it in some tortillas and hand it straight off to you. Then you navigate your way towards the salsa bar and decide whether you want hot pineapple salsa, mild mango salsa, hot mango salsa, super yum guacamole, crema and cabbage. Basically, everything is delicious. ESPECIALLY when enjoyed with a $1.00 Reed's Ginger Beer.
