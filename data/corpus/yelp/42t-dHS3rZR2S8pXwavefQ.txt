Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
What can i say about cut....definitely a place to see celebrities... on that particular night, i happened to be dining in the presence of rob lowe and jerry bruckheimer. Â The steaks were indeed very impressive and the service as well was superb.. . The decor is very romantic yet feels almost outdated nowdays though.. . If you like wine, their sommelier is quite superb herself.. . Overall....a must try, you will not be disappointed..
