Trying too hard.. . If you don't have a seizure from the decor, you just might from the prices.  The food is good, but for $30, the Kung Pao chicken needs to be incredible.  There are plenty of restaurants down the street in Chinatown that serve better fusion cuisine for much less.. . The pierced and tattooed wait staff seem at odds with the surrounding South Loop neighborhood, but everyone is very nice and attentive.. . Overall, it is an enjoyable scene and we've even thrown around the idea of renting out a space for our friends.  The building is an old film storage house, so the back rooms are very private and block out much of the noise.  Also making for a relatively intimate dining experience with your date, if you request the "vault" rooms.
