Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
this place is a landmark more than anything else.  i was a bit surprised that they've expanded their locations even more within the few years that i hadn't stopped by to have some chicken here.. . the menu consists of pretty typical southern food that did not become familiar to me until i made my own visit down south.  for anybody who comes here for the first time, is there any good reason you would go to a place called Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles and NOT order chicken and waffles?. . don't even begin to compare their chicken with KFC or Church's because it's just not the same.  it's not the best i've ever had, but it's still pretty good.  nice and crispy on the outside, moist, tender, not too oily or greasy or heavy.  the waffles are just waffles, nothing gourmet about them, but not bad either.  however, their syrup does this weird upper layer skin thing if you let them sit for a bit.  nothing a good stirring won't remedy.  i happen to like their gravy too, because it's got good seasoning and chopped onions in there too.. . so my usual choice is 1/4 chicken with gravy and a waffle.  they've got the good louisiana hot sauce here too.. . don't walk into this place being all super critical about the subtle nuances of the food that aren't there.  it's just chicken and waffles in a cozy restaurant with sweet ladies to serve you.  since we live in LA, we need to take advantage of all these cool places like this restaurant, so if you haven't been here already, try it!
