So my girlfriend and I walked by this place on a Friday evening at about 6:30. We were pretty impressed with the atmosphere and thinking it was probably a nice place we walked in and were given a little sales pitch by the maitre'd. We asked if we could get in without a reservation and even though the place was basically empty they made a big deal about it - looking at their computer and pretending to shuffle things around to get us in. That should have been a clue to run away.. . In short - the food was boring and bland and the staff just seemed very amateur. The 'sommelier' was a young gal that was basically clueless about wine. In sort of reminded me of what the food must be like at a cheap Las Vegas buffet or on a cruise ship. The price is just ridiculous - $50 per person + drinks. . . Live and learn. I'd be surprised if they stay in business for more than a year.
