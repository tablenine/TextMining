Finally! Gourmet in Murray Hill.... . The beer on draft is sublime, and the bottles are vast and eclectic. The wine list is, surprisingly, equally impressive. But can we talk food?. . The burger -is- without a doubt amazing. New York Mag correctly assessed it as the best burger in the city, even beating out the Shake Shack. Rumor has it, this slender beef goodness is modeled after In-N-Out, a la Belgium. Gathered on a moist bun with onion, pickle and mayonnaise, it is decadent. The frites are fantastic, especially with the tartar sauce, and the light salad is tossed in a citrus dressing finishes off the plate.. . I see your pale Belgian brew, but I raise you one burger and frites. Checkmate.
