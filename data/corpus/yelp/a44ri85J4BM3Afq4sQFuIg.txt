Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I know Geisha House has been around forever, and while it's no longer the hot spot it used to be, the service/decor/food/experience is still solid.  We dropped in without reservations a bit after midnight on a Friday when most of the other restaurants around were no longer seating folks, so we were happy to head straight to the sushi bar for some food.. . Everyone was super-nice and friendly, and I still find the decor enjoyable - lots of red red red and neon pink sleekness.  We had some appetizers and a few funky rolls including the "Octopussy" - ha.  All were good, although obviously not traditional.  If you're looking for top authentic sushi, this is probably not the place for you, but if you want a fun, late night meal, Geisha House could be a good destination.
