Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I don't consider myself much of a scenester but Alcove is such a cute venue... perfect for casual meet-ups with your friends for drinks and dessert =) The desserts are to die for, my favorite thus far. THe only ting that is a hindrance is the street parking.  They also allow dogs in the outdoor area so that's a definite plus as well. The staff is nice and the price is worth the quality and service. I have not tried their food menu as of yet.
