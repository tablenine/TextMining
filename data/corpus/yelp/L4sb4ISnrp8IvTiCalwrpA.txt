Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
4 1/2 Stars. . Man is Johnnies good. The sandwiches are pricey and that is why this place isn't five stars for me but you certainly get large portions. We get it from time to time at my office for lunch and most of the time nobody eats the whole sandwich in one sitting. Most of the time I find pastrami a little dry for my liking when I get it from a deli but Johnnies pastrami is moist and I love the way it's shaved. Definitely recommend it to anyone in the Culver City area who hasn't tried it but it is a bit pricey and only takes cash.
