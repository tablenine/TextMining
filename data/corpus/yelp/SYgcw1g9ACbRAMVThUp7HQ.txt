I often wonder what I will think of this place sober, but it is GREAT after a late night partying in Wicker Park.  Totally cheap and yummy.  Probably not a wise idea to load down with nachos at 3am, but it never tasted so good.  I wish I could give it another star to thank all of the staff there for putting up with so many drunk people every weekend.  They deserve medals.
