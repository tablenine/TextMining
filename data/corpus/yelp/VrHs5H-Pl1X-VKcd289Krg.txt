Severely overrated.  The ride up the glass elevator, and the restaurant's 360 degree rotation and view of Atlanta are exciting, but not enough to justify spending $50 per person on dinner.. . - My steak was overcooked, tough, and dry.  . - The string beans were bland and insipid.. - The desserts were great.  I tried all of them, and my fave is the creme brulee.. . 5 stars for the desserts, impressive view of the city, and fun high-speed glass elevator ride to the top of the Westin.. 3 stars for the entrees and appetizers because of being bland and overcooked.. 1 star for the service of the arrogantly annoyed staff when you order desserts, drinks, and nothing else.  However the servers were very accommodating when I went the Sundial for the first time and unwittingly ordered an entree, side, drink, and dessert.. . I've had better steak at Outback and Longhorn.
