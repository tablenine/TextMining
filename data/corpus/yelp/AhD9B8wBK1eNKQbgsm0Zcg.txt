Since one of my weaknesses is the dreaded pastry, I LOVE this place. I would go there every day and get fat(ter) and happ(ier) on their baked goods if I lived nearby. Their sandwiches are good too. The only bummers are the lines and the eventual wait. Go there! Now! Before there are no more guava/cream cheese pastries! Banish the thought...
