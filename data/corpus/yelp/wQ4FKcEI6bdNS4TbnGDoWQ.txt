Portos is hands down, absolutely delicious!! I've tried everything from the desserts, pastries, potato balls, meat pies, sandwiches, salads, and drinks and I was not once disappointed!! . . I am also happy that they came out with bite size potato balls which is my absolute favorite item. Potato balls are fried mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground meat...very fulfilling and yummy! The best part is the prices are very reasonable. Now that I have moved back to the Bay Area, I make sure to make a stop by Portos when I'm down south and always bring some home. . . *On a side note, even the security people at Burbank airport love Portos...everytime I bring a box through they try to confiscate it! True story!*
