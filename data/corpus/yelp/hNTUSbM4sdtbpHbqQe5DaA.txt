Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
my wonder twin and i met up at pink's last night before our plan to see a little film about bob dylan ...my first time infact to the little stand with the big rep.. . as the line of patrons before me ordered dog after chilli/onion/bacon/pastrami and cheese covered dog, i realized this was a place one comes to die. and why should i be any different. a wise choice, as my dog sans chili, pastrami and onion included the best bacon i ever had.. . as my brain and body started to shut down like thousands upon thousands of angelenos before me in near 70 years, Â we surveyed william shatner and friends gazing down upon us from the back patio, the flourescent lit patrons inside ...and pink's perhaps the only chain binding us together for the evening.. . sleepy and slightly disoriented, we walked to golden apple...far too relaxed and unbelievably content to peruse Adrian Tomine's uncollected Works 1992-2004, the movie plans were abandoned, the evening still a success.
