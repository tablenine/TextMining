Restaurant: Panes Bread Cafe

Now that I have used up all of my Pompei Groupons (across the street) I can finally go to Panes more often.. . Low prices and great taste make this one of the best cafes in Lakeview. The "Spicy Philly" was like nothing I've had before. Roast beef, red peppers, onions, mushrooms, and a secret sauce. I also tried some of the tortilla salad and it was great.. . The interesting decor and cash-only aspect give this place a cozy feel.
