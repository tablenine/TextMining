Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
This bakery has a delicious Cuban sandwiches and a wide variety of breads, pastries, and desserts that is hard to find anywhere else. Portos is always teeming with people who come to enjoy the food as well as the coffee in the conjoined cafe.. . For the first-timer I would recommend the roasted pork sandwich and some croquettes. From the bakery, I would recommend the "Cheese Rolls" and the "Potato Ball.". . The only downsides are the hours and days they are open. 7pm is a bit early to close for me, since I have to drive out here from West LA, and they tend to be closed on some days around holidays. (which is understandable, but that's when I can really get out for some food!). . I usually combine Portos on a trip to the Brand Bookshop or Griffith Observatory.
