Best octopus I have ever had. Period. I dream about that damn octopus appetizer and wonder why no one else has figured it out?? Not even Todd English??. . I had the eggplant entree and my friend had some heavy pasta- both portions were very large and excellent. Small place with two small seating areas, so I recommend having a reservation, especially on the weekend. I really liked the artwork on the walls, exposed brick, and the intimate feel of the place. Wait staff was attentive.. . Can't wait to go back.
