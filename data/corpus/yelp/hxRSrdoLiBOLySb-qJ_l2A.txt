Bo Bane favs -. 1. Chipotle Chicken Salad (w/ currant, some nut, and some other nut) $10-12 or so. 2. Scramble with salmon $10-12 or so. 3. any of their desserts. . Vibe - B. Service - A. Health value - A. . i have a very sensitive pallet, and don't like anything chipotle because the spices are too strong for me. but the chicken salad is mild and sweet in aroma, that i get pissed when they tell me they're out of it. despite what the name may hint, it's not a leafy salad, but packed with soft white meat for lots of protein, also a better buffer for the flavor. they are not huge portions and is perfect for people who like to pick at food together. or in my case, alone with my book :). . the prices are a little high for me, but #1 &amp; #2 i gladly pay for. . there's one particular waitress who creeps me the hell out, you'll know when you get her. the panninis aren't all that. i'd skip them and try an entree.
