This place is as good as it gets when it comes to a Jewish Deli.  The food is the best!  I just got the Fresser's sandwich (Corned Beef and Pastrami) on Rye with Potato salad and Coleslaw.  It was heaven on a bun.  The meats are juicy and the rye is firm so it doesn't get mushy when you pick it up for  your first bite all the way to your last one!  The potato salad was a bit too sweet for me but had a really creamy taste to it.  The garlic pickles are firm and garlic-y.  Also had the Matzoball soup with noodles.  The matzoballs are the size of softballs and the soup was very tasty without being too salty.  Came with a few bagel chips that great with the soup.. . The place is open all night and has the best bakery too.  I got a few butter cookies with sprinkles and some small apricot pastries that were to die for.  I live in Yorba Linda and I drive to Canter's regularly to get the baked goods!
