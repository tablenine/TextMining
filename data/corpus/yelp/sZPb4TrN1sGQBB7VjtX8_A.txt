Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
The special Daikokuya ramen is pretty good, the broth is very hearty. I have had better ramen, but this one is pretty good, not sure how much msg is in it tho~ the gyoza are nice and crispy outside. Parking and waiting in line can be a bit of a hassle. Mr. ramen is a couple stores down, but not as delicious.
