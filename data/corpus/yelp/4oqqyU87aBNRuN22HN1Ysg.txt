The service has improved a lot here. Maybe because I go so often and they now recognize me? Im not sure, but its getting  better.. I have always loved the food and coffee, so that remains the reason I come.. Its calmed down a bit, so its much easier to get a table. Great outdoor seating and people watching.. The paninis are really good for lunch.  I also love their brunch. . Portions are small, but I sort of like that. Its the right amount of food. . Coffee is great. I highly recommend the black onyx.. Baked goods are hit-or-miss. They were doing creme-filled donuts for awhile that were off the hook, but dont see them anymore.. I can definitely recommend this place now!
