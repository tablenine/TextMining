I really only give Uncle Julio's 4 stars because of the bartenders!  Great sense of humor and keep those swirls coming!!  It has a nice atmosphere, clean, interesting, nice people, and about 3 swirls to get a buzz going.  (see Fernando's review... now THAT'S what I'm talkin' about!). . Love the chips and salsa!  They don't have burritos *puzzled look*... but everything I've had is pretty good.  It's close to the Red Line and the Weed Street bars and they have valet parking for a couple of bucks.
