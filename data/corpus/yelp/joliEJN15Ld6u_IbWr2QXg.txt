Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Being [moderately] lactose intolerant, it's kinda ironic that I would go to a place called Milk, but I'm a man who still loves his ice cream, and I'd heard good things about Milk's. I ended up having the grasshopper ice cream sandwich, recommended to me by an employee. It was good, but not great. Even after letting it soften for about 10 minutes, the cookies didn't have that chewiness of say, an Its-It that I've come to know and love. The ice cream did taste pretty good however.
