Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Don't be scared of this establishment because of its proximity to anything and everything yuppie. Food is food, I always say. But Joan's is beyond food. I describe the experience as eating in a deli with white floor tiles where anyone could easily eavesdrop on your stories of last night's debauchery. Try anything on their menu, especially desserts.. . One question remains though, what's with all the cows?
