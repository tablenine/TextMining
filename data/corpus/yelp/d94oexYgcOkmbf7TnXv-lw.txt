It's good, I had the Pan De Bistec or something like that :S. It was good except it had more bread than I liked. I personally don't like bread that much, but if you do I guess you should go for it. The steak in the sandwich was alright. The tomato and the garlic sauce thing was nice, but the potato sticks seemed kind of out of place.. . I also bought a cheese roll which was really great. Tasted almost like candy at first, then later on it's just delightful. So good. Would have bought more, but I don't wanna let myself go :-P. . . The place was really packed and loud. I guess that's what happens when your business is booming as a result of your delicious pastries.
