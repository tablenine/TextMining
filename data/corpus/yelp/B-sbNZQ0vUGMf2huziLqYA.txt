By far the best steak and oysters that Big Sexy has ever experienced in his short life!!   I've never had medium rare cooked the way these guys do it.  And their oysters are massive and delicious.  . . Go here for business people that you're trying to impress or family that you love.  My wallet is still made at me for the last time I ate there with four people that I really care about.. . The valet service is not consistent (been there about 5 times), but I go there for the food.  . . The service is great--it should be considering how much you pay.
