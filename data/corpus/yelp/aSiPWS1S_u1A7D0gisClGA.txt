The Good: I like the location with seating outside.  The food was pretty good here and the service was also friendly.  It's a great place to come and just have some lunch.  The bread that they serve is yummy when you dip it in the pesto oil.. . The Bad: It's not really worth what you're paying for.  But hey, when you're in LA, expect to pay.. . Try: the sweet potato fries.  The mediterranean salad was also pretty good.. . Don't Try: to pull a dine-and-dash.  That's just stupid.  The table behind us actually did it, and we felt so bad for the waitress.  Those douchebags...
