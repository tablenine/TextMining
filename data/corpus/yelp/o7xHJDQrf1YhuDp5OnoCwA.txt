Anyone that thinks these steaks aren't good might as well jump off a bridge because they're f'g nuts! I ordered the bone in filet and I was in heaven. By far the best steak I've had up until this point , not saying i've been to the best steakhouses around the country but I think a step above ruth chris, mortons, flemings, boa, prime @ bellagio... We also ordered the mac n cheese which was superb , mushrooms which complemented the taste of the steak. I want to try the infamous lobster mashed potatoes the next time I'm here...
