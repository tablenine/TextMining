Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
My girlfriend and I decided to try this place after hearing good things, and  needless to say it did not disappoint. For a long time I had heard amazing things about the first restaurant which is based out of Santa Monica and I didn't know if it was a risky decision going to their newer location. Though I cannot speak to the quality of the Santa Monica spot, the helms location  left us craving more for the remainer of the weekend. The words "best burger ever" were quite possibly spoken and as I type this I feel the craving kicking in again. . The office burger allows no substitutions or alterations, and for good reason too. The burger is pure bliss and I wouldn't have it any other way. I ordered mine medium and the flavor of the meat and juices sent me into shock. The burger also comes with cheese, lettuce, and their special sauce that consists of caramelized onions, bacon, and other things that I do not know. We did not try the hyped sweet potato fries, but we had the regular fries which come skinnier than most and are still quite tasty.. In addition to the fantastic burger, fathers office also has a very respectable beer selection and some refreshing bottled sodas. . Bottom line is this,  if you want to try a life changing burger and knock back good brews you should try out fathers office. The two of us left very satisfied and I guarantee there is another office burger in our future
