Great beers, great atmosphere, great sweet potato fires, great steak.  BUT... what happened to the burger?  It used to be the best in town, with a delicate bun, maytage blue cheese and just the right amount of bacon.  All I could taste on my last two burgers was the onions, and the bun is worst than pedestrian.  If you want a good beer on the West side, this is the place.  If you want the great burger, I'd have to say it's now the Lucky Devil's Kobe burger.
