I work in the Lenox Area, and was looking for a nice patio to have an afterwork drink. Aja is the place! I was there last night and the cocktail lounge was steady but not slammed. The inside music was a little too loud for conversation, so we opted for outside. Outside the weather felt great sitting on the cabana-esque lounge chairs. Our waitress was excellent and greeted us promptly.  The cocktails are fun and flashy. After glancing at the menu, our waitress offered suggestions and tempeted us with the idea of a sushi boat. Although a little pricey the "boat" was overflowing with sushi rolls and sashmi.  I had a great time and look forward to coming again.
