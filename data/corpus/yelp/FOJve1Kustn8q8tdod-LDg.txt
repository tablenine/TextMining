I came here for breakfast awhile ago and I can't really remember what I had, but it was pretty good. The restaurant itself is not that big, but they have good service. I know this place is like one of the it breakfast places of LA but to be honest, I am not a big breakfast person and I think eggs and pancakes usually tastes the same wherever I go... But I do enjoy the people I am with whenever I go to these places~. . It's kind of on the pricey side for a breakfast place. I think I ended up paying like $20 for a plate and a cup of latte. But it IS Melrose...
