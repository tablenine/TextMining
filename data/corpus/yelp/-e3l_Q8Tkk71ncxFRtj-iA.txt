The first time I came to Geisha was about 2 years ago- If i was writing a review back then, they would have had 5 stars. I have been here about a dozen times or so, and for some reason their sushi is suffering. It just doesn't have the "sushi satisfaction" anymore- and isn't as fresh as sushi should be- or so it seems. I have many friends come from out of town/state, and they always ask to go to Geisha, so I continue to go. I am not sure if it was on TV or a magazine at some point- but Â out of town friends are into it. The atmosphere, drinks and service/staff have all stayed superb, I just hope they work on the most important part-; the sushi!
