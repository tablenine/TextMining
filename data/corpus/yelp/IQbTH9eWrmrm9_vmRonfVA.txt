We visited from SF and our friends living in Da' Sherm said this was the best place for Mexican food.  They didn't lie.  Food was good all around.  Funny thing happened, after the third margarita things went fuzzy.  I went from loving the food, loving the drinks, to singing PM Dawn on the ride home.. . I've been back twice since.  The service is iffy.  I tried to practice my Spanish and they look at me askance.  They hardly smile and seem uptight.  Other than that...I'd go back.. . "The camera pans the cocktail glass,. behind a blind of plastic plants;. I found the lady with the fat diamond ring.. then you know I can't remember a damn thing" - PM Dawn
