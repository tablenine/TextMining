solid place.  real good food.  just be prepared to pay for it.  portions are surprisingly a decent size for a nice place like this.  maybe my standards have been lowered with all the other places serving palm size servings.  great warm ambiance.  customer service is pretty top notch here. . recommendations:  the mushrooms...  seriously just try them
