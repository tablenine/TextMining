Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So this place is known as a Los Angeles landmark?  Really?!  It's just a simple hotdog!  The smell of hot meat after a night of debauchery does have it's appeal, but if you're gonna make an event out of coming here, take the advice of all the fellow yelpers before going.  Don't believe the hype...celebrities must have bad taste when it comes to food.
