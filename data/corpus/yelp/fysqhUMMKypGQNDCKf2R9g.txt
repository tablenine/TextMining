Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Not bad but definitely not worth the wait.. . The place is packed up even until sunday closing at 2AM.. . There was nothing really special about the hot dog itself, flavor wise it was pretty much store bought stuff. Â . . I only tried this to say I have tried it and now I probably won't ever come back unless a friend really wanted to try it.
