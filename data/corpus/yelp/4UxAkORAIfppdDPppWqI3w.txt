Restaurant: The Euclid Avenue Yacht Club
Category: Restaurants
The Yacht Club is a great place to grab a beer with friends and a quick bite to eat. IMO we really need more local neighborhood spots like this around town. No attitudes, just laid back people enjoying the moment. They hands down make the best hot wings in town. I suspect the other food is good, but since I always order the wings I can't say for sure. Beer prices are affordable, so you don't have to worry about overly inflated prices that are so common in bars.
