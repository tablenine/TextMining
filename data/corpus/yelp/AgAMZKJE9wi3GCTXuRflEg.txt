Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I like Pink's! However, hot dogs aren't really my thing. Therefore, I always order a cheeseburger. Don't get turned away if, like me, you don't like hot dogs because they also make a mean cheeseburger, or other diner-like item which will be equally pleasing. Please don't go here if you're on a diet or watching your weight, because you will not be able to contain yourself once you get within about a 50-yard radius of the place. The overpowering odor of cooking hamburgers/hot dogs will overcome you. Otherwise, eat at your heart's content. It's really an awesome place, and although I have been here many times, I always enjoy looking at the walls filled with autographed celebrity photos. They're really cool, and who knows? You might just see one of them in line behind you, ordering their own hot dog.
