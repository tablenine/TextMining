Why have I not been here in almost two years?  Completely bizarre.  And, honestly, slightly embarrassing.  . Now, having said that prepare to wait on a weekend.  All in all this is a good sign for a brunch spot.  Especially located where it is on Chicago you know that people are coming for the food and it's not a "roll out of bed in sweat pants with Pi Kap written on the rear in capital letters with your Chad in his big ten t-shirt with matching black northface fleeces" that can be stumbled to no matter the prices or average food (ug, cough T0@st!). That being said, it's good.  And reasonably priced.  Seriously.  A brunch spot with a one word name is priced well.  I think my tacos bosillos was 7.95. Did I mention it's all Latin American.  Well, the great majority.  The eggs flo, a benedict, is quite tasty as well.  The interior is fun but understated.  I wouldn't recommend kids/babies during the prime hours 9-12 though.  It's a tight fit.  Swing by around 1 for a later meal and you'll enjoy it more.  If you are uncoupled, then be all means, go for the coffee during the wait.  It's Intelligentsia, of course!
