Notice how hard it is to write a review if you give a place 3 stars? It's neither here nor there. It's like that yawn or that sneeze that doesn't want to come out. It blows and it sucks.. . But once you get it, the feeling is like pulling that single hair sticking out of your nose. Such a relief.. . So, let's try this again.... . USEFUL:. -  If you're driving from Santa Monica to check out this place, it's not really worth the hassle. If you live in Hollywood or Silverlake area, maybe. If you live in Eagle Rock, then definitely you gotta go to this place.. . -  The hamburger and the pastrami are okay. Good but not great. Filling but not satistying. . . -  The twice-fried Belgian fries are probably one of the best THIS part of town. I'll give them credit even if they used processed potatoes.  Chow down these frites with their homemade garlic aioli and catsup.. . FUNNY:. -  Oink? Is it really funny? And do they really have to rub it in?. . -  The real fun is me succumbing to food coma with my friend driving back to Santa Monica on bumper-to-bumper traffic on the 2, the 134, the 101 and the 405.. . COOL:. -  The one and only ube (purple yam) milkshake in LA. Blended to perfect consistency and sweetness. Worth the brain freeze, I'm telling you. Never had a purple shake before? Then you're not cool.. . So,  how do I feel now after this review?  Can someone help me pull that hair sticking out of my nose?
