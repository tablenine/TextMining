Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
When a place has so much hype, its hard to live up to expectations. I mean, look at these reviews on Yelp. Or look anywhere! So.... . Do they really need another review?. Do they need any help getting business?. Is it a waste of time sharing my experiences with others?. . No, no and no. . . Porto's is everything a good cafe and bakery should be. Fresh food, friendly people (which is most impressive considering the extreme amount of business they handle), creative standard lunch faire.. . The food is Cuban-style cafe food, so the usual suspects are there. The traditional Cuban Sandwich is great. As are all the other sandwiches we tried. The potato balls are incredible, and the cheese rolls are delicious. . . We've also had items from the bakery for events now and again and each time we've received the best compliments from our guests. Chocolate Cake, Carrot Cake, Dulce de Leche... the latter is a reason to have the party if don't have one already!. . Keep it up, Porto's.
