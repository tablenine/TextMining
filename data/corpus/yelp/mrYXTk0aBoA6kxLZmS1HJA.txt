Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I have heard about Casa Bianca for awhile and took many others advice about their exceptional pizza. I am from the NYC/Boston area where pizza everywhere are compared to, so I was curios.. . We arrived there on a Sat night around 5:30-6PM and the line was starting to assemble. We signed in and the hostess gave us a 45 minute estimate. We finally got seated after about 50 minutes and every table was busy. We were seated in the back in a red booth and I noticed the room was a bit stuffy and on the warm side. After we were seated, we had a bit of a wait before we got the menu, water and our ice tea. Finally the waitress brought the ice tea. There were some lemon slices that I squeezed into the tea, took a swig and the taste was really "off." I smelled and tasted the lemons and they were rancid, awful! They must have spoiled, sat too long, but that didn't make my impression of the house very favorable.. . Finally the pizza came. We ordered a med mushroom with a garden salad. The salad was ok, nothing special. We let the pizza cool and I took my first bite. It was quite good, not anything near as good as pizza I've had in Boston or NYC, but above average compared to other pizza I've tried in LA. For me, the wait wasn't worth the quality or expense, but the pizza was ok, no complaints. I haven't tried anything else on the menu except pizza. . . I would try it again, but would venture over there to avoid taht wait again. Above average pizza, really quite good
