Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Seriously, I don't know what the hype about this place is all about.  I think the Costco hotdog tastes even better!  The hotdog I got here was skinny and tasteless.  All I tasted was the stuff on top of it.  I guess I just can't appreciate a souped up hotdog.  I just like the plain old mustard and relish on my dog.  Call me boring or whatever.   I was more there for the experience, and now I can say Yes, I've been to Pink's Hot Dogs.
