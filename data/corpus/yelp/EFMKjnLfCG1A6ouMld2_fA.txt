Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Uh, I understand the lines were long and the place was packed. That does NOT necessarily mean the food is good.. I guess I don't like tacos in the first place. . The guacamole tasted like water. . The chili con carne was overpriced. . They were generous with the chips but the salsa was watery. . The tacos were crunchy but whatever kind of meat they were using, it didn't taste fresh.. They did NOT have raspberry ice-tea.... Their parking lot was tiny.... . I didn't hate this place. I just didn't like it enough.
