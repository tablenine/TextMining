Came here after a show at the Mark Taper Forum in downtown L.A, just for some drinks. My colleague and I had already eaten dinner at a far less interesting restaurant recommended by the hotel. It was 11pm-ish. We weren't especially hungry, but the "small plates" menu was so extensive and interesting that we decided to sample a couple of things including the much touted Portobello Mushroom fries. Let me just say that the people don't lie. Those things are awesome. Â I liked the late evening atmosphere in the room. I will go definitely return next time I am in LAlaland.
