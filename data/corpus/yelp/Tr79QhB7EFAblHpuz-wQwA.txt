Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
After attending the Belmont-Sheffield festival I was in the mood for a char burger.  So I decided to take up Wiener's Circle.  It seems like the highest reviews had some common ingredients.  Drunken group of friends and hot dogs.  I did not have either, so I think I missed out on the full exp.  I tried the cheddar char burger and I was not enjoying it.  The bun just fell apart on me and the meat + cheese was pasty and chalky tasting.
