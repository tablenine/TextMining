My boyfriend and I were looking for a reasonable Italian restaurant with good  food.  This place completely beat any of our expectations. The wait staff was very friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The pesto dip that is served with the bread and olive oil was amazing!  My boyfriend ordered chicken with mozzarella cheese in a sun dried tomato and bacon sauce served with delicious pesto mashed potatoes.  I had a wonderful bowl of butternut squash ravioli.  We topped it off with cannoli that was hands down  the best cannoli we have had in a restaurant in years.  All of the food and wine was very affordable.  Overall, it was a truly great dining experience from start to finish.  Definitely coming back!
