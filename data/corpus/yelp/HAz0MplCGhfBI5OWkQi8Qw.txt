Worst coochie is pretty good. . . I was lucky enough to try this spot a year ago when it was still fresh and newish and a long wait to order was not mandatory. Sadly, I have not been back since. Even though it was an interesting dining experience; the place is spacious and hip and has an AWESOME beer selection, the $27.74 for 2 dogs and 2 beers was too much for me to stomach. The fancy exotic dog was very good but small. For $7.50 I wanted to see more meat, some more grilled onions or 7 more slivers of kraut at least AND I expected the bread to be out-of-this-world-crafted-by-monks-on-a-lunar-ecli pse special.. . Maybe if I worked downtown and made at least $20 bucks an hour, or if I had some trust fund, OR if I was some out of town hipster desperate to be seen; I would frequent this spot. . . It's interesting and good, I recommend it. but I will never go back.
