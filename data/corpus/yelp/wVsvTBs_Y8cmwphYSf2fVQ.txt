Just stopped by this place for Sunday brunch, a sort of tradition with one of my best girlfriends, and actually decided to check it out after reading the reviews here on our luvley Yelp community. . There was no wait when we got there, a major plus from our usual spots Toast and Joan's on 3rd, which was around 9:45am. They even sat my girl before I arrived -- which is almost unheard of! LoL . Now, food wise it's pretty damn good. I got the Cali Omelet which was delicious, and I agree with Sarah Beth S., their fruit cup is above the standard of other brunch spots. I wasn't too impressed with my vanilla latte, but I am not a huge coffee gal so what do I know.... The food did take a bit long it seemed, for it to be somewhat slow for a Sunday morning, but all in all the service was great and super friendly. We headed out around 12 and the place was officially packed, folks waiting and taking up the sidewalk packed, so if you can't get there early I say skip it until you can. Not to mention, parking is a breeze before shops open. . Also, the bathroom (I can't help it, ladies bathrooms are a big factor for me - lol) is super cute and was very clean. With a huge full length mirror, someone taught them well ;-) My friend and I have decided to keep it on our list, I'll let you know next time we go just how consistent they are!
