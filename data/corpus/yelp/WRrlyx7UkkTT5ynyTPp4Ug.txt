Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
A SOLID THREE STAR RESTAURANT!!  If you have any doubt on this, dine here.  I can't give it a less than three stars because foods are healthy.  I also cannot give more than three because it doesn't taste that good.. . I believe that it is extremely hard to make a successful "Fusion Asian" food.  Why?. . I know that healthy cuisine is at its peak these days.  However, for some foods, being healthy is just impossible.  For instance, Pad Thai simply cannot be healthy, in my opinion.  Since the Pad Thai sauce is not the healthiest thing in the world, you can either dilute it to make it healthier or you can forget about the health thingy.  Which one would you choose?  I would choose not-so-healthy but tasty Pad Thai.. . Don't have Pad Thai at Duc Chey's.  I don't know if anyone liked it, but for me, it was like eating "NOODLE" without any sauce.. . Veggie spring roll on the other hand, is very good, but it's an appetizer.  Too bad they don't have a great entree....
