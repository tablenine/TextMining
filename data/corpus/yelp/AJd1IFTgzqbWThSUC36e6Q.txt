Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Definitely over-rated.  I wasn't a fan of the tacos that I had, but I will caveat this by saying that I'm not a big fan of tacos that are essentially entirely deep-friend.  This isn't your normal taco shop which offers a fresh tortilla with your choice of meat.  Here, your choices are fairly limited as far as the meat -- beef or no beef.  Where's my al pastor or carnitas?. . There are definitely better taco shops on the Westside and with $1 options at fast food places, I'd rather go to Wendy's or Jack 'N the Box.
