Was hoping for an authentic new england -esque seafood experience.  The atmosphere, in the back, delivered, however, the food did not.  I found the dishes to be bland and and lacking in freshness.  I really wanted to like it , but just didn't.  Not to mention the rushed service.  Two stars for the atmosphere alone.
