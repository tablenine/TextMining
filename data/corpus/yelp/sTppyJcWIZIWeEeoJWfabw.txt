So many happy memories of this place and their specials board, especially the spicy tuna with crispy rice. The rolls here are creative, fresh and LEGIT. My friends and I would analyze the ingredients and hopelessly try to recreate them at home. ha.. . I'd be afraid to step into the new versions in Hollywood and at the (*sigh*) Americana.
