I don't know if I'm qualified to review, because even though I've visited the Roy's in Kauai, Palm Desert, and Chicago, i always order the EXACT SAME THING. Spare ribs appetizer, macadamia nut crusted fish with lobster butter sauce, and of course, the chocolate souffle. It is just too yummy. I can't help it. And the tropical drinks take me right back to Hawaii.
