I love that UG is a coffee shop, and restaurant and bar.  There are so many different sections that it is a great place to meet up with someone no matter what either person is in the mood for.  I came here for a surprise party and there was about 30 people from toddlers to old schoolers and everyone loved the space and the food.  A band was setting up in the back room as we were leaving and people were still chilling in the bars and coffee lounge areas as well.  The food was excellent!  I will be back.
