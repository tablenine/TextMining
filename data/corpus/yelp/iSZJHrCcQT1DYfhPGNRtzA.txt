Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
They roast their Prime Rib in a Alto Sham and that a makes a slow and juicy rib roast. . Love the way they make your salad tableside with a spinning and drizzling of your salad dressing. . . The Prime Rib is hands down cooked to perfection and so juicy ! MY side was mashed potatoes and sweet corn.. A professional carver carves the Prime Rib on a stainless steel carts.. If you love Prime Beef you've got to go to this Restaurant !
