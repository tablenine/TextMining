Their rolls are ... interesting. If you're a sushi snob, this is not the place for you. The indoor garden and the view is wonderful, but the sushi rolls have weird ingredients (probably the sushi chef trying to be unique). However...their pumpkin creme brulee is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Oh my gosh, I came here a second time later in the week trying to get some more but they ran out :'(
