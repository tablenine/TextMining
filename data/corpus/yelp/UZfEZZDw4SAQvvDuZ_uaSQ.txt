Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I'm definitely a fan. . . This was my 2nd time at Bottega Louie and I can't get enough. Something about the restaurant makes me love it. I can't tell if its combination of the more-than-appealing inside decor and architecture and the people, or the tremendous food and service. . . Everything about this restaurant flows very well. I first came on Valentine's Day and the meal was tremendous. This time I had a meatball pizza and I was surprised when it was served. It was huge! Definitely enough for two. The pizza reminded me of something I'd have in italy. Completely authentic. The tomato sauce was zesty and it went so well with the mozzarella cheese. The meatballs were a great addition and the hint of oregano helped the flavor combo out. . . I am definitely going back soon, I can't wait to try some of the bakery goods and food-to-go. So so so awesome.
