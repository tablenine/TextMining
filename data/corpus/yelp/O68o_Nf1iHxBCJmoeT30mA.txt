Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Awesome prime rib house. Had never been to one before and to be honest I am not usually a "prime rib guy." I guess because I had never really had an upscale experience. The meat is juicy and tender. While I usually prefer steak, I would definitely mix it up now after having Lawry's. Aside from the meat, the side are unreal. The creamed corn, the mashed potatoes, the f-ing bread...Amazing ambiance with the professional service you would expect from a restaurant row location. Another interesting fact is that every year the 2 football teams playing in the Rose Bowl go there for a meal.
