Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
I've always wanted to try out Fred 62 whenever I walk pass by it on my way to Palermos, and my girlfriend and I finally tried it out last night.  We were planning on going to Palermos for our six-month-anniversary last night, and since Palermos closes on Tuesday nights, I finally got the chance to try out Fred 62.  All in all, not a bad place, I had the Tower of Power with a side of onion rings and my girlfriend had the fish sandwich (I forgot what it was called).  We ended our meal with the root beer float; I was rooting for the red velvet cake, but we decided to go the "lighter" route.  The sandwich was light and non-greasy, the onion rings' breading was sweet and salty and just the right amount and my girlfriend enjoyed her sandwich as well.  . . So the question is this, will I go back again?  Well, if I'm in the neighborhood I totally would.  But, it's not SO special that I'd make a trip for (I live in Burbank).  That doesn't mean it's not good, the food was great, diverse and chilled crowd, and it's definitely a great place for a group dinner.
