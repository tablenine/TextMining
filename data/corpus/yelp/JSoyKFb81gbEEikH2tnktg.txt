Restaurant: The Varsity
Category: Fast Food
Bottom line, The Varsity is a mecca for grease junkies. The food is decent but, their Fried onion rings are hands down the best I have ever had. Their chili dogs and burgers are good but, minimal in portion size. The only downside about this place is, it's pretty much a pigsty (probably due to the super high volume of clientele that are quickly cycling through.)
