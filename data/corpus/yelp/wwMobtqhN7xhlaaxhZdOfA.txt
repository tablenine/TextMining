I cant believe that I haven't yelped this place yet!!!  My first time here was two years ago for my birthday with my group of girls.  We were pleasantly surprised by the food.  We knew the place was posh but we weren't sure how good the sushi actually was going to be.  We really enjoyed all the food we ordered.  The shrimp salad is a little skimpy...try a little cup of lettuce with one shrimp cut into 4 pieces...I don't recommend it.  However their drinks were yummy and the food was great.  The upstairs area is also a lot more quieter and secluded and right next to the bar so your drinks come out quick!!  The second time we were seated downstairs which was fun but the seating was a little cramped.  That time we also got dessert which was yummy!  The waiter/tress are sooo nice as well and very accommodating which is always a plus.  I really like the place regardless of the crowd or the teenyboppers who come out to play in hollywood.  The times spent here with friends, nice decor, friendly staff, and the yummy food is what makes it great.  overrated?? psh what place isnt?
