This is by far my favorite restaurant in LA for Japanese food of any kind. . . Due to recent notoriety, this place's wait has been getting LONG. I recommend showing up at 10:59AM if you enjoy waking up to a bowl of good ramen. Any time after that, the wait has become ridiculous.. . If you want ramen, this is place to get it. The soup is really just the best you'll find anywhere. It also comes in a few variations. If you feel like you're body fat percentage is not high enough, definitely consider the kotteri because it is just so buttery. In a related note, they also have a LARGE size ramen that is not advertised. Bang that out for extra calories, worth it. Also available is the tsukemen, but to be honest I can hardly discern any difference except that the give Â you fried cha shu rather than just cooked.. . Now if you're into dry things, the PORK bowl is just as fatty and just as delicious. Bento Box is another must have and every one of the options is good, tempura, chicken teri, tonkatsu, spicy/cali roll, tuna ahi sashimi.. . Also, they won't sell you a t-shirt no matter how much you beg. Those waiters have morals.
