This is a great place to go anytime. We love the atmosphere, drink specials, and most certainly the Big Kahuna Burger!!. . We went on a Monday night before NYE and they were having a bingo night. It was all in good fun and proceeds would benefit the Center on Halstead - . http://www.centeronhal.... / The funny thing was that during the whole bingo craziness they were playing The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers on their TVs. Crazy. . . The place is great but I gave it 4 stars for two reasons: their service is sometimes slow and the mashed potatoes are nasty. :-(
