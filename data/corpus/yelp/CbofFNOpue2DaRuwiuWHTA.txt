This place has a great lunch special if you work in the area.  It's like $10 for a limited menu and it's designed to be quick in and out if you only have an hour.  I've been a couple times with work folks and it's always been good.. . But last night my guy and I went for dinner and I was extra impressed.  I just really like Susan Feniger's cooking!  She adds all these delicious details.  Like we shared a steak last night. And a steak with a side of potatoes and spinach would not be that special. But here, there were a million little extras.  Like the steak was stuffed with caramelized jalapenos and came with a cilantro-ey chimichurri sauce.  The potatoes were bacon mashed potatoes with surprisingly big chunks of bacon. The spinach was a warm spinach salad with black beans and fresh corn.  See?  Lots of extra delicious details! We added a couple of extra sides.  My favorite were the honey caramelized plantains.  The only down-side was that they were so sweet, I couldn't bring myself to order dessert after.. . Their drinks were really tasty too.  If you like mojitos, you'll be happy with their selection. They offer lots of different rums and flavors.  We also tried their "supremo sangria" which was delicious and fruity and came with a floater of Spanish brandy.  . . Parking is kind of a pain because it's downtown.  You can get 3 hours for $5 with validation at the lot adjacent to the restaurant.
