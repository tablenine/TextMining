My sister works there.  So see if you can find her and say hi to her!. . 5 days out of a week I would have something (drink, meal, or just some appetizer) my sister brings back from Sinbala.  I personally think that the food there is way too greasy, way too much garlic, shrimps are not fresh at most times.  . . Upside about this place: great sausage- I say definitely try their sausage with peanut butter, I know it sounds weird but trust me, it's great!  They also have many different varieties such as sausage with peach jam and some 'normal' ones like basil, wasabi, etc.. . One main factor that keeps this place growing:  GREAT customer service.  The phrase "customer is always right" fits more than perfect at Sinbala.. . Overall 5 stars for customer service, 3 stars for food.  But I would like to give it an overall 3 stars for Sinbala because I'm so sick of people praising how good their food is when it's really not that great, only mediocre.
