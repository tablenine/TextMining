I visited this place frequently before when it was Buckhead Backlot.  They had decent service, and very resonable prices.  The new version however has slightly worse service (check is supposed to come out 30 minutes before the movie ends, we got it 2 minutes before.  Also when we tried to order a 2nd round of drinks we were told the bar closed 5 minutes earlier and our light asking for service had been on for 15+ minutes.) and much much higher prices.  Previously a pitcher of beer was 9.99 for domestic and 12.99 for higher class and imports.  Now it is 16.50 for domestic and 19.99 for imports which is ridiculous.  I used to really like this place but now i will probably avoid it and just go to a regular theater.
