When I first heard about this place from a friend in Chicago, I got pretty excited.  The concept seemed perfect:  Hot steamed buns without even the wait of a Chinese take-out place, much less sit down dim sum.  Perhaps the expectations were too high.  I tried a sample of the BBQ Pork Buns and the Teriyaki Chicken Buns.  The quality of the bun is nowhere near what you would get elsewhere--the buns are a bit on the small side and the taste is a little off.  I wouldn't foreclose going there again (and I'd like to try some of the Breakfast Baos some time), but I can't recommend it in good faith to someone else.
