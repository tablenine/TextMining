I LOVED this place. I started some Matzo Ball soup which was delicious and very rich in flavor. It helped that they brought out a basket of assorted breads to dip in (who doesn't love challah dipped in matzo). I also got the corned beef sandwich which was very high quality meat on great rye bread after having having my first non-jewish deli corn beef at Halsted Deli and realizing that corned beef can be really really really really bad I can appreciate what they do at the jewish places so much more. . . In terms of atmosphere I don't think I could have picked a better place for lunch. The whole place has old theater posters all around the waitresses we encountered felt like they were from a different time period (in the best way) and there was a perfect balance (for me) of lighting. . . The only real negative here was price. Fro a sandwhich and soup I paid... more than I'd normally be willing to however paired with everything else I'd say it's definitely worth it to come every once in a while to start a weekend adventure. If I'm looking for a cheaper alternative I'll go up to Clark to NY Deli which is amazing as well.
