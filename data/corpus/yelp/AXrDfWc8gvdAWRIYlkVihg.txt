Content. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to dread. I must say the apple wood smoked bacon, alone, is out of this world. If I could order a platter of this bacon I would be in heaven. Great service and an enjoyable atmosphere. I must say I am intrigued by the 3 foot wait staff. I was hoping he might drop by our table, but we lucked out.
