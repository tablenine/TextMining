Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's is to prime rib, what Gillette is to razors.  Only difference is that I live the rest of my life without having a shave, but can't go more than six months without a fat slice of Lawry's Prime Rib.. . You can't go wrong with the Diamond Jim. Its big, its bad and it will blow your house down.  Back in the day it was their signature cut, but  now the Beef Bowl Cut is the reigning heavy weight champ.  All cuts are hand carved table side and come with a your choice of sides.  The creamed corn is the best of the bunch but you cant go wrong with any of them.  . . On a side note there is a secret stash of meatballs, and fresh kettle fried potato chips in the waiting room for all you hungry people waiting to be seated.  I know times are tough, so grab a few meatballs, and a handful of chips before you embark on your culinary adventure.  Keep an eye out for celebrities, if that's your thing.  I have seen a handful of celebrities dining at their Beverly Hill location.
