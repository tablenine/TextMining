Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
First time trying Fraiche, it is ok. 2.5 stars. . Appetizer . Mushroom salad. - The salad was great very tasty. 4/5. . Dinner Entree: . Monkfish - tasty, lemony, pretty good. 3.8/5. Kurobota Pork Chop - dry Â 2/5. DUCK AGNOLOTTI pasta - a bit oily, butter truffle is nice, tasty but too oily. 3/5. . Dessert: TORTA DELLA NONNA with fuji apples, pine nut streusel, mascarpone ice cream. The torta was great combination. Mascarpone ice cream light, not that much hint of french ice cream. 3.5/5. . Ambiance: ok, seat outside it's hot inside. Not much in decor, there are more lavishing places. . . Cocktail: very bland. typical nothing special and not that tasty at all. 1/5. . Overall: So so... had better at other places. Salad is great, monkfish is ok/good. decor, for culver city it's ok, if it is in hollywood or anywhere else i would say it's lacking especially inside. Would go to other restaurants.
