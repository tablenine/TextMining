Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
I am not really that interested in food but Portos was the one restaurant that really made me say "Wow". They have the best pastries and cakes in the town and sandwiches are great too. The only downside to this place is that it is always crowded and they do not have enough seating.
