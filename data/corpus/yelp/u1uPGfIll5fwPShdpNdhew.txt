Restaurant: Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate
Category: American (New)
Ever since Prince of Wales closed, I've been searching for another intown neighborhood bar that has a similar eclectic pub feel. Cypress P&amp;P isn't exactly it, but they're not a bad runner-up. PROS: The patio is really nice - it faces a side street so there's no street noise. And the beer selection is good - I highly recommend the chocolate stout. It's the perfect place for an after-work beer with friends. CONS: However, the food is average. I don't recommend going there just to eat. There's no parking available (blows my mind how they got around the parking ordinance), so you have to park on surrounding side streets. The service is hit or miss every time I've been there. And not all of the bartenders there know how to pour a Guinness properly.
