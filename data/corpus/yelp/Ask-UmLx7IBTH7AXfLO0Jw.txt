A great place to stop for a bite after a movie at Cinefamily, which is just a block or two away. We hesitated by the cocktail lounge entryway, through which some jazz singing floated, but we went to the main dining room.. . I had a chocolate phosphate (!!!) and a hot corned beef sandwich. C. had water and the avocado, tomato, etc. sandwich. The corned beef sandwich, at $12, is basically a heap of meat, with two slices of rye bread for handles. Not sure if it was worth the money, but it was delicious, and I'll return to try other items.. . The pickles are on the sour side -- not as garlicky and cucumber as my faves in New York -- but get a plate, regardless.. . As good as the food is, and as skilled as the wait staff is -- these are hardcore, career waitresses -- look around at the other patrons and eavesdrop a little, if you can. To our right was a guy who was going to court to fight an eviction and restraining order. And a ways away were three felas who'd just gone to the comic shop (Golden Apple?). After making their buys, they went to Canter's to read and flip and chat.. . Open for 24 hours. Spend at least 30 minutes here.
