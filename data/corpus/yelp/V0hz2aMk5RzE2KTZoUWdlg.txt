The Cinco de Mayo Celebration was over the top! Even though the wait for food was 4+hours, we sat under the tents and got a server to somehow take our orders and get us drinks, chips and salsa all within an hour and half!. . Our food was still quality and was steaming hot (despite the huge crowd) when brought to our table! For this, they deserve 5 stars!
