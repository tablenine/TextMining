I don't normally Yelp. Actually this is my first entry-- and it's because I just got off the phone with Cobras and they now have an $8.00 corking fee. I'm sure others have noticed this and have commented, but I'm saying it again. No good can come of that. For us consumers anyway.. . Their food is always inspiring because it simple enough that most of the non-meat dishes can be recreated at home. None the less... A big heaving sigh for the $8 corkage fee and closing the other one to be replaced by Umami, which already has 4 other locations. poop.
