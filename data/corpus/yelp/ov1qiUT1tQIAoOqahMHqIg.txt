We ordered the unlimited meat meal and we sat there eat for 2 HOURS. Man... it was a lot of food. The meat quality was alright - nothing spectacular. Considering that unlimited meat was $17, its a pretty good deal. Too bad we had to sit outside, it was pretty cold but the grill in front of us warmed us up really quickly. It is a madhouse when you get in there, soooo many people, not enough wait staff.
