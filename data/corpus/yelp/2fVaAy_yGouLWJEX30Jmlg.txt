Category: Steakhouses
MMMMMMMMMMMastro's! This place is perfect if you want to feel easy breezy cheesy peasey in a faux bourgeoisie setting potentially mingling and sitting next to overdressed tourists and smelly, under-dressed foreign ones. And old people.. . Every time I step into this restaurant, I always stuff my face, over eat, cry tears of joy, and pray that I don't need a colonic.. . Say what you want about colonic irrigation...but before you do that please do yourself a favor and get the medium rare bone in and the mac + cheese and wash it down with some goose tonics. thank you very much.
