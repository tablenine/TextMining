I am in love!  The burgers are juicy and delicious.  The fries are so yummy.  The service is great.  I was with some friends and we pulled out our knitting.  A server came over to talk to us, and I was worried he would give us a hard time about knitting... no sir, he asked for tips!  How awesome is that.. . We were so full after eating we didn't try and desserts.. but next time that fried twinkie is mine!
