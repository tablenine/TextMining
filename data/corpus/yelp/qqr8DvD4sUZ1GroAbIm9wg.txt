Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Palms Thai Restaurant fulfills every taste bud that needs to be satisfied. As a daughter of a chef, my palette has changed dramatically. For the last couple years I have become a fan of thai food, and I have visited other restaurants but none like this one. . . if your visiting hollywood, make sure to come here. You'll enjoy every moment of it. the prices are moderate but the food is really good. I ordered the coconut soup and the thai beef salad, both were perfectly made.
