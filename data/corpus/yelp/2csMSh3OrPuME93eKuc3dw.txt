My friend saw this place on the Travel Channel and so while we were in the area we stopped by to check it out. The sandwiches are good. The mustard was very rich with real mustard flavor. A little goes a long way. I would stay clear from it again. Ruins the flavor of meat you choose for your sandwich. I had the lamb sandwich dip. Was very good and tasty. My friend had the beef sandwich dip. He also said it was good. Overall I would eat there again if in the area. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.
