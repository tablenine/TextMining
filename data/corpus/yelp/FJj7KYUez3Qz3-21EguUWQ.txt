Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
Sunday night at The Castle was crowded and a bit uncomfortable as you entered. Many men just standing around staring ....the magicians are great and some are better than others... the up close magicians are excellent.. Dinner - waited 45 minutes and we were seated right in front of where people walk up to the restaurant. Dave the maitre-di made up for all of this ! This David Spade looking mofo is great and worth the effort ... he hooked us up with drinks and great seats for the main show... Dave Rocks. All in all Castle was good but not aside from a few stars not worth the price.... . Restrooms -small but clean. . V
