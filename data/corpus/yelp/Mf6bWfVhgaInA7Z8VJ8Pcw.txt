I was expecting the pulled pork to be smothered in barbecue sauce, but it wasn't. I grabbed the carolina barbecue sauce and dipped my sandwich in it; otherwise, it still tasted great (it's really just a psychological thing to me).. . The fries are exquisite, great texture, and the garlic aioli is incredible. Wish we coulda had more. The honey mustard sauce was a little too strong for my tastes.. . Four dollar beer taps was an awesome surprise. Definitely did not see that coming! . . We came later at night when it wasn't at peak, so I can't attest to how well the space works, but the seats are super comfortable and definitely lends to the "slow fast food" slogan.
