Man...where can I begin!  The place is awesome!  i LOVE THE CHICKEN!! Its full of flavor and all the times I have had it it was just right!  The Waffles are addicting....I don't know if its the syrup, or the batter all I know is I love it!  I had the chicken both fried and smothered!  I have never been disappointed!  I love the staff they are always friendly and very nice to me!  The place is just great....except when I have to wait...but hey the food is great what can I say!
