Craving Tortillas? (Capitalization intended) Tortillas was the first Atlanta outpost of "California' style Mexican. It didn't quite get there but had a distinct style that was good in its own way and better than anything we've had sense. Unfortunately Atlanta burritos have been 'chained' for the most part but El Myr waves the indie flag with real food, excellent salsa. $1 lunch special adds chips and beverage. There were even people drinking Margaritas at 3pm on Wednesday. I didn't partake myself so I'll have to go back to update. Can I do that? This is my first review...
