I would have given this place 5 stars but, the line is always ridiculous when I go here.  The fish quality is 5 stars hands down.  Now, this is probably the priciest place in J town but, it's well worth the wait.  Price point is another story though. There are comparable places in the area that get close to the quality of fish here at maybe 1/2 the price.  But, if money isn't an issue, and you value quality sushi, Sushi Gen is something that you would want to try.  All sashimi here shines especially the toro and yellowtail.  This place will be your standard to which you judge all your sushi from now on. LOL
