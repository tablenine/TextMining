It's the best Sushi in Chicago, hands down. I grew up in Chicago and have since lived in Miami &amp; now NYC. For freshness, Toro makes me forget that I'm eating seafood in the Midwest. I went with two friends, and we're all very picky about our Sushi. Toro won us over; we were debating fave Sushi spots nationwide with Toro in the mix in no time.. . Truth be told, it was a more of a maki night: Dragon, Volcano, 3 Musketeers, 3 Amigos, Tiffany, among others. Nothing disappointed. Large portions for rolls. Remove all the frills and names that try too hard (Big Ten roll? ughs), and y're still left with fresh fish that's well prepared &amp; well executed.. . If y're as picky about yr Sushi as we were, Toro is worth the wait--2 hours &amp; 20 minutes in our case to be exact. But it was our first time there. We'll plan better next time (if not just do take out), but there's plenty of time of go to Borders/B&amp;N, pick up some spirits, or have dessert first at Molly's. They call you on yr cell when a table is ready. The space is tiiiiny and I can't imagine it being wheelchair friendly with all the folks in yr grill--whether seated next to you, standing &amp; waiting, or trying to get around you.. . Even with the wait times and space issues, Toro earns 5 stars. It's that good.
