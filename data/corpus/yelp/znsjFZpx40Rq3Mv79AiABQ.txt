The highlights of the meal included the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and my tender, juicy, simply scrumptious leg of veal.  A nice touch was when Wolfgang Puck came out to greet us.  When he asked me point-blank how I liked the food, I had of course just shoveled a huge chunk of veal in my mouth.  Obligated to tell him how much I enjoyed it, I mumbled through the baby cow "Rrrmmmmit's arggreaallyy delicioussrrrrr."  He kind of laughed at me and gave me a hug.  We shared several desserts, which were amazing as well.. . Supposedly overrated, yeah, yeah.  I had a very good meal here and would go back next time I'm in the area.  Service was a teeny bit snooty, but hey, it's LA.
