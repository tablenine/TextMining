Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
I love Gloria's Cafe. I stopped going to Versailles when I discovered this place. Compared to Gloria's Versailles is just nasty. The quality at Gloria's is so much better: the food of course, the service and the atmosphere. It's a very simple, casual place with excellent service that shows how committed the family is about their business. They do everything with a smile.. Their plantains are just DELICIOUS and I have them all the time. I also really like their fried fish, their prawns and their flour tortillas. Don't even get me started on their sour cream... yummy.
