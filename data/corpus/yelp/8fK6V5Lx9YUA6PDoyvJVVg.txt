After my recent string of reviews I've come to the realization that I just may eat too much pizza. Nah, there's no such thing as too much pizza. Plus at Taste I didn't order pizza, I just tried some of Katie's and Christina's pizzas. They were flat bread pies with really interesting toppings like fig jam. Both were all right, but I probably wouldn't order them myself on my next visit and I was much happier with my choice of the grilled cheese.. . The grilled cheese sandwich was the fancy variety and came with a cute little dipping cup of tomato soup on the side. I'm not a huge fan of tomato soup, but I am a sucker for novelty and presentation and this hit both points for me. . . We also ordered the mac and cheese to share, which I thought was just average, and the fries, which I thought were amazingly delicious. They were super thin and crispy homemade potato strips that I could have eaten hundreds of. In fact I kind of want to go back and eat some right now...
