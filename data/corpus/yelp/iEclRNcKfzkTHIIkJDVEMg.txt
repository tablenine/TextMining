This is a place that has bad service. In all of my experiences dining out at Korean Restaurants, this is by far the worst service EVER!. Even Super H Mart food court people act nicer and better than this staff.. . I thought this Restaurant was known for it's Fried Rice at the end of the meals?  Our table didn't get that special fried rice, we just got the check. I asked for water 3X for my  little daughters, and they didn't give it to me until like the fourth time I asked for water.. . The food was good, but I wouldn't go back there, because they were not nice to us. I saw them making the fried rice for all the other customers. And they wouldn't explain why they wouldn't do it for us.
