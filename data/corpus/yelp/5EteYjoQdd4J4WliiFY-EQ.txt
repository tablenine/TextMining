I went to Gilbert's for their brunch.  I have not had dinner there.  They serve brunch on Sat and Sunday from 11-3.  The brunch is $10.95 for all you care to eat.  The way it works is they give you a menu with about 15 items listed, and you pick 3 items that they cook to order.  You can do this as many times as you'd like.  The brunch food was really nothing to write home about.  The cheese grits were OK, but could have used some more cheese.  The biscuit and gravy was made with gyro meat.  If there had been more meat in the relatively tasteless gravy, it would have been better.  The bacon was tasty, but very greasy with not much meat, mostly fat.  Eh.. One of the good things about brunch here is that they have drink specials-- $4 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas.  They use Whiskey Willy's Bloody Mary Mix, which is probably my second favorite after Zing Zang.  They use a pretty cheap vodka, so the Mary wasn't fantastic, but for $4 it did the trick.  It's hard to mess up a mimosa, though, so those can be easily thrown down the hatch.   The servers and bartender were all very nice and accommodating.
