Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
Ah yes the mighty majestic, how many time I have visited you at 4am in the morning after making numerous bad decisions in regards to alcohol consumption. . . I wonder what this place is like during the day, Ill have to take your word for it because I have never been here when the sun is out. . . If you do go here I recommend the Gyro, it sounds weird for a dive diner to represent a greek classic as well as this place does, but I assure you its very, very good. . . And don't just take my word for it because I was slightly intoxicated, friends that are totally sober tried some if it and agreed. . . So see, there ya go.
