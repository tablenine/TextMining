Restaurant: Roebling Tea Room
Category: Coffee & Tea
There's something very special about setting things up to be as unintuitive as possible. For those that want a crash course in that very topic I suggest going to the Roebling Tea Room. Upon walking inside one realizes that this is the exact wrong place to go to do anything besides talk to one, and only one, other person.. . Did you think that perhaps you could order a tea at the counter? . . You thought wrong as fuck. You have to sit at a table and wait for one of the 5 waiters to stop chit-chatting and serve you some goddamn tea.. . Did you think that you could read a chapter or two of a book away from home?. . Well maybe re-think, because a jar of fireflies provides a more adequate light source to read by.. . Did you think you could get a check without seeming like a schmuck?. . Well then your logic circuits must be exploding like fireworks, because if a waiter doesn't even notice when there are people around to spend money, they certainly won't be intuitive enough to realize a person wants to get the fuck out.. . I was thinking about giving a pity star due to the fact that the tea was so good, but i think the effort of re-clicking the star meter would be more wisely used finding a better place to enjoy a cup of tea.
