I was reading a lot about this place and was hearing it was one of the best burgers in town.  I asked a friend if he wanted to go and he said he'd already been and he didn't like it that much.  Being a good friend he always is he still accompanied me as to satisfy my curiosity.  Unfortunately this trip didn't change his opinion and I agreed with him.  The burger did have some type of old fashion authenticity to it, but unfortunately that was not enough to make it a winner in my book.  Between the crowded place, the over pricing, and just a general pain in the neck about it, I was very disappointed in this place.
