Restaurant: Al Di La Trattoria
Category: Italian
A small yet amazing, italian restaurant with excellent food and fantastic service. Great for a romantic date or small group/family.. . The small bar / 3-4 table annex is usually mellow and quiet, almost private. While the main front dining room is bustling with activity, people and good views of the street and passerby's. . . Go for the food. Go. It is as good as anything Tuscany can offer.
