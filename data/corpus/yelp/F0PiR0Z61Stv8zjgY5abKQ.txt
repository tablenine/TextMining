Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Jerry's is okay. I enjoyed my sandwich.. they didn't skimp on the turkey and the pretzel roll was quite good. I enjoyed the sides as well, its nice to have more choices than the typical chips or fries. The mashed potatoes are good and so is the mac and cheese. Stay away from the cornbread however, its awful.. it was like eating a yellow brick. I tried splitting it in half and it broke into a million hard crumbled pieces. Such a bad menu decision.. . I would have given Jerry's 3 stars, but I gave it 4 simply because the guy who sat next to me was the worst person ever. He was on a date and kept going on and on about his ex-gf. My quote of choice is shown below:. "she was 6 feet tall, REAL busty, brown-blonde hair, green eyes..". Who the hell describes someone as REAL busty?! I was really trying hard not to listen (and laugh), but it was like watching one of those embarassing date game shows on tv. This guy also said he likes the cornbread here, which tells you you should skip it.
