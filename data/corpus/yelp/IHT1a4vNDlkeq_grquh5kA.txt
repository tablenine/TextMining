Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
The Magic Castle offers a really delicious brunch. The spread is huge -- the usual offerings, a carving station, tons of fresh fish and cheese, an omelette station, and fresh waffles. Everything is fantastic, and the wait staff is always friendly and entertaining as well.. . Of course, the Castle itself is quite a treat. There's so much detail in every corner of the building, and the magic is always excellent. I look forward to my trips here with my magician friend. It's a wonderful place with great food.
