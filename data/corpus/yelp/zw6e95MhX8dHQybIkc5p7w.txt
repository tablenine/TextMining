Service was good but food was about average. I had the chicken kabobs, which were ok, and the hummus, which again was ok.  The bread was good, but it's sort of hard to screw up bread.  . . For the most part, I thought the food lacked a bit in flavor and seasoning.  For the money (granted, we came as a big group and split the check evenly), some people thought Pita Inn was a better value.
