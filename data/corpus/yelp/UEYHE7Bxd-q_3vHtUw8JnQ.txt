Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I love korean bbq!!!  I think I was korean in another life.  I have never been to an AYCE place so my man and I ventured out to find a great one.  And boy did we ever!!!  I loved this place.  First off, the side dishes were the bomb.  The little salad was really good, the egg soup was awesome. and there was this little bowl of dried fishy stuff that was amazing. The cuts of meat were really great.  We loved everything except the intestines.  Kind of chewy for my taste.  God bless my guy!  I love trying new eating adventures and I know he thinks I'm off my rocker at times but he still comes along for the food ride.  Anyway, I love this place.  It was really cool we got to cook our meat the way we liked it and dip it into the sauces.  The staff was very friendly even though they spoke little english.  I can't wait to go back!!!
