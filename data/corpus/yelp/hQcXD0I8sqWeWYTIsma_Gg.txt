My friend and I dropped by Krog Bar one evening after going to the Botanical Garden to see the work of Nikki Saint Phalle.  The server was apparently unimpressed with our attire and spoke condescendingly to us for the majority of the evening, despite the fact that we ordered several glasses of wine and multiple tapas between the two of us.  . . We enjoyed the three cheese tasting plate, lomo, ahi tuna, smoked salmon finger sandwiches, and a few other tapas before ordering gelato and dark chocolate bruschetta for dessert.  Though the food was very good, I will probably never return due to the service.  There are other tapas places with much friendlier staff.
