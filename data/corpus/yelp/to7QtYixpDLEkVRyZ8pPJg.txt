My boyfriend took me here for NYE and boy was I a spoiled girl that night.  We were seated at a lovely table and was promptly greeted by our wonderful server.  We were served so many courses, six at least and they were all impeccable.  My favorite bite of the night was the foie gras.  I had the Wagyu beef which was really delicious.  It was a magical night of great wine, great service and spectacular food.  I really couldn't think of a better way to have ended the old year.
