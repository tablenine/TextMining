From Holland to NYC this place is always a go to spot if I'm in the area. Great salad bar as you customize your falafel sandwich. Always fresh whole wheat or white pitas. Not to heavy and nicely crunchy falafels and endless toppings! . Hook up a little Garlic sauce and some Sweet potatoes fries you won't regret it.. Only thing missing is a little heat! (better hot sauce)
