Totally subpar, fairly rude staff, and the wait is forever.  What's more, I once went there and waited 45 minutes with a group of people holding multiple, visible bottles of wine, only be be seated at an outside table and promptly informed that the outdoor tables weren't byob.  How's that for service?!. . A place for taking obnoxious, picky out-of-towners who want to feel kind of cool while eating mall food.
