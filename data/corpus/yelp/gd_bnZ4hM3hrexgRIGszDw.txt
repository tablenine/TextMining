Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I had the Special 2 with Miso base and I really like it! If you like hot spicy foods like me, the Special 2 is probably not as spicy as you'd anticipate. However, the bowl is HUGE. So if you intent to make your mark on the Wall of Bravery, it will be the portion that kills you, not the spiciness. . . I have a hard time finding a good ramen place since I don't live near Little Tokyo, so I go to the Vietnamese alternative Pho. Also, unlike Pho, ramen tends to be overly plain and bland with very little meat and garnishing. So why would I pay the same price or sometimes more when I"m getting less food? . . At Orochon, the flavorful soup base is harmoniously paired with the egg noodle. It has just the right amount of meat (by adding pork to my order) and garnishing Â to create this delish dish and make me a satisfied yelper.
