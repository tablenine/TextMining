I, like the majority of fellower reviewers, LOVED the food here.  I don't have much to add about the place in general or about the meat, but I must mention two things:. . 1.  Awesome cole slaw -- fresh cabbages with cilantro.  Yeah, it's good.  As out waitress put it, "I don't even like cole slaw and I like it.". . 2.  Great collard greens -- even though they aren't "southern style".  Well, actually, *because* they aren't southern style -- they are *fresh*, not shredded, and lightly sauteed, with a hint of frech lemon.  Delish.
