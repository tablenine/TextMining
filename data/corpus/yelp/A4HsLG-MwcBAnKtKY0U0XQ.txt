I love LA but when it comes to food I must tip my hat in respect to NY. . . A few more places like Mozza and I won't have to fly across the country anymore (unless I want decent public transportation). . . You can't go wrong here but definately get:.  - Grilled octopus .  - Pick a pasta.  - Mozzarella tasting.  - A bottle of wine. . Also, the service is top notch.
