Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I recently tried Geisha House for the first time, and I wish someone would have told me to go there sooner. We had a number of the items on their menu. We started out with the garlic edema me. This was one of the main highlights of the meal. They had the perfect amount of soy sauce, garlic and salt on them, and were very tender. Then we tried the Beef Robata with asparagus which was also very good. Their sushi was pretty average. The best roll that we had ordered was the red rocket. We also had the cowboy roll and the geisha kiss. I'd recommend checking this place out. . . On a side note, this is a good place for random celebrity sitings. Does anyone remember the owner from that terrible TV show called Sunset Tan? He was there with some random blonds with huge tits.
