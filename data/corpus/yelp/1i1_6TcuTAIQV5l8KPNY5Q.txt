Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
We went to Griddle Cafe on a Saturday around 12:30.  We were told it would be about a 25 min wait for a table for two, and it was just about 25 mins.  When our name came up we sat outside, we could have sat inside, but the wait would be longer.  If you can avoid outside on the weekend you should because all the people waiting, are waiting outside, surrounding your table!  Watching you eat.  The staff at Griddle Cafe tried to prevent this by asking the people repeatedly to move away from the tables &amp; form a line on the other side of the tree.  However, as more people would arrive they would unknowingly stand right in front of your table.  . . The food here is great.  . . We had:. . Coffee. Fresh OJ. Side of Bacon. The Yellow Brick Road. The Peanut Budda French Toast. . Our bill with tax and tip was about 50$. All were yummy.  But next time we will order 1 sweet pancake or french toast item &amp; an egg item, too avoid all that sugar.  We only finished like 1/4 of each item and we were on sugar overload.  . . The food and staff were fab! We will eat here again and sit inside next time.
