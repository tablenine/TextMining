I hate waiting in line, and once in a long while I will actually wait in line for these tasty morsels.  The best part of the dumpling is the skin.  It is very delicate and their flavors are clean, so you dont feel heavy after consumption.  As thin as the skin is, their dumplings are also sturdy enough to hold the juices in the pork dumplings  It does get very crowded but it is good while it lasts.  Their chicken noodles in soup is also very good with their other side dishes in accompany to their dumplings.
