Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Now if your from NY you will not like Pinks because its not as good as Nathans in Coney Island, but I like it just as well and it comes in second in my book and first for sure in Los Angeles.. . My advice.... Order only the HOT DOG or the Chili Dog, stay away from the sausage dogs of fancy topped dogs.. . The sausage although tasty is a bit dry.   The topping fall off and I would recomend keeping your Dog simple.   Either a Chili Cheese and Onion Dog or a Hot dog with regular Hot Dog toppings.  The meat in the weiners were great.. . Now the experience of Pinks was great.   We went a few nights ago and the line was fairly long.   It was cold and everyone was waiting to get thier Hot Dog.   Everyone was talking about what to order, we met a chef behind us whose girlfriend had come from San Fran, to have a date.   They went to Pinks and he was from NY and admitted to the dismay of his Girlfriend that Nathans was the best but said this was second in his book and we have to agree.. . I think the fun of Pinks is the long line, the waiting for the Hot Dog the people and the whole experience.   It was FUN !  Im not a big Hot Dog fan but will go again if invited.
