mmmMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!. . thats all i can remember myself saying while stuffing my race with chicken and waffles.  this was surprisingly the first time i've ever been here.  definitely wont be the last.  i can just imagine the deliciousness inside roscoe's kitchen.  makes my mouth water from the thought of that delicious syrup and chicken.. . we got the corn bread and a plate for each of us and it was MORE than enough!  i wanted to get everything on the menu, but i had to catch a flight at LAX.. next time for sure i want to get the greens, and the yams..... . ....they just need a roscoes in the bay area....CMON!!!!!!!!
