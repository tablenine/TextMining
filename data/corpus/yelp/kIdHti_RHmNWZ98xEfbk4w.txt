Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Okay.. I'm guilty for not eating ramen at ramen restaurants.  I wanted to check out this restaurant after so many reviews and watching Man vs. Food on the Travel Chanel burn up his face with the spicy ramen.  So, I'm more of a fried rice eater than a ramen eater.  Shoot me!! So, I ordered the spicy fried rice and I could tell you that's on top of my list as one of the best Japanese fried rice I've had.  A bit sticky rice with egg and pork.  Sorry Kouraku...  This place is a bit hard to find located on Weller Court.  A small restaurant with outside seating and a bit of people waiting in line.  Overall, it was worth the wait..
