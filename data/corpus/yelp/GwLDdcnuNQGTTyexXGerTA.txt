ok....whoever came up with the idea for this place is very clever!  We love this place because you find super cheap desserts and all of them have classic tastes with a twist.  The ice cream sandwiches are amazing, but nothing more amazing than their blueberry cornbread!  Im southern so I can appreciate good cornbread!  You must sample ALL the ice creams when you go, the flavors are ridiculous.  Much love to you MILK! xo
