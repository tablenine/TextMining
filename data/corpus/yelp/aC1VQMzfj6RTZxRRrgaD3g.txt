Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
After a botched attempt at going to Mojito's, decided to try Papi's instead to get a "cuban fix".  It had been about 6 or 7 years since the last time I had cuban food, so while I remember it being good, I didnt actually remember much else about it.. . I was highly impressed with the food at Papis.  I ordered the Roasted Garlic pork dinner (the Thursday special), that comes with Rice and beans, salad and sweet plantains.  I also ordered a beef empanada and  extra plantains.  . . The Pork was absolutely fantastic.  It tasted like it had been marinating in garlic for hours, and they seemed to find the appropriate balance of flavor....The plantains and rice and beans were fantastic as well.  The extra side that I ordered came in handy, but honestly, I can eat plantains all day.. . The empanada was good, but not great.  I didnt really know what to expect, but the menu seemed to suggest that this was something it really wasnt...good, but not great.. . I also got the Caribbean milkshake, which basically has guava, mango, and a bunch of other stuff i cant remember.  Extremely tasty!. . I agree with Carolyn B.  The service is extremely anti social, but I am thinking perhaps its a cultural thing?  Or maybe the cashier was just being a jerk, but he seemed very disinterested in my eating experience.  The interesting thing is, the places with really good food can get away with this....so, I guess Ill have to let Papi's slide.. . Amazing:)
