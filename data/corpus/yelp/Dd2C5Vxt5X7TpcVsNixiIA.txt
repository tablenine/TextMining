I dig Metrofresh.  If I could go every day, I probably would.  The menu changes daily and some days are better than others, but I've never tried anything and thought "oh wow this is gross."  I love love love their soups and their mayo-less versions of tuna and chicken salad. They have a good balance of healthy and "normal" choices, so your boyfriend won't compain when you want to meet him here for lunch.  Unless he sucks.   Pleasant staff and nice bright atmosphere w/ outdoor seating too. Go!
