Falafel is great, and I love that they also offer wheat pita.  . . Best thing about Moaz is the toppings bar though.  The fried broccoli/cauliflower, the sauces, the slaw... Problem is that I can't fit everything that I want into the pita, and it also gets kind of messy to eat, but who cares?  It's so good.. . The falafel is a bit pricier than other places, but the toppings bar is worth it.  Fries are great too.
