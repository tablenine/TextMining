Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I wouldn't stand in an hour line for it but if there's only a few people ahead of me, I'll order one or two.  I love their hot dogs.  It snaps when you bite into it.  I like topping it with bacon; that's right, pork on top of more pork.  When I was in elementary school, I was a pretty literal kid so I got into a little argument with a friend about hot dogs being made out of dog.  haha, weird that I thought it was dog but was still willing to eat it.
