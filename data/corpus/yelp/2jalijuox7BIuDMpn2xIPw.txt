Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I stood in line for exactly 1 hr and 35 minutes (9:25pm to 11pm) on a Sat nite..  i thought to myself this wait should be worth it since there are so many people in line.   I felt like I was waiting in line for a club.  By the time I got my hot dog (muhammad dog), although i ordered a Planet Hollywood dog (they got my order wrong!) I was not blown away at all in fact I was wishing that Costco was open so I could get a hot dog there.  I love the history of the place and the great concept of filling a lot of crap in a hot dog, but this place isn't for me.
