Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
To know El Tepeyac is to know burrito perfection. . . This little cafe hidden in the outskirts of E.LA has established itself as Burrito mecca. People from all over the county come to this place for one thing only. To enjoy the best burrito's in L.A. . . I have never actually conquered a full burrito. The massive size of these tank like beef wraps are just to much for me. Â Damn this feeble stomach of mine! This is no regular burrito my friends, this is infact the mother of all burritos. . . Theres usually a long line on the weekends, but if you call your order in you'll save yourself some trouble. SOme people are a tad hesitant to visit the area, but rest assured you'll be safe. This place is frequented by a steady and loyal folowing of L.A.P.D officers.
