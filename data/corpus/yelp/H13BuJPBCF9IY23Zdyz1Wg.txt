There's no shortage of good falafels in this city... Rafiqi, Chickpea, Mamouns, Cinderellas, etc...  but I think I've found my fave: Maoz.  And on my most recent trip there, I learned that they now deliver... yay!  I sense a new place in my lunch rotation.  . . I've had several different items here but the best way to go is the Salad Box.  You can get it on its own or as a combo "meal deal" for a few bucks more, which gets you eggplant, hummus, and a juice drink.  I'm not a huge eggplant fan so I usually go for the Salad Box a la carte and a side order of pita bread.  Once I get my salad bowl (bed of chopped lettuce w/ 5 falafel balls perfectly crispy and delicious), I stuff that thing w/ all sorts of goodies from their small, but interesting, self-service salad bar.  Almost everything is great... and goes really well w/ falafel... but the standouts are the following: broccoli &amp; cauliflower (I really don't like cauliflower but theirs is amazingly good), cous cous, cucumber salad, and the pickled red cabbage.  The cole slaw and carrots are the ones I didn't really care for.  They also offer some good sauces too... esp the garlic cream sauce.  A bit heavy so don't go too crazy with it.. . The falafel is great... on its own, in a pita sandwich, or as part of the salad.  I also love their pita bread... nice &amp; thick &amp; super soft.  The hummus is pretty good too (as long as I don't compare it to Hummus Place).  I didn't care much for the Belgian Fries, which is fine by me since I'm getting my fill of fried foods with the falafel.  Just when I feel a bit guilty about consuming all of the five deep-fried falafel balls, I take solace in the fact that I ordered a "salad" and am getting my fair share of veggies... even cauliflower!  My mom would be so proud....
