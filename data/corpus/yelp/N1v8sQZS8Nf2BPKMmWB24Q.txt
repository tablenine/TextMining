Restaurant: Nava
Category: Tex-Mex
Before going to Nava I had heard that the food was pretty good, but the patio was the star of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to go for a relaxing Monday night dinner. (I had had trouble getting a reservation the past weekend and was told the patio was first come first serve.) The host was accomidating when we arrived sitting us on the patio despite their only being 1 big table available. Service was pretty good.. . Each of us enjoyed our glass of wine and the blue corn bread. I have to say we didn't enjoy the ceasare salad much, but the tortilla soup was fantastic. It had big pieces of avacado which was a perfect addition to the soup. He ordered lamb and appreciated the option to substitute his side. I loved my scallops with tomato grits. Really fantastic flavor combinations and beautiful presentation.. . While Nava is an expensive restaurant, the entrees are almost big enough for two people and they use high quality ingredients. I would defiately go back.
