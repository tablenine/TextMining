I must have passed by this restaurant so many times but never knew it. Thank goodness for Groupon for bringing it to my attention!. . For Mexican in this area, I usually stop by La Perez but tonight we thought we'd check out the competition. We're definitely glad we stopped in. The menu is pretty extensive and the descriptions of the dishes made my mouth water! We ordered guacamole, carne asada, chorizo taco, and braised duck taco.  For dessert we had the white chocolate brownie with chocolate chip ice cream.. . Everything tasted really delicious and great.  Except for maybe the braised duck. Maybe my expectations for it were too high? But all the yelpers said to get it. So I got it! It tasted rather bland and dry. I had to smoother it with guacamole to juice it up a bit and still couldnt finish it. . . The wait staff was extremely friendly. They constantly monitored whether we needed a refill in our drinks (the horchata is delicious!) or chips (they refilled it even though we had 1/4 of a basket left!). And they took away our plates quickly after we had finished. . . Overall we had a great experience. Its a little pricey for Mexican food but for the quality and freshness of food and a great wait staff, I think its definitely worth it.
