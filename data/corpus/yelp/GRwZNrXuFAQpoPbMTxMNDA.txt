I'm so relieved.. . This place is a huge disappointment. I was excited to visit this BBQ joint in the Highlands that I had never really taken notice of before. I went with a date to a special "moonshine night" event on the evening of the 2010 Oscars. We ordered a little bit of everything plus a few moonshine martinis. Needless to say, I was pumped.. . Then the food came.... . My relief stems from the fact that I didn't discover great BBQ mere blocks away from my house. If I had, I'd probably have to visit once a week and I'd turn into a huge lard ass. Instead, I found DBA to have lackluster, generally flavorless BBQ that made my mouth water for Buz and Ned's back in old VA (the state, not the Highlands).. . The ribs were small with very little meat. The pulled pork was mushy and flavorless. The brisket was way too dry. To give credit where credit is due, the mac 'n' cheese side was exceptional.. . Also, our waiter wouldn't leave us alone. It seemed like he thought my date was cute or something. I mean, she is, but still... not really sure what that was about. Let me eat my mediocre BBQ in peace, man.
