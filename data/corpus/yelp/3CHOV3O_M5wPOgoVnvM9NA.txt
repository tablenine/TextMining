This is a great place! A friend suggested we go here as it's one of her favorite places and to be frank, I had my doubts.  . . The pork belly was out of this world... melts in your mouth and the "party bomb" (sushi selection of tuna, eel, salmon, and spicy salmon) was all great... we shared many dishes and there were more than a couple of stand-outs.  The only thing I didn't like were the mini stuffed mushroom caps... and the weird wet-mop/musty mold spell in the "garden" area.. . I'd return despite how out of the way this place is...
