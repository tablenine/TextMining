Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
So, I love sushi, but I kind of don't see what the big deal is about Tank. When I first moved to Lincoln Square, one of my roommates and I set out on a Friday night, hoping to try some new awesome place in the square. We decided on Tank as we both love sushi!. . Upon first glance at the menu, we realized that this was a very overpriced sushi place. I've been to a LOT of sushi restaurants, and have paid way less for better sushi. The sushi we got was fine, but just not great. Nothing memorable or that blew us away. And we ate less because of the price!. . I have to give it props for the location and ambiance. The inside is pretty cool, and we sat outside, which was lovely. So, that part is nice, but I don't think I'll be back to try the sushi anytime soon.
