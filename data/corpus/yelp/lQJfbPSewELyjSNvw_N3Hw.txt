Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
There are only a handful of sushi restaurants in LA where the chef still goes to the fish market early each morning to pick out each piece of glorious fish.  Sushi Gen is one of them.. . The staff here is incredibly friendly and the service is excellent.. They do take reservations which is very helpful on a Friday night.. . Great place to grab sushi before heading to staples center.. . Things to try: The Japanese snapper with lemon and the toro (the best and fattiest in LA!). . Sushi-Gen is the real deal.  In fact I really shouldn't be telling you about it, you're going to ruin my spot!
