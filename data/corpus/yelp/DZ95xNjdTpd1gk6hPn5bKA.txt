The bf surprised me for my birthday by taking us here! I've been wanting to go here for a few months and have been pleased with the other two churrascarias I've been to. . . Let's start with the salad bar. Now that I know how to manage my appetite after a few experiences, I knew to dabble with just a few things at the bar. The fresh mozzarella and tomato was delicious and I could have sat there eating just that. But what a waste of money that would've been.. . The service and meat were outstanding. I forgot what type of wine I ordered, but it came in a little bottle. From bringing it to me, to opening it, to placing it on the table (the label facing me), filling my glass with it, the waiter did not miss a beat! My bf's soda was replaced just as nicely. I say replaced, b/c it came in a bottle and isn't included in the price of the dinner. It's little touches like these that made the experience that much greater. and we will definitely be going back. . . My favorites are the picanha and filet mignon wrapped in bacon.
