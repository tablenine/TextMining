When I first came here with my girlfriends last year, it was total Hollywood glam.  A few of them were from out of town and they thought that this is what my life has turned too- from Columbia, to hobnobbing with the likes of Paris, Lindsey, and Britney - yikes!   . . The bouncer was nice enough to let us in through the line.  However, I felt really bad for all those people standing in the cold waiting and still waiting when we finally left.  When we got in, it felt like we were at someone's house (albeit much hipper) and they were having a dance party in the patio area.  . . We finagled our way upstairs with help from some gentlemen with the "Give me a call I can introduce you to a friend who can help you out lines" as if we were actresses/models rather than nerdy finance/marketing girls.  However, we left after it got too much when they were offering something rather stronger than liquor. . . Anyways, the drinks were rather expensive but we only paid once since we were invited to a table - thanks to my girlfriend Dakota with her southern charm which seems to work anywhere.
