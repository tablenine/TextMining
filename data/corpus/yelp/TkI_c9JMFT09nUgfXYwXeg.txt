Just went here for dinner with the bf and it was yum. I got one of the skirt steaks, medium rare (and they actually cooked it medium rare!). The fries were tasty and crispy and our server was super nice. Minus one star for how packed the tables are - 2 different tables of people got my ass and my purse in their faces as I tried to get out from my seat when we were done. Apologies to the purse-getters. The ass-getters thanked me.
