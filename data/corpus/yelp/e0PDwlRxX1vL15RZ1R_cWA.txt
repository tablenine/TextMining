Restaurant: La CrÃªperie
Category: French
This is the best crepe restaurant in Chicago. The owner is hot and french and a little bit gay!. . One of my favorite places to eat in the summer, as they a cozy romantic back patio where you can sip wine and snuggle with your boyfriend. Gay couples are welcome here.. . Love the boeuf bourguignon (stewed beef in red wine sauce) filled crepe, and the chocolate, strawberry ice cream crepe makes a delicious dessert.
