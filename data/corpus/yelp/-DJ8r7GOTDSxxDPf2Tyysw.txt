Didn't disappoint. (too much). . I ordered the pork and beef taco's, and the pork burrito. Pork is definitely the way to go. The beef taco's weren't special enough for the $2.00 two-bites-and-it's-gone taco's. I probably wouldn't come back, but that's only because I can have korean-style spicy pork at home. And it's expensive. . . Worth going just for the fun of tracking it down with good company, and the PORK anything. . . Oh and I had a bite of the Kimchi Quesadillas: An explosion of flavor pleasantly dancing around on my tongue. Too bad they're so overpriced. $6 (or something) for kimchi and cheese??. . Still. Delicious is delicious.
