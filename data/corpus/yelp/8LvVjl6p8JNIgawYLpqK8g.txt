Restaurant: P&#39;cheen
Category: American (New)
I wasn't really impressed with P'Cheen. I ordered the hamburger, and was really surprised it was as sup-par as it was; considering that it was $11. I am fine with paying for food, but I guess when you know so many good places to eat for pretty cheap, that I am always disappointed when I go to a place that I spend about $20 on dinner and drinks, and am at least slightly disappointed.. . The location is nice, and the inside was cute. Our waiter was awesome, and they have $2 PBR, which is a plus. However, the curry smell was almost overwhelming, and as such, I had to leave before I was overtaken by the sickness it was unfortunately causing me.. . I am sure that there are plenty of people that will adore this place, and disagree with me wholeheartedly, but I am just giving me honest opinion here folks; P'Cheen isn't the place for me. I'm glad that I got to go, but I doubt I will go back anytime soon.
