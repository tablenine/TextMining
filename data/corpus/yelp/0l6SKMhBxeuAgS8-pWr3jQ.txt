I've only been to their bakery and I'm in love. Everything I've tried from the case has been decadent and the best whatever-it-was I've had. Most recently I had a slice of their Sacher Torte. It was unbelievable. . . Their espresso beverages are also well made. I have not been disappointed. . . It does get busy and tight in the bakery area though. Especially with people waiting to be seated in the restaurant, but in my experience the baristas and others behind the counter have been friendly and attentive. I definitely recommend the bakery.
