Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
The ambience is soft and romantic, a very charming "French" quality to the place.  Soft lights, light music, oak tables...they just exude a sense of peace.  I really like to just sit and talk amongst friends.. . The crepes are excellent, whether you choose savory or sweet.  My friends loved their ratatouille crepe and seafood crepe (I don't know the specific name, but it tasted a bit like clam chowder).  I enjoy the sweet crepes here.  Crepe suzette is delicious.  But you can't go wrong with any of them.. . The service is excellent, and they are helpful about recommending crepes on the types of vegetables, fruits, etc. that you like.  I will most def be returning!
