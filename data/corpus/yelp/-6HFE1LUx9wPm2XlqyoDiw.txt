Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
I've been here twice, both times there was an extremely long wait to be served. It might cost 20x more than "top" but it is so much better. Daikokuya is also one of the few places open for late night food in downtown, so big points for that. I wish they did to go food.. . First time I was here, I ordered the regular ramen. Last time I got the kichi men, which is their slightly more "flavorful" variant on their ramen base. I liked the regular ramen better. The kichi men was wayyyy to salty. That egg is the tastiest hardboiled egg I have ever had. I hear you can order the egg with different firmness than the standard fully cooked; i will have to try it more runny next time.
