Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I love fried chicken and waffles. It might sound like a novelty but ever since my friend Annie took me to try Roscoe's a few years ago, I have always been in love with Roscoe's. Except for the bad service and ridiculously long wait at the Long Beach location. This location however has people wait outside rather than inside so it keeps the hungry patrons and the actual people eating separate. . . There is a security guard who stands outside and calls you in when you're table is ready. Service is way much better here than other locations and the fried chicken is definitely big and juicy. I had no complaints with mine which was the fried chicken breast which I believe is the Carol C. special I think? Other cool things about this place is all the frame photos of celebrities with autographs. Man, they have a huge following at this location. Good times and good hand lickin' chicken!
