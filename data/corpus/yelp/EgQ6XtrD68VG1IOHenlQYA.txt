I agree with Kim, the guacamole here is the best I've ever had.  Exactly as she describes, it's a chunky-cool concoction with the perfect amount of tangy tomato, onion and fresh cilantro.  Fantastic! . . Los Nopales is BYOB so be sure to stop at Leland Liquors for a six-pack of ice cold Corona.  The folks at Los Nopales will even supply the limes! . . I'd definitely recommend the skirt steak.  It will not disappoint- the perfect amount of tender, juicy steak, cooked to perfection.  The sides are great too.  Way better than average here. . . You see so many Mexican restaurants in the city and it is my firm belief that most can be passed by (see King of Burritos).   This one, however, should be at the top of your list.
