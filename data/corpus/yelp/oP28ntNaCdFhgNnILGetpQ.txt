Restaurant: Craft
Category: American (New)
Craft is the new spot for the power players of LA.  It helps that its right at the base of the CAA offices.  Where else can you combine LA County Sherrif Lee Baca and Ed Burns.. . It's not the best steak I've ever had...but it's DAMN good.  Tom Colicchio does an amazing job of creating and interesting dining experience with his very unique and inventive menu.  . . The decor of the restaurant is gorgeous - the outdoor patio is an added bonus of warm LA nights.. . It's definitely a great place to have a very special dinner.
