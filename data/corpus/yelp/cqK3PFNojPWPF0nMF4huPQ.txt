I don't want to like Fred 62.  It's so hipster and cool and a place to be seen.  But each time I end up there with friends, I really like the food!  Good burgers, good breakfasts, good desserts.  It's always well-prepared.  The service is surprisingly good, too.  I'm not supposed to enjoy something so hip, am I?  I suppose I'll just give in and order a milkshake... . . Update: recently I tried the Super Rico sandwich.  How do you improve upon the tuna melt, the most perfect sandwich?  Deep-fry it!  That's right, dip a tuna mixture in beer batter and fry it.  Simply amazing; perfect hangover food.  (Side note: I developed an allergic reaction to something in it and started wheezing.  But it was so damn good I'd risk wheezing again.)
