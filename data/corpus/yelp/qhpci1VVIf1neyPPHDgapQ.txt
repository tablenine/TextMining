I've been to Ciudad twice now and I love it. The drinks are pricey but unique. I had a Cava Mimosa on during the Mother's Day brunch that reminded me of a Kir Royale except lighter and fruitier. My husband had a Pomegranate Ginger Mojito that was incredibly fresh tasting and delicious. Same goes for the food. I really enjoyed the Peruvian style ceviche. Peruvian style ceviche happens to be something I make myself quite frequently but I will admit that Ciudad improves on my recipe. The cajeta flan was incredible and the tres leches cake was out of this world. . Both times I've been to Ciudad I've been impressed by the service which is friendly and efficient. The only complaint I've got is that even with validation parking is $5. Â Good food I don't mind paying for but parking I'm cheap about.
