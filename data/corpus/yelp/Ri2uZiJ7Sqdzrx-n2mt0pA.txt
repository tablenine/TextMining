Wow this place already has 600+ reviews, so I guess I won't be telling you anything new.. I got a recommendation to check out Sushi Gen as an authentic sushi joint.  I took my mom to eat here.  She grew up in Japan so I trust her opinion on how authentic/good a Japanese place is. . We went on a Monday around 11:30 am and the wait was going to be 1 hour.  I say, put your name down and walk down Alameda to the shopping mall.  Since you will probably always be waiting to go in, definitely park in their lot because they will validate parking so the parking will be minimal (much better than the meters).. We later found out that we could have been seated earlier if we wanted the bar.  We ended up sitting at the bar where there's a 4 sushi pieces minimum and no lunch specials are served there as well (which seemed popular).. . I thought the sushi was good and fresh.  My mom thought it was amaaaazzzing.  I absolutely fell in love with our sushi chef.  An old Japanese man with a ton of personality and knew what he was doing.. The host was not so nice and the other servers seemed frazzled.. . Next time I go, I will definitely order the scallop sashimi.  I saw someone order it, and they are litterally cutting it out of the shell in front of you- amazing!
