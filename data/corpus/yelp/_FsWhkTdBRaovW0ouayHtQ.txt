Why do people still even go here? . The food is sub par.. The food is over priced.. The drinks are Okay. I had good sake and the martinis aren't too bad.. . Trust me, Leave the dining experience to the tourists.. If you must check out Geisha house, grab one drink at the bar and move on.... You will Thank me Later.
