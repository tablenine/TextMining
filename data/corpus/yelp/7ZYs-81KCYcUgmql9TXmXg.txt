Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Prefacing this review with my background:  I've lived in Japan for 5 months, LOVE sushi, and have been lucky enough to sample sushi from well over 50+ sushi restaurants in over 8 or 9 different countries.   Needless to say, i'm very picky when it comes down to it... . Geisha house is VERY simple:. . If you want a place to hang out with friends, be loud, do sake bombs, and have some sushi before you go out and party in Hollywood, GO HERE.  It's decent, but nothing to write home (or yelp) about.. . If you want genuinely delicious, fresh, and gourmet sushi, and don't mind a less "party-like" atmosphere, try one of the other 10 million other sushi restaurants in the area that are SIGNIFICANTLY better.  . . -Wa Sushi &amp; Bistro. -Katsuya (which is also just as hip, maybe a bit more expensive, but DEFINITELY WAY BETTER). -Matsuhisa. -Urasawa
