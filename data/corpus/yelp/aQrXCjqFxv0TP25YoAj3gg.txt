Burgers are definitely over-hyped. Don't get me wrong these are pretty good burgers and as many people say they melt in your mouth, but that being said I've had much better and if you're hungry, the size of this burger will not fill you up. Also, this place doesn't believe in ketchup, which is complete BS. How the am I suppose to eat my fries without ketchup? There is a solid selection of beers, but finding seating on a busy night takes a while and can be a pain.
