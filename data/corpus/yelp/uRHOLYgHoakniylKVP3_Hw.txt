I am going to keep updating this review as I try new dessert items.. . See's Candy Bundt Cake (white icing) - this is a seriously good chocolate cake.  I don't get much, if any, See's candy flavor, but I don't really care.  I really really like this one.  They have a version with chocolate icing too.. . Bread Pudding - this doesn't look that great, but is seriously good.  I am kinda of a bread pudding snob and I really like this.  Even the little chocolate bits in it (normally a Bad Thing) are really dang good.. . Lemon Bundt Cake - not bad, but not nearly lemony enough.  It helped to think of it as yellow cake with a touch of lemon.. . Chocolate Dulce de Leche thingy - this round little hemisphere looked quite appealing.  Unfortunately it is filled with some tasteless goo.  It felt like getting a bad desert from room service.  Not getting this again.. . Apple Pie Cheesecake - I am not a big cheesecake fan, but this was really nice.  The cheesecake was super creamy, not at all like most 'factory' cheesecake.  The apple pie part was nice a cinnamon-y and flavorful; it worked well to make the cheesecake more interesting.. . Peach Cheesecake - pretty much like the Apple Pie Cheesecake, except that instead of the yummy apple pie topping it had mediocre canned peach filling.  I would not get this again.. . Pumpkin Cheesecake - after scraping off the icky whipped cream layer, this was an excellent item.  It was very creamy, light, and full of pumpkin flavor.. . Pumpkin Bundt Cake - a big disappointment.  The icing was hard, too sweet, and tasted artificial. The cake was a bit dried out.  I think if the cake were fresh and it had a nice sour or cream cheese frosting it would be a lot better.
