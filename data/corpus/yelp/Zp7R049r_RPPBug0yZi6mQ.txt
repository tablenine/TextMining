Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I am not all that impressed with the food served by 'the Wieners circle' its okay, not great. I think they realize how drunk most of the yuppies that eat here really are and just serve whatever.. . I will give this place three stars because one of the employees called my friend a 'Don knotts looking motherfucker' for asking about the menu too much. He does really look like Don Knotts though! Thank you sassy black girl for that relevation
