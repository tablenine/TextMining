The best fried chicken in my life. I've never had chicken breast so juicy ever. The breading was fried to perfection. They even make a discreet cut for you down the breast for easy carving. Next time I'm in Atlanta, I am definitely returning back here for their chicken. . . You can park in the lot across the street or find meter parking.
