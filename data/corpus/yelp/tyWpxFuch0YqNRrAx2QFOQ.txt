Restaurant: The Water Grill
Category: Seafood
Arguably one of the best seafood restaurants in L.A, Water Grill offers both elegance and outstanding food. The Water Grill is the definition of fine dining. The atmosphere is intimate yet inviting, superb wine selection, and world class fish. . . You really have to try a little bit of everything here to truly appreciate the quality of the food. Perhaps trying the "fruits of the sea platter" would be a good way to start. The tuna also excellent but my favorite would probably have to be the Alaskan Halibut. Â This place is a fish lovers paradise.. . Like most fine restaurants the portions at Water Grill are extremely small. You have to have a five course meal to fill your stomach and enjoy your dining experience. The five course meals can get extremely pricey, but you do get what you pay for.. . Water Grill is not a restaurant I frequently visit, but certainly a place to go for special occasions.
