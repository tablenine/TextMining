Was there last night for restaurant week. . . I don't know why I haven't been to this trendy restaurant yet but I'm very glad I finally did. . . Unlike other posh Japanese places the decor of this restaurant is very intimate, warm and cozy.  There is a small bar at the reception area with amazing drinks and sake.  a dining area behind the reception and another dining room after you take the elevator to i think 3rd floor? (I wasn't counting someone else pressed the button :) . . Very comfortable booths (and cushions) with bold decorations of tall branches as background pieces against the wall.  Combined with dim lighting it is a perfect place for a date or a small group gathering between 4-8 people.  . . It was not too crowded but definitely busy even at 9:30.  I like the table setup where you will not bump into anyone else or being in the way for serving.  . . We had the restaurant week sample menu which was actually pretty amazing, especially the fact that they did a variety of different dishes instead of giving you one of two choices.  The Sea bass was wonderful and so are the fried shrimps and the sashimi.  Service was great and we had a very nice time there.  . . A keeper for future dinning experiences.
