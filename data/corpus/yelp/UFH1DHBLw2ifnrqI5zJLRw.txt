I don't like this location as much as I do the Perimeter one.  The food is equally good, but it feels somewhat cramped and the service is also more lacking than the newer Perimeter location (It really doesn't take 15 minutes to fix a panini).  . They also have a smaller selection of goodies (no sorbets and i'm fairly sure they don't have a sandwich bar).. . Still nice to be able to stop by there for fresh breads and such.
