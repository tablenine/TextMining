My favorite spot in downtown LA...and probably because it reminds me so much of NYC. It's like walking into Dean &amp; Deluca with the tall ceilings, market area, and stark white walls. And the food is really solid-- affordably priced, modern Italian cuisine. I've come here for brunch and dinner, and both are excellent. I love the fluffy lemon ricotta pancakes and the smoked salmon benedict is awesome as well. For dinner, any of the pizzas are a safe bet. Staff is friendly and helpful, and I love that they offer complimentary sparkling water (it's the little things!).. . The one downside is that the acoustics are terrible, but the noise sort of adds to the experience. Also, the portions are pretty small.
