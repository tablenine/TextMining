Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I don't know much about tacos but I can tell you this... I punctured the upper palette of my mouth with a nacho chip from Tito's yesterday.  I was casually munching along with my friends (we all ordered one taco and one burrito apiece) and before I even got to the burrito, an errantly placed chip cut into the roof of my mouth and I bled terribly for at least 15 minutes.  This had never happened to me before.  I'm not sure if this is Tito's fault but I believe a nacho chip should have some give in this regard.  Nonetheless, before my laceration,  I found the taco to be pretty tasteless, especially the cheese (didn't taste like anything at all -- although it looks nice).  The guacamole was completely liquified and could easily be poured out like milk.  The salsa was runny and watered down.  Pretty disappointing but very cheap. I can see why people have a nostalgic attraction to this place (because it's cheap, open late, the catchy jingle, housed in a shack and always has a huge line cued up) but it wouldn't be my first destination.
