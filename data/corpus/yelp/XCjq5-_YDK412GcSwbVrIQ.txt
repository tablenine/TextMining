Ah... the expense account... the opportunity to dabble in the BIG LEAGUES and venture into all things wild without (really) looking at the numbers.  And having heard all the stories about Mr. Puck's Spago's... I knew we had to go BIG.  Work colleagues in hand and clients in attendence, we had a delectable lunch.  I had this remarkable cream soup that had lobster meat and Jerusalem artichoke puree.  The taste is clean and lighter than the creamy texture of goodness would suggest.  My entree was that day's special, a black truffle omelet... 4 different cheeses, and generous shavings of the black gold... I can't say that black truffles are one of those luxury things that I would die for... but it's use in this particular presentation allowed the pungent tasty morsels to be truly remembered.  Dessert offered us a chance to partake in a bread pudding that was deconstructed.  Awesome!. . Wolfgang, the man who started a lot of this "celeb chef" thing, was a gracious host, as he made his way around the dining room several times, greeting each patron individually.  Another treat during our lunch, Mr. Sidney Poitier was in the crowd, enjoying his own version of this heaven-on-earth eating mecca.. . Oh yes, a deal was signed and all parties went away completely satisfied!
