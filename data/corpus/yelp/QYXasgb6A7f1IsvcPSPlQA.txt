Hands down, one of THE best places for breakfast/brunch places ever! Thank you Yelpers for introducing me to this little piece of heaven on Earth. . . I had the best "Apple Cobbler" French Toast of two thick slices of apple bread with what seemed like little bits of graham cracker all around it and warm cinnamon apples on the side, but did not care for the orange-zested banana slice on top of one of the toast... I'm craving just thinking of it!. . My friend's "Some like it Hot" Scramble was also amazing and I had to stop eating his food and save room for my french toast. I also tried a little bit of "Chicago Charlie's" Scramble, which was also good, but not as good as "Some like it hot." The Poached eggs y papas" were interesting as well. A different twist on eggs benedict that came with two large potato slices instead. The ham that came with the dish was also very good. Fresh squeezed orange juice is AH-mazing here, but it should be since a glass will set you back $5. . . Sighs. Why aren't there places like these in San Jose. Places like these makes me want to move to L.A. to quench my food cravings... I will be back here for sure the next time I'm in the area.. . *NOTE: Portions sizes are pretty big, but if you are up for a challenge and in the mood for the flap-jacks, you are in for a surprise. The flap-jacks are easily 10 inches in diameter and about a quarter inch thick. AND you get three of them stacked on top of one another! A couple next to us ordered one dish and ate only about a quarter of it and took the rest home. Good luck!
