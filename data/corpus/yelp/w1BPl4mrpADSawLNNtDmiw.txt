This is my favorite place in Williamsburg for brunch. I eat mostly raw so I usually get the salads and the fruit bowl with mint. I got a little crazy one day and went for the cheddar eggs which were phenomenal. Everything on their menu is really creative and delicious and not overpriced. Service can be slow on weekends but a fun place to see faces you saw at 4am the night before.
