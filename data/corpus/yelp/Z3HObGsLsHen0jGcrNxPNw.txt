This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago and it certainly doesn't get the credit that it deserves!!!  EVERYTHING on the menu is DELISH!!!!  . . Service: The waiters are very attentive to your needs, knowledgeable and friendly.. . Food: Like I mentioned, EVERYTHING on the menu is GREAT.  You really can't go wrong with any of the dishes.  They change up the menus to depending on the season so you might not see the same things on there everytime you go.  It keeps you wanting to come back for the variety.. . Location: It's located in downtown and you'll easily miss it if you're not looking for it.  It's a hidden gem in the city.  =)  Parking is relatively easy to find depending on the time of day.. . Atmosphere: Definitely great for couples on dates or a girls get together.  It's NOT great for big groups OR family style eating.  This place is sophisticated and classy, so dress accordingly.
