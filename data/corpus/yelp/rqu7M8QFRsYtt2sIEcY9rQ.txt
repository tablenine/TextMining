Beautiful, elegant, and delicious. Great place to take a date and enjoy a fantastic meal.. . My one complaint....Noise...Ugh. Went with 4 people and it was hard to hear even the person next to you. So go with someone you don't have a lot to say too =). . Oh, and ask for Audrey as a waitress. She is fantastic, fun and attentive.
