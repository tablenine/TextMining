Always tough to find parking, always a good size line, always have to hunt for a table and always worth it!   I always have to get AT LEAST one potato ball, but usually get more.  They are awesome!  Meat in the middle, surrounded by mashed potato then batter and fried.  Very tasty and very filling.  Great there or re-heat at home.  My guilty pleasure is to have one the next morning, cold out of the fridge with my coffee.  My wife loves the Cuban sandwich.  I'm generally not a fan of Cuban sandwiches, but this is the best one I've ever tried.  The cakes are great too!  They did our wedding cake and got rave reviews.  I've had their carrot cake and it is, far and away, the best carrot cake I have ever had.  Tasty and good, but requires a bit of patience.  I'm not a patient person, but it is always worth it.
