hands down the best ramen to be had in LA. the pork broth they use tastes like it was slowly brewed for hours and hours. simply delicious!. . i was tempted to give them four stars because the wait for a table can sometimes be up to 1.5 hours. but thats not their fault. and its just a testament to how great their ramen is. so five stars it shall be!!!
