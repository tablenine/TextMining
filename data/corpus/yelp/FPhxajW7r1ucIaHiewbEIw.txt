Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Pricey and worth every bit of it.   The (organic) breakfast sandwich is the best.  The BEST!  I recommend, the breakfast sandwich, peanut butter cupcakes and the meatloaf sandwich.  And then just keep going back and trying more.  If you can afford to do so.  Great staff, Joan is a sweetheart and keeps her eyes on things.  . . Hot running water in the nice bathrooms, which is something I check out in these restaurants.  Need the employees to be able to handle things properly.
