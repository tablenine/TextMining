It's a nice place, with pretty decent menu. I was more impressed with the appetizers than the entrees. I am usually not this critical, but we had really bad experience. The sommelier was not helpful. She was a bit condescending. . No matter how great the food is, if service is bad, the experience will be bad. . I had one of my worst restaurant experience at Osteria Mozza.
