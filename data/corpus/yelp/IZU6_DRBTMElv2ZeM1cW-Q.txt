This place is VERY COOL!  The building, grounds and view are AMAZING!  They almost defy description.  This place rocks for sure.  And for being what it is, a high class restaurant in the heart of Hollywood, it's not very expensive.  2 people can go in and try several things and even have a few drinks and the bill will be under $100.  Most places in Hollywood are not like that at all.  I mean it's not In and Out cheap, but it's cheap for a nice dinner in Hollywood.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the sushi is mediocre.  I mean it's good don't get me wrong...but I would expect the best from a place like this.  I have had better sushi before, but it's still good here.  A very nice place to take a date or someone from out of town.  Just going up to the place is worth the experience.  It's a little tough to see the street that it's on though, so be forewarned.  It's right after the Magic Castle on Franklin to the right if you're headed west away from Highland.
