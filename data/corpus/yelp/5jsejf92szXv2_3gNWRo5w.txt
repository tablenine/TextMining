One of the best lunch options in DTLA. Just get there early enough so you get a decent table. It doesn't matter what time you're there, the place is going to be noisy and crowded. But the food won't disappoint. LOVE the portabello fries with garlic aioli, the eggplant parmesan, the salads, even the Dr. Brown sodas. . . Dinnertime is a totally different story - the crowd is still there, but the noise factor definitely drops a level or two. You can take your sweet time and the service reflects so. . . I remember my first time dining here - it was a mere 3 days after the opening and I couldn't get over the service. It was a Lumiere moment - you remember the Beauty and the Beast scene, when Lumiere leads the wait staff in a song and dance through the dining room. That was exactly how it played out at BL come dessert time - the waitstaff descended upon us in a line, then circled us as they reached our table. Each person held a lighted cupcake in their hand. It felt like a scene out of a movie. . . The only reason I'm giving them four stars is because their macaroons are usually dry and I've found the desserts to be lacking. The presentation is gorgeous, esp. when picking up gifts for clients/friends. But they usually look a lot better than they taste. But other than that, love this place. It was just what DTLA needed!
