Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Alot of major fricken hype.....  and yes, I have to admit, it was damn good pizza.  The crust is phenomenal.  Nancy's got her groove goin' on.  The crust is out of this world.  Small restaurant, nicely layed out with a wine bar and pizza bar....  cute.  The host was so friendly and welcoming.  We went in without a reservation at 3:00pm and got in right away.  . . The squash blossoms were outstanding, the meatballs were good, but not as good as mine and the pizza incredible.  The most popular pizza is the fennel sausage, procuitto and pepperoni....  simply amazing.
