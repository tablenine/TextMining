even if my first experience ain't that good, I usually give places another chance.  so I was really tired, and wanted a dam$ good cuppa joe so i decided this is the op for la Mill to redeem itself.  I sat down, got Sumantra blend clover style - and they "RAN OUT" of cream.  How do you run out of an essential ingredient in the biz (yes, milk's not the same dairy without the FAT).  I was SO annoyed.  A treat turns into a bigger disappointment.  I even decided to treat myself to granola there ($8).   If the employees at La Mill don't know that cawfee lovers are particular, they should.  At least warn people that you're out.  I had asked for cream, and I was given the milk, not told it was milk.  Then when I poured it into my joe, it was still so dark, so I asked for more cream, in case they mistakenly gave me milk, and that's when the barista confessed they ran out.  wtf? . . it's like getting dessert without the spoon, ice cream without the cone, oreos without milk!  And there was no good excuse - 7-Eleven is across the street!  and it was noon'ish.  this is the second time it's happened, so i don't think i'll  go back.  at this pricepoint, they should have the foresight to be well-stocked with sugar, milks of all kinds....
