We recently went to ciudad to try out their happy hour.  All in all, we were not disappointed!. . Parking is most convenient in the parking garage located halfway up the block on the right.  After 4pm, it is validated and you pay only $5.  I hear they have valet, but it starts after 5pm.. . We went on a weekday, and we were only the second customers to arrive.  We had happy hour mojitos - 2 each - and one order of each of the tacos.. Each was four dollars - so we walked away - tip and all for about $50.. . The mojitos were tasty - not strong, but what do you expect for $4?  . . The tacos were scrumptious!  For $4 you get two tapa sized tacos.  . Potato - delightful!  The guac was super tasty!. Carnitas - my fav - the meat was extremely tender. Chicken - surprisingly good . Fish - I didn't like the texture - but the taste was extremely fresh, good flaky with a great lime sour cream - however, my husband adored them. . The service was okay.  The waiters were just getting there and since it was still empty - they were just hanging around, chatting and smoking - no customer wants to watch that.. . I'd definitely go back.  I would like to try it for a full three course dinner.  It reminds me of a restaurant in Scottsdale called deseo.  If you are ever in the valley of the sun - try it out.
