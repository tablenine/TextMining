Great sushi, fun house rolls, fresh fish.  Reasonably priced and you can't beat half-priced rolls at lunch time - even on Saturday!  . . Comfortable atmosphere, decent amount of outside seating, and the neighborhood is enjoyable.  . . Waitstaff is friendly, drinks aren't too ridiculously priced, and they're usually made well.  I'm a fan!
