This is a beautifully decorated coffee boutique.  Eclectic, grundy yet elegant, roomy yet still cozy.  I will have to do a full review when I go back.  I went on a Sunday night at 9:30PM and it closes at 10PM.  The waiter was the biggest jerk since he greeted us by saying, hi guys, so this will be  to go right?  Uh...you're still open for another 30 minutes right?  The barista was super cool and "let" us stay until closing.  The coffee is delicious but strong ( I was up until 2am that night).  It was just an overall unique coffee experience and I enjoyed all 30 minutes of it.
