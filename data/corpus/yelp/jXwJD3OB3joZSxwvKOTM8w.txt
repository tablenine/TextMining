If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all..... . I tried but ugh just ugh... boo to this place. . . I had part of my b-day party here and the word "disappointment" is all I can think of to describe the experience. I'm a food snob and as long as the food is good all else can be pardoned (usually). Geisha House failed with almost each dish we ordered. Which dishes you may ask? I can't tell you- they were all that forgettable.  I don't even remember what I drank! Goodness I'm a sucker for exotic drinks, how did they achieve what no other restaurant  has achieved? That is the action of making me rid myself of all memories of this place.. . I do remember that the waiter lacked personality and that I wanted to give the busboy his tip. I also remember that the music was not very good but was so darn loud that you either had to feign enjoyment or nurse your hoarse throat later that night for having screamed to your party for the sake of being heard. . . I'm seriously trying to remember something good about this experience besides the obvious decor and lighting but I can't think of anything. If I do I'll let you know...
