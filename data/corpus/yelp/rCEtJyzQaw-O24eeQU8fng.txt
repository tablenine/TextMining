Let me preface this review by saying that I do NOT order the famous french dip at Phillipe's. I live about a mile away from this LA institution and visit it on a weekly basis, but that is because I am completely addicted to the pickled eggs and coffee. It sounds like a gross combo, and no I am not preggers, but these two menu items rock my world. The pickled eggs are 85 cents and the coffee is 10 cents. The coffee with cream is hands down the BEST coffee I have ever had. I feel like a modern day, female, non-detective version of Phillip Marlowe as I sit at the old wood tables and sip down a cuppa. The french dip is ok - I'm not a huge beef fan, so beef slathered in beef juices doesn't really do it for me, and I would much rather control the au jus-age on my own (the lovely counter ladies dip the meat and bread in the au jus so you are left to their devices). Only downside to this place are the lines when tourists hit and the fact that it is cash only. Institution or not, not accepting plastic is inexcusable to me.
