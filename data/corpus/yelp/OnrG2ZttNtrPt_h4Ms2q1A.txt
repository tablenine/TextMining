Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
Gene and Judes is my all time favorite hot dog stand . Fresh cut fries stacked up inside the wonderful hot dog with sport peppers and onions with mustard and relish. They don't have ketchup so don't even ask for it. Free parking in their lot. I remeber the days when they had cocky robin ice cream Â across the parking lot. This place is awesome.
