Went here on Friday evening for dinner.  We pretty much walked right in, which is something I'm not used to here.  (This is probably my 4th time here)  Maybe because it was relatively early (about 7:00 p.m.) or maybe the neighboring location saved everyone from having to wait too long.. . This place is definitely overrated.  I mean the xiao long baos are pretty good, but the prices pretty high for the small portions for just about everything makes it very unattractive.  (at least the wait time is down from before)  Dinner for the 6 of us cost about $110 (including tip), and i wasn't even fully satisfied.  I do not eat here unless to go with out-of-town guests who really want to eat here.. . Fried rice costs nearly $8 for a small portion, about half of what I can get elsewhere for less than $5, and it was just ok.. . Sauteed veggies cost about $7.50 for a tiny little plate.  We had some green beans that were pretty good, but $7.55 for a small plate of veggies?  I don't think so.. . Shanghai rice cake was unimpressive.  Didn't taste fresh.. . Steamed vegetarian dumplings were also unimpressive.  Bleh.  The fish dumplings were also just ok.. . If you haven't tried their xiao long bao, I would definitely recommend it.  But be prepared to pay more than you expect for your meal.
