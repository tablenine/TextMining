Definitely an average bar with nothing to write home about. They have a couple of good dishes, notably the white bean soup, salmon entree and tabasco pecans. . . The food is a bit overpriced so make sure you go there on Mondays where they offer half price on all food, although be ready for the 20% "Service Charge" they tack on. I always pay higher tip when i use a coupon or get a discount it just usually annoys me when I'm forced to do so. . . That being said, catch me here on Mondays.
