You know, I wanted to like this place, but it was just 'eh.'   Trying too hard to be cool and ultimately a bit of a rip-off / not good value at all.. . LA is definitely 'burger town USA' (original home of In-N-Out, Tommy's, Fatburger, The Counter, and even Carls Jr and the first McDonald's), but this place just didn't cut it.  It was trying a bit too hard to have a schtick (they don't carry ketchup in the entire restaurant -- really?  I mean, come on -- it's burgers and fries, let's not get carried away).   And frankly, I felt like it was a bit of a rip-off.  Burgers were $12 and then more if you wanted cheese.  All the sides were $8-10 and were tiny and not that substantive.  . . The worst, however, was the wine by the glass. They charge you on average $11-12 per glass and you get this tiny, embarrassing, baby pour into a huge burgundy wine glass.  I literally thought it was a mistake and went back to the bartender who said "oh no, we measure the wine, that's a standard 6 oz pour."  (!?!?).    It was TINY.   Especially if you're gonna charge $11-12 per glass.  Come on, guys.
