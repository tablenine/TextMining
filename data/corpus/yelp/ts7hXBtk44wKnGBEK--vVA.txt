After hearing so much about this place on Yelp, I had to check it out! The interiors are amazing. Super high ceilings and opulent vibe all around. The menu is diverse and not over priced. The only thing they might need to reconsider is the music selection... For such a classy place, downtempo might be better than Beyonce... Other than that, I had no complaints. Jamieson the bar tender was very knowledgeable and nice. I might have to become a regular here.
