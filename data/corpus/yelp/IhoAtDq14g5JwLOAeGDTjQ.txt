Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
We went after Urban Belly appeared in local media, so there were a lot of people trying to get in, which definitely colored my perception, since this place is tiny, and not very convenient to move around in or wait to order. I wouldn't want to go when the weather is bad, or try to go with kids, since you have to wait out in the parking lot when it's busy.. . I thought the food was better than some other reviews have suggested. We ordered the Asian egg noodle bowl, the short rib rice bowl, and the duck dumplings. However, it's Â expensive for the amount of food that you get. We ended up spending over $30 on dinner for two, which seemed like a lot for a place with no conveniences for the diner and not a lot of ambiance.
