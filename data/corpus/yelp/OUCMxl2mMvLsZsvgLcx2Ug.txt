The conchinitas pibil tacos are amazing..so you have to deal w/ the lady sitting on a chair outside the tiny shack in her mumu like she's on her own front porch...it definitely adds to the experience! I took a ton of food to my staff and they loved it too! If you are thinking about eating your food there, think again, because it is crowded and tables are limited. You can buy drinks from the liquor store next door and eat them while they are hot in your car or just take them home. Â The carne asada tacos are good too, but not as good as King tacos.Oh Ya, They will not give you any hot sauce to go or any of their salsa either, but if you can put all their quirks aside and just go with the flow, you will enjoy their food.
