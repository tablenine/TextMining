Category: Asian Fusion
Made reservations for last night and didn't really need them. It didn't get crowded at all but that is not a testament to their food which was fabulous.. . I typically despise those people who order the same item again and again at a restaurant and never try anything new. Well...that was me last night. I had such an amazing meal about a month ago when I went. I got it again. Same Malbec wine, same Mixed Green Salad, same Filet w/ Asparagus, same Chocolate Souffle. . . I eat gluten free and they have a 2 page gluten free menu which has everything from: sushi, salads, fish, beef, dessert. . . Roys is a great choice for attentive service, nice ambiance, and great gluten free menu!
