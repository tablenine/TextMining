This bakery is so popular that it was mentioned and featured in a TV show.. . I mean, reasonable prices for awesome and unique food? What more could you ask for? Despite the fact that I live so far from Glendale, I'd be glad to make a trip any day just to get a bite of one of their delicious Cubano sandwiches (a must try!) -- paired up with their fried, golden plantain chips. Try it and you'll find that it'll be hard to stop ordering food from the bakery/restuarant. So beware, but be there!. . My dad always gets good stuff from here. Actually, everything he gets is always good with me. Here are some recommendations:. . Guava rolls. Cheese rolls. Fruit tarts (Oh God, the fruit tarts. I love them so much that I ordered a HUGE one for my 18th birthday. It was devoured by the end of the night. I can't say enough about them!). Apple danishes. Cubano sandwich (for the win). Potato balls (de-lish-us!). . Not only is their food good and inexpensive (my dad orders a box of food every visit), their line moves fairly quick! My only complaint is that parking can be extremely difficult at times, so carpooling is a great option if you're going here with friends. Also, because of their great size of customers, seating can be difficult as well. Not to worry, though, the quality doesn't fade even after its been refrigerated!. . Porto's is definitely one of the best bakeries around.. . I have yet to hear a person say otherwise.
