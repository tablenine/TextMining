Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This place rocks~  The set menu A is delicious.  We got all the yummy beef we could ever possibly eat.  The set menu A also comes with soju and beer.  Oh yes,  we also got steam egg and dwenjjang jigae as "service".  The staff is really attentive and very nice as well.  And for a Korean restaurant (and I've been to too many to count), it has a clean, nice interior.    The banchan (side dishes) are also the yummy.. . If you want to go for good Korean BBQ, I highly recco this place.. . Food = A-. Service = A-. Decor = C. Overall = B+
