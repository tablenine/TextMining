Some coworkers asked if I wanted to come along for lunch. Sure! It was friday and even though I don't really eat meat with the exception of salmon, I figured I could find something to eat at Sushi-Gen.. . The parking lot was paid parking and incredibly small. We found a space and then joined the rest of our, party waiting outside. I think we waited for about 30 minutes before being seated.. . Many of my coworkers came along for the sashimi plate, so they were happy. Unfortunatly pretty much the only vegetarian option on the menu was a veggie roll. It was the same price as the sashimi plate, at $15, but I ordered it anyway. It had to be good, right?. . Everyone got their soups and eventually our meals showed up. Well, everyone except for the veggie rolls. We saw our waitress and asked her about the rolls and she kinda ran off. Finally, once the rest of the people had consumed about half of their meals, our veggie rolls showed up. Although the rolls were fine, they weren't special and I could have made the same item at home for probably a dollar.. . For me, this place was way overpriced and not worth the wait. I am glad I went along to spend time with people and not for the food.
