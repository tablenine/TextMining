Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
We meant to go to Bricks for think crust pizza but the boyfriend got all mixed and we ended up here. It wasn't until we were seated and got the menu's that we realized our mistake, but we stayed anyway.. . It's not like there is anything wrong with this place, when I came down to it I just wasn't that impressed. I guess I understand loving Grinders if you always went here as a kid, or if you just can't get enough flat bread, but I fall into neither of those categories.. . The wait was pretty long, about an hour, but whatever, you expect that.. So once we were seated we ordered the flat bread- and it was pretty good. I mean, it's kinda just a big warm pita with seasoning on it.. The grinders, well, they're good- kind of this meat pie thing. But again, it didn't blow my mind. . . I guess what I'm saying is, if you really are curious and just really want to try it, come here once. If you think you can live without ever going here, then you will live.
