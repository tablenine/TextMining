Parking is REALLY difficult at peak times.  Call ahead around peak times otherwise you'll wait in line forever.  Small place, a little intimidating the first time you go in - but once you get how it all works that'll never be an issue again.  BEST Italian sub I've ever had, on great crusty bread and the price just can't be beat for the quality.
