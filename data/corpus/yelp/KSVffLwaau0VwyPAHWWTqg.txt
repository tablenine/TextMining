Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I love a good old Pink's chili dog. That crack of the skinny hot dog skin, followed by the oh so bad for you white bread that becomes gooey when muddled up with the weak runny flavorful chili is divine.  . . Will I wait in line for one?  NO WAY.  Hence, I do not have them often.  Once a year is good enough!
