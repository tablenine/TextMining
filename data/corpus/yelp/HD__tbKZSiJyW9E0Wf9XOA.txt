Jinxed hammockers beware....  I'm of average weight, but for some reason, also the guy who broke every rope swing and hammock ever tried.  The hanging acrylic chairs scream "embarrassing ass drop" to me.. Oh, the lunch is pretty good too.  Agree with early review, really a 3.5 star.  Worth a visit if you're on Broadway.
