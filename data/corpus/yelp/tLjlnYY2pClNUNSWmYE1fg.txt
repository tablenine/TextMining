This is the best burgers I've ever had. Same goes for the Sweet Potato Fries. It is not a cheap burger and fries, but it is worth it...just know what you're getting into. It is a "fancy" burger, and they will NOT let you change anything. I know a lot of people don't like the place for that, and I understand that, but at least come in knowing what you're getting into. Checkout the ingredients, and make sure you'll be alright ordering it as-is. If so, definitely come out to Helms over SM, where there is much more seating (the SM seating is VERY limited) and enjoy one of the dozens of beers they have on tap to go along with an incredible burger and fries!
