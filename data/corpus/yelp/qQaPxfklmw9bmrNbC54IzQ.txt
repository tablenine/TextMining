I had to try this place out since they have 1000+ reviews. We weren't able to find any street parking so we had to park across the store where the shopping mall parking structure is ($4 flat rate after 4PM). After riding down the pee smelling elevators, we headed out to Daikokuya. We didn't even have to search where the place was since there was already a line out the door. The place was nice and cozy with lots of japanese style artwork- Â there was godzilla I think hanging above the door which i thought was pretty funny. There weren't too many tables considering how popular this place is. The bar was full and the tables were packed. We scribbled our name on the list of paper in front of the door and waited for 45 minutes. I was getting anxious watching what people ordered and smelling the aroma of hot ramen on a cold windy day. I was Sttarvingggggg. Once our name was called we proceeded into a booth. Hands down, we already knew what we were going to order. The Ramen. . . One I got my ramen I was slightly disappointed. The broth was so greasy and the pork had so much fat on it. Maybe if I put some garlic in here it'd taste better. It did, but still greasy. This is my first time at a japanese ramen place and I'm not sure how exactly japanese ramen is supposed to taste but I wasn't too satisfied. The broth was okay, but I'm used to the shin ramyun or the yook ge jang kind of korean ramyun. The spicy uber taste ramen. . . I dont think it was worth the effort trying to eat here with the wait and the parking. I'd hate to be the sore thumb that gave only 3 stars but it was okay, not too good, not too bad. To me, it wasn't great, but to each its own. You should definitely come here and try it out, you may love it.
