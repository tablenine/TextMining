so i read about this concept and was curious to try it but wasn't about to go truck hunting. LUCKILY i stopped at my internship on a thursday and looked over at t.lofts and what appeared to be a mass of people in line at a truck. I thought hmm maybe its the imitation one calbi truck or whatever.. but it didn't matter i was gonna get some korean tacos! I wait in line deciding what to get, and finally settled on the short rib and chicken taco and a kimchi quesadilla. I REALLY wanted a shortrib burrito but... the guy in front of me told me not to get it.. and that the tacos were the winner because they get straight to the point.. (i later found out he ordered a burrito -__- LOL). . kimchi quesadilla- i know i could possibly make it at home.. but it just really hit the spot.. it was REALLY good in a weird way. 4.5 stars.. i would of liked some chicken in it though. . chicken taco- eh. no biggy.. don' think the korean coleslaw went too great with it- 3 stars. . short rib taco- 4 stars great meat, great taste, but too small .. :(. . next time i want to try the burrito, definitely short rib style!. . oh yeah BRING CASH.. i didn't realize it was cash only till i got to the front, luckily there was an ATM. across the street but.. i thought id miss out on the tacos i waited for 30 mins for.
