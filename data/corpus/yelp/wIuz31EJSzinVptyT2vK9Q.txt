Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Really People!?  Come on.  Another over-rated joint.  So I wait around the the U-shaped counter like a vulture waiting for a customer to die and shove off.  (Angelic music please!) And then I am presented with a mediocre burger. WTF!  What is wrong with people?  Long wait, tight quarters, no real line so, people argue over who's next and the food is - whatever.  Oh, mind you the parking is just horrendous. Hello! Is anyone paying attention.  Hey, but, if that's your thing...go for it. The Apple Pan - get's Panned!
