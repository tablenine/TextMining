I was a little skeptical after the mixed reviews, but I had a great meal here. And pretty good service too. We got seated right away for a Sunday brunch (maybe cuz we were only a party of 2, there were lots of people waiting for a table). I had the crab cakes special and also tried my friend's blackened catfish. Try the corn muffin. The coffee was pretty good too (dark). Yay! I'll be back.
