Outstanding and wonderfully romantic.  Make a reservation and ask for the patio (two types smoking and non-smoking patios).  Expensive, but worth the cost for that special occasion.  . . Come here for the long, extraordinary and endearingly romantic meal.  Beef and Fish should not be missed.  The steaks are outstanding.. . A must visit for the romantic in everybody.
