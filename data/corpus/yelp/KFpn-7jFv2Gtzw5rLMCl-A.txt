I stopped by DBA for lunch and ordered a pulled pork/slaw sandwich and brunswick stew.  The pulled pork sandwich was really good- tender and flavorful meat accented with a purple cabbage based slaw.  I liked their sweet sauce, but was surprised not to see a mustard sauce option- no biggie though.  The stew was pretty good- more of the soupy style but not bad at all.  Pretty pricey for a sandwich and 1 side, but I guess that is to be expected with the VA Hi location.  I'd be interested in checking them out for dinner sometime and getting a little more into the menu.  They have a full bar and decent selection of wines for the type of restaurant.
