I was very suprised when eating at this place. We went to see Banana Shpeel (long story) and could not get into Paterino's, so we tried its LEU cousin, Hub 51. Wow!. . Hub 51 is a happening place where the young folk go. It was extremely loud in the place, but I guess thats expected on a Friday night. Anyway, the service was great and very attentive. We got the Pulled Chicken Nachos for a starter and it had to be one of the best starters I have ever eaten. For dinner, we got two turkey meatloaf sandwiches and a green pepper burger. We enjoyed our meatloaf sandwich and I think my brother liked his burger, but looked less enthusiastic about it. We were too full to eat desert, but they looked like they had some good choices. . . All in all, they had great food and it was a fun time! I will come back very soon!
