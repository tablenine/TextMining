There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said really. The place is amazing. . . It reminds me of a club. Cool, modern interiors? Check. Attractive Women? Check. Overpriced drinks? Â Check.. . We showed up on a Friday night at close to 9:30 pm and the wait was over an hour. No worries though because after we bought our overpriced drinks we waited patiently while admiring the attractive women and cool, modern interiors.. . The food is quite good also. We started off with the portobello fries and meatball pizza. The portobello fries are great but are a bit rich for one person to eat. It is best shared amongst a group of people. The meatball pizza was before my trip to Pizzeria Mozza the best pizza I have had in Los Angeles.. . For my entree, I got the pappardelle. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the chicken, mushrooms and sauce were exquisite. Had it not been for the fact that I had two beers, pizza, and fries beforehand, I would have finished the whole dish. I took it To-Go planning to eat it for lunch the next day but I managed to leave it in my friend's car. He ended up eating though and he said it was amazing.
