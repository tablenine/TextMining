Category: Southern
Really, I'm not sure what else I can add to convince you that you should pay Carver's a visit--especially if your craving good old fashioned southern food. Being from a more "rural" local than Atlanta, I can say that spots like these are not uncommon. They are a bit more hard-to-come-by in the city, though. Carver's fare is not spectacular in the genre, but it is very good. Standouts for me include: the fried chicken (of course), cheese bread, macaroni and cheese, and sliced tomatoes (ok, they were heavenly, simple but so fresh and worth a mention). And of course, like most people on this page, I loved the ambiance. Definitely a fan of what those Carvers are doing!
