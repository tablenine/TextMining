My cousin:  Hey, wanna go to a filipino-owned pastrami place?  It's called the Oinkster. Me:  Serious?  That kinda sounds weird.  That kinda makes me feel like a fat pig.. My cousin:  C'mon, everyone says it's good!  It's in Eagle Rock.. Me:  OF COURSE it's in Eagle Rock!  Arlight, F-it...I'm down.. . So we get there.  Sure enough...Filipino-owned pastrami place.  Where else in the world can you grab a pastrami sandwich, belgian-style fries, and an ube shake to boot!  WTF...I was confused.  I can be picky when it comes to pastrami sandwiches (I like Johnnies, Langers, The Hat, etc), so I was skeptical.  This place...not bad for a giant sandwich.  I have to admit, I still like Johnnie's Pastrimi's $10.25 sandwich, the best.  . . But Oinkster...you guys weren't half bad.  I'd go back.  Oh, and that aioli sauce...addicting!!!!
