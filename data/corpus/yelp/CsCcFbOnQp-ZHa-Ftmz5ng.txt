Ever find yourself in Arcadia? Look for the strip mall with a bunch people huddling around a door with magic little tickets in hand. There you will enjoy pillows of juicy pork love they call dumplings. The shrimp and pork dumplings are just as delishhh.. you will not be disappointed! i guarantee it!
