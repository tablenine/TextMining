Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I hadn't come here since my birthday in 2007 and back then it was still good.  I came here on 07/21/09 with my mom after winning the free dinner-for-two on the radio.  Woohoo!  Free is a wonderful thing. . . The place is a bit pricey but worth the money.  The portions are huge.  It's enough for two people.  Trust me...you will need a doggy bag.  Our meal started off with sourdough bread and butter, then the infamous spinning bowl salad followed - the dressing is so yummy.  After came our entree...we both had the Lawry's Cut (10 oz. of prime rib) which comes with mashed potatoes.  I chose creamed corn - yum!  Mom chose creamed spinach - also, yum!  For dessert I had the chocolate cake (ooey gooey mess with vanilla ice cream - yum) &amp; mom had the creme brulee (yum).. . I'm normally not a prime rib kinda girl.  I normally take my filet mignon if I want beef, but I will chose this place for prime rib any time.  :)
