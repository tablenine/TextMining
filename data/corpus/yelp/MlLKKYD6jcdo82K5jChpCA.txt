By far best pizzeria around!! . Service was GREAT!! Jordan was awesome. . Love the idea of keeping the water carafe at the table! . Started with the Insalata mista. Enough salad for two people to share. It may not seem that way but it is. . We also got the white bean bruschette! OMG! SO GOOD! . Two people, two pizzas!! Gotta try more than one:) . Margherita and Bianca! . Both were incredible!! I think we like the Bianca a little better but they both are SO worth trying! . I have to admit that I was disappointed in the dessert. I wanted to try the Caramel copetta.   I personally didn't care for the peanuts.  The flavors to me just didn't mix well.  I also thought that the cookie was suppose to be a pizzelle?  It was more like brittle.  Oh well.  . It's not enough to make me not want to go back.  (I'm a dessert snob).  . Recommend making reservations especially on a Saturday night.
