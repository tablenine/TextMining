We got crazy up in this piece, dropping mad bills and chowing down on moo-meat.  Server came and it was "hey baby, slip me some sea-beasts, tower-style."  Never has a seafood edifice come so carefully constructed and bursting with shrimp, oyster, and lobster tails.  Like a manatee, I opened my mouth and let crustacean, ice and water alike course into my gaping maw.  . . Steaks are delicious, expensive, and oozing moo-fluids.  So good.  Order anything bone-in.  Side of macaroni and cheese is excellent, but I'm not feeling the lobster mash.  Too rich, lumpy, and a bit dry.. . My party waddled out of Mastros March of the Penguins-style.  Never been so full in my life.
