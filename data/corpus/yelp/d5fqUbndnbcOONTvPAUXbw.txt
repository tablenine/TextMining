Restaurant: Big Star
Category: Mexican
Big Star is more of a bar with good food than a restaurant. Adjust your expectations accordingly.. . A first visit to Big Star merited 3.5 stars, rounded up for the relative ease of scoring a couple of bar stools on a Sunday evening and the vibrant, festive atmosphere. Prices are pretty cheap, and the upfront warning about cash-only policy was helpful, yet it's still sorta annoying to have to run over to the ATM mid-date.. . Pork belly tacos were a standout, while the lamb was more forgettable. And that Velvet Hour-esque ginger cocktail is still burning the back of my throat (in a good way).. . I'll try Big Star again, although I might give it some time to let the hype die down (and for them to come around to accepting credit cards).
