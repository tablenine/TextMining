After weeks of seeing the Yelp picture of that French toast, I absolutely had to go to this place everyone raved about.  I absolutely was blown away.. The French toast was the best i ever ate!  I wanna go back and try some more stuff . . .its all i thought about all weekend.   And the French-pressed coffee was better than Starbucks (which I do not say lightly) . .. the service was great, the food was great, wow.. the only downside was the bathroom which was kinda dirty.
