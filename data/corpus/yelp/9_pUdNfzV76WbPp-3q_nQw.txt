ABOUT THE NEW MENU. . The food is MUCH improved, but, again, you're not coming for the food, so don't get your panties in a bunch about it. It used to be institutional grub, so the fact it's pretty good is a big deal. However, there are highlights --. . The appetizer menu is the strongest part of the menu, I've found (which is a good thing). The portobello mushroom fries are very good, the crab cakes are solid (lots of crab), the french fries are okay, the calamari (when I had it) was good, though I've heard mixed things about this from other people. The fries are okay. People seem to love the deviled eggs, but I can't stand boiled eggs, so I didn't try. The oysters looked good. As always, the chili's a good choice.. . AVOID the lobster mac and cheese, as it's super fishy tasting. The creamed spinach is tasty (although I'd love it with some bacon, umm!) and the fish was solid (got the special of the day, so won't dwell lest it never reappears). . . So go, eat and enjoy. And as an aside -- DON'T BE THE A-HOLES WHO GET DRUNK AND SAVE SEATS, because someone will find a manager, you will have to give up those seats, and you will be publicly embarrassed (seen it happen). And if I am there, I will laugh at your jerky ass. Seriously, there are signs EVERYWHERE telling you to 1) not save seats and 2) not save places in line. DON'T DO IT. You're a GUEST IN A PRIVATE CLUB (because members don't do that shit -- because magic is a small, small world). Behave your damn selves!
