A stellar spot for dessert and coffee. Chocolate or fruit filled cakes, rum balls, scones, biscotti, cookies, etc are there to your liking. . . They do serve brunch and dinner. One summer breakfast meal had white chocolate chip pancakes layered with blackberries and drizzled with pomegranate syrup. . . I wish summer would come sooner.
