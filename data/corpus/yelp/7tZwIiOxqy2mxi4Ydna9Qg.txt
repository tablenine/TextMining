Everything here is extremely tasty - but per their reputation, you definitely can't leave without getting the lobster.  Make sure to ask for extra green onions because it makes for extra-tastiness with rice.. . A good bargain is coming here for their lunch menu.  Like many lunch menus, it's a fraction of the dinner price and just as tasty.
