This place is so cute! I came here on valentine &amp; loved it! I tried their blue velvet cake which was heavenly...it's such a delicious combination &amp; their 1/2 lb burger which left me wanting more...the decor is really cute &amp; they have a window you can look into to see what they're doing in the kitchen though the guy was not happy I was taking a picture. It's a small space but they've done a lot with it. They have Â A LOT of different treats that they sell.
