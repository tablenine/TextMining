ROSCOE's....YO!!. ive been fantasizing about eating here forever.  The time had come on a thursday when we were freakin fried chicken hungary!  Since it was a weeknight there was no wait, we sat down immediately. The place was smaller then i expected, its old school country in the south decor. The menu was a little hard to follow, being that it was overwhelming enough that I was finally eatin' the roscoe's dream.  They have a large menu, mainly southern influenced, SCOE's #2 was the ticket.  They have a "gravy" option to add on the chicken &amp; i was hesitant about the extra gravy, I thought it would be too much, but Im so glad I was convinced by my brother to get the damn gravy! There was another roscoe's virgin in my party &amp; he was glad he got some gravy too...The chicken with gravy was so moist, tender &amp;  flavorsome....it was a poultry orgasm with gravy on top! skeet skeet! Now the waffles, I usually like belgian style waffles, but these were the thin waffles.  They were really tasty, even better with the chicken &amp; gravy.  The portions were a good size.  I was completely satisfied with my first Roscoe's meal.  I wanted to go back the next day.  The only reason why Im not giving them a 5 star rating is because of the service. It was fast, but  the waitress didnt really give me a welcoming southern roscoe's feelin, nor did i think she was listening to us half the time, so Im knockin' em for it.  I would go back anyday except on the weekend, because it  seems it would be a long wait...other then that it was finger lickin' gravy drippin' good.  Live the Roscoe's dream...
