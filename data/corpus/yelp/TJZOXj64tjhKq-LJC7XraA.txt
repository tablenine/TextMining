i think it's a little overrated.  but maybe that's because i ate a veggie dog when i came here.... . ok ok i was with some vegetarians and out of respect i decided to eat the veggie dog.  i got the apple/sage sausage, which is just a field roast brand sausage (i think they also serve a tofurkey sausage).  oh and if you're vegan - the buns are not.  and everything is grilled together.  sooo yeah.. . the french fries were tasty, but i would have likes to have mine a little crispier.  they offer a lot of neat dipping sauces for the fries.  i got the bbq sauce, which went really well with the thick cut fries. i tried someone's peanut sauce and it was a little too gingery.  i'll stick with my bbq.. . i couldn't resist the ice cream sandwich.  delicious oatmeal cookies with cinnamon/apple (?) ice cream in between.  i don't even like oatmeal cookies, but these were awesome.  i'd go back if only to get one of these again.. . they have an awesome selection of beer, and each beer comes with a specific mug, which i thought was really cool.  i might have made a beer selection based solely on the goblet type glass i saw, but whatever!  don't judge!
