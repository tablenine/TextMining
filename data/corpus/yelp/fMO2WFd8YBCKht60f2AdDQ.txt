To the guy who pulled us over to say how Kogi wasn't very good.  Go away.  Kogi makes a damn good taco, and I'm sure if I had been drinking, the flavors and satisfaction would have become exponentially better.  . . It's kind of a pain in the ass to have to track down a restaurant, but if you're interested in Kogi, you know what you're getting into.  The good thing is, the food is kind of worth the hype.  The Kimchi and short rib taco is kind of terrific, as is the bulgogi taco.     The short rib sliders were also excellent.   Downside is that we ordered one chicken taco, and instead they gave us tofu.  Major wahh.. . Dear Kogi.  Please bring your food up to the SF Bay Area, you will do very well up here.
