I love this place, the only reason why I give it 4 stars is becuase everytime I find a dish i love, i go back and it's not on the menu anymore!  But, one thing that doesn't change is their yummy bread and hummus :)  dishes that I've gotten and loved: Summer Snap Pea Mint Pesto Pasta, Seared Ahi Sandwich, Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  My dad got the Kobe Burger and said it was great, and my boss often gets the salads and loves them as well.  . . The pomme frites are yummy as well.. . It's a super cute place with pretty good service.
