This is my favorite breakfast place.  I live a couple blocks away, so it's really nice to roll out of bed and wander down here for some good coffee and tasty food. :)  My absolute favorite items are the banana french toast and the retro omelet, but I haven't had anything that I don't like here.  This guy uses the best ingredients, the presentation is fabulous, the taste combinations are delicious, and the atmosphere is casual.  I never come here on the weekends since there is always a line outside, but there is free coffee if you're waiting!  . Closed Mondays, FYI.
