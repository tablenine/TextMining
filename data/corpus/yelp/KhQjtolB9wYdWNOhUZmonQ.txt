Restaurant: The Foundry On Melrose
Category: American (New)
My humans and I frequent The Foundry at least once a week. Between the three of us we've eaten about everything on the menu. Not only is Eric a MASTER at what he does, the service is amazing! Yes yes, I do mostly go there because of my now famous celeb "Billy Burger" but they have the friendliest staff and super delicious drinks. My owners tell me the potato soup is to die for and a must order when you come in!!!. The live music is amazing in the summer with the doors open, and even when it's chilly I can sit outside with the heaters on comfortably. All in all, I wouldn't be coming here once/twice a week if it wasn't completely worth it....AND IT IS!. I give it 5 paws up!!!!
