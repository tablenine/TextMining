Recently had my second meal here, 2 Â years apart. I was totally blown away on my first visit. My second visit didn't necessarily disappoint, but I'm wondering if b/c they recently celebrated a 4 year run, that the service might be slipping. Maybe a new GM would get the place back to amazing service. Anyway, it's about the food. Vegetarian or not, the menu would suit anyone. It's very inventive and I'm sure even a steak kinda person would love their meal here. Can't say a bad thing about the food, or the wine pairing. perfecto! and it didn't hurt that we went while celebrating the 4 year anniversary b/c we got a deal! $40 for a 4 course dinner and wine pairings at $4/glass. Hell yeah.
