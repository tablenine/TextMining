I heard about this place from Jonar R. because he labeled this place the Pho Killer. and though i had doubts at first..... i must say..... "Tooshaaaaaaaay Dorko.....!!!" . . i actually went to this place during lunch yesterday and orderd the Ramen combo with the side of Unagi Rice Bowl.. . They first greeted us with cute smiles (women ofcourse) and seated us at the counter. We were scepticle at first due to they only had 1 style ramen. The daikokuya special ramen which had a description stating that the soup is cooked in pork, and the egg is marinated over night in their special sauce. . . we first got the salad and our drinks. the salad was shredded with a japanese version of thousand islands dressing but better. crisp and refreshing.. . then came the unagi. it was 3 pieces of grilled eel over rice and splashed with teriyaki sauce.... mmmmmm. this alone couldve filled me up. but then came a large bowl of the ramen. it was in a soy sauce base with 3 long chunks of pork, and the special marinated egg. . . YUUUMMMMY. it needed not any additional seasoning.. . i used to be a hardcore fan of orochan but with the selling price of $12.50 for this meal, i was POANED....!!!!! Â they had me at the Sack with this meal.. . we loved it so much, my friend Daniel and i, recruited 2 more friends the same night and brought them back for dinner. hahahahaha. . lovely......!!!!!. . the place looks great too. i especially love the geisha surfboard and the japanese anime books.
