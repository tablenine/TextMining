I think this farmer's market is the very definition of a clusterf%#k. It makes me irritable to be shoved around and crammed into awkward corners and trying to find a seat during any time on a weekend is a hilarious endeavor. Loteria's lines give me the same feeling.. . I was here recently and sat on the stools along the side. After waiting for a really long time I got up to stand in line and order while Nick saved our seats. The bummer of this was literally 2 minutes after I got up someone else sat down next to Nick and his order was taken by the people working at Loteria. Um, what's up with that?. . Anyway, I waited in line and placed my order and since we were sitting on the side asked if they could just give it to us there. The answer was no. Really? I mean I can't sit on the other side while I wait? Okay, whatever, I'll play by your rules. Except these appeared to only be rules for me because other people were happily delivered their food while sitting at the stools. Bogus Loteria.. . After an enormously long wait, and 2 forgotten tacos I finally got our order and brought it back to Nick. Were these delicious? Most certainly. But, I can walk down to Taqueria la Mexicana, wait 10 minutes and eat tacos that are just as delicious without all the hassle.
