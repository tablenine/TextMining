You should eat dinner before you come here. I just got back from Bluebird and I'm still hungry.. . Definitely a place that practices portion control. I just paid $12 for a bison burger that was okay. The menu just didn't have anything a normal person would eat. Well, maybe we would if we knew what the hell some of this stuff was. . . I saw $18 bottle of beers on the menu and that where they belong... on the menu. I'll save my money.
