This place is delicious. Their salmon benedict is served on a potato pancake, they smoke their own salmon and it's the only creamy hollandaise sauce that doesn't make my stomach hurt after. The stuff of dreams, i literally crave this place for weeks on end before breaking down and driving ALL the way across town for what me and my friends call "Scientology Breakfast". . . The only thing... the wait is forEVER and the service is eh. The last time i was there we were lingering over coffee over our meal and they literally asked us to leave. I mean I understood because there was still people waiting to be seated but REALLY? . . ah well, i will still return- on their chalk board they have their daily specials and you can actually see where your meats and produce come from!  The last time i peaked they had a bacon-gruyere scone. FTW! . . Also delicious must try, grits with bacon and cheese. GOD BLESS AMERICA.  Must return asap. Enjoy!
