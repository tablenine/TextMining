This is the best LA food phenomenon ever!!  It's a tricky cat'n mouse game trying to hunt down this grub truck.  but man, if you do, you will be rewarded.   i got the spicy pork sliders which were savory and tangy at the same time.  it also included a cabbage slaw ( i think, i was too buzzed to be sure) which gave the sliders a fun crunch.. . i did not personally try the tacos, but everyone who did raved about them.  . . confession: i never got food at the truck; i went to the alibi room, their "home base" kitchen. the best part about this place is you don't have the long wait!!!. . i've been thinking about this place ever since i had my first taste.  i guess you can call it love at first bite??  it's cheap, it's GOOD.  really.  i just blew $500 bucks on dinner the other day, but i would rather these $6 burgers again than a 14-course meal!  where can i get my own truck?  do they cater weddings??
