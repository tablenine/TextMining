Went there Saturday evening with a group and was way more impressed then I expected to be. I don't know why I had such low expectations, except because it's a Concentric group place. Our server, Nathaniel, was the best server hands down I have ever had. His description of food was like reading Sauveur magazine except then I actually got to eat it. We had the creamed corn (oh. my. Corn, feta, smoked paprika. I could stick my head in this dish), an eggroll I think? and roasted fennel. I think the app was called three from the garden. . For dinner, I ordered the Hamburger which was not the best I ever had but it was topped with pancetta so who's complaining? The fries were great - a hint of Parmesan on them. . . Others had (and I sampled) the margherita pizza (Um, yeah. get this), the brisket and scallops. All were a huge hit and there were no doggie bags that night. . For dessert I want to tell you about something called their version of a  kit kat bar - I don't know what it was or what's in it but I would certainly cross oceans to have some more of that. The cheesecake too. . . All in all, it was a fantastic dinner. The mood can't be beat either- GREAT date place.  Just moody enough...
