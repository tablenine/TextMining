absolutely delicious for all vegetarian fare.  i think that everyone should try the santa fe chik'n sandwich with the sweetheart [sweet potato] fries--it is to die for.  also, ask for more dipping sauce [the one that comes with the fries]--it's delicious and you'll want to pour it on everything.  it is a bit pricey but i think it's worth it for the quality of food you are getting.  i need to take my friends here!
