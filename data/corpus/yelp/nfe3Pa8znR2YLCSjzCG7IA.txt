Plain and simple - delicious food and love the fact that it's BYOB. Great for a group! The sopes are perfection... last time, I got them with chicken which was nice and tender, no "mystery meat" to be had. The complimentary chips come with two fantastic salsas, which are great on their own but also taste delicious mixed together or poured on your entree. This is one of those restaurants where you'll want to go back a million times and try everything on the menu!
