So i came here 12/12/09 for my birthday. We had reservations. We were seated immediatly. The place is Beautifully decorated. It also is huge. Valet for a Sat was $8.. . We asked for a quiet area which we got compared to the upbeat loud area open kitchen scene.. . So i was here ready to splurge for my B-day. Our Server a French Man was so attentive. I dont uderstad some of these reviews saying they felt nneglected??? Our waiter Has many excellent suggestions. Also our water was filled almost ever 5- 10 min. . +Bread Service was every 8 Min they came around different choices for bread, Lavash with parmesean, Walnutt, French country, Sourdough, Olive &amp; wheat. My fav was the Lavash , Sourdough, &amp; OLIVE.. . +Menu changes daily as i have been told but some items are fairly available everyday like the vienshnitzel &amp; Goulash. Most items just change the ingredients used by season. A huge Wine list almost a booklet type. . I started off a glass of Prosecco $10. + As Appetizer i ordered:.  FIRST OF THE SEASON ITALIAN WHITE TRUFFLES with rissotto you have a choice of Pasta or ravioli as well. $140 Â  . OMG i was soo goood Im a truffle person but i usually get the black ones the white ones NO wonder there so expensive it was a distinct flavor &amp; an aquired taste you must have for it. either you hate it or love it.. . My friend she got the-. +ROASTED CHINO FARM'S BEET LAYER CAKE $18 WOW this was amazing i want this next time i come. I highly reccomend this not small portioned either perfect size.. . Entree I got the $150 . +6 OZ. JAPANESE WAG YU NEW YORK STEAK. "SAUCE MOUTARDE" AND CARAMELIZED SALSIFY With Mashed potatoes+$12. This is by far the most amazingist steak i have eaten in my life. Its like butter melts in your mouth. I got it medium rare. Soo juicy &amp; fatty YOU MUST try this AT LEAST ONCE IN YOUR LIFE. Now i understad truly why it was so much. Kobe beef is corn fed, fed beer, massaged, not allowed to roam around so it gets really fatty &amp; not tough tender. The sauce does it no justice i loved it better wihout the sauce. Best mashed potatoes youll have in your life!. . My Friend ordered the $49. PAN-ROASTED CHICKEN WITH BLACK TRUFFLES GOAT CHEESE AND YELLOW FINNISH POTATO PUREE with RUFFLE BUTTER. This was by far the best juiciest chicken &amp; crispiest skin on th eoutside i have ever had. The sauce was delicous the potatoes amazing How did they get a juicy so crispy &amp; juicy inside?. . Dessert:. I ordered the Autumn Souffle Tart $14 . it was ok to be honest I was expecting more. I really was looking forwatd to the dessert menu but very little choice on that the menu has alot of choices UPDATE YOUR DESSERT MENU!. . My friend ordered the Choclate bread pudding $18. again thought it was ok. . My friend had coffe $3.50. I had this amazing tea my waiter suggested called GENMAI IT WAS SOO GOOD light &amp; perfect $6. . our whole bill together was $517.61 with tax . if you think you wouldnt be able to eat here because if you think the total woudl be this much for you think again. You could skip the Drink that i had &amp; the two entree's that were $140 + $150 &amp; skip dessert unless you really have to have it. overall your bill would have come out to be $200 OR LESS TOTAL. So give this place a try at least once in your life! Its well worth the atmosphere, Service, Quality of the food &amp; presentation.
