I was excited about this place, reading that it was a very nice Thai restaurant.  I took a friend who was visiting from out of town and is a big fan of Thai food, and we both walked away very unsatisfied.  The meals weren't exactly bad, but they were nowhere near worth the price we paid for them.  Everything tasted very bland.  The signature drinks were quite tasty, however.. . While the food wasn't exactly up to par, as previous reviews have mentioned, the bathrooms are extremely nice.  I'll give them an extra star for that!
