Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
"Two char dogs, cheese fries, and a cup of water," might be the best words ever uttered after 3am.  The phrase reminds me of many late nights in Chicago, and I have no fonder memories than those made at the Wiener Circle (except maybe that time my friend Andrew got in a fight out front and ended up with a head lac).  The radioactive green relish and gritty cheese-like topping for the fries...classic.  Earmuffs recommended for children after 10pm.
