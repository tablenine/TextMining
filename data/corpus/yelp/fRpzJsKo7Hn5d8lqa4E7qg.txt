Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
It was PACKED on a thursday night for dinner.  For such a busy restaurant, the food came out very fast and timely.  There were literally 7 men behind the sushi bar making sushi.  It was a hilarious sight seeing them packed so tightly behind this little sushi bar! . I had the red dragon roll and spicy basil chicken entree.  Although I liked the roll, after trying my friend's spicy shrimp roll which was half the price and 2x the flavor, I know what I'm getting next time I go back! . The spicy basil was delicious and definitely more than enough for lunch the next day! . What's better than free-flowing byob wine and cheap but suuuper delicious food?! mm...not much!
