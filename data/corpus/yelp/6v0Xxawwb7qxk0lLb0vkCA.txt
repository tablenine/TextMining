Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
I have a special place in my heart for Porto's. They introduced me to cheese rolls, fruit tarts (ginormous sheets to single servings), potato balls, guava+cheese/coconut/strawberry/coconut/apple/crea m pastries, Cubanos, and most recently a non-Filipino chicken empanada.. . I'm pretty sure there are other bakeries that make the same things, perhaps even better but why bother taking those risks when Porto's has been getting it right for awhile (as evidenced by the many articles/awards framed on their wall as one of LA's best). It's a bit far, and the lines are long no matter what time or day you go, but if you gave me a box filled with whatever they got, I would eat it all for the day.. . On those empanadas. The meat inside taste almost the same as the meat used in the potato balls. When paired with a flaky/savory dough, yum! Screw Red Ribbon, Valerios, and Goldilocks. I like it Cuban style now.
