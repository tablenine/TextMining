Stopped by the pick up window and ordered 4 tacos + an order of chips and guacamole. Walked home, opened the bag to find only two of the four tacos I had ordered. I don't mean to completely rag on the place -- I've been inside and the food and service are of quality but to-go service like that is inexcusable.
