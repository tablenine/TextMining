Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Now this is a restaurant that's worth the wait! The meat is fresh and the sauces are oh-so-delicious. The price is totally worth it ($12 for medium plate, $15 for large). I've had $50 shabu shabu before that is not nearly as good as this place. To alleviate the wait, I would come here in the evenings about 30-45 minutes before they close. And the wait isn't that bad since there are always people around and shops to visit.
