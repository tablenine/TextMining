Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
I'm a big fan of tapas, so after coming home from an AMAZING trip from barcelona, I was in desperate need to find a tapas restaurant out in LA that would satisfy my cravings. Who would of thought that right in LA an establishment would do just that?!?? Although not as authentic as tapas in Spain, Cobras &amp; Matadors comes pretty close. Not only is the food well portioned, reasonably priced, and oh so yummy, but the ambience of the restaurant is excellent. WIth their yummy sangrias and wide selection of red wines, its the perfect restaurant to spend with good company and even a first date! . . As for the tapas, we ordered a variety of dishes and all of them were excellent! I do remember the paella being a little too "lemon-y" for my liking, but the texture was beautifully executed. Its been a while since I've been back, so I don't quite remember the other dishes that we ordered, but I do remember leaving quite full and extremely content with my meal. =). . Great place to go for a tapas experience outside of Spain!
