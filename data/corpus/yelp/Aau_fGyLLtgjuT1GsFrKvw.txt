Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I like fried chicken.. I like waffles.. I like gravy.. I like biscuits.. I like cheap food walking distance from my house.. . I like Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles.  Especially the #13: One Succulent Breast.  One Delicious Waffle.. . With a side a' gravy.  Comped.  Yay!  And my friend's biscuit.. . The gravy has onions.  The chicken is, fried in...crack maybe?  It's CRISPY.  And even the breast meat is juicy.  The beans and rice are really tasty and comforting with butter and honey, which I realize isn't actually good for you, but my goodness who the hell cares?  This is what I want when I have the flu.. . The whole thing embodies "comfort food".  Salty.  Fattening.  Inappropriately delicious.  My dining companion yelled at me for not finishing my biscuit.  As she neared fullness she started shoveling gravy-covered rice into her mouth to get it all in before her stomach had a chance to protest.. . Ahhhhh gluttony.   The good kind.  The kind that says "Here's a plate of food that's just a bit more than you need, packing in about 3x as many calories as it should, and honey, eat it up!  Eat It Up!. . I like fluffier waffles, but these taste amazing.  So I forgive them their flatness.  The chicken skin doesn't even taste like chicken skin.  It tastes like...Oh.  Sorry.  I was eating.  I don't remember.  But it was good.. . Honestly it's not like it's a song on the palatte, or anything.  It's just the best comfort food ever.. And for that?  It's PERFECT.. . Oh, and the gravy has onions.  Yay.
