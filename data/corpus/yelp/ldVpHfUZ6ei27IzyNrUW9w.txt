It's a little pricey for what it is. But it's good. I went here for lunch, and have a hard time understanding if it's suppose to be fancy or laid back; the white table cloths throw me off. i walked in wearing skinny jeans, and felt a little out-of-place. Perhaps it's different at night. . . The servers are nice, (a little slow though even during off peak times), but their special rolls are good in comparison to sushi I'm used to in NYC.
