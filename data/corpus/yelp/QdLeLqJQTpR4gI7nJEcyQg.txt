This place is amazing - but not if you are on a diet!. . I had the Saturday night Special - which is Kahlua and Baileys in a buttermilk pancake --mmm!  The pancakes are colossal, the scrambles too.. . Pros:. Huge, creative menu. Fast and friendly staff. Large portions (which means lots of left-overs). Great French Press Coffee. . Cons:. Noisy - try to get a table outside to minimize this. A bit pricey, but not too bad. Expect a wait, this is definitely a hot spot.
