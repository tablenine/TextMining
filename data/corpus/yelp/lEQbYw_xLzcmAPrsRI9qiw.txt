I braced myself for an intellectual "pizza". You know, the kind of pizza that quotes Rimbaud, speaks some Tibetan and walks into a dentist's office and selects a New Yorker or Utne and then proceeds to actually read it. Yeah, a no good minimalist ironic type that you'd like to pop your gum at.. . Well, I was wrong. My pizza listens to Whitesnake and drives a Trans-Am. Maybe... Well, maybe not. But it was tasty.The fennel sausage was aromatic yet accessible. The prosciutto pizza was too salty and meaty for me. The heat in the anchovy pizza was overdone. I think it was trying too hard like a young Casey Affleck in Oceans 11. But look at him now, right? He's actually good so there's hope anchovy pizza, yes there is.. . The best antipasti was the white sardines which tasted straight up Korean even though I think it had cheese in it. This dish was just fishy and I mean that in a good way. I also loved my mussels the presentation of which merits discussion. Discussion: they were all seated on their ass ends in a shallow dish so they resembled a bouquet of metallic tulip heads. They were amongst the best mussels I've ever had and a definite high note of a really nice supper. Thanks to my corporate sponsers for paying for the meal and enduring the penitential wait to be seated.
