Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
Eleven City is a cool place! I'm not quite sure why its not more of a tourist trap (then again, maybe it is... I've only been there late-ish on Â a Saturday night).. I love the letter from the owner about where the idea for a Jewish diner came about and the fact that there is a full soda bar as well as a regular full bar. Plus the menu is stacked full of good 'ole Jewish meals like latkes, matzo ball soup, lox, and that sort of fun stuff.. When you think diner you dont usually think you'll be paying 15$ or so for a dinner, I think youre paying the atmosphere... the booths, music, giant chalk board and such.. The food was good, both of the things I ordered came out a bit different than I expected but they were still good... a bit too pricey for me to be a regular but I might take a visiting friend if we were in the area. . I cant say my server was amazing... I took a break from eating since I ordered two things... and she came and got one plate and threw about half of it out without asking if i wanted it boxed or anything, in fact she didn't even ask if I was done... but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt since they were closing soon. However, when I wake up tomorrow morning and have no left overs I'm probably going to be sad.
