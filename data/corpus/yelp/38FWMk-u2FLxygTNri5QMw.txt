When I entered I was starving.. . When I left I was stuffed - and smiling - AND had a bag of sweets to go in my hand.. . I had stopped in here a few years back when I wanted a quick sweet treat and was shopping in the area.. . I remembered the sweets being good and wanted to stop in for a meal this visit. Convenient to where I was shopping - The Hundreds, Hall of Fame, Diamond, etc. it was a perfect place to grab a bite.. . We ducked in, were seated immediately (no time to gaze at the wall of delicious desserts and treats), and had drinks as soon as we named our beverage of choice.. . Our waitress was old, hilarious and sweet - just what I expect at a diner! LOL. The pickles were not my preference, but a nice little treat. . . I ordered the beef dip sandwich with cheddar cheese and my fiance had the spaghetti with meat sauce. Both were amazing. They were straight from the kitchen and steaming hot when they arrived. So hot in fact I had to disassemble my sandwich and allow it to cool or risk severe injury to my tongue. . . Portions were huge and impossible to finish, but major bang for the buck.. . Also, make sure you stop at the dessert counter on the way out and get a sweet treat to go. We got an eclair and sugar cookies. Delicious!!
