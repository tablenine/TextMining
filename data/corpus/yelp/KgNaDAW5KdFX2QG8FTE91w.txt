Restaurant: Top Flr
Category: American (New)
Top Flr is a quality place!!!! . . Top Flr is open late till 1am on Weekdays and 2am on Weekends. It's great to go for just drinks or even food.. . I've been here a few time and always liked it. I've been here for drinks and food.. . The ambiance and the decor is great so this place is definitely a great place to take a date. The staff and the bartenders are friendly and cater to your every needs.. . They have a wide wine selection as well. I tried the Duck Confit, Applewood Bacon Pizza and the White Bean Hummus and Flat bread.. . The pizza was amazing! Service was great.. . I'll be here again!
