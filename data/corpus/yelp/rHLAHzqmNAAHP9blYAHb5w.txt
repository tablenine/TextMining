On my way to the Long Beach airport for my red-eye back to NYC I stopped at RFD for take-out...it was fast! I ordered and was out the door within 18 minutes and to the airport in 40 minutes.  I must have been the envy of all on my plane! The "Burger with the works" is fantastic.  Who needs airplane food when there's take-out vegan to carry on!!
