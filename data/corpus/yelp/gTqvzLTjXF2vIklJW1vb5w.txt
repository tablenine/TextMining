omgdeliciousnessoverloadddddddd. . i love love love rose angelis. i used to live on the 1100 block of wrightwood, so this was my go to italian spot. . . they have a huge menu and everything ive ever tried has been delicious. my personal recommendations include the ravioli and the caprese salad! but really, try anything! try it all! as many have said, the portions are quite generous.... . i usually leave w/a doggy bag, but always come back wanting more!
