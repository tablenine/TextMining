Cool spot to have lunch on a Friday &amp; enjoy a brewski. It's located next door to a furniture store, HD Buttercup, in the Helms Bakery building.  It wasn't too crowded.  The place has a modern look with a lot of wood everywhere even on the ceilings.  You can sit at the bar, at one of the tables inside or outside in the patio.  It's a rather small menu, roughly half a dozen appetizers and another half a dozen entrees to choose from.  I like the burger &amp; sweet potato fries but a bit pricey to come here more often for that.  There is a large selection of beer on tap to choose from &amp; also hard to find, expensive beers.  Just remember to order at the bar.
