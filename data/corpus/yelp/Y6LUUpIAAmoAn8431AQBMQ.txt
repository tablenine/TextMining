Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If 'Melrose Place' or 'The OC' was a restaurant The Griddle Cafe would be it's name. Whatever you do, don't go here on weekends, you'll wait for days and days and days. If you must, order take-out - it's only a 20 minute wait. . . Food is very good but the young hipper-than-you wait staff is as incompetent as they are attractive, they're more concerned about their non-existent Hollywood careers than getting their customers orders correct. Make sure they explain the menu! They get a real thrill out of surprises... For example, the pancakes are three huge 12" discs stacked in three - enough to feed 4 people, your eggs get only ONE side (you'd never know that reading the menu).. . Don't be intimidated by these talentless showbiz wanna-be's.
