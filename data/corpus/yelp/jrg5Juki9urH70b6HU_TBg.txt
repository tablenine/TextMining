Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Everyone has their favorite places.  Savoy is definitely one of mine, and has been for years.  . . The hainan chicken here is awesome, no doubt about that.  But another must have I nearly always order is the seafood salad.  It is so good, so order a large and share as an appetizer.  The unlimited refills on the lemon ice tea are also something I love, especially since I prefer liquid sugar as a sweetener over artificial sugars.  Plus you can get a lid to take it to go.  . . Yes, the wait can be quite long during peak hours for cafe food, and parking may be a bit irritating since the lot is so small.  No, Savoy does not take credit cards, so make sure you bring cash.  And unfortunately it is not open on Sundays, which I still forget all the time after going there for a good 5 years on and off.  But the wait staff is quick and as attentive as can be for a busy little place, there is outdoor seating, and the food is always satisfying.
