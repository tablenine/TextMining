Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
I admit this place is a bit pricey for the tea and coffee.  BUT, La Mill is completely unique so despite the prices I think it deserves 5 stars.  I've never been to a cafe quite like it.  It's a nice, clean, trendy spot without being pretentious at all.  I've been to completely grungy coffee shops that are waaaay more snobby.  . . The first thing I ever had here was this MILK TEA thing (I'm not 100% sure what it was called but it's on their coffee/milk menu, and it's a hot beverage, not cold).  It was thicky and milky, just sweet enough but not too sweet, and absolutely delicious!. . I've also had their cappucino, latte, and just plain coffee.  Beware, their coffees are strong but GOOD.  I've also ordered their ground coffee and teas to take home in those awesome airtight tins that they have.  Once I got this limited edition coffee (I think it was a Rwanda-something) that was SO PERFECT.  But, because it was limited ed., they don't have it anymore and I'm so sad!!  My favorite teas are the GUILT FREE and TUMMY TIME.. . I've never had the food here but I've seen other people order breakfast and the egg dish that this one guy was eating looked so yummy.  I've been wanting to try their breakfast for awhile now but alas, I live in SD now so I don't get to go to La Mill that often.. . [*Tip: bring back your coffee and tea tins and they give you a discount on your order.]. . oh yeah, and i love their decor + location + the fact that it's not super loud inside + the fact that the waitstaff doesn't rush you out at all.
