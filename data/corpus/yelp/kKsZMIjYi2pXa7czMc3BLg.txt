Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
My favorite thing to do on a Sunday morning is to go jogging up Mt. Lee and then have brunch at Square One. It makes me feel so good. The delicious food satisfies only the way food made of fresh ingredients from the farmer's market can. My favorite omelet is the garlic/lemon thyme chicken sausage with roasted tomato and gruyere.  I was absolutely blown away by their buttermilk marinated chicken breast sandwich with portobello mushroom confit, truffled aioli, gruyere cheese, arugula and shaved red onions on a baguette. All the ingredients were so fresh and the bread was moist inside with a crispy shell just the way I like it. I'm salivating just thinking about it.... . The seating arrangement is quant and intimate. I love sitting outside where I can enjoy the beautiful LA weather and check out what the crazy  Scientologists are up to across the street. I read "TomKat" go there pretty regularly.
