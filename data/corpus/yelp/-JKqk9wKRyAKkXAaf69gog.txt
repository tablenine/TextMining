man oh man. how is this place still so busy after this many years. but anyway, went here with my parents this weekend. . . first of all, why is valet 8.50 before 5 and 10 after? remember when mozza opened and it was like 6 bucks?! . . we started with the grilled octopus and the burrata w/ speck. delicious! man, who knew octopus could be so tender?! i'm used to the japanese chewy kind. then for pasta, we had the orrechiete with sausage and then the big ol' raviolo. i had to get the sausage cuz i absolutely love the sausage pizza at the pizzeria. and the raviolo was perfectly how it should be. last month i had that kind of ravioli at another resto and i had to get that terrible taste out of my mouth with this big one. . . for secondi, we had the duck and the halibut. the halibut was overcooked and had way too many flavors. meh. but the duck was tender and juicy. it came with a corn salsa on the side, but i think it was a bit too early to serve that corn. not ready yet. . . dessert we had the blackberry crostata with a blackberry compote and the bombolini w/ huckelberry sauce and gelato. i heart donuts. . . so overall, everything was delicious besides the halibut. the service was friendly, especially when we asked for another table since the chairs were soo hard and so my dad could sit in a booth. . . next time i don't think i'll order any mains at all. just burrata!
