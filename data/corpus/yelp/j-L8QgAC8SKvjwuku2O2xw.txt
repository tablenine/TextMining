At lunch time, this place is always packed. And the really nice thing is their sign outside the door that tells you how long you could expect to wait be fore getting a table, before wasting time to wait in line, see a waitress, and finally just put your name in.. . The food here is pretty good, certainly better than old Shoneys or IHOP, but no where near as good as Greenwoods in Roswell. The service is quite nice and they are always on their toes there waiting hand and foot at lunch time! Like Lauren S. was saying, if you are on a diet, this is one place you do not want to be! Their white gravy is excellent and makes the fried pork or chicken just that much better. . . If you are in the area, you should check the place out.
