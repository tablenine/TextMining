Run, don't walk to Yuca's and get the cochinita pibil taco or burrito. Its pork stewed in some sort of delicious, spicy sauce and renders the pork so tender you are licking up every bit of it. The carne asada tacos are good here as well, but its the pibil taco's that are the true standout. The hours are weird though, they close by 6 pm and are not open Sundays, so I have been here only a handful of times because my cravings for tacos usually do not coincide with the hours Yuca's is open.
