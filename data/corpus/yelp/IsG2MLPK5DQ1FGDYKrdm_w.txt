I admit it.  I had very low expectations.  I despise sports bars.  But, I reluctantly agreed to join some fellow conference goers and Stats was where they wanted to go.. . The food was actually decent.  Waiters were attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere is laid back.  Dare I say I had a pleasant time?  Which could mean that for true sports bar fanatics Stats is a place to avoid.
