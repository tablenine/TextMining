The Happy Hour special is definitely worth waiting for a table.  Although the rolls are kind of small, because it's so cheap you can order enough rolls to make you full.  I wouldn't necessarily say the food itself is worth waiting for at full price though!. Service is mediocre at best and the food comes out SLOWLY.  I've been there at least 3 times and have had to wait a minimum of 45 minutes to get my food.  My advice is to get there before you're hungry!
