Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
The pasta bowl is a great place to meet friends for dinner or take out of town guests too - everyone likes pasta! The portions are really big. I usually get 2 meals out of one dinner. My favorite is the chicken with bow ties; it's with a white sauce and grilled chicken. There are also a lot of specialty pastas that are vegetarian, they're not just plain tomato sauce and noodles.
