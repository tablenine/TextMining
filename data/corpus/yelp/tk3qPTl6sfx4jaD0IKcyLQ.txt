Forget to mention how LOUD this place was the first time around. I went back the other weekend , had the cornbread waffle which was redonkulous but also got there a little earlier, around 9:30 and the place was muuuch less crowded and more quieter. As we left around 11:00 (don't expect speedy service, but whatever, you're enjoying your champagne!) it was starting to get loud again. So if you come around brunch time, don't bring your grandma--poor ol' lady doesn't stand a chance. "COURTNEY?! COURTNEY I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!"
