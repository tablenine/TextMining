I love this place, but it can get pricey if you go with a big group since dumplings alone can't fill me up. I also recommend the shanghai noodles, that was really tasty as well. You have to put ginger and vinegar in your soysauce... it adds so much flavor to your dumplings! I think it's the closest thing to authentic jaotze in Cali.
