by now you know this place is all about meat.  i give it 5 stars b/c the service is also very excellent.  they will not let you be hungry for a single second.  they will refill your sides, your plate and if you look the least bit like you need something, fingers will snap and waiters will be at your side in the blink of an eye.. . interesting tidbit.  this place also has the best flan i've ever had.  if you have room for dessert and you're not broke by that time....ORDER THE FLAN.  and after dinner you'll have to go on public assistance/welfare for about a month to recoop.  but i definitely recommend this place for when you feel like splurging.  . . i'm going this week!!!  i'm so excited..... . 9/21/07....edit:. ok, third time going and this time i ALSO tried the papaya creme for dessert.  MUST DO THIS AS WELL....very delicious...oh, and i forgot to mention last time that the salad bar here is the most excellent on earth...
