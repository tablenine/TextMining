Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The Apple Pan is fun. A fun, older establishment with cash registers that look like they belong in an antique shop. I love the hickory burger. It's the kind of burger that's not too messy, but not too clean. Their "special sauce" isn't anything like In n Out's thousand island dressing concoction. I'm not actually sure what it is. Ketchup-based is my best guess. I'm sure other writers have weighed in. It isn't a food burger but more of a "gourmet" burger: extremely filling and the meat is thicker, juicer, tastier. . . The bar itself is really interesting, as everyone is glancing over at grill right in front of them, where burgers are made to order extremely quickly. Fries are crunchy, nothing special. For the price, they do serve a lot of fries. I haven't tried their pie yet because I was just TOO full from my burger, and that doesn't usually happen when I am hungry. When I'm back next time, I will take the advice from fellow yelpers (and the name itself) and order me some pie! Until then, enjoy your burgers!
