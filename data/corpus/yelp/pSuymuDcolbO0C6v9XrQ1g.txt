Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
great place. they were able to accomodate a reservation for 18 on a friday night at 8pm. so thats already awesome in my book. service was really good. the food was yummy. they have this cheese that looks like parmasean and it was sooooooooo good especially when you mixed some of it with olive oil to dip your bread. . . i didn't know that there were three different restaurants in this place. we had reservations at the village which was upstairs. loved the decor. it looked like we were outside. there were cute little booths and cubby holes areas that made things a bit more private. it would be a nice place to take a date.
