Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
Came here for the first time last week.  Fortunately, I was with close friends who were more than willing to share.  So, true to form, I ate way more than I should have, but I was able to sample several entrees.  . . The highlights of the meal:. Salumi &amp; Charcuerie (chef's selection cured meats). Roasted Pumpkin Soup. Lamb Spezzatino. Steak Frites. Lamb Shank. . In my opinion, Fraiche is a gem of the Culver City food scene.  The sign of a good restaurant is that it seems to call you back for a second round, while a very good restaurant fulfills your expectations upon your return.  Fraiche is calling me back, and I'm looking forward to another fine meal.
