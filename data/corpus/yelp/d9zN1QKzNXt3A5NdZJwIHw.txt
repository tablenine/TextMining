Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I too got my ramen cherry popped by Orochon and it left me satisfied. It is my go-to ramen place. . . I'm weak sauce so I usually order one level above non-spicy. If i go a level Â above that i swear i will sweat bullets and feel like someone's tickling my feet. . . It's only wheelchair accessible because you can eat outside.. . Oh, did you know, the teriyaki chicken is the BEST here?
