Wow I must have missed something....how come everyone loves this place? I didn't enjoy my experience at Geisha House at all. The valet parking out front is a disaster! Every time I'm in the area I want to spit at the Geisha House valet  for creating so much havoc. I guess most people don't know you can self park a block up in the parking garage. . . Walking into Geisha House you are greeted by a long dark hallway that leads you down to the hostess/bar/lounge area, I didn't mind the long wait for our table since I was well equipped with a cocktail. The area we waited in was spacious with high ceilings, but the whole place has a bat cave feel, it's very dark!. . As the hostess lead upstairs to our table I started feeling even more claustrophobic because the ceilings were low If I stood on a stool I could touch the ceiling of the bat cave! (and I'm 5'2!) I was hoping the food would blow my mind and divert my attention away from thoughts of  "the walls are closing in on  me" but no such luck..... the sushi left a lot to be desired especially at those prices! (oh and what's up with the outfits the waiters sport? Are they gondoliers? Shouldn't they be dressed like GEISHAS?)
