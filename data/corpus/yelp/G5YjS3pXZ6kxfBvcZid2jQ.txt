Overall, a great experience! I went on a Sunday evening and there was a line out the door, but we only waited about 15 minutes as the turnover rate seemed high.. . I had the chicken and pork combination dish on recommendation and it was very good. The chicken was saoked in the garlic juice which is great because even if you are the type of person not to eat the skin the meat is full of flavor. The pork was tender and went well with the rice and black beans.. . If I had any complaints, it would be that the food was very oily. The bread basket that they give before your meal had a puddle of oil left over on the bottom and the meat was swimming in it. Its hard to really complain about this because a lot of the flavor comes from the oil itself.. . The best part is the price. All the prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food that you get.
