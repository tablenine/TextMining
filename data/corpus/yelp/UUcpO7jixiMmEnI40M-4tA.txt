The Tyrannosaurus Rex tour of Chicago continued with Gibson's tonight. Yesterday was a rib-eye so today called for filet mignon.. . I see this establishment is hated as well for its crowds, noise, and hype, more so than the Weber Grill it seems. I must be easy to please, because I just loved my meat today. It too was also charred well on the outside, yet pink on the inside as medium rare should be. It was tender as all get out, and juicy to the max. The Bearnaise sauce on the side was full of buttery goodness. I'm not sure how many years tonight took off my life.. . The garlic spinach with mushrooms was one nice side dish. I kept eating it until my teeth bristled with that irony texture. Portions were big enough for 5 of us to share. The asparagus with hollandaise sauce was somewhat disappointing. It didn't have much pizazz. The salad that comes with the steak was nothing special, just iceberg lettuce with a ton of dressing. I like the drowning of dressing but I know it's bad for me.. . The place was crowded as all get out, but noise was fine since we were seated in the glass enclosed outer patio room, and was placed in the corner with a great view of the street life.. . Service was great and attentive. Prices are quite amazing with the grand porterhouse running around $90 and the giant lobster tail at $125 or so. They do have some entrees under $15, so you can eat there on a budget too.. . So far so good on the carnivorous tour of Chi-town. The tour concludes tomorrow with Fogo de Chao. I expect meat and meat goodness, and will post tomorrow!
