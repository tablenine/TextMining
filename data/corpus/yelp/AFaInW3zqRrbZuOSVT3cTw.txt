Restaurant: Gibsons Bar &amp; Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I've tried Gibsons twice because the first time didn't impress me, but I always give a place a second chance.  Unfortunately the second time was just as bad.  It's pricey, but that doesn't bother me.  I'm willing to pay for high quality, but I just don't get it here.  I had the filet both times and it was about the same thing I could get at Outback.  The service was fine and the decor was as well, but when I go to a steakhouse it's because I want a kick ass steak and quite honestly Gibsons doesn't deliver that.
