Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Palms Thai is almost as unreal as the mythical elvis that is supposed to pop out of the rice pot when you get your food. The food is delicious and authentic and for the right price! I really like the pad thai and the curries come out in a big heaping bowl. This is a change from the places that when you order curry serve it to you in a small cup, leaving you yearning for more. The portions are great as individual servings or as family style, if its still not enough, order more! The place is also great for large parties because the big long tables, parking is in the back as valet for just a couple bucks.. . Last times I came I missed out Â the mythical elvis, but truthfully, I believe it is the little bit of elvis inside you that is awakened when you walk through the door.
