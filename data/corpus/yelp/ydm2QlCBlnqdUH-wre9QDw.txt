Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
If you want to be offended come here. Although, I was one of the lucky ones to be complimented. "Thank you, Michael Jackson." I mean, I know I can be light-skinned, but skin-bleached Michael Jackson? Baby, please. Weiner Circle definitely throws a show! Imagine a hot dog host saying that the ring you bought your fiance is a "cheap ass ring." Or you walking in with your tight-fitting jeans, "Uh uh honey, you ain't no size 14!" Or you taking a picture: "B!TCH this ain't no zoo, put a dollar in this, B!TCH!!!" Dang, mouth agape. Not only with a hot dog about to kamikaze its way down to my tummy, but in shock at how bold, belittling, and biting these ladies' comments are. Have fun but wear a thick shell in case you get whipped with words. -Matt
