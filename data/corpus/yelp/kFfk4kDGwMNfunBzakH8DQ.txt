Restaurant: Osteria del Figo
Category: Italian
I'll take this location over the other Figo spots because of the outdoor seating. It definitely has more room to breathe and more room to enjoy a meal than the other spots.. . Service isn't stellar, but the food makes up for it. I'm a huge fan of the siciliana sauce, to the point where I either get that or something from the daily specials. The zuca used to be my obsession when I first started going here, but now that it's on the menu every day (it used to only be a special) it doesn't seem the same.
