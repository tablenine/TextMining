I came here on a Monday night celebrating my own birthday.. After reading all the rave reviews on Yelp, I thought that this place would be a great place to celebrate.. I had very mixed feelings about this place.. Here's why!. . Pros:. -The decoration and interior was indeed verrry lovely. I was not expecting this place to be so swanky and upscale. Everything here is very WHITE and dim. The whole restaurant seems like a converted warehouse, thus the ceilings are very tall and overall venue large.. I enjoyed having the open kitchen too.. - Great wine list! We ordered a bottle of the moscato (since it was all girls). At $36 a bottle, it was definitely a great choice!. - The menu was incredibly expansive. It offered everything from sandwiches to pastas to pizzas to chicken dishes and even steak! There also was a large section dedicated to smaller plates. . The pizzas (in my opnion) are the best bargain. Each pizza is $15, and they are very large! . - I liked how there was a small market-like area of the restaurant. They sold things a la carte, like their lasagna and other dishes.. . Cons. - They don't take reservations. Luckily, I had picked a Monday night to dine so there weren't that many people and I had no problem getting a table for the 7 of us.. - Despite it being a low key Monday night, service was not that great. We had a hard time flagging down our waiter. He did make it up to us by giving me a cupcake for my birthday! yay!. - I was kind of upset with the portion sizes. I ordered pasta gambart(?) and I was sad at how small it was. It was $15 and I didn't think it was worth the price. The pizzas and chicken dishes were so large, I kind of expected the pasta dishes to be the same.. . Overall, it was a solid restaurant.
