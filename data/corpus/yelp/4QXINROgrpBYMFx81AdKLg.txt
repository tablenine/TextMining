Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
Trader Vic's just plain ol' rocks. I had no idea. I expected a kind of fake Hawaiian atmosphere that a mafia hitman would find classy. And it is exactly that. But up his sleeve Vic hides an old fashioned charm that won me over, not to mention amazing food that made the prices seem like a downright bargain. Mai Tai's were $7 a pop and worth every damn penny. The spare ribs, roasted in this massive wicker basket-like contraptions, tasted like bacon and fell off the bone. They have nice waitpeoples all dressed in floral prints and treat you all fancy. I'm a sucker for a place that is both elegant and causal at the same time. I hope the local Vic's is as good because I plan to go a lot.
