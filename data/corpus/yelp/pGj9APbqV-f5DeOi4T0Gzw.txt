Pretty much my dream menu.  I am the definition of a carnivore so a place with all you can eat meat...outstanding.  The cuts of meat are delicious, I second what some other reviewers have said by asking for a piece of meat from the middle because the exterior can be overly salty.  The picanha, filet mignon and the chicken/filet wrapped in bacon are the highlights for me, but everything is at least worth trying.  Starve yourself before and if somebody isn't a huge red meat fan it's probably not worth bringing them.  But if you are like me and will probably die at 35 from a red-meat induced heart attack then by all means hit this place up.
