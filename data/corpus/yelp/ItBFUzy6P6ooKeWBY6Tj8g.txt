YEAH Revewer # 1000. Our office used to come to Porto's weekly before I joined the company.. I had to resurrect that tradition.. . Came during the weekday..  There was tons of traffic due to construction.  Be warned!!!. . Came with 4 co-workers.  There are two lines.  one for food and the other for dessert/pastries/cakes.. Standing @ the end of the line, it was around 15 mins to get to the front.  The line movement depends on newbies asking too many questions. . . Now for the food review: I ordered the cubano.  It was nice size for $5.. I had bigger and better for same price.  But, prices are higher in Burbank.  So hence I would consider this a good deal.  (imho as a newbie to the Burbank lunch scene).. As a plus, you get plantain chips for side.  Better eaten fresh.  They taste awful if refrigerated and eaten later in the day.. . They have counter seating, inside and outside table seats.. As the weather is warming up, we sat outside.. . I wanted to check out the dessert side but there was a long line. The dessert counter does not display any prices.  I guess after standing in the line, you are willing to pay their price.  :). . Well go try it.
