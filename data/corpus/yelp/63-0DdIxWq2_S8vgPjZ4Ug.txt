Trader Vic's is so fun! We go there with a big group on a lot of Thursdays when Tongo Hiti plays - they're a great band that plays lots of hits - 80s, random movie hits, you name it, they can play it. The last time we were there they played "My Heart Will Go On" from Titanic, which is an EPIC singalong if you've had a few of their Mai Tais.. . Speaking of which....$5 Mai Tais on Thursday nights!! They used to be $4, but seriously, all you need is 1-2, and you are good to go for the rest of the night. A lot of sugar in them though, so watch out. . . The food here is good too...I've had the calamari which was great and one of their desserts, too. They also have these really cool big cups they serve some of the tropical drinks in. You know, the brown, glazed type in the shape of monkey heads and what not. . . Love this place, will probably be going back this week!
