Attention boys! If you are trying to impress a girl (also known as trying to get laid),, take your girl here.  She will be impressed.. . The food ranges from okay to pretty good depending on what you get, but the views and atmosphere are wonderful.  In the center of the restaurant is a large room that is a very romantic.  It has a koi pond and a great Japanese feel.  The other areas of the restaurant have spectacular views. . . Also, it is a bit pricey but you are paying for the view!. . Good to know-Parking is just valet.
