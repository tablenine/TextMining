Restaurant: El Carmen
Category: Bars
(I have been going to El Carmen for over two years and never got the gay bar vibe.....is it really a gay bar? (see the category above)). . I enjoy El Carmen more and more with each visit.  The tequila list is strong and the bartenders actually know what they are talking about.  I really like being able to say, "I usually drink (Insert name of tequila), is there anything you think I should try?" And actually getting an intelligent response.. . Also, the guys (and gals??) in the kitchen managed to maintain consistently good food (not haute cuisine by any means, but tasty) despite the expanded menu.  . . Great place for drinks on a week day evening or even a casual date.  Gets crowded on the weekends!!
