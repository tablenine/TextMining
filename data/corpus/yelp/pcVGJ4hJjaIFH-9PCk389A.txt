This restaurant has an intriguing menu and a nice ambiance indoors.  There's something for everyone; even non-vegetarians will find food to their liking.. . The biggest problem with RFD is that it's overpriced.  The portion sizes are only moderate and while some ingredients are a bit obscure, most are not.  You could well end up spending $14 for a salad you could have made yourself for $3.  The message is: Order wisely and expect to leave with a little less than you'd hoped in either a) your wallet or b) your stomach.
