I really don't get why people like this place at all. I ordered the seafood paella and it was basically plain yellow rice tossed with some cooked shrimp, mussels, calamari, and salmon. Â Zero flavor. Definitely the most terrible paella I've had. I should have known by the $9.95 price tag that it wasn't going to be spectacular.. . The staff didn't help us find a table and barely told us that it was seat yourself.. . If you're looking for Mexican, even cheap Mexican this isn't the place to go. Check out Casa Grande on Peachtree for good Mexican and El Azteca for cheap Mexican.
