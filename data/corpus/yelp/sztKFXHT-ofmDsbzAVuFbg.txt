3rd stop for the food coma adventure.. . Ice cream sandwich that's the only thing we got. We tried vanilla and mint chocolate i like the vanilla way better! Plus i'm not a big fan of chocolate mint, who ever thought of that flavor being mixed together should be executed electrocuted or raped by 1000 maniacs!!! Anyway i love the crunchy cookie that they used and its covered with chocolate so it won't get soggy.. . it was good!!! But I won't be back any time soon cause its far and its cold right now!!!. . shut up!
