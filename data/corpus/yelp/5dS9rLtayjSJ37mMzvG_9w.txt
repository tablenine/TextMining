Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I first came to Geisha House a Â year or 2 ago when I had to take some clients out to dinner. I've since been back a few more times and the service and food are always good.. . I like the tuna tataki, Kobe beef with crispy rice, black cod, the lamb chops, and most of their rolls are also tasty. I always get a few orders of toro as well, especially when I'm eating on the company's dime. Don't be a goober --- order something aside from the teriyaki chicken. This isn't Yoshinoya so go out on a limb and try their specialties! There are lots of raw and cooked options so no excuses! Geisha House is a modern Japanese spot so it's a good place for American palates who want to try sushi. The space is also beautiful. Very seductive, all lipstick red.. . The Blushing Geisha and Geisha's Kiss are my favorite cocktails.. . This IS Hollywood though, so you'll have to ignore the girls outside looking like $2 gardening tools. Whoever said that underwear can be worn as a skirt needs to be shot.
