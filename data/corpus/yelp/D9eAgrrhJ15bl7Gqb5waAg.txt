Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
I HATE this location of the Vortex. It's almost inconcievable that two restaurants in the same chain could be so diametrically opposite. The food here is the same, but the service is horrid. If the Little 5 one is the "punk Vortex" then this is the "gay Vortex," but that's not even the point. This is almost the "sex and the city vortex" with all the WASPs and stuck-ups from Midtown. For this reason, alone I would ruuuunnnn .......
