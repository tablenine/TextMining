I came here the first time on a weekday for lunch and was impressed with the freshness of the sashimi pieces.  So my friend and I decided to eat here on a Saturday.  I think we both ordered the sashimi plate and this time, the sushi was kind of bleh.  The pieces seemed small and brownish, not very fresh looking or tasting.  Service was good both times.
