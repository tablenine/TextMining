Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The thought of rolling deep at Roscoe's with a bunch of San Francisco white people seemed like a death wish at the time, but now I'm pretty sure waffles and fried chicken brings everyone together. I really wish Roscoe's was in the Bay Area, because I'd eat here every day and get super fat and most likely die of a heart attack, but at least it would be a delicious ride.. . Snoop Dogg was right. Roscoe's is legit.
