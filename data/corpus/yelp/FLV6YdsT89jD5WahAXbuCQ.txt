One of my favorite lunch spots.  It's really gorgeous inside and I always want to order everything.  I always end up getting their grilled vegetable sandwich with goat cheese but the egg salad and caprese sandwich are good vegetarian options as well.  It's never too difficult to find a seat (different story with parking), there are people around who will help you.  There's also a bakery with the best "decadent brownie" ever.  EVER.
