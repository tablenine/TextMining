Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
After introducing my buddy to some good food in San Diego. She felt she needed to return the favor. So on one visit she brought my sister and I to Casa Bianca. . . Apparently there is always a wait...and If memory serves ours was almost more than 30 minutes. We went walking around the neighborhood for a while, bought some donuts (to hold us over), and made use of our time. . . When we were seated the service was mediocre at best...the food only slightly better. I ordered Pizza ( what else?)...and I have to say, as much as my friend highly spoke of the pizza I was not as impressed as I hoped I would be. I ordered the sausage. My initial reaction was "this taste like frozen pizza, good frozen pizza, but it taste like frozen pizza".... . . My sister ordered some sort of pasta, and my friend ordered Lasagna which I have to say I wish I would have ordered because it was great! Overall the environment is really cozy and the food is good. So I would return someday....but I won't go out of my way to come here again. . . I recommend to try it, at least once!
