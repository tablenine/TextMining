The Cuban sandwich was delicious and only $6. At first, I was like, wait, it doesn't come with a side? But don't worry, this is one large sammy. It was oozing its delicious cheese and pickle juice all over my hands, but it was worth the four napkins I had to use. Seriously, this Cuban was so good, my tummy and my tongue high-fived. . . Unforch, our service was not up to par. After waiting 20 minutes for our drinks to come, they forgot my friend Elizabeth's Diet Coke. It took awhile to get our checks, and nobody checked on us during our meal to see if we needed anything either. So make the trip if you're in the mood for some quality food, but make sure to devote a lot of time to your meal and hydrate yourself beforehand!
