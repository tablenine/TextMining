Absolutely hands down! The best place for Chinese/Authentic cuisines in Atlanta.  The Dragon Soup is very savory and compliments any dish well as a starter.  All dishes are cooked to perfection.  You can find your typical chinese favorites or you can order off the menu if you are craving a specific authentic dish.  The service is quick and they are open late (2am).  . . Here are my favorite dishes as suggestions:. . -Salt &amp; Pepper Shrimp or Squid. -Dragon Soup. -Shrimp toast. -Wor Sue Duck with assorted meat. -Beef Brisket Hot Pot. -Lobster with ginger/scallion sauce. -Pan-fried sea bass. -Filet steak with black pepper sauce. -Beef with chinese broccoli. . I am salivating as I list these dishes....
