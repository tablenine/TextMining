Had dinner here for the first time last night. Don't know why we waited so long! It was delicious. Started with the calamari! Not my first choice for Â an appetizer but this was very very good. Tender and tasty and the fried lemons were a taste bud surprise! I had the Moroccan Chicken...perfectly cooked and seasoned, great flavors, the sugar snap peas were also amazing. My husband ordered the small plate cedar plank salmon and steak pita. We are usually disappointed when we order fish at restaurants...but this salmon was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. It was delicious! I did not try the steak pita but he said it was incredible! We had to sit inside on account of rain...but the decor and service was wonderful...pleasant, warm and inviting. My in-laws agreed it is their new favorite place to eat when they visit Atlanta! We are looking forward to going back to enjoy the food and hopefully the beautiful patio out back...and maybe even some live music!
