I have no idea what to get...but the bf told me that it's all good. i have to say that i am a sucker for southern style fried chicken. hell, i even made the bf take me to the grocery store at 2am to buy supplies to make it the next day.. . i got the normal chicken and whatever else comes with it. it was yummy. i normally don't even like chicken too but this was delish. i liked the potatoes and gravy too. the drinks with oj and whatever else are good too. i highly recommend.
