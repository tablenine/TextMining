This place is really good. Too bad it's super small and always crowded. Doesn't matter though. I'm hooked now. That Greek scramble put it on me and now I'm an addict. . . I will share one particularly frustrating experience that I had which made me question my love for this place... . . I walked in put my name down for party of three and waited...and waited...and waited...and waited. I see that my name is close. Now the lady who had been seating people had been doing a very good job. Then she got busy. Uh oh. So this guy starts seating people. Ok so let's do the math ok? So there are three open tables. Two two seaters and one booth. There are two party of twos in front of my party of three. So where should everyone go??? . . Figure it out yet? I hope you did because he sure didn't. He sat the party of two at a two seater and then a party of two at the booth. then that leaves my party of three...oh wait now we can't sit down because there is only an empty two seater table. I tried to explain the error of his ways but he completely blew me off and then proceeded to seat two to three other party of twos who came in after me. By this time I'm FURIOUS. But oh no...he wasn't done yet. Then he calls a party of three whose name was after mine on the list and I about lost it! I stopped him and told him that he keeps passing over my name. Then he apologizes and hugs me! He hugs me! It was very condescending. I really wanted to slap him but then I'd have to deal with APD (and we know how crazy they are). Then he finally seats us. . . Although I found this situation to be very ridiculous and upsetting I've decided that I won't let it get between me and my Greek scramble. So take my advice and monitor that damn wait list. You wait right there until you are seated because they obviously aren't organized as far as hostessing goes.
