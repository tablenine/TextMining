Category: Dim Sum
After living in SF and eating great dim sum, I was skeptical about trying dim sum in Chicago.  Well, I am happy to say that I love the dim sum at Phoenix!  . . I eat the typical favorites...ranging from the bbq pork buns, salt and pepper spareribs, turnip cakes, egg custard tarts, chinese broccelli, mango pudding, sticky rice with chicken...there are more but I don't know the equivalent English names to them. Also, unfortunately I have a shellfish allergy so I can't eat my favorite shu mai or har gau anymore. But everyone else at my table say they're good and that the shrimp in the har gau are pretty big. . . Every once in awhile if I'm with a group of guys, we'll order a noodle dish to fill them up. The noodles are hit or miss as they sometimes come out really greasy.  . . After finding Phoenix, I haven't had the need to venture out and find others. Only complaint is that the wait can be extremely long so make sure you get there really early. I've had to wait up to an hour for a table for 2!  Also, it's definitely not cheap. For two people eating moderately, the tab has been about $30+.  Guess I can't find my $10 per person dim sum restaurants like I did in SF.... . Tip - Order a pot of chrysathenum tea (with side of rock sugar) instead of the jasmine tea that they'll bring to you by default.  It's my favorite kind of Chinese tea and has more health benefits.
