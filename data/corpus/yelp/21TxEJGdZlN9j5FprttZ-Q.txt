Again with the freaken shabu shabu! I don't like it! But I'm forced to have it every once in awhile. For some odd reason, everyone loves this place. There's always a loooong wait. Why? Because it's supposedly sooo good. Well we waited and waited tonight and you know what? TASTES LIKE EVERY OTHER SHABU SHABU RESTAURANT! My friends said it was sooo delicious....WTF? Did I miss something? Maybe I wasn't high enough? Is it not the same 2 sauces, the same thin slices of meat, the same stupid veggies? I really don't get it? Definitely not worth the wait. This place is small too. Since there's a long wait, people will just stand there and watch you eat. WTF? Shabu shabu will remain a mystery to me...as in why the fuck do people love it so much? And how can you get full on like 3 bites of meat? It ain't cheap either! Dinner for 4 was about $100! Parking was dreadful. I will definitely pass on this place next time...even if you're buying.
