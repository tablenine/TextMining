Porto's is good... for certain things.. . I LOVE all their pastries. I have tried a couple and I've never hated one. They are all really delicious, especially the ever popular.. cheese rolls. The guava&amp;cheese, mango empanada, and apricot danish are really good too. . . I've only tried two things outside of the pastry menu. The potato balls are SOOO good (but so fatty&amp;oily). I tried their tamales and I've had A LOT better. I can usually finish tamales but that one just wouldn't go down. Because of the tamale I don't think I want to venture outside of the pastries.. . Otherwise... Porto's has reaaal good pastries. The lines aren't long (if you go to the one in Burbank which isn't that much farther) and it's pretty cheap.
