"WOW!!! I still have money left to spend?", I asked the sweet kind very young gentleman at the register after ordering the soup and fried rice and sweet tea. My first time here today at the GT technical-campus sidewalk cafe. The food and atmosphere here is awesome.  I haven't seen a bowl this huge of hot n sour soup and basil fried rice with chicken before!!!  The portions are so huge and it was so good but unfortunately I couldn't eat all of it. The hot and sour soup was brothy with great flavors!!! The chicken basil fried rice was very good but it had very little basil and only couple of pieces of jalapenos in my dish, but still good to eat though. I would have liked the gigantic sized cucumbers to be diced instead of slices though and same for jalapenos.  I also tried the Vietnamese roll with honey-miso sauce. It was kinda of like a tofu-ish minced chicken roll, slightly odd tasting but not bad at all!!!  I enjoyed the beautiful surrounding of warm walls and urban-loft like atmosphere.  This place hits the spot for comfort eating. Definately a place to return to!!!. *Caution: I came at 1:00pm and found a nice table seated by the window.  Before I realized it a huge flux  of people arrived and suddenly the tables became a luxury item. Do try this place!!!
