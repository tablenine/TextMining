I'm sorry to say, but this place is way over-rated.. Or maybe my expectations were too high. I also saw this place on the Food Network and on the Travel Channel. When Anthony Bordain came to LA and went to Philippe's with the Derby Dolls, I decided that this is somewhere I really want to visit. . . The sandwiches looked good. I thought it was wierd that I had never heard of Philippe's until I saw them on TV.. . We headed over right after the Dodgers game and surprise surprise the lines were LONG! . I think we waited about 20 minutes to order.. . We ordered the beef sandiwiches single dipped, a bowl of chili with beans, potato salad, and a baked apple.. The sandwich was was really bland to me. The only flavor came from the au jus. Not worth the wait already.... The chili was alright. Actually, I enjoyed the chili more than anything else we ordered.. The baked apple was cold. I was expecting a warm baked apple but it was good. . . I didn't like the potato sald mainly because it had relish in it. Don't get me wrong, i like relish but not in potato salad. One bite and I was done with that.. . I wouldn't come back unless a few friends were persistant that they wanted to try it. . . Nothing to rave about.
