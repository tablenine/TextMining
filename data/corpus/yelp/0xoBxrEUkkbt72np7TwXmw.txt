Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
The popularity of this place pisses me off.   . . This is not a Chinese restaurant- they serve a little of every kind of Asian food- Chinese, Japanese, Korean, SE Asian.  That always makes me skeptical- everything I've tried is OK, but nothing's great- what exactly is their specialty?  Some will say tapioca ball drinks, which is lame if you ask me.   . . I think this place's specialty is getting non-Asian people to visit Chinatown knowing there's a nice safe restaurant "for them," complete with a menu with PICTURES!  The line's out the door since it was on "Check Please" with sheep looking for a safe Chinatown "hot spot."  Ha, this place sucks- they should go to Emperor's Choice down the block and get some good Chinese instead!  Or go up north on Western Ave for your Korean!  Or Argyle St for Vietnamese.  The list goes on, and this place ain't on it! . . Update- So many friends have read my review here and made a point to tell me how "great it was before Check Please."  Well, I'll share with you internet people what I've shared with my friends- it's now after "Check Please," and my review is for how it is now.  So RIP "good" Joy Yee's because you suck now by me.
