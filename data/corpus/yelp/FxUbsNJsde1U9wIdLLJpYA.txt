The food is so so so good, and its fun sitting outdoors.   My friend Joe had the pesto pasta scramble and man was it good... be forewarned, the parking situation is terrible but I think its well worth it... I've tried a few things here and never been disappointed.  A good solid go-to breakfast place that is a lot lighter than doughboys (which will make you full for the next 3 days I swear...)
