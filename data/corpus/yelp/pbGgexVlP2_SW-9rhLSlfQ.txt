Wait, I seriously haven't written a review for Frasca yet?!?! Whaaat?!. . When we first moved to the neighborhood, the boyfriend and I came here all the time.  It's a great neighborhood place, especially on Wednesdays for the buy one, get one free (gourmet, brick oven) pizza!!  (On one particularly cheap Wednesday we walked out with a pizza each + a diet coke for me + tip for $21 dollars or something like that.)  We also like to order the farmer's board or whatever it's actually called.  They offer a nice  selection of cheeses, yummy cured meats, and bruschetta--and you get to pick 4.  Nice way to start the meal.. . Really nice wine list, too.  One night (Tuesday or Weds, can't remember which), they have half price bottles of wine.  To me, I thought that's cool, but probably only a limited selection to choose from.  No.  ANY BOTTLE UNDER $100 is half-price.  Frasca, your specials are ridiculously awesome.. . And to end the meal?  They have skillet cookies!  (Don't tell anyone, but I freaking LOVE skillet cookies!)!  Not the best I've ever had, but a skillet cookie is a skillet cookie, people.  Enjoy!
