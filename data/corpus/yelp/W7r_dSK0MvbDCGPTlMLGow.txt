oh geez, the los angeles version of the soup nazi.  DO NOT mess around ordering your food at the apple pan.  they don't stand for that kind of silliness, but don't misconstrue this for rudeness.  this is just the way they have been since the dawn of time.  order yourself a cheeseburger with double cheese and fries.  mmmm, some of the best french fries on the planet.  i also only drink orange soda at the apple pan, which is a mystery that i have yet to solve.  finish that up with a piece of pecan pie and you will not be eating for a week.  so much food.  . . the apple pan gets 4 stars because sometimes it can be a little stressful waiting around to find a seat at the u-shaped bar.  there is no real rhyme or reason to the waiting policy, and there have been times when i've been too hungry to jump over people to eat.  that said, don't be one of those people who hang out eating their food forever.  you see all those people waiting behind you?  you're killing them.  thanks!
