If you're lucky enough to get an invite from a member, please go, you won't be disappointed.. . Magic Castle is home to some of the biggest names in magic, and thankfully the largest room is probably 40+ people.  The close-up room in particular, will let you see some of the best slight of hand on the planet, mere feet from the illusionist.. . I've only dined here once, and the Beef Wellington was excellent.  Do yourself a favor: as the night winds down, head to the kitchen and get a bowl of chili.  It's absolutely fantastic.
