i originally wanted to try BOTH Portos (don't judge me!) so i can compare the two, but we ran out of time, so will check out Glendale location next time! . . Got the Portos Special- a dozen guava cheese strudels (you can pick cheese rolls instead) for 8 bucks. . Two potato Balls. One Napolean . Two Cheese rolls = total THIRTEEN BUCKS! very affordable!. . guava pastries were a hit at the potluck later. as soon as my friends saw the Portos box, they were happy!. . i do prefer the cheese rolls over the guava strudel, with the sugar sprinkles that top the flaky,yummy cheese rolls Â =5 stars!!! . . potato balls were a nice surprise with their meat filling. . . napolean- good, but i like the one at kings hawaiian better. . . A MUST for baked good lovers!!!. . (thank you marthie D and Anthony N for the glendale location notes- will def use them when i go there next!) and thanks to all my yelper buddies who recommended the pastries here!
