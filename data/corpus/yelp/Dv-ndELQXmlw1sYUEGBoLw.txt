Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I think Pink's hotdogs were just ok...honestly besides the variety it offers...I can't really taste the difference between Pink's hotdogs and the ones from my friend's bbq.  It really is just a place where you would have to go once for the sake of "Oh..I live in LA and I've had Pink's before."  My bf really wanted to eat here...so i just tagged along with him.  But their variety of sodas were pretty cool though.  I don't think I would ever go out of my way to go to Pink's for a hotdog.  Its not worth the drive and the wait in line.
