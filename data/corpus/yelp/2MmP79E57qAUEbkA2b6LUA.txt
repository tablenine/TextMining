Probably the best Brazilian steakhouse I've been to in LA! It easily beats out others like Picanha in Burbank... . I came here over New Years day with a friend from Canada. To be honest we went to the SLS first but they were full so this was sort of a second choice. And I'm so friggin' glad we came. I'm a steak fiend so I was in heaven, and as for my friend.. Let's just say it was the most meat I've seen eaten by a 110lb Canadian girl in one sitting.. she loved it!. . We had 7 different cuts of steak (yes I was counting), chicken and lamb. My favorite was probably the filet. It was seasoned to perfection. And best of all the meat chunks were grilled from rare to medium to well in sections so you could try different textures of the same cut in one sitting. The rib eye, top and bottom sirloins were great too. The lamb was a slight disappointment, they should've tried a sweeter marinade. The chicken was deelish!. . There was a good variety of sides too. I loved the mashed potatoes. Not a big fan of plantains though so didn't try that but according to my friend it was good. I asked for A1 sauce and got to work on the meats and boy was there a lott...! The servers come by in quick succession when you have your little card showing green. They weren't as attentive replenishing sides but as soon as we pointed that out they brought out more in a flash. Nice service!. . As for the price it was $57/person but I think that's well worth it, specially when you realize that a single cut at Lawrys costs $40. And the crowd is not pretentious at all, which is cool considering that its in Beverly Hills. Everyone there were dressed in t shirts and jeans and busy pigging out.. Ha!. . We felt pretty barbaric at the end of the meal having consumed so much meat. But we were happily shtuffed :)
