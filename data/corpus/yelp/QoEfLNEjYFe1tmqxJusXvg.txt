Live seafood would be awesome with this sauce, and of course cost a little more.  Their sauce is awesome..  The only problem is most the seafood is precooked, and just mixed with the sauce to be heated.  . . I usually just get the shrimp there now because they were at least raw frozen shrimp that got cooked with the sauce.  The dungeness crab and crawdads I got didnt taste too fresh, but the sauce helps a lot
