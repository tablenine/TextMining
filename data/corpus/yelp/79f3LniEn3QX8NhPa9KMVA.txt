I absolutely loved the feel at Fraiche.  The wood floors, the exposed brick, and the outside patio with trees and twinkle lights are an absolute perfect setting.. . I met a friend here for dinner the other night.  I arrived first and sat at the bar.  I ordered a Swanky Lee. Mmmm, so delicious. It was gin, lemon juice, muddled fresh strawberries, and vanilla.  Definitely a must have. And I thought was reasonably priced at $9.  I asked to keep the menu so my friend could order a drink, but then was brought the check right after that.  A bit odd, but not a big deal.. . After our drinks, we were seated.  We sat inside but near the large open windows that lead to the open outside patio in the front and the breeze was perfect.  After reading the reviews here, I went with the Kurobuta pork chop.  It was good, but nothing amazing.  It looked like it was cooked perfectly but was very difficult to cut and hard to pierce with my fork. I actually had to ask for a steak knife to cut it. It came with shelling beans, caramelized onions, and a delicious aioli.  Being that it was $26, I don't think I would order it again. My friend went with the Lamb Spezzatino with ricotta gnocchi.  The lamb was soooo tender and the gnocchi was perfection.  Definitely a great dish.. . And for the pièce de résistance...  the new love of my life.... the Chocolate Bread Pudding with bourbon caramel sauce and peanut brittle ice cream.  Do you hear that??? The angels in heaven are singing. If I could bathe in it I would.
