After watching the documentary "I Like Killing Flies," I had to visit Shopsin's on our stop through NYC last December.. . Not being a party of five, I knew my boyfriend and I would be alright, but I was still a little skeered of Kenny Shopsin -- he's an imposing figure!. . The menu is indeed a clusterf*#k of insanity, and I think it needs an errata.  We ordered a soup to share in one of those crazy yin-yang bowls and had a sandwich each: all of it was amazing.. . While we were there, Kenny came out from behind the stove and opened his mail, and one of the packages he got was the book "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs," which got the few patrons reminiscing about what a great book it is.. . I wanted to ask for a picture with him and mention we'd seen the film recently, but fearing a reaming, I managed to snap a fuzzy pic as we were leaving.  Definitely one of my favorite NYC experiences.
