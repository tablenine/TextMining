Maybe it was the single quail egg, an egg I've never completely trusted, but the tuna nicoise salad lacked the nicoiseness I expect from my tuna nicoise. Fresh, no doubt, but something about the whole arrangement didn't quite ever make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.. . That said, I'm more than willing to try this place again, as a single bite of the Cobb was enough to convince me to come back. The meager slice of bread brushed with oil and garlic is horrendous, however, suitable only for use as some sort of undercover ninja weapon.. . Second Time There:. Had some yogurt and granola before I went, so I decided to get a cup of the chilled yogurt cucumber soup special and a small salad. The soup was great, spiced perfectly and incredibly refreshing. The small goat cheese salad was decent, but nothing amazing.. . Third Time There:. Opted for the big chipotle barbeque chicken salad -- the chicken was moist and tender (they leave the skin on) but it was almost impossible to taste the chipotle, if there was any, and the dressing was a little too lime-y.
