This is one place which has to yet get its due!We heard several positive reviews for this place and decided to try it out last weekend. We went on a Friday night and the place was surprisingly empty. For the appetiser we had the Shitake Mushroom Wonton - excellent! The husband had the Hainanese Style Kaipong and I had the Kung Pao Tofu. the Kung Pao was good, tasty but what stole the show was the Hainese Style Kaipng. I am still dreaming about it. portions are huge and unless you eat a lot you certainly cant finish it all! For dessert we Â shared the tropical chocolate cake, again yummy.Our bill came to $60 with taxes but minus tip and drinks. I would highly highly recommend this place!!
