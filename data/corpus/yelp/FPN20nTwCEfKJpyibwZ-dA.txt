It all started out one cold night at about 11p back in a industrial complex out in Torrance. Rolled up saw the mega line of peoples and new we had found the place. Standing in the line is cool as long as you are dressed for the weather. Which on this night it was about 52 degrees. Not bad if you aren't in it for too long. Unfortunately my pardner &amp; myself ended up in the line for about 1.25 hours plus another 15 minutes or so to receive our food after we ordered. I was thinking DAM we are the second to the last ones in line.................its gonna suck! Â And I have froze my manhood off waitin here!. To my suprise..............I was totally wrong. I stuck with the short rib tacos (all they had left). Worth every minute I waited in line. Tortillas were fresh and grilled crisp. I'm not gonna even get into them. They were worth the wait. A must try in my humble opinion!
