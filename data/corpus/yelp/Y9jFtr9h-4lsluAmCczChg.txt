thank you to selby j. for referring us to square one for brunch this morning and bless his soul for mentioning the pecan coffee cake. it truly was the most fantastic that i have had. i almost busted out my vicious beaver face when anyone else's fork came close to it... . . i would also like to thank the cooks at square one for being so considerate..... to have put PLENTY of salt in my food. they really did want me to know what salt tasted like. . . ........ hi! Â did i mention they sure love their salt here? and how generous for them to share SO MUCH of it with us... . . seriously i almost felt my food had been soaked, drenched, doused, marinated, swimming, showering, or bathing in salt. after my first bite, i was surprised that my omelette didn't arrive with a swim cap on. . . what type of school are these chef's graduating from? morton's school of culinary salt? ugh.. . maybe i should have tried the french toast that everyone was raving about. but i was trying to be good since i am unable to work off the grub i've been eating from my recent peg leggedness. . . dodgeball gods have mercy and heal me, already!. . *sigh*. . thanks for the great company of panda, masa, aaron, and mikey l. despite my disdain for the food, i had a great time - AS USUAL. :)). . and thanks again selby j. for the coffee cake recommendation. actually, maybe square one should thank you, since that was their only redeeming quality. i would come back only for that...
