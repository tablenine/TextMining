Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi

Alright, so I'll be honest. Before I lived in the SGV, I thought Panda Express was legit Chinese food, Cup 'o noodles was as good as it gets for a college student, and dumplings/gyoza/potstickers were all the same. A lot can change in 2 and 1/2 years.. . Now that I know my bao from my buns and my gyoza from my dumplings, I had to check out this place for it's ramen. My only experience with ramen are the kind you get 10 for $1 and the kind at Ajisen, which, after trying, I couldn't see what the fuss was all about.. . I have seen the light. Having my first bite of the ramen at shinsengumi, it's like a light shone down from above, angels sang, and a light bulb went off in my head all at once: THIS is RAMEN.. . Once you find this place (it's in a strip mall-type shopping center) there's usually a wait, even on weekend at 2pm, but it's amazingly worth it. The menu isn't confusing and they offer enough to have variety but not too much to be overwhelming to a ramen newbie like myself. . . You get to choose the richness of the broth, amount of oil, and firmness of the noodles...as well as what you want to include or exclude from your bowl of deliciousness. I had the C set with  medium  for all three (next time I'll have light oil though) and fried rice, added spicy miso (an absolute MUST), and excluded the ginger. RAMEN-LAMA-DING-DONG, it was scrumptious. I splurged and got extra noodles, which was definitely worth the 95cents. The fried rice came first and was perfectly cooked and with delicious flavor. I will definitely be back....on a cold day, when i'm hungry, when I'm sick, when I'm nearby.. . It does suck that the hours are kinda limited on the weekdays and there's usually a wait, but trust me, it's worth it. . . I don't think I'll ever be able to eat Top ramen again.
