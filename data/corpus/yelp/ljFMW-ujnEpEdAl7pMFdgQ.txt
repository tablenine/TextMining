I finally tried this place a few weeks ago when hanging out w/ a friend who lives in the area.. . I was impressed - on a Thursday evening at 8:00 (without a reservation), we were seated promptly.  Definitely a plus.. I was glad that we were in the back room, as the front area seemed WAY too loud to hold even a casual conversation.. . The wine list was comprehensive, while the menu was a bit smaller than I was expecting.  That being said, there was definitely something on there for most people - meat, seafood or vegetarian.. . The service was friendly &amp; responsive and the atmosphere lively.  I'd love to go back w/ a group!
