I used to eat lunch here at least twice a week. The food is pretty decent, the atmosphere is ok, and the service is usually ok, even if its slow. Last Friday i explained to the girl at the counter that i have severe food allergies to wheat and asked if i could order a sandwich wrapped in lettuce instead of bread. She was unbelievably rude to me. I mean, i'm allergic to bread, i can't eat it, it's not like i was trying to be picky on purpose. The manager was standing right next to her and didn't say a thing, but he was on the phone so i'm not sure if he heard how she was speaking to me. Anyways, except for a few select employees, everyone who works there is nice and the food is decent. Personally, I don't enjoy being spoken to in a mean and sarcastic manner when i am just trying to get some food, so i'm not going back for awhile.
