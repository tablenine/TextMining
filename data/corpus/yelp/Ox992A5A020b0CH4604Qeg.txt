This typical bar in the Highlands is low key with midlevel twenty/thirty something people sitting in booths listening to juke box music and sharing a pitcher. The owner wasn't creative at decorating this bar and therefore, the crowd this place attracts is quite plain and normal. It is a good place to go with groups if you aren't willing to pay for cover at some of the other bars. It's perfect for bringing a group of friends to fill up a table on the large outside deck and just chill with a few pitchers and chat the night away. The only time I've had problems finding a table is in the winter when everyone has to squeeze into the two indoor rooms. Â I've also had a problem with the rude waiters on the porch with getting our drink orders and letting us save seats for friends who were coming in a bit. Apparently everyone who works there is desperate for tips, and is will not let you sit in their section unless your entire group is there and is going to drink. Because of this, I prefer the other bars down the street.
