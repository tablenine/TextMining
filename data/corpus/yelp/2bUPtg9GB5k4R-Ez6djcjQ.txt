The first time I ever came here it was 2 am after I finished up at the Dresden which is down the street and I walk into this packed diner with Dr. Dre blasting over the speakers.  How could that be any better?  . . Right? I know you agreeing with me and are thinking how could it possibly get better than that? well it does, not only do they make a great cherry coke and serve it to you in humongous cup they use CRUSHED iced. The soft snow flaky kind that melts in your mouth and makes life just that much better. . . I recommend the Tower of Power, no not the 10-member horn-based soul band but a huge club sandwich.  I stick to grilled cheese now and fries. They have a huge menu and a lot great/interesting choices.
