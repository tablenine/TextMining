Ok, I think that I'm getting into a rutt - like a 4-star rutt. I keep giving them out. But what can I say. Most of the places I go to are pretty good. Nothing to complain about.. . I came to Fred 62 during the week for a couple of beers after a couple of other ideas didn't come to anything. Ja and I sat outside first, but there's no beer served there. But we got the last two seats at the bar. It was crowded.. . The 4-stars is for beers that were cold. Can't go wrong there. I have eaten here before but that was before I was on Yelp... so I can't comment. But if I HAD to...I bet I'd give them another 4-stars ;-)
