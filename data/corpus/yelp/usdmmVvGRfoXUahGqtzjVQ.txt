Everyone should at least TRY Daikokuya once.  If you don't like it much - nothing lost.  More likely you will crave it at least once a week for the rest of your life.  There is usually a wait, but it only makes the ramen that much better when you finally faceplant in its buttery-beige-goodness.. . Good gyoza too, buried in green onions.  Geez, it's 11pm and having written this review I'm tempted to hop in my car and head to JTown...
