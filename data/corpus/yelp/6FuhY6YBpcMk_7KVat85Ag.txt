Restaurant: Ben Pao
Category: Chinese
I went to Ben Pao for lunch.  While I've certainly had better Chinese food, I didn't get food poisoning. Gotta look on the bright side, right?. . The food:  . . Crab Rangoon to start (Did someone in the midwest make this up? I never knew Crab Rangoon existed before moving here) It was meh.  High on the cream cheese. Low on the crab.  However it was fried. Yes, please!. . Seven Spices Beef: There was a little red dot next to this on the menu.  Naturally, we assumed this meant spicy.  We assumed wrong.  The red dot just meant the presence of peppers (without SPICE) in a gooey sweet sauce.  I felt jipped.. . Sesame Chicken: Can you really screw up sesame chicken? Yes, by serving it with hair.  To be fair, the server was very apologetic and replaced the dish quickly sans follicle. (When we got the bill, the dish was deducted from our total. Reason: No Like.  I guess it would be wrong to have HAIR as an option.). . BBQ Pork Fried Rice: Best of 3.  It wasn't too greasy or too eggy (if I wanted a fried egg, I'd go to brunch. You know who you are!). If I felt like giving an extra star, this would be why.. . Overall, it was just okay.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to go again.
