I've been here three times now, so it is past time to review.  Aside from being a short walk from my house the best thing about this place is the incredibly friendly and attentive staff.  They are always helpful with suggestions and the waiters know the menu in and out.  Being BYOB means that I can bring whatever fancy beer I want (no corkage fee!) and they make sure your glass is never empty.  The food is great - I was particularly impressed by the appetizers (truffle covered frites with mussels stand out for me) - but the friendly neighborhood atmosphere is what will keep me coming back again &amp; again.
