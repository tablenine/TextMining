Restaurant: Tap

I really enjoyed Tap!  Four of us out-of-towners came here to eat dinner, and we just ordered a bunch of their plates, tapas style. The guys really enjoyed the unique variety of beers they had, and the girls appreciated the waitress' wine recommendations.  The service was great, and we were totally surprised when she told us at the end of the night that she was fresh out of training.  Pretty much every plate we ordered was delicious (see pictures!), and the ambiance is not what I expected out of a pub.  Dim lighting, with sort of a chic, upscale-but-still-casual feel.   I thought the prices were very reasonable too, but maybe that's because I'm Californian -- bill for four people was $160, and that was for 10 drinks and 11 plates of food.  If I were from the area, I'd totally frequent this place for a chill night on the town with a group of friends! . . My favorite plates of the evening: the deep fried pickles, the goat cheese, and the buffalo calamari... but they were all good! I do sort of regret not trying any of the many beers they had on tap (heehee, get it?) though.
