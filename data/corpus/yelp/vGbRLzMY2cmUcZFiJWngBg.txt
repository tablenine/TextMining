Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Not really that into this place.  It's basically just like a cheap taco stand on the side of the road.  I've heard there are long lines, but when I went it wasn't too bad.. . I don't know, I just wasn't that impressed with their tacos.  I found them to be fairly bland.  Nothing really jumped out at me.  Maybe I should've tried something else, but there you go.. . Nothing special, but at least it's cheap.
