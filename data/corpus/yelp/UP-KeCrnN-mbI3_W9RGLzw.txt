2.5 stars.. . Ate here for lunch and got the yakitori chicken bowl.  It was all right, nothing spectacular.  I thought Furaibo had more of the izakaya style dining, but maybe that's just for dinner.  The lunch menu didn't have the kind of options I was expecting.  The katsu style food looked better than my yakitori.  Maybe it was my fault for going with grilled instead of fried.
