When I unwrap a 12-inch Italian sub from Bari I begin to shake and drool as if I am a junky and I have the last crack rock on earth.  This place has become an institution in Chicago and for good reason.  Whether it is the bread - from next door Damatos I think - or the choice cuts of meat, or the old-world feeling of the place, Bari is the real deal.  I take one star away because every time I phone my order in they get it wrong; forgetting giardinera, adding tomatoes, etc....  A small injustice for such a thing of  wonder.
