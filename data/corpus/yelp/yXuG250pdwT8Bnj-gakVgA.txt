Been here twice, and both times I've had to be wheel-barreled out!  Ok, so that's a fabrication, but it would have been nice if someone wheeled me out of there.  I think that's my problem with nice restaurants--over eating.. . But that's beside the point.  The last time I went was the night of the Golden Globes for my sister's birthday.  There were 6 of us enjoying such a delicious Italian meal.  And to make things even better, Nancy Silverton was at the mozzarella counter, possibly making bread!  ::Sigh:: How I love her rustic glutenous concoctions.. . As for the meal itself, we shared:. - Mozzarella tasting (Mm, I love cheese). - Burrata with bacon (I love cheese and bacon even more!). - Grilled octopus (Odd thing to love, but rather tasty and tender). - Crispy pig trotters (Surprised the boyfriend loved it!  Almost foie gras-like.. . The boyfriend and I opted to share the hanger steak and the gnocchi with duck ragu.  I could only wish I could make a ragu sauce that delicious!. . And for dessert, the table shared:. - Bombolini (fancy way of saying Italian-esque donuts.  Delicious sauce!!!  A little heavier than a beignet). - Chocolate cake with bourbon ice cream (they weren't kidding about the bourbon!). - and last but not least, the torta della nonna (best dessert there! they claim it's cheesecake--i don't care what's in it, it's that delicious). . Overall, delicious delicious DELICIOUS.  I will go again (and again) so long as my wallet permits.
