I could live quite happily on their cheese and wine flights, with some bread on the side.  Luckily, Bin Cafe also serves other food, all of it good.    Their soups tend to be especially tasty.  The bottled wines (near the front of the store) are priced very reasonably, so if you try a wine and like it, chances are you can take a bottle home without breaking the bank.
