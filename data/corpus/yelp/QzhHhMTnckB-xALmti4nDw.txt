when we arrive, we're on the booth mission. we stalk, we analyze, we pounce.. then, we order dirty martinis, and settle in.. friends join, marty and elaine groove, another round... lame people definitely come and go, but we tend to stay so involved in our own happy little existence that we hardly notice.. thank goodness we're within walking/stumbling-distance.
