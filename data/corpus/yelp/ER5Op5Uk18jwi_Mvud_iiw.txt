Service and food was outstanding.. . There is nothing I hate more than waiters who aren't opinionated.  If a server answers the question "What do you like here?" with "It's all good" then strike 1.. . Not only did our server point us to the best dishes, she practically ordered me to get the beef carpaccio.  Done.  It was great and so was my Lamb.
