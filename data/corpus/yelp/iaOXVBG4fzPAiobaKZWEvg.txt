This was my second time here.  It was as good as the first time.  I went with a couple of friends to celebrate a birthday.  We got up and early and drove out before they opened and managed to get seats for all of us.. . What we ordered were:. Funghi misti, fontina, taleggio &amp; thyme. Egg, guanciale, radicchio, escarole &amp; bagna cauda. Fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions. Pizza alla benno. Squash blossoms. butterscotch budino: sea salt, caramel sauce, rosmeary-pine nut cookies. . I ordered the mushroom pizza.  The mushroom aroma was just so present in the pizza.  Though there it was heavy on the oil, the pizza was just one of the best mushroom pizzas I've ever had.  (this is the 2nd time I ordered it).  The other thing that is a must try is the squash blossoms.  They are seasonal I heard but are very well worth trying there.  The others were enjoyable and my company really enjoyed it.  For desert, we had the butterscotch.  To enjoy this as much as possible....try eating it evenly so as to not take in too much sea salt.. . Prices are 15-30 per pizza.  Service was great!  Be warned though, this place is not that big and lines can get long.
