Got a takeout order from this place for lunch.  My review might be different had I sat at a table swilling beer with everyone else (everyone in there had a beer in front of them - at 1pm).  Purely based on food, I can't give more than 2 stars.  The buns were - strange.  Sort of chewy, like an oblong kaiser roll.  My kielbasa was dry and not very flavorful.  I should have drowned it in sauerkraut.  Co-worker said her veggie italian dog was dry, and she wasn't a fan of the roll.  Sauerkraut, however, was tasty.  The Belgian fries were definitely oversalted (we're talking big salt flakes, too).  It takes alot for me to say that, as I love salt, but the sauces were overpowered by the salt.  I liked the spare, industrial design of the place and the oktoberfest-style seating.   Prices were on the high side (we paid $30 for 3 "dogs" and 3 fries), but that seems to be a theme with alot of restaurants that have opened adjacent to the many of the new, pricey lofts downtown.
