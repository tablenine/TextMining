I'm just not that crazy about the food here.  I like to think I have a pretty refined palette so I like different things ... which is what you will find at Tap.  But I felt like the menu was trying a little too hard.  I mean it's cool to serve the burger on an english muffin with a side of fries and a little shot glass of chocolate shake.  But it just didn't look that appetizing, it tasted only ok, and they couldn't bring ranch or BBQ sauce because they don't have those things in the kitchen.  I get it, it's refined, but it is a bar afterall ... you'd think they would have some homemade ranch for my fries.. . I love the atmosphere and especially the bathroom that looks out over the street.  Very cool that they didn't board up the windows.. . Wine list is paltry ... but it's a beer joint afterall.  Just don't go expecting lots of options on the vino.
