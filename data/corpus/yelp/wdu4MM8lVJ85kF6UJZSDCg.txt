Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
The food is delicious, but be prepared to wait . . . and wait. The first two times I came here there was no wait at all, but this last time it was packed and there only seemed to be one waiter. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and then another 45 minutes for our food after ordering. And we were not alone--as we looked around the restaurant we could see several tables waiting just as long as we were. And for several of the tables, I saw the waiter bring out one half the table's food, so then people were sitting there awkwardly waiting to eat their food until the rest of the party had been served. . . I guess we can chalk this up to the recent feature on the Food Network? I think Gloria's needs to hire some additional wait or kitchen staff.. . With all that said, the food is consistently excellent, especially the pupusas, so I will still give four stars!
