i dont know what else i can say about this place other than just thumbs up A+++!!. . lots of people on saturday night, of course. this place was recommended to me by several coworkers and i finally tried it w/ my bf. the wait was out the door. for just 2 people we had to wait 30 mins, and it was only 6pm!. . we sat at the bar, and for some reason they told us there were no menus for sitting at the bar. and then we were confused bc the next couple sat right next to us got to order from the menu..? but regardless, the chef we had was awesome. he realized that it was our first time there at the restaurant, so he suggest to make us whatever he feels. and he did a great job! everything was so fresh and so good!! simple as that! the restaurant was packed, and the chefs also had to make other people's food, but he was still very focused on us sitting at the bar. . . we must've had about 15-20 orders of sashimi altogether in a span of 1:30 hrs. and when the bill came, it totaled up to about $150. as i was about to sign, the chef called over the server to fix the bill. apparently he noticed that there was a mistake, and the bill was too high. which we wouldn't have noticed because we didnt count the orders we had. . . we were very pleased with the food and service. definitely will go back again for the best sashimi in town!
