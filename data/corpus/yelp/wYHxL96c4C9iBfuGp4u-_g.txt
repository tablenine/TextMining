Great lunch spot for those who work downtown in the Mag. Mile area.  Great southern food with the spicy flavor that gives you a good afternoon kick.. . Entouffe of the day is usually very good.  . . Another dish I've had are the coconut shrimp with some sort of mango sauce served in a split open coconut is very good.. . All sorts of spicy sauces line the walls and fill the centers of the table.. . Fun music and friendly staff.
