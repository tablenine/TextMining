Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I was Introduced to Lawry's Prime Rib about a year ago, and since then it has become an addiction.    . . They have five cuts to choose from, including an option of having two lobster tails served with your cut or prime rib.  . . 1) Classic-Cut:  Their smallest serving of rib.  . 2) English-Cut:  Three thinner cuts of rib.  . 3) Lawry's-Cut: Their traditional not to mention their most popular cut of rib.. 4) Jim Brady-Cut:  Their 16oz cut of Prime-rib.. 5) Beef Bowl-Cut:  Their 20oz cut of Prime-rib.. . 6) Two Lobster Tails &amp; Cut of your choice. . . As a side, they'll always offer mashed potatoes.  You are also given an option of adding to it:  Creamed spinach and creamed corn.    . . Just as every other restaurant does it, they'll serve you a pre course, a main course and then an optional dessert.  . . At Lawry's, they'll always start you off with their signature Spinning Bowl Salad as a pre courser.  They'll spin the bowl on ice while pouring in their signature dressing.  . . The main course will then be whatever you select from this six choices above.   . . To top it off is a delicious dessert.  If you order the Hot Fudge Sundae your server will prepare it for you at your table. . . They do serve more than just Prime-rib; but honestly, there's no point in going there if you're not going to get their Prime-rib. . . In the end, you will be a happy customer.  The only thing walking out of the restaurant unhappy will be your wallet and your colon.
