the first time i came here there wasn't really anywhere to sit so we had to wait a bit.  it was after dinner so we just had a couple beers.  i don't like beer but i have to admit they have some tasty selections here.. . the second time we came to try the "burgers".  i don't know if you can call that a burger though.  it was good, but....arugula?  on a french roll?  maybe a fancy pants meat patty sandwich.  i would say it was a nice foodie experience, but whatever dark sauce that was, mixed with the overly sauteed-to-mush onions, was too strong.  it overpower the rest of it and i couldn't taste the "burger" too well.  i've come to realize more and more that a good burger is usually meat and cheese done properly.  this one tries a bit too hard.  *skip the shoestring fries you can add to your burger order.  they're too thin, hard, crunchy and not potatoey at all.. . ok, the growing burger snob in me aside, it was a satisfying meal.. . i'm totally a fan of the sweet potato fries and the dipping sauce!!. . to summarize:. burger = pretty good. sweet potato fries = awesome!. drink selection = cool but not exactly cheap. atmosphere = usually crowded. . btw the nicest guy on the staff is the bouncer at the door.  he is one cool cat.  after reading some of these other reviews about the rest of the customer service, what does that tell you hmm??
