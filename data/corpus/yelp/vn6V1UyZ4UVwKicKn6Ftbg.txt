Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
I really only suggest to eat here if you are REALLY hungry.... . . The portion at Versailles is very large and its too much for a lot of people i know. . . All in all Versailles is excellent, the food is fantastic (Garlic Chicken OMG!) and I can't complain about the service. But seriously though, only come if you are starving and can handle a large meal. . . Gotta love cuban food!
