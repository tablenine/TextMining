Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Lala's is the new Bossa. But i really wish they would merge into a giant mega restaurant!. This place is dangerously good and has a really good cheese appetizer that comes in a sizzling hot skillet with little tomatoes on top. it tastes like pizza without the crust...sooooo good!. the chicken is always juicy and flavorful and i can never stop scooping spoonfuls of mash potatoes even when i'm full. . I went for happy hr with the gals once and filled up on some mighty good sangria and at the waiters suggestion got the spinach empenada. it was the best of all the dishes we tried and i ended up ordering more. good ambience in teh outdoor patio, sometimes sitting inside on a weekend you feel squished too closely to the otehr tables..  only 4 stars because it seems like everytime i order steak they cook it too rare or too well.
