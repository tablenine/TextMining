pretty good. not as excellent as i thought it'd be cuz of all the great reviews. maybe cuz i'm not used to this kind of ramen yet. There isn't variety when it comes to ramen but i guess that's how they do it. the broth is a bit milky which was interesting. it kinda reminded my friend and me of a korean beef stock noodle soup (sullungtang).  I think i would've enjoyed the ramen more if the noodles were a little on the softer side. however, the portions are huge and we each got the combo. friend got donkatsu on rice and i got the chicken/egg on rice. we were so stuffed! we didn't finish half of our food. i liked the cabbage salad that came in the beginning of our meal. It's good food for cheap, and I love how they have Kirin on tap!  . . yummiest element were the silky smooth pork slices in the broth. i think it was pork..but it was so soft i'm not entirely sure. if so, i'm impressed. . . part of the experience involves sitting at the bar and watching the boys behind the counter work. i think they thought we were checking them out cuz my friend and i kept watching their every move cuz we were so intriqued by this whole ramen house concept. (nonexistent in chicago). everytime one of the guys turned around he caught our smiles and stares. prolly thought we were smiling at him but we were really just oogling the steamy broth being poured over the noodles. sorry dude.
