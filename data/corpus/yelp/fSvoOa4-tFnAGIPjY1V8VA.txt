I've been here twice, and maybe I'm just crabby, but both times my princess has ordered something I've enjoyed much more than what I ordered. Both times we also waited ten minutes or more to be greeted by a server after being seated. Both times I waited another ten minutes for my first refill on coffee. Both times the food was outstanding. See? I do more than whine and complain.. The first time we were there, we ran into some friends and wound up sitting with them. They're regulars there and her recommendation of the chilaquiles was spot on. Of course, I ordered something different- having a taste for french toast I went with that and found it dry and uninspiring, though the fresh fruit on top was at its peak. This time around, my princess ordered the breakfast burrito and I had the lemon poppyseed ricotta pancakes, topped with blueberry syrup. Again, I found them good but kind of dry. There was no butter served with them and the syrup was rationed sparingly, and since our waiter would be AWOL until I was nearly done eating, I made do. My apparent low biorhythms and crabbiness aside, they were good. The burrito was amazing, and came with some good home fries. . Waits for service and coffee are annoying, but the food is really good. I'm certain the third time will be the charm for the service and I can give the place the thus-far elusive fourth star that it surely deserves.
