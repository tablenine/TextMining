so what if there's over a 1,000 reviews. i know i'm late, but i live all the way in the OC. so here it goes..... . came here on thursday beating the lunch rush. found parking outside. the sausages are whatever. i still like mine old school style...you know, the one you get for a $1.00 coming out of the clubs at 2am. its wrapped in bacon and drizzled with mayo. what more can you ask for? belguim fries are BOMB especially drizzled with the white truffle oil. good selection of beer but the meal is not worth it.
