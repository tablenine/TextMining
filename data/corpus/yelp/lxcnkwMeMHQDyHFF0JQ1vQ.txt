To be honest with you I checked out Geisha House because I saw it on the Hills. lol I'm a huge fan of Japanese food and the Japanese culture. So I had to check this place out.. . As imagined, I knew this place can be very popular on the weekends with crazy people trying to bump into a celebrity while dining out.. No luck for me I guess but that wasn't the main reason I went. I went to try the food.. . Okay the entrees, the menu was very limited but luckily I ordered something I fell in love with. The salmon teriyaki with other sushi. Geezus, just for edemame it was like $5!! when you could just go to a little asian market or something and get a bag for $1.50! They are totally jipping( i think that's how you spell it. lol) us off. lol The service sucked but it was understandable because it was so busy.. . I liked how you could just sip on a few drinks, lay back on their chairs/couch and mingle. Huge place! Too bad they only sit two sitters in a corner! I wish I went upstairs or sit at those cool boxy area for groups there was so much more to see. . . Kudos! 4 stars to you.
