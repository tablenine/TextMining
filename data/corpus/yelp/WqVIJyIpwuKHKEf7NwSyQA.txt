Yikes, I hope Chicago has better deep dish than this, because in the SF Bay Area alone there are three places (Zachary's, Little Star, Paxti's) that absolutely kill this place.. . The 'butter crust' was disappointingly not at all pastry-like, as I was expecting, and the cheese to topping ratio was way too high. Â The saving grace of this place is the killer side walk patio, which is perfect for drinking beer on a warm summer evening.
