Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
the recession has caught up with lawrys.  On the salads they only offer romanian tomatoes upon request.  The stickers on the togo boxes are absent - unless you ask for them.  The nice thick paper towels in the restrooms are gone.  - Settle for normal ones.  The absence of enough waitresses is apparent- even on a Monday night.  Its amazing.  I believe they still try but the large cuts seem smaller now.  Not sure whats up - but it seems bad.
