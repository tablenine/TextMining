Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Not bad but barely a three. I'll bet most of these five star raters have never been to Ensenada. Went there with expectations and wasn't impressed. The shrimp tacos were pretty good but the fish didn't deliver. The condiments were good but that mystery cabbage concoction is a loser. Serving only fish and shrimp tacos is really a great idea. Too bad whomever runs this place obviously eats elsewhere. I won't return to this venue because I'm on a mission to find the best fish taco in Los Angeles.
