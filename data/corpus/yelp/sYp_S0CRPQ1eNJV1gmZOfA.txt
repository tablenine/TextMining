Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This is my favorite ramen place, very authentic Japanese in both taste, and atmosphere.  If you like Ajisen Ramen, then you really haven't had ramen, you need to go to Shin Sen Gumi!!  Just come early or avoid primetime, cuz this place gets PACKED!!
