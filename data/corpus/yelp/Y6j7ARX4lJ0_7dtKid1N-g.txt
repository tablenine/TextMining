YA BABY this pizza is way num yummy!.  For some reason it tastes even better when i'm totally F'ed up on Rum and Diets.  My favorite pizza is the Chicken Parm.  . . I would have to say my favorite part is pulling out cash to pay and my GF pulls out  5 stamped cards.  She said "You would be surprised how many times we actually come here hammered". Love it!
