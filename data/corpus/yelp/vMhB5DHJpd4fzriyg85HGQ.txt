-2 star from my original review because the wait gets longer each progressive time i go here. i only go here when friends are visiting from out of town otherwise i'd avoid the phatty wait.  oh yeah, we were chillin by the driveway at the end of the parking lot  for an 1 1/2 hour wait and they called our name. we walked up to the door where the host was like 5 seconds later, and they friggin gave our table away already like 2 secs before we come up to to host....EPIC FAIL....gotta give us time to walk over to the door, shietttt.
