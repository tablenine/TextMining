We had seen Ozzie Guillen rocking the hat on the post game interviews, so we decided to check it out. My gf, friend, and myself made reservations but we didn't need them as there were plenty of open seats for a Saturday night. I forgot what appetizer we ordered but I know it was good because there was none left on the plate. I ordered the brickhouse chicken. It was delicious. Great flavors and the chicken was juicy and not dried out. TVs were everywhere and any game that you wanted to watch was on. Excellent service and the crowd was good. You didn't have to yell at each other to hear each other talk. Prices were fair and we were very satisfied. I recommend this place.
