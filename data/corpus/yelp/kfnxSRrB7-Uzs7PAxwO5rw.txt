When there's a line out the door during most of the time a place is open, you know its gotta be good.  Such is the case with Daikokuya. You are almost guaranteed a wait, but the wait is oh so worth it.  Small, hole in the wall, with exceptional food is epitomized here.  . . Their specialty is the ramen and it does not disappoint.  The secret is in the broth stewed from yummy pork fat (kotteri) accompanied with a few slices of fatty cha su, plenty of green onions, and a perfectly cooked egg that still has that tender yolk center.  . . Don't expect a million different variations of this delectable dish, there's only two and one of which is merely a deconstructed form of the original.  So for those who don't enjoy the flavor of pork fat, don't even bother (you'll just clog up the line even more for no good reason).
