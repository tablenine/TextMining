Whimsical, kitschy... definitely worth going for the margies... house, on the rocks. The large open space allows for a fun time with a large group or a nice (not intimate) dinner without overwhelming noise. Chips might be a tad salty but barely noticed with the fresh, smokey chipotle(?) salsa. Also enjoyed the fresh salsa provided as a side... fresh tomatoes and nice twist... corn. . Agree with others as to the entrees... 2 1/2 Stars. Rice was bland and dry. Ordered the burrito with tilapia, since it's Lent. TOO MUCH rice in the burrito! There was plenty of fish.... but tilapia should not have a strong, fishy flavor when you bite into it, if it's fresh. Put Â in some lettuce or beans or something other than the rice which also comes as a side.. I may say the service was excellent, very attentive without being intrusive. It was fun to sit upstairs and people watch and we did have a great view of the skyline. On-street spots go quickly on a Friday evenings and the lot becomes valet only for dinner.
