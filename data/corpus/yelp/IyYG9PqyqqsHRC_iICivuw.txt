I actually liked this place until about a week ago when I realized that it was not really worth it. The service has been one of the worst, and its unfortunate because the waiters are cool and you can tell that they try but there just aren't enough of them to go around especially during lunch. Its a constant waiting and trying to get someone's attention game. The food is pretty overpriced for what you get. The fish and chips are one of their most popular items on the menu, probably because people order this beloved dish imagining it would be something out of the ordinary at 18 beans. Unfortunately its not. The Pub burger, cod and Flatbreads are good, but again, not really worth what you pay for and the other items are somewhat bland.
