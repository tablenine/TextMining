YES! This is my favorite place to get a burger when I admit to myself that I am not as healthy as i pretend to be. The counter-only seating is weird, but fine, since i have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a seat. The servers have all worked here forever, and although the service is not always the friendliest, it gives the place an authentic old-school diner vibe. The hickory burger is maybe the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. and then I eat the pie, and realize that THAT is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. There is only one word that could possibly describe this place....scrumtrulescent. One downside is that I'm pretty sure this place is cash only, which sucks for a person like me who never carries cash. Also, vegetarians beware, my friend had the cheese sandwich, and that was basically a pound of cheese on two slices of bread.
