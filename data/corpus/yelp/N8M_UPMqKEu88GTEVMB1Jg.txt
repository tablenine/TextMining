I've only had brunch at Sola, but man was it good! The french toast was just the right consistency and it had lots of fresh fruit and my dining companion's huevos rancheros were delicious. They have a lot of great breakfast options as well as fun drinks. The pomegranate mimosa was the perfect accompaniment to the meal. Service was good and the atmosphere was simple, yet still trendy. I hope I get the chance to try dinner here!
