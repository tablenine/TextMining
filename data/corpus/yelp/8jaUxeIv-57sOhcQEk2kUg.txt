Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Wow I never had shabu shabu before until my friend Shane took me to this very tasty little eatery tucked in little Tokyo. I thought the dinner was so tasty. In this restaurant you get to prepare your dish the way you like it. It can either be real spicy the way I like it or real moderate, either way I think you will love it.. . The staff was very nice and very helpful to our needs. The atmosphere was very typical of a Japanese restaurant nothing to spectacular, but clean.
