Category: Vietnamese
I'm relatively new to Vietnamese food and this place was a great intro.  The staff was helpful but not hovering--a great thing when you are rolling your own little spring rolls and aren't always successful!  . . Plenty of English on the menu where you need it--I'm brave enough to try some of the other places on Buford Highway now!. . Delicious and highly recommended!
