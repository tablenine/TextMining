Going there is an experience every time. The shrimp is the best and most consistent. The crawfish is kind of a gamble, but I think it's usually small and doesn't have much meat.Everything is very tasty and spicy though. Prepare to get your hands dirty, but a lot of napkins are provided. Only downside is, I always need to spend at least 15minutes in the toilet the next morning. Probably because of all the chilli. But the pain is definitely worth it.
