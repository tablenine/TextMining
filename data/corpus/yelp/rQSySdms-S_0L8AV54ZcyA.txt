BEST VIEW EVER!!!!!!. . You are paying to eat at this location, so don't expect with your food. The decoration and view are what you are here for. The Garden is very pretty. . . I actually don't remember anything about the food which means it's not super yummy, but i do remember the bill at the end. You should expect $60 to 80 per person with drinks. . . The service is great!!! its a "one-visit" place. =)
