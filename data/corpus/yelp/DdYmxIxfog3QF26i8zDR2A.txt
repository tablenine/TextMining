Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Went there after a big closing about this time last year. Made reservation for two, got a great circular booth... was very romantic. . . The service was a 10. Our waiter was informative, attentive, and polite. We ended up doing the Steak for 2, rib-eye &amp; fillet. The fillet was excellent, the rib-eye not so much - too fatty - not that you could see it, because this restaurant is the absolute darkest dining experience I've ever had - you can taste it though. Next time, I think I'll just order the fillet. . . The sides were excellent; especially the corn. The creme brulee I had for dessert was also good, but I haven't found a creme brulee I don't like yet. . . Overall, a good experience. My husband likes to call this restaurant over rated, but I disagree. Not my favorite restaurant in Atlanta, but I highly recommend you checking it out.
