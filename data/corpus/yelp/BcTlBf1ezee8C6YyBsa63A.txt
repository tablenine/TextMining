So happy to have it here!  Your standard rescue from the chain supermarket with a bit more swank and sex-appeal than your local health-food coop.. . This particular location does not prepare hot food as well as some other ones. You are likely to get overcooked salmon and generally not pleasing execution of the standard WF items.. . The store is definitely a pick up joint of sorts, where busy professionals browse after a long day at the office for some fresh produce and meat.  . . Try to avoid it on the weekends and evenings, unless you are ther&amp;#1091; for more than groceries: it's impossible to find a spot in the poorly designed parking lot.
