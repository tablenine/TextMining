Restaurant: Nava
Category: Tex-Mex
NOTE- Whenever I eat at an establishment I look at the following factors: quality of service, quality of food, price of meal, portion sizes, and the restaurant ambiance.. . Another of the fine Buckhead restaurants is Nava. With the weather getting warmer, Nava is a great place to go by yourself or with friends. Hang out or relax at the fountain-side patio and don't think about the worries of work.. . You'll definitely want to check out the interior of Nava. The design is open and inviting Southwestern. The faux pueblo look with wood columns and ceiling add a rustic feel.. . The menu is what you would expect with all the Latin fair. However, there are some unique flavorful twists within the menu if you're adventurous and open to new dishes such as:. . Starters. The Barbecued Rabbit Tostada. The Masa Crusted Oyster Chalupas. . Main Courses. The Mustard Mojo Rubbed Duck Breast. Or the Suncorn Crusted Georges Bank Merluzza. . But, do not worry if these sound too exciting for your tastes. Nava offers other chicken, steak, and salmon dishes as well.. . Whatever your dinner choice, be sure to leave room for dessert. I love bananas, so my fave is the Roasted Banana Enchilada. Chocolate lovers will want the dark chocolate B&amp;B Cube. If you like something light with citrus, try the Rasberry Creme Brulee or Sorbet sampler.. . Nava -- another one of Atlanta's eating treats. Check it out.
