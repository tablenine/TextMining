Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Ahhh Tito's Taco's a staple of my life as far back as I can remember.  My dad took us there as kids any chance he got.  Living in the Valley, if we were heading south on the 405 we would always take a detour off the Washington exit before hitting our final destination.. . My father being a New Yorker could not understand his colleagues adulation of the fast food Mexican fare at Tito's.  This was the early 70's and my father was a hot dog kind of guy.  His co-workers insisted they eat at Tito's and my father resisted, until one day a buddy ordered him an all beef burrito with cheese.  From that day he was hooked....and he passed on that same obsession to my and my siblings.. . I love Tito's for several reasons.  First of all, there is ALWAYS a crowd at both counters inside and out...and the crowd is made up of all kinds of Angeleno's.  . . Another reason I love Tito's is most importantly the food.  The tacos and burritos are awesome...especially the all beef burritos, think chili Colorado in a flour tortilla with melted oozing yellow cheese.  The sauce the beef is simmered in is incredible!  The tacos are damn good too!. . Finally, the prices.  Tito's is a pure dive with great food and extremely reasonable prices.  There is a reason there is always a line!
