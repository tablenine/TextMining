Restaurant: The Nook On Piedmont Park
Category: American (Traditional)
What a great spot to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon, especially when the weather is that quixotic blend of warm but not hot with dappled sunlight covering the beautiful patio which is perfect for people-watching.. . A group of us spent a few hours here just soaking in the atmosphere and talking last Sunday and I can't wait to go back, though the parking situation was rough as The Nook's (valet) lot was completely full. Aside from that, the rest of the experience was great and the drinks were well made and priced fairly. . . We had just had brunch elsewhere, so I didn't try the food but James' Coca Cola glazed BBQ wings looked great! . . Service was terrific- he even kept all of our tabs separate and accurate without even being asked to do it individually-nice touch!
