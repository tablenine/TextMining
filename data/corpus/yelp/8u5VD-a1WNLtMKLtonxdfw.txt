I still haven't gotten used to the whole gigantic bar thing that happens down here in Atlanta. Back in DC, my favorite spots were in tiny rowhouses or awkward basements, not warehouses with soaring ceilings and sprawling bars. Six Feet Under is impressively large but yet still maintains a somewhat cozy feel.. . There were a lot of families dining here late on a Friday night, which I suppose is an indication of good food, but I always feel awkward being drunk around toddlers. Call me crazy, but it just doesn't seem right. Still, I was able to put it all behind me, somehow.. . The real kicker here was the price on some of the beers: $7.75 for Chimay?! Um. Wow. I don't think I've ever seen it priced so low during non-happy hour. And yeah, it was on tap and served in its own glass. Perfect. I'll take two. . . Service was friendly, laidback, and attentive (I'm noticing a theme of this in Grant Park-- love it!). I sampled a bit of Kristine's bread pudding which was very good, and Berlin's fish sandwich was the size of my thigh, so it seems like you certainly get your money's worth here!
