Great atmosphere, great drinks, and good grub.  But it's LOUD.  Something about the acoustics of the rooms make it sound like everyone's screaming.  And so everyone does.  My ears are still ringing from the chick cackling behind me like a heckler at the Apollo.  But even the loudness of the place didn't deter us from having a great meal there.  Our server seemed a bit ditzy though - came over to our table with an "oh, did you need something???" look on her face, even though we'd been sitting there with closed menus for 15 mins.  But she was a doll and ever so sweet, bless her little forgetful heart, so we couldn't be mad.  Or maybe it was the great drinks that made us extra forgiving.  Actually I think it was the oh-so-cute bartender that made it all better.. . After all the hype and anticipation of it opening, I have to say that it was worth it.   I'll be back.. . Note:. Ask for a table in the front room when you make your reservations - at least if you want to see and be seen.  If you want to have actual conversation or are with a group, better to do the back rooms.. . And the men's and women's bathrooms share the sink area.  Oh so perfect to act coy and meet your fellow diners.
