Yeah, I like Joys. I've been here a couple of times and have definitely not been disappointed. The food is great and comes out ridiculously fast. . The spring rolls are a great, light starter. The last time I was here I had the Ginger Chicken, without the Chicken. Just a big pile of vegetables. That was pretty good. And the mango bubble tea!! OMG, that was just a little slice of heaven for me. That was my dessert. It's more of a mango cream slushy with tapioca pearls. Mine was delicious but my friend said her tapioca pearls were not all the way cooked.. . It's BYOB with no corkage fee. In the summer, it's nice to sit outside. Seems to get a little busy on Saturday nights, but the wait is not long at all. We've come here with a large group and had no problems getting a table fairly quickly.
