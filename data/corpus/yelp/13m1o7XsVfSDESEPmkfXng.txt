Ohmygawd, the best breakfast EVER. Yeah, huge waits on weekends. Which is why I never go before 2:00 pm, cuts wait time down to 5-10 mins. By 3:00, you'll be seated right away. Note that the restaurant shuts down at 4:00, though.... . You don't go for the service -- though it's usually adequate -- you go for the pancakes. It's impossible to visualize how large they are without seeing them for yourself. One order consists of 3 massive pancakes. Regulars will usually ask for just 1 or 2 (I recommend 2... even if you don't finish them, that extra thickness is deliciousness itself). Hard to beat the Black Magic pancakes, loaded with the black part of Oreo cookies, but they have several other choices, too.. . Their egg dishes (Charlie's Scramble, Yumm!) are also top notch.. . And the coffee is not to be missed. I've yet to have better coffee in Los Angeles. Simple French press style, really good beans. (Also some of the best orange juice in the city, and there's not much good OJ out here. Sorry, I used to live in Florida, and the OJ selection in LA is pretty weak for the most part.). . We don't go often -- just too busy at times -- but we try for a visit every 4-5 weeks and always leave very, very happy.
