I had the burger here a few weeks ago and I've been craving another one ever since.  I am trying my best to exercise restraint because of the calorie count of that culinary delight + the sweet potato fries, but I must indulge soon.  What the heck, I'm training for a marathon, so I deserve a treat. . . Though we know that this location has far more seating than the original, we still heeded all the warnings to show up early to get a seat.  On a Sunday when we didn't eat lunch, we decided it would be the perfect day for an early dinner.  After a little bit of browsing at the furniture shops nearby, we decided to head in at around 5:30.  Already really busy and packed!  We were able to score a table inside, but then the bf had to patiently wait at the bar to place our order.  That took a little while, but the order was in, beer was in hand and all was good.  Then our burgers and our shopping cart of sweet potato fries showed up!  Utter bliss.  . . On my next visit, it's going to be hard to not order the same thing, but I really do want to give the steak frites and the bone marrow appetizer a try.  On a side note, why is bone marrow showing up on so many menus these days?  I feel like it is the new foie gras.
