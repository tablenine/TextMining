I really like this place.  And so do my gmas.  So that's really saying something.  They're not only picky eaters, they're picky chinese eaters which means (usually) they only like chinese food.  except when it comes to Philippes.  Of course, they remember the prices of a million years ago.  Good news- coffee is still $0.09.  i don't think that can be beat anywhere.  And the iced tea or lemonade?  still under a dollar.  . . there isn't much to the decor.  tables and stools that are shared.  multiple dining rooms upstairs.  and now, the food.  the sandwiches are great.  the french dip was invented here so stick with it.  even if you don't like it, get it, DAMNIT!  i like the turkey and roast beef.  my friends swear by the pork which i've never tried because the turkey is so tasty.  too much variety makes me indecisive!  what else is good?  the chili.  and ZOMG the pumpkin pie.  . . !!!  get the pumpkin pie.  and while you're at it, get the baked apple too.  only available during apple season and guess what guys, it's APPLE SEASON!. . this place would have lost a star for the crazy long lines and slow moving ladies at the front if it weren't for gloria (who's fast!) who always saves the day or the floor manager who sees us and lets us cut by bringing us to the kitchen to take our order.  nice nice people.. . $0.10 sandwiches start this week to celebrate their 100th anniversary.  get there at 5 AM to avoid crazy 3 hour waits.  :)
