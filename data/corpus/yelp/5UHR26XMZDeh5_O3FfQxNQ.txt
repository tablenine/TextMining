We did Gino's East on a previous trip so it was time to try something different. . . Only got the 1 lb pot pie. It was definitely tasty, but I think I would rather have Gino's. Didn't get a chance to try that bread but it looked real good.Girlfriend thought this was definitely 5 stars which is fine, except I am the one with the yelp account so I am the one who counts.
