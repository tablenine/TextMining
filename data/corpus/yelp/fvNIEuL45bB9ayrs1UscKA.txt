A great alternative to a full, sit-down meal at Rathbun's next door with the same stellar quality and service. It's small and intimate, with a European vibe. It's a nice spot for a glass of wine and some cheese in a relaxed yet chic atmosphere. One of the small gems of Inman Park that's a draw for the locals and those looking for great food close to downtown.
