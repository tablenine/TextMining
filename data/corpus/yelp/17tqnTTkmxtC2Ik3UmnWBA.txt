Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
I'm not sure how people could complain about their frog legs because I think they are so delicious! I could eat those and their crabcakes all day long! Their bar is really fun to hang out at too- it gets suprisingly crowded for being in a restaurant.
