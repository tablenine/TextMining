Considering its landmark status and prominence in LA culture, I was expecting more.  As I walked in and grabbed a seat, I was struck by how much this place reminded me of oh-so-many bars I've haunted during my 29 years living in Wisconsin. That's certainly not a bad thing, oh no, that's just fine.. the "more" I was expecting lay elsewhere.. . To be brief I'd say, "come here for some drinks and bar games in a cool casual environment".  I'd also add "I wouldn't necessarily recommend the food".  GF had a "chicken burger", which turned out to be a dry chicken breast sandwich (either server error or discrepancy on menu, as it said "chicken patty").  The Jalapeno cheese cornbread biscuits tasted, smelled, and felt microwaved and stale.  I ordered the  Stratosphere sandwich with turkey, pastrami, bacon, and jack cheese.  First one came out with ham and american cheese.  Waitress put in another order to correct it.  Second one came out with ham and american cheese again.  The manager came out and seemed to imply that we had been mistaken and I was like "Ham is pink, turkey is white" (!!) I know the difference!. . An hour after my initial sandwich order, the correct combination of meats and cheeses finally arrived.. it was tasty, but by that time we were ready to get the F out of Dodge, so took it to go.  To their credit they comped the sandwich and the corn bread muffins, and the waitress and manager were appropriately apologetic.  One has to wonder however, with their preponderous menu, what margin of error they must have.. if putting turkey instead of ham on a sandwich becomes an exercise in futility, what mistakes and delays lie in store for the next customer??
