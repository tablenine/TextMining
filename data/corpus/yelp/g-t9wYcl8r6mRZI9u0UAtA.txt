The purpose of going to Rusan is simply to get drunk.  Avoid the food until your body needs to absorb the alcohol.  After that point, it really doesn't matter what the food taste like.  In Japan, you have similar places like this called "Izakaya" (though Rusan is far more of a poor man version of it).  Expect loud college kids on a budget and young professionals when you visit Rusan .  Again, focus on the drinks because the food is very secondary in taste.. . Cracks me up, The AJC gives the Ru-sans the best sushi in their 2007 Best Of.  You got to wonder when they list Harry's &amp; Sons in the top three.  That means Publix's sushi is damn great too.  Pa'lease!!!
