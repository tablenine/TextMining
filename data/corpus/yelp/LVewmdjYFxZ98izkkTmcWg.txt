Ok so it's in the middle of Water Tower Place, a tourist trap if there ever was one.  But if you have a difference of opinion on where to go for lunch because someone wants burgers, someone else wants pizza, someone else wants a salad, &amp; you want noodles ... you really can't go wrong.  It's a little overpriced considering it's fast food pretty much, but I guess if you go to a tourist trap, expect to pay tourist prices, right? . . PS:  The noodles in BBQ sauce?  TO DIE.
