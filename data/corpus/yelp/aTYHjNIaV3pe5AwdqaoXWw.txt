Don't be scared of hundreds of sausages in your face when you walk up to the cold case. There are too many varieties of tubed meat to talk about but i eventually ended up going for the dunk, bacon, and i think jalapeno with sauerkraut, grilled onions and mustard. It sure was full of flavor, but right then and there i realized that i guess i don't like my buns filled with so much flavor and actually prefer a plainer sausage. It would actually probably taste really good with some rice, but just not my taste.. . There was a good 15 minute or so wait to get to the counter to make our order, but a dude got us our drink orders so at least we could have a drink as we waited and waited and waited (amazing how long 15 minutes can feel like when you're hungry and just trying to order).. . The dining area is like a picnic inside, and finding seats you're just going to have to ask ... is anyone sitting here ... like 4 times before you get a spot. Thankfully there's another bar on the inside so you're not going to have to wait for another drink to save your mouth from some of the burning flavors of sausages in your mouth. Really cool place as long as you can find a place to sit. Definitely an easy place to force you to make friends, or at least nice to your neighbors.
