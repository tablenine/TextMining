I kind of love this place.  I've been here twice and while I didn't love everything, I'd go back tomorrow and be quite happy.   On a really nice night, the patio is beautiful.  We sat outside today for a long time and it was comfortable and lovely.. . BLT = fabulous.  The bread is great, the bacon, the lettuce/tomato...everything.  I'd say in general all of the bread is good.  We had the hummus, it was a bit weird but it tasted pretty fabulous on  chips.  I also had the garlic + butter bread, and it was pretty much just chunks of garlic on bread, which wasn't bad but some of the pieces were a tad overwhelming (and I LOVE garlic with passion).  The banana bread was good.  Lastly, and a bit sadly, both me and my dining companion were disappointed in the cookies.  I can't explain why exactly, but they were not tasty.
