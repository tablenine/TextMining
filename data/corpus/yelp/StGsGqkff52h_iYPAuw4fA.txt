Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
it's been awhile since i've been back to this place. they've done some interior renovation which made the place look so much better. it's nice and bright and less dingy. didn't take away from the food either. always love the sangria, no questions asked. had the oxtail stew the other day but i have to say that it wasn't as tasty as the way the other versailles in manhattan beach serves it. the stuffed yucca with beef/pork is also oh so delicious. and we almost never forget to order the avocado salad.. . but overall, versailles just kicks butt. if you ever crave the yummy meats and juicy dishes of the cuban cuisine you have to come here.
