Overview: bakery and cafe with a slight Cuban twist. Very inexpensive.. . I didn't think the sandwiches were all that. They were good, but they didn't knock my socks off. So the sandwiches get 4 stars.. . But the baked goods were definitely 5 stars. Especially for the prices. . . 5 stars:. guava and cheese strudel - very unique with guava filling. guava strudel - very unique with guava filling. meat pie - so flaky and delicate. And for under $1?!!. fruit tart custard pie - so much fruit. . 4 stars:. cheese roll - sugary pastry with cheese. good, but can't compare to guava. potato ball - potato was great, but the meat inside detracted because was too mushy.. . 3 stars:. chorizo empanada - flaky pastry pies are much better than crust-like empanada flour. chicken empanada Â - flaky pastry pies are much better than crust-like empanada flour
