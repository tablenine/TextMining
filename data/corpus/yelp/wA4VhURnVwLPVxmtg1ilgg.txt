my favorite food place in LA!  fly to LA from SF just for this.. . (cuban restaurant) with a wonderful. garlic chicken with lemon and onions and fried plantains. noisy, family friendly. though occasionally lines on weekends.... . get their special chicken, nothing else is good.. . about 20 minutes from the airport withOUT traffic. . with traffic,  could be bad, but ok if you take local roads.... . Their other locations are not as good b/c probably not as high turnover so not as fresh.
