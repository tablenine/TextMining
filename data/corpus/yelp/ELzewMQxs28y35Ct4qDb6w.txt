A stellar deal (dinner in LA for two at just a hair above $30?  Nice!).  . . This place has NOTHING by way of ambiance.  It feels like everyone is staring everyone else down... and I think they played (gasp) country music while we were waiting! . . The owner seemed really nice but his estimates on the wait were sooo off!  (Note: Once you go in, head around the counter to the right and put your name on the clipboard, along with whether you want a large/15 slice or regular/10 slice order.  And then... you wait!  Be careful though--if you wander around while you wait make sure to come back by 9:30 or whenever they close their doors for the night, or else you're S.O.L.!)  They told us it would be 30-45 minutes and it was well over an hour before we were seated.  . . With that said, the food was GREAT, cheap (I repeat, CHEAP) and I'd definitely go back... just not when I'm starving!  If you have difficulty making decisions then this a great place to go--literally the only choice you have to make is if you want a medium or a large!
