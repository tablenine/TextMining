The rib eye is the best cut here.  It was juicy and flavorful.  The top sirloin would be my second favorite.  The filet mignon my third favorite.  The rest of the meats are satisfactory.  The bottom sirlion was too dry, the pork ribs were dry, the lamb was dry.  I asked for medium rare slices, and they ended up being well done.  They charge $25 corkage!!  Our bill ended up being almost $100 a person including 1 bottle of wine and 1 corkage.  They charge 18% for us since we had 11 people.  This was the first brazillian bbq place I've been to.  I'm not sure how it compares to other places since it costs so much more.
