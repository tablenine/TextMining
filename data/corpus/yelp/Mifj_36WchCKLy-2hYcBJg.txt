Delicious. Expensive. Crowded, but surprisingly not intimidating (or maybe I was just super doped up on benzos those nights). Prepare to wait. Loud, so not a great place for a first date if you are hoping to speak with said date in-depth without others hearing. Waiters/waitresses look like superstars. . . FYI - there is a liquor store literally next door. No corkage fee at C&amp;M.
