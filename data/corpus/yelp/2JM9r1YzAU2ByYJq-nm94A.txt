OK, if you're watching your diet and counting calories this is NOT the place for you! We went here on a Saturday night and it was super packed. When you walk in, they don't take your name... they remember your face. So we waited and waited forever, I was with my fiance and his BF. We were at the bar drinking some wine until our table was ready.. . We had a hard time deciding on what to get so we all ordered items that we could share. We got the big salad with all that meat, the flat bread, and the pot pie pizza with sausage. We enjoyed all of the food, very unique! The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because of the LONG wait and the coziness of the restaurant (it wasn't very comfortable). But the food makes up for it all!
