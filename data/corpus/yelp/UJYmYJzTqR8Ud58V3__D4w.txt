Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Calling all Carnivores! Calling all Carnivores!. . If you love meat and BBQ, then you will love Fogo de Chao! (or as I like to call it, Fogo de CHYEA!). . I have always been a fan of Brazilian style BBQ.. By nature, I tend to eat my food way too quickly, so how could I not love a restaurant where servers are constantly walking around with swords of meat ready to serve you at neck-breaking speeds!?. . This place is in Beverly Hills though and it's probably going to make a large dent in your pocketbook.... but that's why I had my dad pay ;). . Also, like somebody else mentioned, You can definitely get delicious Brazilian BBQ for a cheaper price..  **cough** Agora in Irvine or Greenfield Churrascaria in Long Beach **cough**. . But overall, If you're ever in the LA area and craving a delicious variety of BBQ meats, then go to Fogo De Chao! . . Your Nutritionist may be upset, but your tastebuds wont be!
