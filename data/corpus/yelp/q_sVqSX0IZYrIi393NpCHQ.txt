All you brussel sprouts haters, eat your hearts out! The highlight of the evening was the brussel sprout salad off the Winter 2010 seasonal menu. Absolutely phenomenal! All the good things in life are unfortunately short-lived but it's well worth the trip so get it before it's gone.. . Other highlights included a preserved lemon risotto, sweet potato macaire (both from the seasonal menu), and the wood grilled lamb porterhouse from the market menu.. . We were late to our reservation on a Friday night but the restaurant was very accomodating and nice. We adored our waiter. All of his wine (and food) recommendations were spot on and didn't break the bank in the least bit. We enjoyed our wines so much that we headed out after dinner to hunt down some bottles in the area.. . Overall, this restaurant is getting added to my list of faves. The patio looked great and I'm really looking forward to better weather when we can dine out there.
