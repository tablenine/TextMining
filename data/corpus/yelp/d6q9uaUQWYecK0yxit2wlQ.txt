Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
The four stars I gave it are based solely on the food. It's great, it's tasty, and it fills you up without making you feel gross. They do just about everything well. . . The downside is that the restaurant is crowded, noisy, and not to atmospheric. Also, parking on nearby streets is almost impossible and the lot behind the shop has potholes that make you feel like you're off-roading. So, it's a great place to order from, but I have to admit, as much as I like the food, I don't like going there; but it's always worth it. Four stars, all the same.
