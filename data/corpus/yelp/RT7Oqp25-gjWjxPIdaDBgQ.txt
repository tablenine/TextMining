I am a die-hard pork lover so when my friend suggested Mana, I was very skeptical. We started with some tasty and creative saketinis (loved the one with pineapple ginger) and ordered the hummus with veggies, bi bim bab, sliders, and polenta with mushrooms. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and would definitely go back to try some other items off the menu.
