A stunning representation of what you can be achieved with a strip mall. . . Up for a movie? Go early have a drink, something to eat. . . After the movie walk, "yes I said walk" over to the Park Tavern for a change of view, and discuss what you hate about American Cinema, "I know you Goggled some key cinematic terms to drop in on your discussion." . . The bad.. . That slightly unsettling feeling of knowing you are in a strip mall.
