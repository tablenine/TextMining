Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Din Tai Fung has a legacy of it's own. Among Asians and a few non-Asians alike, it's famous for it's line of Xiao Long Bao (known to non Chinese speakers as juicy steamed pork dumplings)-like cuisine. Seeking the American branch of this legendary restaurant, I arrived here one weekend with four friends. Luckily, in response to long waits due to the popularity of the restaurant, there are essentially two Din Tai Fungs within a minute walk of each other. As a result, we were able to get seated without a wait, despite the fact that it was a Saturday night. . . The wait after we sat down was another story. Given, the restaurant was very crowded and busy, but the food we requested after our initial order as well as the take-out order we placed both took an unreasonably long time to arrive. Furthermore, we were asked if we would like the take-out order on a separate bill and even though we replied that we would, the take-out order was still included in the bill with the main meal. . . Besides these inconveniences, the food itself was superb. We had, of course, the trademark Xiao Long Bao, as well as the Shanghai Cao Nian Gao, or Shanghai Fried Rice Cake, and the Beef Noodle Soup. The Xiao Long Bao were just the right temperature and the soup wasn't too bland or too salty. The Shangai Cao Nian Gao had just the right consistency and really hit the spot. Lastly, the Beef Noodle Soup was amazing and the noodles had a really good texture. . . Overall, I would definitely recommend Din Tai Fung to anyone craving an authentic, satisfying Chinese cuisine experience.
