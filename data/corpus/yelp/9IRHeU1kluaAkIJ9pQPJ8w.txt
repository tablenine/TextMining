Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
It's worth repeating: the beer list is stellar and entirely worth the (usually 30-40 minute) wait. If you can, avoid waiting in the (usually) hot and uber-crowded upstairs bar. It's visually stunning with pub charm, but not worth adding to the menagerie of bodies pinned against each other. Hold out for a seat.
