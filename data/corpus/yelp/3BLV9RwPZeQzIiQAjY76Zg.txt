Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This place is one of the few ramen places that has flavor in the broth that isn't stricly shoyu. This place is the only other ramen place I like to eat at, aside from Santouka. You can chose the firmness of the noodles, the thickness of the broth and sides to add in your bowl. I get chashu and a flavored egg to add some substance.. . The fried rice is something different to try.
