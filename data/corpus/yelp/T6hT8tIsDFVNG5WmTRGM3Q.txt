We were here this past Thursday for some more exotic sausage. I had the duck pork and a rabbit veal w/ white wine sausage. I ordered both with caramelized onions and sauerkraut--AMAZING!!!!! We also split a groot order of fries with the chiptle aiole and bleu cheese walnut bacon sauce. . . *jizzes self*. . I washed all of that down with several glasses of Delerium Nocturnum (from the tap). Man, I love being twisted at 1 in the afternoon. . . Oh, and was funny was that one of their gigantic bottles of Duval bursted open due to the heat. Yeah, that big one out in the front. They proceeded to move the giant bottles of Blue Chimay to the bar area for a cool down. . . I can't wait to come back!
