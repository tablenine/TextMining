I a meat lover, so, four stars.  And I could smell my cloths for two days as a reminder!!  lol. . My gf and I arrived early to meet another couple, I think we got there about 5 so we got a good table and par-took in some beer.. . Plenty of hussle and bussle once most of the grills get going, I was surprized on the amount of smoke there was despite the outdoor nature of the tent shelter.  My friend aksed me the next day if we still smelled like bbq!  lol. . It was really comfortable, no pressure for us to leave early, they kept that yummy meat coming, and for $16 all-u-can-eat...  WOW!  Will definitly come back to this place!  :o]
