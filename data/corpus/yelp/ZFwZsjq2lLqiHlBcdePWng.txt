One of good malaysia restaurants in Atlanta!!! I love their food, its soo good....nothing here on their menu can be bad!!!! Â The roti canai is awesome and the flavors in every dish is amazing, Just the right spice and if you want it spicy, be prepared to have ur togue on fire.....you will literally have fire flaring out of ur ears....hehe. I love Penang...its good yummy food and a very decent price.... :)
