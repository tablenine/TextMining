Very good all around - service, food, atmosphere, decibels...  Friendly and prompt server, knowledgeable about the menu.  Burgers cooked perfectly (love the large knife protuding out).  Fries done right (no extra salt needed).  . . High-heel shoe for the receipt is a cute gimmick - which made The Darling cock an eyebrow.  :)  . . Sold on the first visit!  Need to go back to try a house-brewed beer, but especially the mac and cheese (sorry for staring at your food, folks at next table!).
