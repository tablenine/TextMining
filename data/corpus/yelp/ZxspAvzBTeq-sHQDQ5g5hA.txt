I've been here twice for happy hour and I've had two different experiences. The first time, the roof deck was packed, so we had to retreat to the lower levels for a table. Food was your typical chain restaurant (though cheap!) and the beer was really good. The second time, we managed to find a table on the roof deck and it was just a nice and chill crowd.. . The roof top seems to be the draw of the location, so if you go here, be sure to look aggressively for a table.
