Toro! Oh, how I wanted to love you. I really did. Maybe I put too much pressure on you. Maybe my expectations were just too high. Or maybe I am too much of a lush and the one bottle of wine per 2 people limit sucked the wind out of my sails. Whatever the reason, this will not be my go-to for sushi.. . Don't get me wrong. The service is great. Everyone is uber friendly. And the wait was not as long as I was prepared for. Granted, it was a Tuesday night after 8 pm, but I was honestly quite impressed. The let down (aside from my second bottle of vino that had to stay stowed away in my purse) was the sushi itself. As a veg I obviously am limited to a certain section of the menu, but can usually make it happen with what is offered. This was not the case. The veggies didn't taste too fresh, their Futo left something to be desired, and there was no tempura roll. Likewise, my boyfriend was under impressed by the ohmigod so i couldn't even chalk it up to my lack of food intake options. . . All that said, I still want to say this place is worth trying. It is Vince Vaughn's favorite (so I hear). And so many seem to go crazy over it. So my recommendation is go on a weeknight. Call ahead to gauge how long the wait is. Prepare yourself for the one-bottle-per-two-people rule. And try to stay grounded after reading most of these reviews. Maybe then you will leave happier than I did when I was not served God on a plate like I was expecting....
