Restaurant: Osteria del Figo
Category: Italian
I've gone to Figo off an on over the years, back when it was one location/tiny little shop out in 'the cut' -- a takeout counter on Collier Rd. Thankfully they now take credit cards and this larger location off of Howell Mill delivers pasta @ a sit-down restaurant with very reasonable prices. I'm a creature of habit and typically get the butternut squash ravioli. The tiramisu's not bad too and they have specials every week
