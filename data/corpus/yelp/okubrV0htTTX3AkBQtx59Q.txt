Restaurant: Highland Tap
Category: Steakhouses
I've not been to the restaurant yet so I'll just review the bar... . You know you've found a great spot when you've made 4 new "best friends" by the end of the night, sure you might never see them again but it's all part of the fun. Â If you manage to grab a seat at the bar consider yourself lucky, you have a commodity. The Highland Tap looks like a kickback of a bygone era, possibly 50's gangster or 60's biker, the only thing modern about it were the patrons. Drinks are served cold and fast and expect to leave with the age old odor of tobacco hanging on your threads. The list of amenity's, Jukebox, Cigarette machine, Pay phone.
