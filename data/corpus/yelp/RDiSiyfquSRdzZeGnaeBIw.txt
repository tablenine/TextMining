This place is fantastic!!  . . Best potato balls and meat pie.  The sandwiches are EXCELLENT.  I've tried a few and they did not disappoint me.  Fresh and just the right amount of everything.  . . My bf had the Guava juice and it was incredible.  Very refreshing and a great substitue for coffee/fraps which I drink everyday.  I used to drive miles to come here to grab their pastry.  Now that I am much closer I will visit more often. . . The only downfall is that people might get confused if it is your first visit.  They have a few lines.  One only for bakery, one for pastry, the other side of the room is for pick up for drinks.  I think the cake section is there too.  You'll figure it out!  . . Parking sucks but that's true in the city of Glendale.  Drop off your friend/significant other and drive around.  There is a parking lot in the back but you just have to try your luck.  I've never been to the branch in Burbank but I'm sure their standard is up to par!. . The best part is that everything is affordable so everyone is welcome.  Great for a quick lunch or Sunday breakfast with your friends and lovers.
