I really enjoyed this place. The space was a little small and a bit tight but the food was great. The prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly.. . Chicken Pio a whole chicken marinated in a special and unique Peruvian sauce was great. The Avocado Salad was great as well. I'm going to have to go back to try the other dishes!
