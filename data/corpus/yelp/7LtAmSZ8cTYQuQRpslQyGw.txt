If you are a big fan of tasty, exotic grilled sausages in a urban revival atmosphere, this is the place to go. First off, I love what they did with this place. They remade this dilapidated building into a find location for exotic cuisine. Try eating up all of the exotic sausages, including the buffalo, rattlesnake, and alligator. Spoiler alert: rattlesnake and alligator do taste like chicken. . . Good: Great food in a great gastropub setting. . . Bad: The parking here is bad, especially on a busy night. Expect to find a spot far away, hopefully not in the dark.. Seating can also be pretty bad, especially when rows of tables are reserved for private groups. . . Final: Great place to go and have dinner to have unique sausages.
