Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I have to give a special thanks to the wonderful company I had the pleasure of dining with this night (Melissa G., her friend Shaun, Ron, Linden and Amy K). This was my first dining experience at Umami and it was truly an exceptional and memorable one.  . . Food consumed:. Fries ~ I'm a shoestring fries kinda girl but your aioli paste is wonderful.  ~ Replaceable.. . Truffle Burger - with truffle cheese and truffle glaze.  Perfect in everyway, the truffle oil wasn't too overpowering, yet the taste lingered in my mouth for just a little bit longer..I'm in love.. . Port &amp; Stilton Burger - with blue cheese and port-caramelized onions.  Came so close to being my favorite burger of the night.  The strong and rich flavor of blue cheese and port made this absolutely delicious and intense.  I'm in love.  . . Hatch Burger - with 4 types of green chiles.  Hot..Spicy..and Juicy...what more can you want from a coveted piece of meat.  I'm in love.. . Manly Burger - with bacon lardons and aged cheese.  This was succulent and memorable...Calling all carnivores...MANLY! (period)!!!  I'm in love.. . Lobster Burger - My #1 favorite burger of the night.  A great burger to end your night with...two words...DIVINE BUTTERNESS.... . Whoever says they don't like Ho's and Ding Dongs in their mouth is lying!! The Cake Monkeys were a delight ~ Ho Ho's, Raspberry Red Velvet Ding Dongs, and Peanut Butter Ding Dongs...~~~Dreamy.. . I still think of UMAMI...and their creative twist in their burgers...I can't wait to come back...I now understand that frenzy that is Umami.  I love you.. . **quick note**. . The place is quite small...you might have to wait a bit if you do decide to visit.  BYOB!!!
