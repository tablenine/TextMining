Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
We heard of Eleven City from the 190 North show and thought we'd stop in and see what its about. The diner is aesthetically wonderful with the high ceilings and huge chalkboards, and the beautiful bar adorned with cakes in their antique cake stands. I definitely liked the vibe of this place....but maybe I really wasn't in the mood for diner food. Â The cheeseburger was good though. Next time I might try one of the deli sandwiches.
