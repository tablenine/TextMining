Restaurant: Sepia
Category: American (New)
The plan was originally to check out the wait at Avec.. but after realizing that we were too hungry to wait an hour to be seated, Sepia looked like a good alternative to check out. . . We were seated immediately (on a Friday night) at one of the mixed tables (I was OK with this, seeing as that we were planning to go to Avec anyway) and the food was served promptly. . . The ambiance and decor suits the name of the restaurant - Sepia (Photoshop buffs rejoice) - and the color scheme fit. . . Enjoyed the monkfish entree, the cabernet-merlot blend of wine, and the warm brownie with chai ice cream for dessert.
