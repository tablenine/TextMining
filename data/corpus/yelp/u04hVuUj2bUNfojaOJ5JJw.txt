Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
We had a similar experience to others here.  The food was great, it was impossible to get in, the service was good, and the price was reasonable for the food quality.. . The fennel sausage pizza was delicious, but the highlight of the meal may have been the white beans bruschette, it was an incredible appetizer.  The burricotta pizza was very good as well, I really enjoyed the bread used to make the pizzas.. . It's impossible to get in here so we decided to come at 10:00 on a Monday night, and it was still fairly busy.  It's very small inside, but the high ceiling really makes the restaurant feel comfortable, even with so much packed inside.
