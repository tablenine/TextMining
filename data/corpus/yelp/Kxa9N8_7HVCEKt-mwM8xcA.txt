Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Bad burger, bad bad burger.  Very simply when the ONLY thing you serve is hamburgers they better be good.  And when the ONLY thing you serve is burgers the service better be efficient.  . . Their signature burger is gross.  Very SWEET, sugary sweet.  It is also very soft- there is no texture to this thing at all.. . The service:  After 45 minutes from the time of ordering NO BURGERS TO BE SEEN.  I think that is a crazy wait for a lightly filled restaurant on a Wednesday night.  I asked for them to be packed "to go" after 35 minutes, and it took another 15 minutes still to see the food.  At that point the food should have been comp'd, but instead they gave me a free homemade dingdong.  . . Seriously, you F'd up my date, took $50 of my money, wasted an hour of my time, and remedy it with a kids snack!?  Maybe whenever you screw up you should offer tokens to the Vermont Arcade or complimentary tickets to  Twilight New Moon.. . To the owners of this establishment:  TRY HARDER.  YOU WILL NOT MAKE-IT ACTING UP LIKE THIS.  Ask your customers regularly what they think about things.  Have an anonymous comment box by the exit and truly encourage patrons to fill it out after every meal.  Fix your kitchen &amp; service.  NO RESTAURANT COULD BE EASIER TO RUN THAN A BURGER JOINT.  Clean up your act and expect much better success in your business.. . And Im not the only one to have this story, Deion K., describes the EXACT same story, and the managers remedy... free ding-dongs!!
