Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Heard about Roscoe's for years and finally got to try it.  Not a huge fan of fried chicken, but their's is fantastic.  Also not a huge fan of waffles or syrup, but they have a unique recipe and the waffles and syrup are SO tasty!  Don't tell your cardiologist, but this is a fun, family friendly place with great food!  Service is okay, not great.  The staff is nice and friendly, but they could use one or tow more waiters.  Wait time is not bad.  Went on Saturday night at 7 and there was a crowd waiting, but we waited less than 10 minutes.  Well worth it!  If you are in LA, you have to go at least once!
