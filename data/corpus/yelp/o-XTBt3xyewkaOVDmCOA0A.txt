Let me start by saying this: the food alone would definitely get a 4 stars easy from me. I absolutely love that they have an entire vegetarian menu, and all of the dishes I have had from it were great.. . Now, the establishment itself doesn't fair so well (not the decor per se, because it is really cute inside). I recently went there with some friends for a great meal, and our server was just rude. Seriously, if I ask for something, don't continue questioning my decision. My friend ordered something, and after him battling her over her choice (they went back and forth no less than four times about her choice), he still brought something she specifically didn't want. The way it works is like this: I order, you put in said order, and then bring it to me when it's ready. It isn't a challenge, it's what servers do; I know, I was a server for years in college. I think that's why the exchange was so uncomfortable for me, because I would have never done that myself.. . Also, I found it weird that my other friend had to pay for more rice (seriously, that big of a deal over $1?) when she got a to-go box for the rest of her massive portion of food. It really isn't that big of a deal, but he made a big to do about it, so it's definitely worth mentioning, as we all thought it was a bit nit-picky. . . Overall, the food is excellent, but the service was lacking. Maybe my next experience will be different, but regardless, I will definitely be back, as they have some delectable vegetarian dishes that I crave regularly!! Hopefully, we'll get a different server next time!
