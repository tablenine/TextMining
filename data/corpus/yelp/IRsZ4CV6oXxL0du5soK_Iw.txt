Okay, if you love Thai food and Elvis..go here because the food is good and the entertainment is great..but i do have to admit the service takes long and they all talk on those damn headphone set to each other. I mean the wait is worth it but i have better Thai food up the street for less money. but like i said Elvis and Thai food..this is the place
