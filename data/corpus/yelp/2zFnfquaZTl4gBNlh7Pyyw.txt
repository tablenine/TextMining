It was a gorgeous, warm Wednesday afternoon when we decided to stop by Blu Jam Cafe. Even though it was 1in the afternoon, neither of us had had breakfast yet so this was the perfect place. My friend ended up having a Mexican Omelette which he devoured. I had the red beets and greens salad which was great. I love beets and I love goat cheese, so I was in my happy place. I was hoping for a bit more of the balsalmic dressing but I didn't ask for it. I typically don't care for meat or chicken in my salads but that day I was in the mood for some protein so I asked for it on the side. I would say that the chicken was a bit dry on the ends so I am glad I stuck to my decision to have it on the side. Overall a very pleasant way to spend a Wednesday afternoon.
