How come I didn't review this place yet?!. . I love the place, the ramen are great and you DEFINITELY HAVE to try out the Spicy Challenge they have! Not the best or THAT exciting compare to a lot of great ones out there. It was more like a hype, once experience it then you are good to go. Yes, this is a ramen version of Pink's Hot Dog. BTW, if you are at Pink's and the line is not that long, get their Chili Cheese fries instead! Â Their BBQ pork is VERY good though - my recommendation, get it on a side instead as they have it as its own side dish. Skip the ramen! . . We got Jonas T. to do it with also cheer by fellow Yelper Torie Y. in our group! It was an overall roller-coaster ride filled with cheering, "you can do it's" and excitement! . . The service was okay and it was fun cheering on other people from another table from doing it.. . At the end, our famous Jonas T. got the job done. But, from what I heard, words from his extra mouth, "I feel like I am pregnant!" The poor dude was having a hard time from walking afterward.
