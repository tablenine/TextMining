I went here for breakfast after reading some amazing reviews. Not gonna lie, but I was pretty disappointed. It's in a cute neighborhood but there is another breakfast place next door that looks better. The food was good, but it's not that hard to make decent breakfast food. I admit I'm cheap, but Â I still think it was overpriced. Everyone raves about the "retro decor" - it wasn't overwhelming, though. Service was just okay. It was a Sunday morning at a breakfast place, and I was a server for years, so I understand that. The only thing I really liked was that they served good coffee (Intelligentsia) and then didn't charge me for it. All in all, I wouldn't waste your time - make breakfast at home, you'll save a lot of money :)
