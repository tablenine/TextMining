(Please note I want to give Gato Bizco 4.5 stars...but I can't.). . Nom, nom, nom, nom...oh wait, the review.  Right.  . . Eating here is such a pleasure.  Jim loves the sweet potato pancakes.  I am happy to say that when he can't eat them all, I eat the leftovers.  They are that good.  I am partial to the huevos rancheros with red and green salsa.  Even though try as I might, I can never finish the whole thing (probably has something to do with eating the leftover pancakes).. . Yes, on the weekend you have to wait.  But as long as it isn't 32 degrees outside, you can people watch and drink your coffee.  And laugh at all the suckas trying to get into TFB.  :P. . Gato Bizco takes Cash, VISA, and MasterCard.
