Finally I get to eat here...I had a rule - no unnecessary waiting for a table at popular eateries. I only break it for Mozza and similar, not fancy, smancy diners.. . But come 10.30pm on a summer weeknight...it was safe to approach this spot. But I see why it's popular - those picnic baskets are very user-friendly. But the red velvet cake is a bit over-rated! What's up with icing on American cakes?! It's like everything comes with cheese too...!? What are the yanks hiding ;-). . Anyway, I ordered chicken meatloaf sandwich with mash potatoes I think. That was fabulous (even if it did come with melted cheese ;) ) . Price was very bearable $35 for two of us gluttons.
