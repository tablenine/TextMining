Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Nostalgia, plain and simple. That's the best way to describe Apple Pan.. . Quality is there. Quite good actually, in terms of ingredients and cooking. . . Prices are a little high, for what you're getting, but not ridiculous.. . So, it really comes down to taste and preference thereof. . Wife had the steakburger, and I had the hickory burger. I believe, on both counts, it may come down to whether you grew up on the flavors components. Reason I say is the steakburger has a mound of a sweet relish or relish-like sauce which I found, well, very sweet. The hickory burger is very smoky, and does in fact taste good. But just be prepared for it. Not a huge fan of the tillamook on the hickory burger; the flavors tended to fight each other. And WAY too much lettuce (which was self-resolved).. . We also had the fries and the banana cream pie to round out the afternoon. The fries were a bit puffy, and very undercooked; almost flavorless. A complete miss on those. The banana cream pie however was very well made, and you understand by the 2nd bite why it's recommended by people who frequent the Apple Pan.. . The ambiance is like I said, a time capsule of nostalgia. The staff is all about getting you in, and getting you out. So there is an almost impossible-to-ignore feeling of being rushed.. . I wouldn't tell anyone not to go here, but I don't find myself dreaming of the Apple Pan flavors either.. . While I understand that Apple Pan gas earned its share of accolades of its fans, at this time, there are far better burger joints in this great city of ours for me to discover, eat, &amp; repeat.
