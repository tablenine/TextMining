Restaurant: Ria&#39;s Bluebird
Category: Southern
Ria's BlueBird. Unlike many other breakfast spots which sport bright colors resembling the sunrise and such regular color schemes, Ria's Bluebird is a combination of dark natural woods with deep blues. There's a small counter and about half the regular seating area you're used to from other breakfast locations.. . While the menu has some of the regular breakfast comfort food staples, this isn't Flying Biscuit and it's not Thumbs Up Diner. This is Ria's Bluebird. Only open from 8am - 3pm daily with options such as Country Fried Tempeh, Ria's Bluebird is a hip diner cafe serving soy.. . With the expected tatted and mohawked servers, the service is friendly, more than competent, but not out to win your heart with a cheesy smile. Just what you want when a hangover reality hits you after a night of too much fun.. . What's the best? The potatoes. Ria's Bluebird has the absolute best potatoes in town. Seriously. Whether as a side with your omlette, or covered in the spicy tempeh sauce, these are not your usual fry-out-of-the-bag breakfast potatoes. With the skins still on, seasoned with real seasoning not just salt and pepper, and a consistency that sits right before being mushy, these are perfect. Filling, flavorful and delicious, no matter what, make sure you get some of these potatoes for breakfast.. . Note: There is a lot less seating than you're used to from a breakfast place that's not a waffle house. Especially for someplace with such good food, so get there early on weekends or else you're guaranteed a wait. Have a large party? Sorry, I'd recommend you go elsewhere. Just you and a few friends? Definitely try out Ria's Bluebird. The food is awesome and eating here obviously means you're cool.
