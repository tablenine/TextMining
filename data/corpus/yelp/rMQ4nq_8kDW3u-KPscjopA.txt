I don't like sports bars, but I really liked this restaurant. I had lunch here with a few colleagues and thought the food was delicious. . . Our server told us that they would be getting their liquor license this week, which was ok since we were not drinking. The decor is upscale sportsbar - very modern, with clean lines, neutral colors and exposed brick.. . I had the Market Club Salad - I asked for grilled shrimp, but got chicken. I was not feeling very picky, so I just went with it. It was deeelicious. The guy I work with had a burger and he said it was really good. Their fries are absolutely delicious. I never eat fries and couldn't resist. . . Service was ehhh...They've been open for a week. I get it. I hope it gets better down the road.. . We did tour their rooftop deck and it has a very similar vibe to Zed451's deck. Except it's smaller. I'm looking forward to cocktailing here this summer!
