I knew I was in for a treat when I smelled the wonderful aromas of the bakery from the parking lot.  Lines were crowded, but went fairly quick.  That's due to great service....with a smile.  After ringing us up, our friendly (and funny) cashier entertained us by drawing out a little map to the pick up counter in the next room.  I did not get lost.    . . Their huge croissants were amazing.  The meat pie was ok.  Their perfectly spiced chicken empanada was better (wish I had more).  And the almond danish was just right. . Tis the season to have the Noche Buena cuban style sandwich.  The fresh concoction of roasted pork, ham, and swiss in a toasted sweet roll hit the spot!. . Another reason for me to go back to Glendale!
