Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
All you can eat Korean BBQ, need I say more. The meat keeps coming along with all of the typical korean sides. Not my favorite but still a fun experience. This is probably as authentic as korean bbq can get for me in los angeles. Â Fun place to take friends/coworkers for a relaxing event.. Service is not as bad as others have made it out to be.
