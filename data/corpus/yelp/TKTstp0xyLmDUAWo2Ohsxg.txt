A healthy and delicious brunch?  Check.. Organic, sustainable and/or fair trade food and beverages?  Check.. Seating for large and small groups?  Check.. Fireplace?  Check.. White college students with dreadlocks?  Check.. . Also: live music, but then, most every bar, restaurant, hole in the wall, in Rogers Park features bands, whether they should or not.
