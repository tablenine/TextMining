Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
De Cero has a festive atmosphere, ample seating, a great selection of fine tequilas along with a kitschy drink menu.  The tacos are great and with fresh tortillas what more could you want in an upscale taqueria!  They're really perfecting this as a wonderful new nitch market restaurant concept.
