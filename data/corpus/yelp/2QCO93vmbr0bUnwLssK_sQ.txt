If you're coming to this location for the first time, look for the red sign that says "RFD" instead of the full name.  I had The Weekender, which was a well portioned brunch sampler consisting of a tofu scramble, french toast, tempeh bacon, and hash browns.  Everything  was interesting and delicious, save for the bacon, which suffered from the typical dryness of most vegan food.  I look forward to trying one of the specials next time.  The prices are a bit expensive, but in return, you'll be getting a novel meal and service with a smile.
