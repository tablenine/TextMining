Get the french toast. You will not be disappointed. But the skillets are pretty amazing too. in fact, even if you get a skillet you should still get a french toast - just share it with everybody else. This hipster restaurant is great for brunch and good for groups. Nice patio out back. Great coffee, good vibe, helpful waitstaff. It's behind the giant blue Scientology building, so you've probably never noticed it before.
