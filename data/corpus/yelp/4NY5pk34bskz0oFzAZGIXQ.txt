Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
This place reeks of SUCCESS. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.  The wait prohibits me from giving it a full 5 stars.  However, the wine bottles are only $20 and can be drank while you wait. . . Talk about unique.  The pizza pot pie is definitely an original spin on an American favorite.  Also, the building is historically significant to Chicago.. . Our typical order:. 1) Bottle of the Pinot Gris. 2) Small Salad (Great for 2. Served with a cold plate!). 3) Pizza Pot Pie (Wheat crust, mushrooms, and meat sauce). . Total is somewhere around $50 for the 2 people. Go here, its worth every penny.. . TIP: Everything and I mean EVERYTHING on the table can be purchased.  I consistently purchase the poppy seed salad dressing to go, YUM.. . Cash only.
