This place was just ok.  I walked in with pretty high expectations considering the "hip" reputation I heard about.  However, when the people who work there tell you how "hip" it is and why, you begin to wondering if it is just another NYC wanna-be trendy restaurant.  . . The restaurant is located behind several parking lots and buildings.  It is not easy to find.  If the cab driver hadn't known where it was, we probably wouldn't have found it.  . . The food was pretty good.  Our table got the salmon chips (which were amazing) and the flash fried oysters (didn't try them- oysters aren't my thing).  I had the braised pork as my meal and the mac and cheese it came with was amazing.  . . Unfortunately, any time I wanted to talk to someone at my table, even right next to me, I had to shout because it was so loud.  I don't just mean regular restaurant buzzing, I mean uncomfortably loud when you are trying to have dinner.. . After dinner, we waited about an hour for the cab (that the restaurant called for us) since the cab could not find the restaurant.  We ended up having to walk through all the parking lots and buildings to find a main street where we could hail one down ourselves.  . . All in all, it was just "ok."  I probably wouldn't go back again.
