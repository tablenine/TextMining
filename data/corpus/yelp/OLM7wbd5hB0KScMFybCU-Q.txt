Restaurant: Bin Wine Cafe
Category: American (New)
I love this place. I've been to bin 36 and bin wine cafe, and it's a world of difference. The menus are similar, and the wines are the same, but the cafe is so much cozier! The wine flights are a lot of fun, and the food is delicious. It's pretty pricy, but for the right occasion, it's worth the money. Also, make sure to try the tempura green beans as an appetizer. They are so addicting! I love this place.
