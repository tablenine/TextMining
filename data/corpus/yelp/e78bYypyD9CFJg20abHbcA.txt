All in all, I'm a fan.  If you grab your beer or wine from the deli next door, there's no corkage fee at the restaurant.  The servers are friendly, the decor is industrial chic and the atmosphere cool - not too out there - though a little loud, and the food is excellent.  You don't have to wear your best - I saw two guys wearing baseball hats, others wearing t-shirts and fedoras; some girls were dressed up, but most weren't.  I like places that welcome all walks of fashion so this fit the bill.  If my experience was at all tainted it was for personal reasons.  My friend is a reality show whore (her own words) so she kept mentioning an episode or six from the Hills that were shot at this place.  Had no relevance for me which is maybe a good thing, because I went in there with no expectations.  Also I was completely exhausted from a late night hopping around L.A. the night before so after about six bites of the absolutely amazing and rich food, I was ready to curl up in bed.  We ordered: . . -vegetarian paella with manchego cheese melted on top. -bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese and a port reduction sauce. -some kind of potatoe croquette. . I could've done without the last, but the first two were some of the best tapas dishes ever.  Really, ever.  . . Also, we found parking just a little ways down Beverly.  In fact, I had incredible luck with parking during all of my dining experiences in L.A. this week.  (Maybe it's because I was doing the NY thing and eating at 8:30, 9, 10 pm at night - do most people in L.A. chow earlier??)
