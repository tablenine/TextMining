The food was very good but thought it was kinda "icky" on the inside.  I think my wife would rate it higher than me, and I am NOT usually one to complain about decoration, but the seats were falling apart, the table had burns on it, the plates had burns on them, the salt shaker was covered with nast, etc.  Leaving that stuff aside, the food was really good.  Not very big portions, but very good quality.
