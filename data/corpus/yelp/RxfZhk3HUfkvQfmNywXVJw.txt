Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Truly deserves a 5+stars. My boss was in the dog house and he prides himself on his worldly knowledge. I said, "I know I'm Â 22yr olds, but I assure you...take your wife here and you'll be OUT of the dog house.". Chef Kevin picks his own meat...! The corn, don't miss it. The mac and cheese is great. The broccoli is HUGE and smothered in cheese. The bread is unique and varies. The filet mignon is alwasy perfect, the tuna is seared to perfection. The staff is assertive and quick to react, they work great as a team. In the summer sip cocktails outside while you wait. Grab a table by the bar or sit in the elegant dining area that features a giant branch which works as lighting. Valet is honest and won't rummage through your car. Classy crowd, ladies...dress it up.
