This place is amazing, great staff, great food and great atmosphere.  There is even a halfway home across the street where you can observe weirdo's, but holdon to your cigarettes because they will beg for them.  The skirt steak at this place is godlike.  It melts in your mouth with flavor.  You can also indulge further and treat yourself to a pitcher of Sangria which tastes amazing also.  Also entertaining is the amount of Hipster Melrose inhabitants you will see walk through this place, very entertaining.  Although, the main point of going here is obviously the food.  The steak or chicken with mashed potatoes is great.  Easy 5 stars.  Oh and parking could be done by valet (5 dollars) or you can go off the side streets and try to find a spot for yourself.
