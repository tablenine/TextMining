Restaurant: Strip House Steak House
Category: Steakhouses
I have been to a number of the Manhattan steak houses and the ribeye that I got at Strip House is the best steak that I can remember having at any of them.. . The steak was so tender that it felt like it was melting in my mouth, and the flavor was superb. I suggest that you order the steak rare. As others mentioned, the sides here are also phenomonal. Do not miss the black truffle creamed spinach (sooo good).. . Other reviewers were not as complimentary of the steak as I was, but I really do think it was very good.. . Oh and by the way, the chocolate cake is massive and delicious (it should be shared between at least 3 people).. . I would have considered giving 5 stars, but we waited for an extremely long time, even with reservations. It seems that the tables weren't turning over nearly fast enough. The staff realized that we were becoming upset, and gave us free drinks, so that helped.. . All in all, I definitely recommend this place. Make sure you get the truffle creamed spinach and don't be surprised if there is a wait (but it's worth it).
