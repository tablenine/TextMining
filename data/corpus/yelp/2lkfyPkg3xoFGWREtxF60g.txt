A big, beautifully designed cake for under $30.  Easy way to make any bday party look awesome!  Pastries are also reasonably priced as well.  And all are SUPER delicious!  Love the guava and cheese roll and of course, the potato balls!  It's the perfect combination of good, tasty food and good price!  The only downside is that everyone agrees with me!  It's always crowded with huge amusement park like lines!  But it goes by rather quickly so just be patient!  (Wow.  I really like exclamation marks...)
