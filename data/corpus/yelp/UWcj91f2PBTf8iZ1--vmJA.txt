Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Mastro's is my favorite steakhouse by far!!!  It tops Ruth's Chris, JJ's, and Arnie Mortons.  Masto's has the finest cuts of meats, with amazing side dishes, and an extensive wine and cocktail menu.  Their Mastro's mashed potatoes and creamed spinach are must haves!  I always order the same thing - the sides I mentioned with a medium filet and it is always amazing! For such a busy restaurant, their food is consistently perfect and their service is stellar.  They recognize special occasions and greet you wishing you a happy birthday and gracefully bring out dessert with a personalized message.  . . Masto's spoils me and I save my dinners for nights I need extra attention - a birthday, anniversary, or other celebration.  They even have rooms surrounded by fabulous wine you can rent out for your private dinning experience or celebration.  . . Now I'm starving and craving their mashed potatoes.  Who has a birthday we can celebrate?
