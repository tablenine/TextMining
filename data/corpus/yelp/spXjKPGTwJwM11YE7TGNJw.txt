Really? Water in the Patron.. . One lovely Thursday night, I went with a group of friends for Trivia and wings.  We got cheap pitchers and answered all the lovely Adult trivia. HOWEVER, I ordered 2 shots. One was this lousy orange shot the waitress recommended. Since I didnt feel the buzz (Im a "good" drinker) I ordered the shot of Patron...which was around $3 cheaper than usual places. Now I know why!. . WATER!. . Who puts water in Patron?  A VERY distinctive taste.. . I even sipped it. And was taken aback that I didnt squint my eyes. I had my partner sip it and he was also shocked by the taste of water.. . If you are a tequila connoisseur, you would be very livid about the scam performed on such a fantastic liquor.. . Im appalled. Jack's, if you want to be sleezy? Dont add Patron to your menu.
