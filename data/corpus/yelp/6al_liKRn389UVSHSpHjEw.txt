Okie dokie artichokie. I gotta tell you. I love pastrami sandwiches, and I'm a big dude. I like to think I have great tastes in food and when I saw all the great reviews to langers I had to go.. . I have lived 5 minutes from langers for nearly my entire life and I didn't try it until I was 21 and a half years old. I now regret my last 21 years of my life until I tried the #19. (YES THE SAME #19 everyone else is telling you to get) . . Expensive, but worth it. Best sandwich in LA. 4 of Goro's Hands down. Don't miss is PLEASE.
