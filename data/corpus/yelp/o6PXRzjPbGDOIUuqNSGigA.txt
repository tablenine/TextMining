Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
Ah, home sweet home.  This is where I go when I need a Texas fix!  I was a regular at the Camp Bowie Blvd. location in Fort Worth, and not long after I moved up here, I discovered that Uncle Julio's had moved north, too!  And there is a location in Lombard, not far from my home.  I've tried all of the mexican restaurants up here, and while authentic is good, there's nothing like greasy Tex-Mex!!!  And I hate dark meat chicken in my mexican food-gross (I'm looking at you, Lalo's!)!!!  The cheese enchiladas are my absolute favorite!  And the swirl margaritas will kick your ass!  I'm also a big fan of the hand shaken margarita, I prefer Tres Generaciones tequila, but that's just me.  It's fun, it's loud, it's perfect!  Be prepared for a hellacious wait, but it's totally worth it!  FYI:  One Saturday afternoon at the Lombard location I was wearing my Dallas Cowboys tshirt and UT ballcap and got my meal comped by a homesick manager.  This should be the ex-pat Texan hangout!!!!  . . P.S.  This is the only restaurant I've seen up here with THIN chips!  Why does every place in Chicago have thick chips?????  Ugh!!!
