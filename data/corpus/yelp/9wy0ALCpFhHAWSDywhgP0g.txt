Category: American (New)
Food was three stars, maybe three and a half. We had both charcuterie plates of meat and cheese which were good, can't really go wrong with those. I had the grouper special on a bed of lentils. The grouper was perfectly cooked. Everything in my meal tasted good, but nothing out of the ordinary. My other companions had the duck confit and another fish dish. Both were good. The desserts were so so.. . The reason why I am giving this a two star review is the price. It's a little on the pricey side for average food. There are so many great restaurants on the Westside that charge similar amounts for much more exciting gastropub food.
