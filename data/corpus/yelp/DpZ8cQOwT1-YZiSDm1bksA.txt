Restaurant: Big Star
Category: Mexican
Went out with friends last week to Big Star and enjoyed my experience. Â I had yet to try "The Publican" or "Blackbird" which come from the same culinary minds as Big Star, but alone the tacos in the place exude flavors of combined street food with high end ingredients. You may have had pork belly and lamb on your tacos before, but none with the tenderness and enriched flavor as Big Star. On top of everything, as a bar to hang with your friends BIg Star gives a great experience packed with bartenders who can serve you solid mixed drinks with a latin edge.. . Must Try:. - Tacos Al Pastor. - Tacos De Panza . - Queso Fundido. . Must Know:. - Cash Only. - The place can get packed during Friday &amp; Saturday nights. You'll be waiting a hour at times.
