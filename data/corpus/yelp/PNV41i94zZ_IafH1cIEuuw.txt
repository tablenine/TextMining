This place really wasn't all it was hyped up to be. Maybe I tried the wrong items... I *might* go back and try a sandwich, but it's iffy... Perhaps if I was in the area and really convinced.... . I stopped by on my way home from work and picked up a chocolate almond croissant and a chocolate/vanilla cupcake.. . The croissant really was good, very nicely made, with a decent amount of chocolate inside.. . My biggest complaint was the cupcake. This cupcake looked so tasty! I was so excited to try some.. until I tasted it.. Isn't there enough salt in regular food?! Why is my cupcake SALTY?!?!?!. It was the worst cupcake of my life. And I didn't even know that was possible :(. . I was so disappointed.. The frosting was strangely salty, and the cake part was odd and dense as well. I could barely eat it. I can't believe my total for these two items came to 6.75.. Such a waste! . . Since people on Yelp seem to like it, I would think about going again to try something new, but I definitely need to make some more money before I can afford to blow it all on small pastries.
