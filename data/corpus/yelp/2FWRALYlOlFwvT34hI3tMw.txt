i prefer the salt #2 on days i feel like having a little spice.. i have salt #1 when i feel like eating spicy.. . the sauteed bamboo shoots are good.. and i like the cold tofu.. as well was the fried rice.. and the spicy scallop.. . the special 2 is too chalky to eat. i dont know how others finish that chalky broth.. . the miso broth isn't as spicy in my opinion.. also, the spice level is different on different occasions.. sometimes a #2 feels like a #4.!. . but the ramen noodles are good.
