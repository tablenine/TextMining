ok, again atmosphere is everything. this is a really awesome coffee shop. the food is good but not amazing. its worth going to lunch with some friends. yes, the parking blows and the wait can be just sad, but the service was good and the place was clean. . . and the fries are fresh greasy and yummy. . . go here if you can't get into "Home"
