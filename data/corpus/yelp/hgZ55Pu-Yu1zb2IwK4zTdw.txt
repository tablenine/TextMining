Love this place and have been going here for about 10 years.  It is consistent every time.  Good food, good service, interesting specials and great deserts, especially the bread pudding.  This is one of the only bread puddings I LOVE.  Especially if you like caramel.. . My favorite dish is the Tortellone con salsa di noce- gorgonzola filled tortellone tossed with grapes in a walnut pesto cream sauce.  The grapes make it.  . . It is hard to find parking but worth it!  There are no reservations and the wait can get very long.  Up to 1.5 hours BUT there are 2 nice bars across the street and the restaurant and these bars have a relationship.  You can go over and have a drink or two or three and the will call the bars when your table is ready.. . Also, the have outside seating in the warmer weather.. . Doesn't get any better than that!
