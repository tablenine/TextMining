Bone Garden Cantina, they say it's real authentic. It's different from most TexMex style places I've visited so perhaps that's true. The Day of the Dead decor is fantastic. I could imagine being a regular here if they weren't so tucked away in a business park. It's hard to get as festive as I want in that atmosphere, even on nice evenings on the porch. I've been here for dinner during the week and lunch on the weekends. I've never had trouble getting a table pretty quickly.. . I love that I can order ala carte here and don't have to choose three yummy foods AND rice and beans on top of that (they always end up leftovers at other places). The sopas are my favorite. The pork tacos a second favorite. Though I always feel like I don't get enough salsas... It does make me worry that I'm spending way more than I want, but in the end my bill is always less than I anticipate. . . I've only had one run in with the service here; a male waiter deliberately handed the check back to my male date with a snide comment after I'd clearly been the one who paid. Otherwise everyone's been awesome.
