This is a find.. . Comprehensive menu that serves breakfast all day, a solid and diverse sandwich section that doesn't skimp on the ingredients, a few dinner plates, some korean/japanese dishes, a south of the border section and some tasty desserts. . . As noted, it caters to the hipster/los feliz crowd. I am not into the scene but didn't really care. The decor and style gives nod to a 50's diner but with more of an updated feel. . . I had the BLT with avocado that hit the spot. Because of the size of the menu, I can imagine some dishes are hit or miss but this is a spot to come to when you know what to order. I also decided to try out the peanut butter milkshake and that sealed the deal. It was one of the better shakes I've had in LA.. . This is a definite go to if you are in the area. Lots of variety, open late, relaxed atmosphere and you can find something that will hit the spot.
