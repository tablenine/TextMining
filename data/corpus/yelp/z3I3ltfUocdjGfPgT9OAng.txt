I got a real cafeteria feel upon entry.  It was pretty loud, which worked out fine for our group of 15.  But I did think it was rather loud.  It's definitely not a first-date place.  Our meal was a bit customized, deviating from the menu and instead consisting of several courses of meals. Expensive, but so much fun and worth it.
