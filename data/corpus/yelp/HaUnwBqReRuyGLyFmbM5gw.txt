Really yummy drinks and a decent happy hour - if you can find a seat. The martini selection is great and pretty delicious. Never tried one that I haven't really liked - so, that's god.. . Service wise -- whoever is running this place has no idea what they are doing!! We came one night for happy hour into dinner. There were menus all over the place, waitresses coming up to take our menus because they were short, total chaos. Our waitress would take drink orders and then totally disappear, so we would have to go to the bar to get in some happy hour prices on the drinks before we missed out. Never once did our water get refilled. I actually got up out of my seat go to up to our waitress and RE ORDER a glass of Merlot (also mentioning that she never brought it the first time around), she shrugged and said, "oh okay" -- yeah, we never got that glass of Merlot either. Pretty awesome.. . I understand the whole "busy" factor and having to get around to all your tables, but I don't think there's any excuse for being rude when we're essentially paying for service, because the food isn't 5 star or anything.... . Nice place to hang out for drinks, for sure.. If you're lookin' for a great experience with awesome food and even decent service, there's plenty of the fish in the Los Angeles food scene sea.
