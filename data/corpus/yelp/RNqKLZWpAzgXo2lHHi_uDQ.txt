How do you write a review about your best friend?  I feel that's the task I'm trying to accomplish here.. . The Highlander (or The Winchester as we like to refer to it in an ode to Shawn of the Dead) is like the "bad boy" boyfriend I never had mixed in with my very best girlfriend.  I've been coming here for a decade at least, and the food has never not been just what I was looking for.  Back when I still ate meat, the french dip was my regular, now it's the amazing black bean soup and jalapeno corn fritters.  I get cravings for those.  Everything I've had on the menu (and that's a lot) has been amazing.. . When you've had a few drinks, I suggest you try the tater tots with cheese and ranch dressing.  Just don't then think it's a good idea at that point to try to play Britney Spears on the jukebox.  You'll get funny looks. . . The servers have always been nothing short of amazing - friends I look forward to seeing when I arrive and who remember my drink order even when I haven't dropped by for awhile.  The prices are great.  It can get smoky on the inside, but it's a bar, you should expect that.  It has wi-fi access, an jukebox with everything, plenty of seating, and they don't mind if you plan to stay awhile or just pop in for a quick drink before a movie; if you're all fancy for a night out, still in your suit from work, or in sweatpants.  It's comfortable, reliable, and judgement-free; like sinking into your couch at the end of the day.
