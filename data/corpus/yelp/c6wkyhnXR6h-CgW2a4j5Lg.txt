Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
this was quite bizarre. i'm driving through all these sketchy places from block to block in downtown la, i start to wonder if this is really the area, and i lock all my doors. and then all of a sudden i see this beautiful white marble building to my left, with two security guards in front, and in gold fonts at the very top of the entrance, it reads: "bottega louie".. . the inside was super nice too. i kept wondering, WHERE AM I????. there's the boulangerie/market on the very right when you enter, and the far left end is the eating area. the entire place is white, it's all airy, clean, spacious, and loooovely.. . there were so many kinds of macarons here. mocha, lime, hazelnut, orange/chocolate... what else? i forget, but those are the ones i took home, lol. they were really pretty AND yummy.
