The fries are very good. Ask for the garlic sauce to dip them in. Other than that, and the beer selection, this place is nothing special. The hamburger buns are the cheapest white bread type you can get. They have long lines and not enough tables to seat everyone. Lots of room on the deck but not enough tables.
