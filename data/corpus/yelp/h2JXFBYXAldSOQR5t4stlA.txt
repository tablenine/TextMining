"Summer Time/ And the Living is Easy..." Â Saturday nights sure aren't what they used to be in my life. Sometimes, that brings up sighs of melancholy for me, but other times, like tonight, I can't imagine a much more wonderful time then spending a lazy Saturday evening with my l.o.m.l. (love of my life) and l.l.o.m.l. (little love of my life). We used our first "Groupon" to get a bunch of food for more than 1/2 off-- but turns out Metro Fresh was running a two-for-one entree special that would have run us just about the same. The servers were outgoing, friendly, and helpful. We sampled both of tonight's entrees-- teriyaki salmon with a ginger citrus slaw and a lamb lasagna. Both entrees, as well as a soup and side, were ripe with fresh flavors. The lasagna was succulent and rich, the salmon almost shockingly moist and flavorful. The ambiance is plain, and it is in a strip mall, albeit one chock full of charming offerings, so four stars to Metro Fresh.
