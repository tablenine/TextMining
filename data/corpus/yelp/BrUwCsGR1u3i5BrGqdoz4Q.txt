yea, as almost everyone says, this place rocks!. their falafel is awsome! pita sandwich, free salad bar! and quite good fries!! . crispy falafel is nearly perfection.. and don't really know if the hummus was the best i've ever had, but it was good combination with eggplant. so don't forget to add them to your pita sandwich when you order!
