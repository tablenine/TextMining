Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
First off: I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I love the meat.. . The best thing about Veggie Grill is that you won't miss the meat.. . My favorite is the Chik'n Caesar wrap and kale salad.  I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato fries, but these are hands down the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. It comes with this sauce that adds a little "something extra".. . Make sure get a drink too. They don't serve soda here but you also won't miss it eaither because the strawberry lemonade and the regular lemonade are awesome. But my favorite would be the iced peach tea.  Ask for a cup to go because you'll want some more later.. . I've tried alot of the other dishes and everything is a reasonable facismile of the "real deal".. . The almost-wife loves the chocolate pudding and I liked the carrot cake. Esepcially since we got them FREE!. However, this place is like chinese food. You don't think you're full but then it hits you and you're full.. . Note that if you bring a friend or go on your birthday they might do something special for you! . . Tell you friends!
