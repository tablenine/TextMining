Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Why oh why do I live in the valley where all the alleged "legitimate" sushi bars are all but Japanese owned and operated? Why can't there be more establishments like Sushi-Gen around here? I suppose I'm going to have to move as a solution to that problem.... . Sushi-Gen IS the place to go to for sashimi in Los Angeles without having to pay out your ass. For $15 during the designated lunch period, you can stuff your face with a platter of clean and fresh cuts of yellowtail, albacore,  octopus, and salmon with an order of their "sashimi lunch" --- all while sheeplessly contributing to the global decimation of wild-caught fish populations. A zesty miso soup and a hefty individual serving of rice is served with the fish. I eat a good amount of sashimi (surprised I'm not dead from mercury poisoning) so I'm confident to say I know fresh seafood when I eat it.. . They don't have any of that Americanized-fusion "Las Vegas high-roller tempura cowboy roll" or "Caterpillar rainbow dandelion cut roll" crap.. . REAL, JAPANESE PREPARED FOOD. REALLY FRESH SUSHI. That's all there is to it.. . Highly recommended if you're down in that part of DTLA (Japantown). . Here's a little heads up though...it's not a "well kept secret" in L.A. Too many people know about this place and for good reason...which results in the restaurant being packed for every hour they are open (especially lunch), so you may have  to wait awhile to be seated.. . A very solid 4.5 stars.. . Parking in that lot with validation from the restaurant costs $1.50.
