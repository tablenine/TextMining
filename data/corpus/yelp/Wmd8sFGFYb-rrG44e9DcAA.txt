I make it to Lala's almost on a weekly basis for lunch, and occassionally dinner.  . . Street parking isn't bad from the morning to early afternoon.  However, it can be difficult in the evenings as most of the streets are reserved for resident parking only.  I think the valet is overpriced so I always avoid it.. . Lala's has a great patio with warm modern decor.  All walks of life can be found here:  businesspeople, hipsters, the refined, and the casual.  They welcome anybody, and even dogs in the first row of tables adjacent to the sidewalk.. . The service isn't overly-friendly but it is consistently adequate.  The staff is quick to serve fresh moist bread, yummy chimichurri sauce, and water the minute you sit down.  You never feel rushed, but it's a breeze to get in and out of here over a lunch hour if you need to.. . I don't find any of the appetizers that great.  However, for main entrees I really like the arroz del campo, pechuga dijon (chicken with delicious wine mustard sauce), and ventura salad.. . Oh yeah, and the price is right!!!  That's why this place is always busy and I'm consistently satisfied every time I leave here.
