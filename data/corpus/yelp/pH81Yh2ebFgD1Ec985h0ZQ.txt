Restaurant: Santullo&#39;s Eatery
Category: Pizza
Of all the things in life there are a few that make it worth living.  Two of these are pizza and beer and these just so happen to be the mainstays of Santullo's menu = why I love this place.. . I went here after a long and cold CCM in February.  The Art Show was going on upstairs in the Flatiron, but we had to get our grub on first.  . . I had never been here before, but the friend I was with told me they have the best pizza in Wicker Park.  He was right about this and what made it even better was that they had ice cold beer on tap.  (I know you are probably wondering why was I drinking cold beer when I was frozen - idk - I just like beer). . I got a slice of cheese and should have gotten the "Three Way", which is a slice with three different kinds of cheeses on it.  If my cheese lexicon and vocabulary were better I'd list them here, but will instead just note that this kind of slice was $4 while a regular slice was $3.25.  . . Their slices are New York style so you have to fold them to eat them.  Being so big though they really hold the crushed red pepper well since the cheese sticks to the dough better than a typical deep dish.  Fat, cheesie, slices - does it get any better?. . They have a 'happy-hour' on weekdays from 4~6pm where slices are only $2; I gotta go one day.. . They also had a vegan chili advertised so if you are vegan don't think it is all cheese and nothing else.  For the vegetarians out there though the cheese pizza is the whip!. . If you are like me and love pizza and beer - go here now!
