cool, without being too cool. veggie eggs benedict, i love you forever. waiters are sassy &amp; nice. sometimes cops hang out which freaks me out, but usually they sit by the wall that has weird drawings on it including one done by yours truly &amp; i like to think my psychic energy makes the cops indefinately more awesome. . regardless, this hip (or shin) diner is where it is at. they just need to give me more potatoes with my veggie benedict.
