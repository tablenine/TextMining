Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I love hot dogs. They're one of my top favorite foods; so I was really excited when my friend and I took a road trip to LA and I could finally try one of Pink's "Famous" Hot Dogs. We ended up going to the place late night after a couple of drinks at a lounge and I was surprised to find a line at 1:30 am. I chose a hot dog with onions, nacho cheese, and mushrooms.....YUCK! Maybe it was just my selection but the hot dog was not appetizing at all. I guess its back to Costco for the best and CHEAPEST hot dogs.
