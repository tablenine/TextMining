Pretty good food and crowd.  The bathroom are out of this world!  You feel as if you're in a club in Latin America (yes, weird comment, but it's true!).  I enjoy their brunch on the weekend but any other time is good too.  From the menu, I must go back to try the Kick Hash.  Their mojitos are great, Sangria I give it a 3/5 *s.  Nothing epectacular.  It can get really packed so just be a aware of a wait (at least they have a parking lot in back) or make a reservation on their website is what I recommend.
