!!!  I live right around the corner from this place, and was pleasantly surprised and confused when a trendy-looking little restaurant appeared in the uber-typical strip mall where I take my drycleaning.  I went there with a group of friends and we all ate our hearts out.  Two of the people I was with have lived in Japan for an extended period of time, and they agreed Urban Belly had the best noodles (etc.) they had eaten since their time abroad.  Best ramen I've ever eaten... probably the best dumplings I've ever had as well... I was impressed with everything I ate and will be back whenever I can.  yum yum yum
