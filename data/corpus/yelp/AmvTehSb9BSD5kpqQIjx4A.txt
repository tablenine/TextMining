nice place to celebrate a birthday! seriously! i was here for my 21st! the best.. take your friends... have an awesome time... especially when it comes to getting weT! been here twice in six months.. pretty awesome... . i cant tell you how good of a time you'll have... but it depends on you.. the waiters are super cool if you let them be.. throwing extra soju in your drinks and extra beer... . my only downside... i prefer to pay with cash.. i paid with my card a long time ago and i was accidentally charge an extra 120... of course, it was fixed... but it was a little irritating.. other than that.. if u have cash, have fun. haha
