There is only one other thing that I love as much as sushi and that is sashimi!!!  But most of the time I can't afford sashimi as its more expensive =( . . I was downtown visiting a friend and we needed to decide on a place for lunch.  What a perfect time to try out this sushi place in Little Tokyo.  A sushi place in Little Tokyo, no really?  But seriously the wait wasn't as long as I had read on previous posts on Yelp, but it may have been the fact that today was a Monday afternoon and people haven't built up the eating out yet.  After about 10/15 minutes we were seated and we noticed that everybody sitting at a table ordered the same thing and it was what was recommended to me by an acquaintance.  The Sashimi!!!. . The fish was fresh and tasted wonderful.  Different cuts of tuna, baked salmon, yellow tail, squid, octopus, baked tuna for only $15.  What a deal!  The lunch dish also came with cold tofu, miso soup, rice, hot green tea and 2 mini veggie/salad dishes.. . Service was on par with the food and overall I had such a great time and would recommend this place for lunch to everyone!  This place and Daikokuya will be my go to places for lunch in downton.
