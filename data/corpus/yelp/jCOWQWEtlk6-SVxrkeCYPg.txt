I have always wanted to go here, and finally got the chance this weekend. It lived up to my expectations. It is excellent food with a great atmosphere- not stuff, but just nice. Â The appetizers and meal were delicious. If you go, you MUST get the chocolate souffle. It might be the best dessert I have ever had.
