Great view, lovely setting, and that's about it.  Mediocre food at over the top prices, generally impersonal service.   I'd be thrilled if the management made a clean sweep and redid the whole menu to make the food worthy of its admittedly remarkable atmosphere.. . The worst worst thing of all is their idea of sushi, which consists of giant slices of loosely packed rice and seafood and .  . . . .lettuce.  Ugh!
