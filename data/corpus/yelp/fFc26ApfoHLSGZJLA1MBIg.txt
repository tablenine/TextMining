To channel the comic book guy, WORST.  SERVICE.  EVER.. . We live a hop, skip, and a jump away from Deleece and had heard great things about it.  When Groupon offered a deal, I jumped on it.  We arrived at 7:15, sat down, and our server was initially attentive.  We got the appetizers, he took our main course order, and THEN.... FORTY MINUTES WENT BY.  FORTY. MINUTES.  For some chicken.  After we were done eating, it took another TWENTY MINUTES for them to bring the check.  . . The food was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  Everything had too much vinegar - the salad, the sauce with our appetizer.  The Amish chicken was cooked perfectly, but the sides were difficult to eat.. . Every second we sat at the table (remember: this is an HOUR of time wasted) just made the experience more and more mediocre until I couldn't stand it any more.  It was unacceptable.  I will NEVER be back  I enjoy lingering over dinner, but on my terms - not at the whim of a slacker server,
