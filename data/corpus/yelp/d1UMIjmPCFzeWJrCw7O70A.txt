Restaurant: Hand in Hand
Category: Pubs
I didn't think it was possible for a restaurant in the Highlands to ruin brunch, but the Hand in Hand mightily accomplished that feat a few Sundays ago.  That the place was empty at 11 a.m. should have been a sign that we ought to head next door to Neighbor's, but having never been to either, we unfortunately didn't know better.  The brunch menu was extremely limited: only six items (pancakes and/or waffles not listed: very problematic for the non-egg-eater in the group), and the one that I ended up ordering, a cheese omelet, was served to me full of egg, cheese, AND sliced red peppers, which I most certainly did not want in my omelet nor expect from the menu's description of it.  And when our lackadaisical waitress returned to the table after delivering the food, she was not apologetic in the least about the mislabeled menu item.  An additional annoyance was the extremely loud, extremely brunch-inappropriate music piped through the place.  Don't get me wrong, I love MGMT, but I DON'T want to hear Oracular Spectacular during my Sunday morning brunch.
