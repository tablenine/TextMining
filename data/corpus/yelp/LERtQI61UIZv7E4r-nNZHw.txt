Eh.  The prix fixe menu pulled me in, but I wasn't overly impressed with the food - not in a town with so many great Italian restaurants.. . We were able to get seating quickly outside, and the hostess was very nice.  Very good menu, and the prix fixe is a great deal.  Limited wines by the glass. Pretty good bread and garlic spread come out right away.. . For starters, we had grilled baby octopus, minestrone soup, mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and grilled, and bruschetta.  The soup was pleasant, the octopus was a bit overdone and rubbery, but the mozzarella was rather nice.. . For entrees we had veal in a white wine sauce, gnocchi in a 4 cheese sauce, parmesan encrusted steak, and the veal ravioli.  Again, everything was good, but not great.  I was very disappointed with the gnocchi - it was heavy and dense, and the sauce was bland.  Dessert was decent as well, the pistachio gelato was a nice finish, the profiteroles were finished off quickly, and my friend greatly enjoyed her chocolate walnut tart.. . All in all, a decent meal, but with great restaurants like La Gondola and La Scarola in the same town, not a place I'd go out of my way to eat at again, even for the great value on prix fixe night.
