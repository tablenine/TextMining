When one of my friends and her boyfriend visited, she picked this place for brunch. I love brunch and have fairly high standards for it. The food was delicious. I generally do not eat eggs but was compelled to have an omelette with vegetables in it. It was so amazingly good and beautiful to look at (my friend is the kind of person who observes stuff about food presentation and pointed it out to me). If morning isn't too early for you to drink they also have a good list of mimosas to have; I got something with mango, forget its name, but it was great.. . Despite being kind of full and warm from sitting outside, we ended up with dessert. Dessert was just as delicious as our meal food; I had a baked alaska (it's a Hawaiified version of it) and my friend had creme brule. The nice part about the desserts is not only were they good, they were good portions, not stingy things a lot of restaurants serve.. . For brunch, it was perfect. Reasonably priced, beyond delicious.
