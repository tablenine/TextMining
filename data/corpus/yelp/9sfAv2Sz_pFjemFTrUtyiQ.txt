This place was across from our B&amp;B on our recent trip to Chicago. We coudn't get enough of the orange brioche french toast with almonds. Also, love the outdoor seating area. Tasty hot cocoa, and for my last meal in Chicago I ordered the avocado &amp; smoked gouda sandwich. It came with fresh lettuce &amp;tomato, some killer cracked mustard, an awesome deli pickle and chips. LOVED IT.
