While this place is really cool and comfortable, and the staff was friendly, I did not think that much of the dinner options.  I had a ham and cheese sandwich, which was ok, but the side of potato salad was very under seasoned.  My friend's grilled cheese tasted ok, but at around $10 a plate I did not think it was worth it.  I have not however, tried any of their deserts or breakfast/brunch items and I heard those are delicious, so I would go back to try that because the atmosphere was very enjoyable and laid back.  Also, the sign telling parents to keep their children in check is about enough to get me to give it another try.
