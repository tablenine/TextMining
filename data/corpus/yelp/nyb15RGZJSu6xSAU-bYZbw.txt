Extensive menu with out-of-the ordinary offerings, including extensive vegetarian options.  Can't wait to try the chilaquiles de mole.. . But today I had the shrimp tacos with black beans and rice plus homemade limonada.  Price came to about $15 which seemed a little pricey considering it's counter service, but OMG  the spicy morita salsa was sublime.  Finishing it with Crema Mexicana was a nice touch.. . Lunch hour at Farmer's Market can get dicey, but  they served me in under 5 minutes.  . . I think it took me even less time to wolf it down.
