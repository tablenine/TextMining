Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
The noodles are pretty good here! They have a pretty good Panang curry, and that's a hard one to get right. I also enjoyed the pad thai, pad see eiw, and the pad khee mao has a kick of flavor. It can get a bit loud in the evening, but it's fun. Service can be a bit slow with refills on drinks, but there are a billion tables, so...I can understand. Overall, good place.
