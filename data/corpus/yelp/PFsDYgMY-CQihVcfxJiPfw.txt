One word: OVERRATED.. . Unless you like long lines, forgetful and slow service, don't go to the Griddle during prime brunch time on the weekends.  I waited 40 minutes for a table for 2 at around 11am on a weekend morning. . . I'll give them props for their amazing French press coffee. Large pot, the choice of 3 brews. Nice.  I got the basic breakfast of eggs, turkey sausage and griddle potatoes. It was just average. My meal came with toast. I ordered wheat. They brought me sourdough. About 10 minutes after the rest of my meal was delivered. How long does it take to make toast? Seriously. I need to dunk my toast in my eggs, very important!!!. . They had some more interesting options but I was lame in my choice. My date got the Tequila Sunrise. It looked like eggs covered in enchilada sauce. Um, it did not look that appetizing at all to me.  . . Unless you have an appetite bigger than a mack truck and a sweet tooth, I'd go elsewhere.  . . Despite the mediocre-to-poor review, I would consider going back to check out their rumored delectable griddle options on a less busy day and time. But only if I ever wake up with a severe sweet tooth.
