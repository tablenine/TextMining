Ate here for dinner the other night for the first time.  Dont know if this is every Thursday but they had Fat Tire for $2 on draft which was a great way to start the evening.. . Started out with fried pickles and bacon for $5.  I only ate one piece of the bacon I got and while the pickles were good, its pretty much a rip off to order this....should of figured that out before ordering.. . Anyway my meal was much better.  Had the half chicken and two sides --- collared greens and brunswick stew both of which were good.  The chicken was flavorfull and moist.  Not sure I'm a big fan of the bbq sauce I tried, but it was ok.. . The one complaint I have about this place....we got TOO much attention from our server.  She was nice and all, but this is what I need.  I need you to take my drink order, come back take my food order, come back 5 minutes after food arrives and ask how everything is, and refill drinks as needed, then come back at the end to give me my check.  I DO NOT need you to come to my table an extra 7 times (I am not exaggerating if anything I"m under the exact number of times) during my meal.  Ok thats my little rant there...... . I will definitely be back here as they seem to have a lot of beer specials...I think they had $1 Yuenglings on Mondays and the food was decent.  But I have to take a star off for the over eager service I received.
