I'm not really in the mood to write a long drawn out novel about this place b/c there's really nothing good to say about it. How it lasted this long is anyone's guess. They should follow in the steps of B.E.D. and Piebar...and just go into the light at the end of the tunnel. The tourists still have Hardrock Cafe and Hooters.... . Besha from the Loaf says it best... . "Oh, and let's not forget the sushi. Actually, let's forget the sushi. My one attempt at testing that side of the menu rendered fishy, slimy yellowtail sashimi and a spicy tuna roll with rice that had obviously been sitting out for some time.". . . http://atlanta.creativ....
