Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Yes, it's a Hollywood landmark, but it's also a blatant tourist trap. Everytime I drive down La Brea, I have to feel a little pity for the tourists who stand in line for both Pink's and Kat Von D's High Voltage (yet another tourist trap but that's another review in itself) because it's more hype than anything else. I have fallen for that hype myself, hence this review. . . It took a couple of attempts before I was actually able to eat one of those damn hot dogs. On the first attempt, my friend was unable to find any parking nearby (their parking lot is tiny for the amount of people who frequent Pink's) and the line stretched out to be what would take 1 - 1 1/2 hours long so I said forget it. On the 2nd attempt, my friends and I had just gotten out of LAX (the club, not the airport, and no this was not recently, it was a good 2 years ago when LAX was a hotspot). About 30 minutes into the line and after way too many drinks, I threw up in line. You would think that after seeing this that people would start abandoning their positions in the line but no one did... except for me and my group of friends. . . Well, as they say, third time's the charm and I was finally able to acquire a hot dog from Pink's. Needless to say, I wasn't charmed by it. The onion rings tasted better than the hot dog itself. I got the Muholland Drive Dog (w/out bacon) and my friend got the infamous Planet Hollywood Dog and they were both just mediocre. I guess when it is hyped up so much you expect way more than what you get, which is exactly what Pink's is. . . Why the 3 stars? That represents my 3 attempts, which were adventures in itself. Thank you Pink's for the adventures, but for a better adventure I'll just head on over to Disneyland and hop on Indiana Jones (not literally)! =P
