Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I love ramen noodles, but this is definitely not my first pick if I have a ramen craving.  I would probably come to this place if I have a spicy noodle craving that day.  However, their ramen is about $7 each, but it can start to get pricey when you start adding toppings to it.  . . The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of the Weller Court.  While most businesses in this plaza is dead, they usually have a waiting list going at Orochon.  Consider sitting outdoors if it is not too cold that day, or you might have to wait for 30+ minutes.. . I personally like their #2 Salt Ramen.  Now... remember this... #2 and Special #2 are two different things.  Special #2 is that giant bowl of hot ramen that can get your picture on the wall if you can finish within 30 minutes.  I have seen several people making attempts at the Special #2, but most can't finish... (If you are making an attempt at Special #2... Careful that you don't burn a hole in your stomach!)
