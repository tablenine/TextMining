I took two of my kids and wife here on a Saturday evening.  It has to be one of the cleanest Vietnamese restaurants on Buford Highway.   The food was AWESOME!!!  We had Pho which we split - one of the best as it was very delicious broth and the thin steak was perfect.  The Grilled Meat platter was very tasty and we made all types of rolls which the kids loved.  We had a couple of very scrumptious appetizers.  I am planning my next trip.
