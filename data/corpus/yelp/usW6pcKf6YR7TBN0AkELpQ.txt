Thumbs up for the awesomely deliciously enormous red velvet pancake and mimosas...FREE! (Pays to be a Dollhouse fan ;)  Everything else on their menu looks incredible and I'll definitely be back here to try more. The only complaint was how crazy busy it was, and how LOUD. My friend and I were sitting no more than two feet from each other and we had to yell over everyone gabbing. But the food was so worth it.
