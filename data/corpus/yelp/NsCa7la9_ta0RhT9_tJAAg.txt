Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Taste is great.  It's right on Melrose across from Marc Jacobs and down the street from Dolce serving up some delicious comfort food at reasonable prices.  I am telling you that Father's Office is getting a run for its money.  The delicious Kobe Burger is just as tasty without having to be a hawk spying for tables in order to snatch it up from some unfortunate hipster in too tight Tsubi jeans.. . While the burger tends to be a fave, I love the short ribs.  They are fall of the bone style with a delicious gravy.  I also recc'd the wine tasters at this place.  You get three glasses of wine to taste for 14 bucks.  It's the perfect way to try their wine menu without having to break the bank.  I promise, their pouring skills are very heavy handed.. . Try and make a reservation though.  The service isn't exactly perfection but they at least apologize for their lagging-ness afterwards.  :-).
