Wow, what a disappointment!  I ordered the "whole" lobster and garlic noodles for about $46.  I got a small side of noodles that I probably could have had for about $4 somewhere else!  The lobster was good, but did I really get a whole lobster?  Much of the space on my plate was taken up by the inedible head of the lobster!!  . . As for drinks, BEWARE!  Each refill of diet coke was $3.50 :(.  . . Overall:  Overpriced and Overrated.  Save your cash for something good.
