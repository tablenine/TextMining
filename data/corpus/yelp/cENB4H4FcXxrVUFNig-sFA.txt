Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Due to the fact that Giordano's was my first &amp; only deep-dish experience ever, my review may be a little biased. But, I have to say I was impressed. The ingredients were fresh, the sauce was savory, the service was good, and the pizza was absolutely delicious. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad. The next time i'm in Chicago i'll definitely be paying Giordano's another visit.
