That's Midtown!  That's Buckhead!  I can't believe we can see that far!. . I got all gussied up and came here for a nice dinner.  I had been to the bar before but never dined at the restaurant.  The prices, were well, super high but, the flavors did not disappoint.  I tried the chicken and my date had trout.  We were both pleasantly surprised at how good the food tasted.  Not a morsel was left on the plate.. . If you are planning on coming for dinner, be sure to check you wallet and bank account balance because it can get pricey.  It's definitely worth it.  Not to mention the beautiful 360 view of Atlanta!
