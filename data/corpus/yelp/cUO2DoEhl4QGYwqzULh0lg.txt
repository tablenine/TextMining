Good for colds, late night hungers, or if you just have a hankering for chicken broth, the matzo ball soup at Canter's is the dish to satisfy this creature of habit. You can typically make a meal in itself with the big matzo balls, but remember it's never complete unless there are bagel chips to go with it. Unfortunately, more than usual by nightfall they usually run out of bagel chips. . . They have a pretty big menu, but to me, the items on their menu can be a hit or miss. There's no point in going to Canter's to order salad because for one, their salad isn't that great. I suppose their pastrami is great but I've personally never tried it.. . My usual dishes there besides the matzo ball soup, is the potato knish, the turkey pasta warm, and of course sweet goodies from the delicatessen afterwards.. . (Begin useless but interesting observation now...). BTW, anyone ever noticed the ceiling decor of Canters? Beautiful photo collage of branches and the sky, but in the center of each repetition almost looks like it forms a swastika. Highly unlikely, but who knows...
