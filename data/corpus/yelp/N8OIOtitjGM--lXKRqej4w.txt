i heart lola's and hope to be back sooner than later.  grabbed some drinks &amp; appies on a thursday night and loved the warm spanish villa feel.  was also loving their martinis.  generally i'm not a huge martini fan but i could consume large amounts of their apple martini on a daily basis.  as for food, you can't go wrong with that mac&amp;cheese.  also found the artichoke appy quite tasty..imagine loads of artichoke/spinach dip layered between thin strips of phyllo dough, baked accordingly.  yum.  not a lot of parkin options so valet it for a bargain $5.
