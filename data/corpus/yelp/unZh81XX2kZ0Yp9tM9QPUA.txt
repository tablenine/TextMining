Category: Thai
While, admittedly, the food can be hit or miss depending on what you order, I really like this place.  Not only do I like it myself, but I like bringing dates and out of towners here.  Thai Elvis never gets old.  There are a couple things on the menu that are just delicious.. . A *REALLY* good place for groups, by the way.
