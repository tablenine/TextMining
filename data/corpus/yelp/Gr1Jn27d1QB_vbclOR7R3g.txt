Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I love the pasta here and the atmosphere is great and makes you feel like you have escaped LA for a street-side Italian cafe, if only for an hour -- but literally every time I have eaten there I leave with a stomach ache. The first couple times I thought it was a coincidence, the third time I got suspicious, and the fourth time I swore never to come back. I assume that they use some ingredient that I am allergic to so you should try it and it would usually get a four star from me. . . .Still has anyone else had this happen to them?
