I don't remember the sushi here as it was over-shadowed by my first experience with Sea Cucumber.. . UPDATE: I've now been back and sat at the crowded sushi-bar. After a mix-up with the sushi chef, about whether the ladies i was with wanted rolls or nigiri sushi we got them what they wanted, which were rolls. me moved on to some nigiri once they felt more emboldened, I ate some yellow-tail, some kanpachi, unagi, anago, all which was really good.. Our Sushi-Chef was hilarious, when asked about a fish he would enact the part of the fish, flapping his arms for halibut fin, etc.. Pretty amusing, and all after he scolded us for wanting maki at the sushi bar. But now I get it.. Line or not, I think the sushi here is good, and in a pinch if you don;t know where else to go this place will do just fine.
