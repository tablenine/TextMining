I have never had my socks knocked off with the food here, granted I am a picky eater which limits my menu items.  But that being said, the cheese burger has never made my fun parts tingle.  And lets face it: A greasy spoonlike diner should atleast kick burger ass!  That having been said...I dig the Daddy Mac and Cheese (spicey version of the ole fav), and some grilled cheese action. Mmmm cheese.. . I have never felt rushed to hit the road by the staff either, which is nice because I usually just stop in to get some tea while reading and people watching.  . . Around the clock foodage is also a plus, because let face it sometimes you need to eat when everyone else is asleep!  In a nutshell, food (not great food) 24 hours, decent staff, and watching interesting Los Felizites equal an ok place to visit from time to time.
