Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Once in a while your taste buds are searching for that particular taste. Last weekend my taste buds were looking for some greek food. . . I was introduced to Papa Cristos by my mom who, like me, is a foodie. . . So let me give you the run down of this really surprising establishment:. . 1. Parking - street or in the back of the restaurant which is FREE.. . 2. The restaurant is connected to its deli which has an abundance of different mediterranean goodies - olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cookies, juices, and probably the most impressive item you can buy a whole lamb at their meat section! That I will have to go back for at another time. They also give a 20% discount for a purchase of $20 or more. . . 3. Interior decor of the restaurant is very humble - basic chairs and tables with blue and white table covers. I mean, what more are you expecting? Remember you are going there for the food. . . 4. Cost of food is pretty reasonable. If you are a smart eater, you'd go for their combo meals and just order sides or an extra dish to taste. We ordered the falafel sandwich combo, grilled baby octupus, lamb kebab gyro, chicken kebab, house salade w/ olives and feta cheese, dolmas, baklava, and coffee. Overall the food was very flavorful. My favorite was the grilled baby octopus - simple flavors - olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and galic. . . 5. Service was great. Everyone at the restaurant and deli was very friendly and helpful. The cherry on the sunday would probably the impromptu greek lessons I received from the son of Papa Cristos.. . The food is flavorful, service is great, shopping for greek food is convenient, and the cost is pretty decent especially in this economy. . . Will I go back? Yes and this time I will try other dishes and maybe purchase more from their deli.
