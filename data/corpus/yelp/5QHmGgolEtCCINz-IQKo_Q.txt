went here last night for the salsa finals (i do not salsa, but it was so awesome to watch) and it was a great place.  the sangria is amazing and potent.. . I had their nachos and a mini steak taco.  Next time I go I'm definitely having a meal.  The nachos were so tasty.  None of that fake cheese stuff.  And their mini steak taco was the tastiest bite-size taco I've ever had.  I shouldve had their taco flight, but wanted to eat nachos.  . . The service was great and the crowd once the dancing started was amazing.  After the salsa-ing, they played a bit of reggaeton.  I miss hearing reggaeton so it was nice to hear it and dance again. :)  . . Amazing atmosphere.
