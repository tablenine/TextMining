This is a great place for people watching, but you'll wait a long time for a table. Griddle arguably has the best french toast in LA -- the Devil's Daydream.  They should play 70s black metal when they serve it at your table.  The pancakes are enormous and you'll never finish 'em.   But hey -- you aint coming here if you're on a diet, because if you were, you'd be at the farmer's market sucking up some wheatgrass.
