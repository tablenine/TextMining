It seems as if more and more places are going for that industrial-style, sterile look, which makes you focus less on the environment/atmosphere and focus more on the food.  This tiny cafe (not too many tables inside or outside) is an all-right place to get your sweets fix.  . . My friend, brother, and I ordered the strawberry lemonade, the grasshopper ice cream cookie, and the milkie way malt.. . The strawberry lemonade was a tad too sweet and a tad too artificial for me.. . The grasshopper ice cream cookie (mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiched by sugar cookies and covered in chocolate) was pretty good.  The cookies used were crunchy--I prefer soft cookies for my sandwich, but my friend really seemed to like it.  Plus, Milk gave a generous amount of ice cream for the sandwich.  The chocolate covering really didn't provide much to the sandwich and seemed to just get all over everyone's clothing because it crumbled easily.. . The milkie way malt was delicious.  Made with vanilla ice cream, malted milk chocolate chips, with a caramel chocolate swirl, and topped with whipped cream and a whopper, this was one sweet malt.  All of us basically inhaled this malt down!  The only thing I wish they changed was to make it more malt-y, if that makes sense.  It tasted great, but you could have mistaken it for a milkshake instead of a malt.
