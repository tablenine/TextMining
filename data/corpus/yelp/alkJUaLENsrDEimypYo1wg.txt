Given that Pho appears to be most Yelpers cuisine of choice, I decided to check out the local eatery with high hopes.  Unfortunately, I was thoroughly disappointed.  In reality, Pho couldn't be a more boring and uninspired cuisine.  Apparently flavorless soup is huge in Vietnam.  My guess is that someone once dropped an egg roll in some tea and pawned it off as a new meal to their mentally challenged friends.  That being said, there are about a million more interesting and flavorful Asian cuisines to try.  Don't even bother with this stuff (unless you grew up eating cardboard and anything that doesn't taste like water or wood seems delicious to you).
