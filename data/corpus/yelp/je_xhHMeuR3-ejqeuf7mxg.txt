The California omelette was foul-smelling. It had too much going on (avocado and 3 kinds of cheese and sour cream and what-not) and none of the flavours were really going with each other. It honestly smelled so bad, I didn't feel like eating anything else. The gnutella-banana crepes weren't bad. The banana pancakes were disappointing (topped with bananas instead of cooked with them!). . . Also, the service was less than perfect. We went kind of close to 3 when they close for brunch, and the waitstaff pretty much sat down to eat and ignored us. Also, when I went to the _women's_ room one of the waiters was in there - weird.
