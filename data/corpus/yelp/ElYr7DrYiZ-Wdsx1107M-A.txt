Had the $10 crunchy sushi lunch plus an order of tuna nigiri and was pretty disappointed. The roll was pre-made and soggy and the nigiri was sliced so thin it could have passed as carpacio. This was maybe my 5th time there and neither the food nor the overall atmosphere make me want to return. The waiter was pretty quick and friendly though.
