I drive past El Barco at least once a week and have been wanting to make a stop in. Today on the bike ride home from work my finance and I decided to go to dinner at El Barco. It was great, there was a bike rack right out front.. . The place seemed pretty busy but there were plenty of tables and no wait. Once seated we were given this giant menu, about a foot wide and 2 ft tall. If you were at a table with a large group it would of made it really hard to flip through the menu. It wasn't even that there were a lot of items - it was that the type was just giant with lots of cartoon pictures. . . To drink I went with a mango margarita and my finance tried the sangria, both of them were good. We were seeing the size of the food come out of the kitchen and figured we should share an entree. But we did go with two appetizers, but think we should of gotten only one. I just really wanted to try an octopus tostada. I had never had or seen a octopus tostada so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was just a tostada shell with a bunch of octopus on it - nothing else. I don't think I would get it a again but I am glad I tried it, it just needed some of the tostada fixings. We tried to get the waitress to suggest a red snapper to get but she had no idea and couldn't explain the different sauces. Randomly we picked the broiled snapper Â with adobo sauce. I think we made a good choice since the snapper was excellent! . . Overall we had way too much to eat. I think two people could just get drinks and share one entree and have a great meal.
