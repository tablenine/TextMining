Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
The best thing here is the salsa. I like mixing the red and green together. If you like hard shell, shredded beef tacos, this place is some of the best I have ever had. Sometimes the tacos taste better than other times - not sure why - the last time I went there about 2 months ago they were incredible. The refried beans are a taste thrill - awesome. The bean burrito is good if you like that - I'd rather have the beans without the burrito. I don't like the con carne, enchiladas, tamale, or beef burrito. The chips are ok - the Salsa makes the chips and tacos - the chips and tacos do not taste that good without the salsa - don't be shy with the salsa - pile it on the tacos - awesome. They switched to Pepsi a while ago - which set the hook deep for me because I hate diet coke. The lines are long for a reason - it is worth the wait. I wish they were open 24 hours - I would come more often. Anybody who rates this place low does not like hard shell tacos and does not appreciate good hard shell tacos. If you do not like hard shell tacos, don't bother coming here.
