I will say they have an interesting menu and on a nice day out on the patio they gave me a little sample of a chocolate milkshake which was wonderful...I just didn't know what the heck it was for the longest time. The food was decent, probably wouldn't say good enough for the price. However, the staff is friendly and mostly attentive, even during lunch rush.
