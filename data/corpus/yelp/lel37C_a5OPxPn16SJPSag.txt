Great tacos...Loved the atmosphere and it's a nice walk from friends house...The only downside is they have weird hours and we tired going there 2x and they were closed. This could be for certain reasons. Some restaurants need to close during the day to prep for their dinner hours. But, this won't keep me from going there again. If I like a place and the food is delicious I'm pretty failthfull...Great for a small group 6-8 people at the most and I would definitely call ahead. It's a very cozy dining room, a small patio great
