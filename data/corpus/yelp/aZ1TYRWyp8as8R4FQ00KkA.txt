Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I came here last sunday after my man and I went to see the Pistons vs Clippers... I don't see what the big deal is. We wait for 1 hour and 15 mins, the selection is dope; there ain't much you can't put on a hot dog. I got the New York dog. Ewwww, freaken nastyyyyyy ass shit! If das how ppl grub on hot dogs in NY then i'm straight... it came with this red onion sauce (sounds appetizing but it ain't) and their sauerkraut was BOOF! My man's hotdog however was delicious! He got a 10" dog w/ fajita mix on top... it was hella good!! They're chili fries are good too but oh hell no I wouldn't ever go there again. It would not be worth the wait. yea yea now I have the experience under my belt... been there done dat. next!
