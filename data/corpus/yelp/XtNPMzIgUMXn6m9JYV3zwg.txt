This place is like crack for the pancake junkie.. . I'm talking monstrosities for pancakes and with almost 20 different varieties, my head almost spun into another dimension. These aren't for the light of heart either, with flavors like "A Time to Love" (pancakes filled with streusel, butterscotch chips, and caramel and topped with powdered sugar, whipped cream, and caramel). . . Now, I admit my appetite is not along the lines of a pro linebacker for the Chargers (yay!) but there were THREE people working on our stack and we got through about half. So note to self: split the order because there's no splitting charge!. . Another plus with a very minor negative:. If you order coffee or tea, they'll give you your own kettle/french press. I had tea but I'm told the coffee was amazing. The downside: Expensive. My tea was $4. The coffee was actually a little cheaper at $3.60. . And of course, in true West Hollywood fashion, I would venture to guess all the waiters have their headshots in their back pockets :)
