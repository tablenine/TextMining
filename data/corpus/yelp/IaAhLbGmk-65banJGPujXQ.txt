The line is ridiculous but its a landmark and a total tourist attraction but its totally worth it. My favorite is the Planet Hollywood. (I think thats what its called) and their chili fries are yummy. The whole thing is so much fun definately worth the wait in the long line. And if you have room after? I love the little patio outside to sit and eat. Just remember though its CASH ONLY. kind of lame to wait the whole time in that line to realize you need cash. BRING CASH! CASH CASH CASH!
