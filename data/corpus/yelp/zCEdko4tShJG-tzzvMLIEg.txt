I'll keep this short, since there's hundreds of reviews for Daikokuya. And I'm sure I'll be repeating what others have already said... . As a testament to how amazing Daikokuya Ramen is, a few years ago I visited three separate times over one week. That's extremely rare for me. Pros: broth, perfectly cooked noodles, berkshire pork, flavored egg.. (am I just listing the ingredients for ramen? lol..), fried rice is really tasty, gyoza is delicious, and the iced tea is very good. . . Additional Notes:. + Huge crowds equal long wait.. + Space is small, just a few tables and a bar. But it adds to the charm.. + Plenty of things to do while you wait or after you eat, e.g. anime store next door, J-town plaza across the street, liquor store a few steps adjacent (where you can giggle staring at J-porn.) . + Parking is structure, so it can be expensive to a certain extent (unless you find street metered parking.)
