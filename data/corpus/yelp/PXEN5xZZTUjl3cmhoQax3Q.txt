Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I've been tortured by my daughter and her boyfriend's stories of delicious portabello fries....And Yes I was Jealous! . So finally a trip down to LA to see my baby and a plan, Bottega Louie's for dinner! We went early to ensure a seat with no wait. Had drinks at Rosa Mexicanos, and then headed to BL around 5:30 on a Friday. Got a lovely table in the center of the restaurant near the pizza making area. It's an amazing high ceiling airy white washed walled simplistic style decor. Very inviting and comfortable, and our waitress "Michelle" was amazing and on top of all are needs. After inhaling those crispy little delights called Portabello Fries, I settled on Roasted chicken and a side order of Fresh organic carrots cooked in butter. So tender and so many I shared. My Â one daughter a huge piece of lasagna (took a taste even though I normally don't eat beef) Delicious! And my other daughter had a light cheese and spinach ravioli also buttery in flavor and rich but not over the top. . From the moment we walked in and were seated to upon leaving everyone was on the spot with a smile and great service. I'll be back with my husband next time I'm down in LA.
