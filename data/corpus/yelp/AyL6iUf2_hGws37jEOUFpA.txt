I love the chicken wings there. it's a nice place to have a beer and some snacks...why do i call snacks? because you will literally needs to order like 10 dishes to fill two stomachs.....the "ham-pan" cheese is good. The saboro bowl is good. if you are super hungry, i will suggest you to go across the street o hurry curry.
