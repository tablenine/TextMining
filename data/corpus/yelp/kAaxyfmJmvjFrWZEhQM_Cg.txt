Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I very much so dislike this place. I frequented  this locale a very long time ago...during my college years. Every time,  with the hope that it would be better.. . I don't understand why there's such a fan base for this restaurant when there are a kajillion and one other mexican restaurants that far surpass the quality of Tito's attempt for tacos.. . Here is my opinion on the said tacos:. 1. Cheese is NASTY, as in watered down cheese nasty.. 2. Meat, is that meat?. 3. Line is usually long. . Tito's Tacos is a resounding NO! in my book.
