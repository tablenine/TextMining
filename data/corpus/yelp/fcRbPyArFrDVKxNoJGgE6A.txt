Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Didn't venture into the special ramen but level 1 was at about what I consider bearable, but only by a slim margin. I was on my first day of the common cold, so I recommend it for some help with congestion. Portion was large. I think I'd have trouble contesting to get my picture on the wall, simply because of the portion size. A lot of food to finish in 30 minutes, especially if you pay the extra for additional noodles . . Price was decent for how full you leave. Don't forget extra noodles and garlic. Few other items are available to be added for a price. Despite what I read, the gyoza was good. . . Parking is supposedly available. Â I guess if you know that it is part of a three story shopping center, you won't have to walk around for a while. Could just have been me.. . I was very content with the experience.
