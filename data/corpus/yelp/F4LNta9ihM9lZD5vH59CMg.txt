Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Besides the Thai Elvis, Palms Thai Restaurant is currently my favorite Thai restaurant in the Thai Town area.. . The restaurant is spacious with all tables allowing views of Elvis on stage and the wait staff, fully equipped with ear pieces and mics give the service a sense of urgency and attentiveness.  Being able to communicate quickly with the wait staff cuts waiting time for refills, table clearings, etc in half.. . The restaurant closes late into the night which is nice for those late night thai cravings without having to sacrifice having to go to one of those dark and dimly lit places where even the C rating sign is dirty just so that you can fullfill your BBQ pork urges.. . The portions are good and the prices adequate.  The menu selection is wide ranging from typical pad thai to frog, venison, and wild boar entrees, making each visit enjoyable to try something new. And with the full bar, delightful food, and buzzing environment (especially when Thai Elvis is on) it makes for a great place to hang out with friends and family, not to mention a memorable fun place to take a date. . . The only thing I find annoying is that not all the dishes come out together. Sometimes the appetizer will come after a main dish.   It seems that they come out as soon as they are finished in the kitchen, which makes for piping hot dishes, but I like receiving all my food in the order in which i plan to eat them. However, sometimes it isn't so bad because the food is so hot coming out, we just wait for everything to arrive to the table as the food cools down. I always leave full. :)
