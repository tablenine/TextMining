Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
I have learned a valuable lesson: be careful what you Bitch about because you might not be able to Bitch about it some day. . . One afternoon we walked into Porto's and took a number, #113. My bf looked at the digital sign and informed me that they're currently only up to #4. I tell him not to worry, that must just mean that they're on #104, the digital sign just doesn't go up to the 100s. Turns out that's not the case! There were 109 people ahead of us. We hemmed and hawed and Bitched and moaned...weighed the pros and cons of trying to go to another restaurant and by then they were on #22 so we decided to wait. But, we Bitched about the wait the entire time, "I'm hungry!", "My feet hurt", "They're crowding me", "They're trying to cut,".... . Well, let me tell you kiddies...a line is just a line is just a line and you cannot find as heavenly a cuban sandwich, meat pie, or potato ball ANYWHERE else this side of Cuba. And now...I'm living in a new city with just my taste buds' memories and a new lesson learned.
