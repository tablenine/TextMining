Oh sweet Grilled Cheese, "You made me love you, I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it..." Now that The Foundry On Melrose's Grill Cheese and I have exchanged numbers, I can properly review my experience.. . I first went to The Foundry On Melrose last year for a networking event. I recalled enjoying the hors d'oeuvres and drinks that I received, so I decided to try this place out for dinner. Â First, we were presented with an amuse-bouche. I don't exactly recall what it was, but I liked it. My friend and I ordered the Steamed Mussels (with chorizo, fennel, and crispy bread), Albacore Tartare, the Hand Rolled Pasta (with braised lamb, eggplant, fava beans, and saffron), and of course, Grilled Cheese (with taleggio, raisin bread, apricot-caper puree, and chunks of short ribs). OMG, the Hand Rolled Pasta is sooooo amazing! As you can already tell, I adore the Grilled Cheese sandwich! The Steamed Mussels were tasty, especially with the added pieces of chorizo. The Albacore Tartare was ok.. . The staff gave us outstanding service! They were very attentive and cordial. In addition, The Foundry is one of the few places in L.A. that can actually make a real Bellini (not with that Peach Schnapps crap). . . As I was leaving there was a live band playing in the lounge, which was an added bonus. The Foundry On Melrose reminds me of the "grown up" places I would fantasize about as a kid. I can't wait to return so I can make out with my new love... yeah I'm talking about you, Grilled Cheese!
