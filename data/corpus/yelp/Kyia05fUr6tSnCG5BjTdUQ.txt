Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Friends and I hit up Umami's the weekend of July 4th. Perhaps, that's why there was relatively no wait for us to get a table. I figured most everyone already got their fill of burgers. Lucky us~. . I love burgers. Not just any burgers, but GOURMET burgers. Hm. Actually, I like McDonald's burgers too. Ok. I LIKE ALL BURGERS. And Umami has got some tasty ones.. . Friend and I split 3 burgers. Truffle burger was the best. There was a great taste to them. The Hatch burger was our second favorite. We like our food spicy. And then the Umami burger came in 3rd. . . 2 things surprised me. 1 - they grind their own meat in the kitchen. You can see them grinding away right past the curtains to the kitchen. 2. The portions are a little on the small side... therefore my friend and I had to split 3 of them instead of 2.. . The fries are great (although, again sort of on the small portion side). Friend's onion rings also looked great (again small portion).. . But! In the age of "Supersize me", diabetes, childhood obesity, maybe the smaller portion is fine. . . The burgers are generally served medium rare. We asked for them medium and thought they were perfect. Still juicy, tender and scrumptious. Oh yummo.. . They also had amazing desserts -- good ice cream sandwiches and some red velvet dingdong looking thing.. . Food = B+ (strictly a burger joint). Staff = B. Environment = C (on the too small side). Overall = B. . A must eat place for burger folks.
