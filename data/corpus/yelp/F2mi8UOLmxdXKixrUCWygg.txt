Best subs I've ever had, but success means longer lines/waits lately, and it seems like the sandwiches aren't as plump as they used to be. A few competitors seem to be putting dents in their business, but none can really compete with Bari in quality.. . Get the italian with hot or mild peppers, a meatball w/ provolone, or a prosciutto and mozzarella.. . The deli and specialty foods are great, too, though expensive. Don't order their italian sausage for lunch (I think they microwave it) but definitely take some fresh sausage home to cook for dinner.. . They're only open for lunch, the sandwich counter closes at 4 I think.
