I have to say this place is as authentic as you get in Atlanta when it comes to Thai Food! . The ambience is very soothing, the staff are awesome, they will go out of their way to make sure you are having a great time at Naan Thai! . The drinks are great - I tried the cocktails and was definately not disappointed. . Overall the food is awesome, its a little spicy, but then again authentic Thai food is spicy. Â Try the shrimp and the lamb! It was definately a great choice for a friends Dinner! . It might be a bit pricey to go there often, but it is definately a good place to go if you are trying to impress someone :) or just make someone feel special!
