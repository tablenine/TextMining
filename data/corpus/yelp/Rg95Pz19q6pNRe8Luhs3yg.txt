Probably the BEST coffee cafe I've ever been to. But I don't go to many.... I had a delicious Bali coffee brewed in a gravity-bong-like, reverse-press, coffee siphon vacuum pot! The water is on bottom, the coffee up top, and the water boils up to the coffee chamber, and then cools down and drips back down into the coffee pot. Weird science!. Also had: . Emmy's Peanut Butter Cup / Peanut butter cream, Madagascar vanilla cream, bananas, honey, candied peanuts, topped with Valrhona dark chocolate $9. Not Quite French Toast / Two slices of caramelized vanilla-cinnamon-sugar brioche toast $4.50. Valrhona Chocolate Chip Cookie. The interior was chic, the dessert was ok, and the coffee was amazing!
