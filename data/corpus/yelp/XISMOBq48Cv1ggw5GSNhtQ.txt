Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
A better name for this restaurant would be FAMINE. Tammy and I went here for brunch and sat at a table for WELL over an hour before we were served a decidely average meal.. . When I asked the manager to replace the toilet paper in the men's room, she disappeared forever.. . After we finished our food, we couldn't find our server, and no one else would come over to help us. Once we did finally locate our server, he acted as if getting our check would be the most difficult task of his life.. . I've never seen a staff at a restaurant so openly hostile!. . I'd rather go hungry than eat another FEAST.
