I was waiting for my food to go when I saw a lady eating the stewed pork rice noodle soup. I said to myself, d*mn, I should have ordered that. Then, the waitress brought her a plate of Pork Rice cake. I was really kicking myself for forgetting to order that. Suddenly it dumped on me, I always wanted more at this place.
