Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Walking into the the Bourgeois Pig, you might feel as though you could acccidentally bump into Hemingway or Faulkner while making your way to the bar. The intellectual atmosphere of this wonderful lunch spot makes it the perfect place to bring a book, have a sandwich or just spend some time contemplating life. The list of sandwiches and salads is scrawled out on a chalkboard and can seem daunting to the newcomer. But if you feel overwhelmed by the possibilities, you can always build you're own. After you've ordered, you can find a spot on one of couches or antique wooden tables and it will be served to you with no extra charge when it is ready. Pig out!
