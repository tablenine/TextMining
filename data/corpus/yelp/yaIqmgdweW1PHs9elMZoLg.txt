Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Probably the worst-run restaurant in Los Angeles. After 4 years or so you'd think they would figure out how to create a nice environment. But the owners and staff are clearly not motivated to make improvements.. . I honestly don't know why anyone ever comes back here. It's like an M. Night Shyamalan movie -- the hype makes it seem great and next thing you know, you are just sad 'cause 2 hours of your life have been sucked away.. . Visit Alcove if you:. . -Love standing in line in small spaces. -Enjoy tiny tables that the awkwardly-sized plates don't fit on. -Seek out the intimacy that only tables jammed together can provide. -Can only walk 10 feet at a time and live next door. . The overpriced food is mediocre and takes forever to arrive. In the 4 times I have been (I know! See?! it's like a Shyamalan movie! I want it to not suck) we have never had all of our food arrive at the same time. . . And, wow, the crowd of lamesters is pretty impressive. Parking is a nightmare down the tiny driveway.. . I will say that they serve a giant piece of cake, so kudos on that.. . With so many other good places within walking distance, there is simply no reason to deal with the stress and annoyance of Alcove.
