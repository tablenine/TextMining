SOOOO overrated. . . Saw this place on DDD's, so we had to try it out. . Glad we showed up early for lunch, cause this place really fills up. . But why? . Manchild ordered the Oinkster pastrami meal combo, which ended up being around 13 bucks!! I had the pulled pork sandwich. . The sandwiches were huge and we both only ate half. . I was deeply disappointed. We had been talking about going to this place for weeks. . My pulled pork was dry and flavorless. It desperately needed sauce, which it came with on the side. Except isn't wasn't very saucy, it was more like water with some spices in it. . The pastrami was blah, and unmemorable. I cant even remember it well enough to write a detailed review. . The french fries came with a garlic aioli, which I put on my sandwich to add some flavor. Wish we would have known to order ketchup for our fries, even though they charge extra for it ... who does that?! . We did enjoy the outside seating, even though it was right on the road.. . Never again Wilson, never again.
