Restaurant: The Earl
Category: Dive Bars
The EARL boasts some of the best food at any bar I've been to in ATL, great burgers served a variety of ways (Bleu Cheese, Bacon &amp; Mushroom... OMG) as well as daily specials like meatloaf, and a decent assortment of appetizers and snackables like some bomb-ass nachos and PBR battered alligator tenders.  The alcohol selection is great, with ample selections of bottles and drafts, and all the liquor you'd expect at a proper bar.. . My only complaint with the bar / restaurant area is the jukebox is always SO DAMN LOUD YOU HAVE TO SHOUT AT THE PEOPLE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.  I'm not some old fart; everyone I know who's been there agrees.  If they'd just turn it down a little, it'd be so much more enjoyable.  At least it's mostly good stuff in the jukebox.... . Their music venue in the back is also excellent, a mid-sized room with a corner stage.  Good sound system and sight lines.  You're likely to encounter unconventional acts at the EARL, assorted indie rock, post-rock, electronic, hip-hop, comedy, etc.  They may seem a bit elitist, but so what.  They book good acts outside the mainstream and fill a vital need in East Atlanta, especially since the Echo Lounge shut down.. . . http://www.badearl.com.  will fill you in on the rest, like concert schedule, menu, etc etc etc. .
