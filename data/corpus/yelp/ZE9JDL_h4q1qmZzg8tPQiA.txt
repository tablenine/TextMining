Not worth the wait.  Not worth the hassle of the line.  Not worth not being able to find seating.  Just not that good.  I mean seriously, I don't know why this place has gotten so many good reviews, Amateur burger aficionados!. . Sure, this place has a historic charm.  But it's over-priced and not nearly as delectable as other local spots like Father's Office or even The Counter in Santa Monica.  I categorize this burger about as good as what you'd get at a Cafe 50's chain, and you'll get better seating at Cafe 50's.
