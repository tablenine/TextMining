Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I'd like to change my thoughts about this place. My roommate and I just recently shared a cheese and pineapple pizza from here that was AWESOME, and I'm a huge huge fan of pizza. This was an amazing pizza. I came for pick up, which was nice because then I didn't have to wait for a table. I'd say that I'm giving it a four because of the quality of the food. The line is always ridiculous, and that always deters me, but from now on, when I drive by and there's not a long line, I'm totally going inside for some delicious, hot Casa Bianca.
