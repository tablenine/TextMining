Happy hour, happy hour, happy hour! It's been said before, but this really is the only reason to come here. And since their hours for happy hour are so long (5pm-10pm, half off), it's pretty much happy hour all the time.. . Our party of 4 arriving at 8pm waited about 5 minutes for a table. The inside of the place is trendy and very Asian. The sushi is good. They have a wide selection of rolls that are part of the special, including some very good, spicy specialty rolls. UCLA students are spoiled to have this place near campus.
