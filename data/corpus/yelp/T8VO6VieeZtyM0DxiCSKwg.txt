The wait is insaaaane for a bowl of ramen.  The ramen's great, and the broth is very rich.  if you're not a big fan of pork and pork flavor, this won't be for you.  the pork they include with the ramen is really fatty but very flavorful.. . if you can get in with less than a 20 minute wait and you're a fan of good ramen in rich broth, then it's worth it.
