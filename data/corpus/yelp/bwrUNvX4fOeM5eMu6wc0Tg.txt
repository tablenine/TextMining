Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I'm pretty sad that there aren't more people giving Johnnie's 5 stars.  I also grew up in Culver City and have been going there since I was in elementary.  Now I live in Orange County but would get those crazy cravings for a greasy, delicious and satisfying pastrami sandwich I will drive all the way to Culver City to satisfy that craving.  Yeah, we have The Hat but it is no comparison to Johnnie's.  Oh and lets not forget about the homemade kosher pickles that come with every order.  My husband or brother will get the chili burger when they're not in the mood for pastrami (which they swear is one of the best).. . But me, I will stick to my Pastrami with American on a roll.  Plain and simple.  No ketchup needed.  One of the great things about this place and what's unique to Johnnie's is that they don't fry or grill their pastrami.  It's actually boiled which translate to DELICIOUS and tender.. . Yes, the menu is pretty pricey but hey, its considered a landmark.  I will forever be a true Johnnie's Pastrami fan til I die (or until it kills me).  Ha ha!. . OH YEAH! Make sure you bring Cash! They don't accept credit cards but they do have an ATM machine that charges an arm and a leg.
