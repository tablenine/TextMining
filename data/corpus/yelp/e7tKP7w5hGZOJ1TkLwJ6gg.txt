Went here for dinner.. . Had their salad with arugula, fresh sliced parmagiano (square) with balsamic vinaigrette, the most simple salad but very delicioso!. . Their meatballs were SUPER TENDER and moist, idk wth they put in it but they were perfectly cooked (medium).. . Their roasted olives in olive oil w/ toasted crackers (?) were ok.... . The fried squash blossom with ricotta was good... . We ordered every single pizza on the menu.... the one w/ goat cheese, garlic, bacon, etc. and the one w/ the bacon, salami, sausages, tomato, etc. were my 2 faves.. my least favorite one was the one w/ anchovies (I don't like these D:). . For dessert we had fresh tiramisu in a wine glass, and a triple fudge cake with gelato. These were awesome!. . Service was awesome.. Parking is valet only.. Street parking is hard to find.. . Two thumbs up for Nancy (lovely lady~) and Mario x333 *heart heart* hehe
