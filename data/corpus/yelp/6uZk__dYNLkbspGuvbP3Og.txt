If you like red meat, booze, and a great atmosphere this is the place for you. Right smack in the middle of the Viagra Triangle you might get lost in the beef at this place (pun intended). This place has my favorite steak in town, the WR Chicago cut. This steak is a gorgeous bone in rib eye that tastes like a dream. I normally get it with bleu cheese melted on top. Wow my mouth just watered thinking about it. Well if you can make it out there make sure you make reservations because Gibson's is the place to be and enjoy a Gin Martini on me.
