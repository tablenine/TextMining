Restaurant: Noche
Category: Tapas Bars
Yay for Noche and their pomegranate martinis and mango margaritas. This is a great place to slip into for a drink and a tapas plate if you're in the Highlands area. Also connected by patio to Fontaine's, so you can enjoy drinks at both, although you will have two separate bar tabs since they are two entirely different places.
