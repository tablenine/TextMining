Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
We were really excited to go here after all the buzz. Well, Comme Ca is just "so-so" and possibly even a "no-no." First off, I ordered a carafe of red wine. When it came, the server didn't offer for me to taste it, he just poured a glass. I tried it and thought it tasted off. After another sip -- yup, it really was corked! Gross! I told the server and asked for something else. Realized after I paid that they had charged me for the bad wine -- unbelievable. . . Hoped the food would make up for the wine but it was mediocre. Had the steak frites, which *should* be the piece de resistance of any French bistro. Sadly, the steak was overcooked and stringy, the fries weren't crispy and were flavorless. The aioli was basially just plain mayo. We had oysters to start but the sauce was watery and unappetizing. . . Not worth the trip at all, especially when there are such great other options just across the street (Lucques, Ago). I also wasn't a fan of the crowded tables and plastic seats. Blech. . . The best part of the night? I found street parking.
