If you want a nice relaxing dinner with some friends this aint the place....the waiters are all douche bags who run around and force u to drink.  The dancing around and the stupidity is entertaining.  The restraunt looks like a dining hall more then anything else filled with nothing but kegs of japanese beer and sake on each table.  Next thing you know your bill comes out to like 500 bucks for the shittiest time u've ever had.  This would have been fun if i was still 18 and juss needed to get trashed.  The food was also overpriced and shitty as hell.  Stay away from here if u cant handle insane amounts of alcohol or if you fall easily to peer pressure.
