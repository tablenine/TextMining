It's hard to believe there is only one review for the place, it was pretty packed with diners at lunch today. A good friend of mine treated me to lunch, and said it was his current favorite Chinese food restaurant. Being that he has excellent taste in food, and is Chinese by birth I was really excited to try it.. . They've done a nice job of decorating an old Marie Calendar's space. About the only reminder are a few brick walls, and the new look is a semi hip upscale. It's lacking alot of the cheesy style usually found in this type of place, so that's a welcome relief. Service was okay, pleasant if not earthshattering but it was timely and we got what we ordered.. . The food was solid, if not the exquisite experience I was hoping for. We order beef cube steak, it was nicely cooked but not as tasty or as good texture as this Vietnemese restuarant off Fremont on Valley (can't remember the name at the moment). Â We had some good shrimp, the type you have to peel yourself and it was quite good and the serving was plentiful. Lastly we had some fish on lunch special, had a nice taste and was firm just the way it should be.. . All in all it was good, I can see how it might be really good for dinner so I'm looking forward to trying it then.. . Food - A-. Ambience - B. Service - B+. Value - B+
