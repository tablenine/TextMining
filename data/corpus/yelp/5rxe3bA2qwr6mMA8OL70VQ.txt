Next time I'll just save myself 20 bucks and go to Taco Bell.. . I'm not sure there was any tequila in my margarita.  Off to a bad start already.  Especially when your customer is a lush.  . . The guacamole was serviceable.  With the beef enchiladas, though, I'm not sure you could take a blind taste test and tell the difference between Uncle Julio's and Taco Bell.  There was some kind of processed nacho cheese that overpowered everything else.  . . We got a complimentary plate of sopaipillas for dessert on account of it being my initial visit to UJ's.  Gonna have to do much better than that.
