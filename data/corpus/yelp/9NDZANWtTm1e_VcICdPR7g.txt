Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
It's rare you find a place that's cheap, good, and healthy in LA! Tender Greens manages to do it, with an upscale environment and fresh ingredients at fast food prices. You wont' spend more than $10 for a full meal and there's no pesky tipping. Only downside is the aggressive busboys, who take your tray as soon as you sit down and then hover over you if you stay more than 45 mins. Parking is a spacious lot two blocks away, no problem.
