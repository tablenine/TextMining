My first two visits here were less than perfect.  My first time around, I ordered the highly acclaimed hickory burger and did not like it!  Tall Mexican ordered the original steak burger, of which I had a bite and decided I must order next time around.  Unfortunately, our next visit was a hungover Sunday morning and a burger was not in the cards.  So I ordered the ham and swiss combo sandwich instead.  Worse idea! Meanwhile, Tall Mexican is right next to me enjoying his Steakburger Part 2.  FINALLY, I force a third visit just so I can claim my own Steakburger and alas, we have 4 stars.  The Steakburger is very good, although for me nothing beats In-N-Out.  What really puts this place over the top fo rme are their fries - O-M-Godliness.  They are delicious.  They are cooked to the perfect tune of crunchy and almost crispy.  I crave those fries.  I also love the novelty of the cone shaped soda cups, but that is a minor detail.
