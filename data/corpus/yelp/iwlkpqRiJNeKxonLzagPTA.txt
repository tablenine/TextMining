this vegan food outdoes a lot of non-vegan food that gets rave reviews on this sucker.. . like others, i am not vegan, but i'm trying to eat healthier and my vegan friends like to take me here and experiment. Fettucine Alfredo, better than any other I have had, doesn't weigh down your stomach and is digestible if you are a lactard. Wide variety of options, ranging from all ethnic cuisine.. . Food is colorful like a rainbow and that is what nutritionists and dieticians tell you! Fill your plate with 3/4 color and you will be healthier and lose weight.. . Down side- you pay a pretty penny for the healthiness, but you walk away feeling satisfied, not guilty and more informed about food options, and a little bit more daring to experiement in your own kitchen with vegan alternatives!
