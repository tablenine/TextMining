No one hurt me, but I had one of the guava cheese pastries tonight (Boyfriend's Aunt gave me 6 of 'em to take home) and I found them to be tooo sweet &amp; I have one helluva sweet tooth. I have yet to try anything else from here and I'm pretty anxious to since I'm always passing Porto's when on my way to Bob Hope, but its always packed ! We'll see. I want to try their Cuban Sandwiches. . . (I at least gave it a 4 star review for now so I don't unfairly curb the overall rating of this place - - I just had to say something about how crazily sweet the guava cheese pastries were)
