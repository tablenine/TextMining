Loved the atmosphere, people watching and cocktails.... the food was just ok.  Calamari and spinach were excellent.  but i was disappointed with my tacos- maybe if i request some salsa next time that will give it the kick they need.  Server was great!  I think his name was Ryan.... . It seems like a really great place to have a group of friends together for apps, drinks and music.
