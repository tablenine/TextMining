Like many others, i learned of this place after seeing it on Man vs Food. Â Being a noodle lover and one that likes things hot, i was anxious to see how good this place would be. I got Miso #3 and was pleased but def not blown away by any means. #3 was just right in spicyness. not super spicy where it pinches and ruins the flavor but enough spice to leave a tingling sensation. I enjoy a rich deep broth and didnt find that here. Overall the ramen was good but didn't do anything for me other than satisfy my curiousity about the place.
