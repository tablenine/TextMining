Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
I love this place.  My girlfriend and I are addicted and probably go 2-3 times/week.  The food's great and while it might not be the healthiest in the world it definitely seems a lot better for you than most traditional fast food.  I'd love to see Veggie Grill expand to many more locations soon.. . The only reason I can't give five stars here is that VG hasn't published nutritional information yet.  I'm a little leery of places that don't do this...what do they have to hide?  I'd really love to see them do this, other than that I have nothing but great stuff to say about Veggie Grill.
