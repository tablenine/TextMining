Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Pops for Champagne is an answer to my prayers!! I love champagne but have yet to find the perfect champagne bar downtown until now.. . This bar welcomes all types of people and occasions. Not to mention the design and lighting really makes it comfortable and inviting. . . I stopped in for a glass of champagne with a friend of mine and can't wait to go back! The staff was friendly and helpful when deciding on what type of champagne to order.. . After we left we decided that this a great place to meet for a drink after work, a girl's night out or a perfect place to bring a date. This bar is what downtown Chicago needed!!
