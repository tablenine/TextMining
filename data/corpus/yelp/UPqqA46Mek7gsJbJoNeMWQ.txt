You will be my downfall.... . Uni Village Joy Yee might not have the same sardine ambiance of Chinatown Joy Yee... but this is good. You get a seat immediately (as opposed to being stuffed into the tiny entryway in Chinatown for 45+ minutes) and the service is prompt. They're especially good about topping up your water glass ...usually as soon as you've had one sip. . . The food is amazing, especially Korean Beef over Rice. Always get a drink too because they prove the existence of God. I like the Avocado Tapioca Ice Cream freeze. Sounds bizarre, tastes like heaven in a plastic stein. Also - this may seem like a small detail - but your place comes laid with both chopsticks AND a fork (so you don't have to feel embarrassed to ask for it yourself).. . The only thing I don't like about this Joy Yee is the strange chairs - I'm not really sure how to describe them besides "uncomfortable".
