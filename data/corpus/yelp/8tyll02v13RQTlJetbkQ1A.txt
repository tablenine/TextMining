I have to say that the food here is great: unique combinations of ingredients, different type of menu but with all the basics, nice little store.   There is something that annoys me about the total experience that takes away from the 5 star rating that is probably mostly a personal thing: something about the combo of the crowdedness (could barely move in my seat), the crowd (sudden appearance of a roomfull of young white married couples between 20-30 +/- kids, all looking pretty rich-like), the polished granola-ness of the look.   But who can slam good food.
