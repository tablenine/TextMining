Stumbled in here trying to find some late night dining options downtown. Holy crap batman! The brews are local, great, and tall. Deep dish? Decent I must say... Though not the best I've ever had. Crust was too crunchy. However, I am a big fan of the authentic divviness of this place.... Graffiti on the walls and all. Must come here again on my next trip to Chi Town
