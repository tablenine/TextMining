Don't mess with breakfast. It does not need to be 'new american'. There was nothing wrong with the old version. The grits here are a disgrace to all southerners (and I am one) to the point where I sent them back and had it removed from my bill which I never do. They consisted of actual pieces of yellow corn that one should use to make cream corn soup with, not breakfast grits. Grits are made from ground white hominy. Period. Pancakes here are dry disks of dough that demand the heavy distracting toppings offered. Service on the patio is at a snail's pace. I don't care if its 'farm fresh' or 'local organic' or any other trendy menu moniker....my friend and I left here hungry and annoyed at what is supposed to be the most satisfying meal of the day in my opinion. Â I'll take Vivian's or Jinky's or Lulu's Cafe for breakfast anyday.....
