Food is pretty good, though during our last visit my fiancee was served up a bowl of lukewarm salmon bisque which was pretty disappointing. This is an "order at the counter and busser brings yer food out to you" establishment, so there was no waiter to come by and say, "How is everything?," to which Bronwyn B. could have replied, "Not so great, dude. My bisque is cold." The prices also tend to make my wallet ache. That combined with the stress-inducing, jam-packed weekend crowd make this less than an ideal brunch spot.
