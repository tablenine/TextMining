Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I keep dragging people here, and then they start dragging people too.  The avocado bruschetta is my new favorite thing! . .  I love the wide array of sandwiches and sides so that anyone can find something they like.  Their servers are, in my experience, awesome.  They are generally pretty attentive and willing to answer lots of questions (I'm vegetarian and have food allergies, so I appreciate this A LOT).  Most of them seem to actually know their food and the beer they serve, which is a nice change.  I've been to too many places with large beer menus where the servers have no idea what they're selling. . . Overall, love it.
