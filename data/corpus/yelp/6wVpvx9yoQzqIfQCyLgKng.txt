I LOVE Tank.  Full disclosure, I'm a strict vegetarian so only get the veggie rolls but they have several to choose from and they are all delicious.  My favorite is the veggie tempura but make sure they know if you want it veg; I think normally it includes fish eggs or something similar.  Other plusses are the drink specials Monday and Tuesday nights, half-price rolls at lunch time, WONDERFUL appetizers (try the chopstick rolls; I can't get enough of them), great cocktail selection and a relaxed atmosphere.  I don't mind the techno as much as others seem to, I think it suits the decor.  Outdoor seating is great on a nice day and they also have a couple of private booth areas that are great for a group.  Service in my experience has been friendly and attentive.  Overall, one of my favorite places in the neighborhood and a regular destination.
