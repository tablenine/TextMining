Seriously, there's not another place on this planet that I can think of to go when I want to watch a Thai Elvis sing.  Seriously, this Thai dude does a good rendition of all of Elvis Presley's songs.  It's pretty loud, though, so be warned.  A big bonus is that the Thai food is all pretty good and reasonably priced. The dishes are huge to boot.  A very good place to go with a huge crowd!
