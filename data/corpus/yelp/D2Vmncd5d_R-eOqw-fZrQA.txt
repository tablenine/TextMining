This is like one of those too good to be true places...except after pinching myself, I did realize that it was real and it was THAT GOOD! Had the pleasure of stuffing myself silly twice here.  Really fresh sushi, it could practically swim off your plate...  . . Always crowded and booming, may be a bit of a wait depending on when you go, but you'll def. leave a happy camper!
