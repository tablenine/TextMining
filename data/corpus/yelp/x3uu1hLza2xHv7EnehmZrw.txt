Great homemade ice cream! Fun flavors, great consistency and very fair price for a quality handmade product. The people behind the counter were also very friendly and rather than give me attitude when wanting to sample nearly every flavor, they actually encouraged it!! . . Though I've never eaten the food they offer here it seems to be a little on the over priced side, probably done to help combat the high price for rent on Beverly and as an attempt to be more diversified than an ice cream shop.. . All and all great experience, fun place to end the night after catching a movie at The Grove.
