I have been to SIMB many times and have had food at their catered affairs and have always been impressed.  I am pretty hard to please when it comes to food, and SIMB has never let me down.  My favorite is the Challah French Toast full of big, beautiful berries...and the coffee, of course!  I loved the tomato &amp; goat cheese soup, too.  I have enjoyed the sandwiches and salads I've had as they are unique and inspired.  The building and the decor are quite stylish and make for a great atmosphere for brunching.  It's definitely one of my favorite places to go, and I don't even live in Atlanta!
