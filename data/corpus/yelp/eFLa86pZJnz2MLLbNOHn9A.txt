For meat lovers , this is the place to go. Brazilian style steak house aka Rodizio. Great quality of meat from fillet Mignon to lamb chops, from rare meat to well done , the meat just keeps on coming to your table as long as you have the roundel in the green side. The side dishes are also incredible, many different type of salads and cold cuts a long with Brazilian special dishes and Â  cheese bread. You must try them!!!!!!!!!!. AAAHHH i can't forget, they have a great wine list you will noticed as soon as you walk in. When you go there you ll understand what i mean.. Price: + - $70,00 per person, so go there with an empty stomach and take advantage of the great food they have.
