Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I believe the direction and concept that The Best Fish Tacos in Ensenada (TBFTiE) is great one. Talk about what you serve and specialize in it. You also create conversation as to who has the best Fish Tacos. You could argue that Ricky's Fish Tacos, Wahoo's, or Taco's Baja might have the best Fish Tacos, but TBFTiE makes the claim as "The Best". Also, the menu items at TBFTiE are simple - you can either get fish tacos or shrimp tacos. Bottom line, claim what you do best and make it simple!. . This little restaurant or shack in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles make pretty good fish and shrimp tacos. The deep fried batter, which is made to order and fried in front of you, is light and crisp. As you bite into the taco's you can taste the shrimp and fish without the batter overpowering it. You can add the different salsas and sauces to increase the spiciness or sourness. On an empty stomach, I could easily power down 3 or 4 or 5 of these little treats.. . Nice little place, but as for the claim - I believe it is quite comparable to Taco's Baja in East Los Angeles - see my post. I still need to try Ricky's, which I understand is just a cart and is close to the Los Feliz area.
