Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The burger and sweet potato fries are good. From what I recollect, I had a fathers office burger from the Santa Monica location a few years back and their burgers were made with a different type of beef.  That burger was the best I had ever had.  The burger I had today, while still good, really shouldn't be $13.   I'll definately come back to try some of their amazing beer selections.
