Once upon a Tuesday, three colleagues walk out of their office with smiles on their faces. Why? Because it's just before 5 o'clock (and their office normally closes at 6), it's a Tuesday, and they're calling it a day. Not only that, but they don't plan on coming back until the following Monday.  Awesome.. The colleagues, who are also friends, decide that there's nothing they'd rather do with their suddenly free time than sit outside on this beautiful (both in spirit and in disposition) evening, sip cold refreshing drinks, and nibble on tasty food to happily make the transition from hectic work day to lazy long holiday weekend. . 15 minutes or so later the friends find themselves seated in the spacious Cooper 35 garden, digging into a plate full of salt and peppered edamame. Their tentative this-is-to-good-to-be-true smiles grow into goofy grins. shortly there after, the aforementioned cold drinks have arrived. sweet lycheetini. strong whiskey sour. huuuge and limey mojito. ooooh. ahhhh. appetizers are ordered and shared. 2nd rounds follow. pina colada swilled with pomegranate juice? weird, but delicious.  giddiness begins to set in. the garden has been filling with similarly chipper people--good spirits seem to shelter the crowd from the traffic and construction that surround this oddly positioned oasis. . eventually, the friends decide to call it a night (even though the sun still shines--yay summer!) and painlessly pay their $21 each (3 drinks each + 3 appetizers + 2 plates full of edamame). a wonderfully good time is had by all, and each vows to come back. and often.. the end.
