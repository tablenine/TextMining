Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
This is my absolute favorite restaurant.  I am very much a meat and potatoes kind of girl, so Mastro's is a dream come true.  I've been to the Beverly Hills location a couple times, as well as Mastro's Ocean Club, and both are delicious.  Perfect bone in filet - best steak I've ever had.  Every single side dish is amazing.  My favorites are Mastro's mashed potatoes, the mac &amp; cheese, and the onion rings (huge!).  I celebrated my 23rd birthday here with a group of friends, and though they weren't ready by the reservation time, the staff compensated by treating our group to some extra cocktails, as well as followed up the meal with the largest dessert platter I have ever seen (literally, I could barely hold it with two hands).  They even gave us a private room in the back, so their service made up for the fact we had to wait an extra hour.  I now live in SF, but make sure to visit my favorite restaurant when I'm back in LA.
