This place is amazing! I love mom &amp; pop shops and this is living history! This is my first visit to this historical la landmark. . . I had to go downtown early in the morning and was looking for a place that served breakfast. Thanks to yelp and Marc d's review, I found this place. . . As many have known and have written, the atmoshpere is a time capsule from the 1920's - flat tables to sit multiple customers, booths, candy stand, walk up service, and many locals eNkoyingveach others company. There are many reviews on the wall that describes their history. . . I had the beef French dip and a glass of lemonade for breakfast !! The bread was soft, the beef very tender and the au juice a little salty - just the way I like it. As many know, the lemonade is fresh squeezed and real!. . I will be back to try the other menue items. . Thanks yelpers for this execellent find!!. . Oh yeah - cash only. A 9 minute walk from Union Station and there is about ten - fifteen spaces in the back for parking.
