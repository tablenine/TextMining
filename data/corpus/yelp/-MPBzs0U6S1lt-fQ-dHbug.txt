OK Food . Everything on the menu is cooked well and every dish is garnished accordingly (I don't think you can mess that up). . OK Staff. Friendly, personable but no service here.  You want it get it yourself!. You do not feel rushed or pressured to pay and leave, but it's because nobody come around at all.. . Great Price. most sandwiches on the menu are under $10.00 and the portions are OK!. Find myself going at least couple of more times, if I'm in the area.. I ordered  the roast beef sandwich for lunch with two big sides !. Coleslaw and Potato Salad.  The apple pie was ok, but the chocolate cream pie was like eating a hot chocolate with extra whip cream! A+. I will go back couple of more times to try the pork and lamb sandwich.. Double dip please!!. . Accessibility. Big parking lot  hope I don't have to parked on streets.
