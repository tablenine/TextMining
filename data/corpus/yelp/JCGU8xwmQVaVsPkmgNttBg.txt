Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Din Tai Fung's soup dumplings (or xiao long bao) are SOOO delicious that I will make the 45 minute drive up to Arcadia JUST to visit DTF. And if I'm even close to the area (say, Pasadena) then DTF is a must!. . The XLB have incredibly thin skins, which means more juiciness - never a bad thing! I also recommend the spicy beef noodle soup, it's some of the best I've had outside of Taiwan.. . Don't wear super nice clothes here because if you're like me, when you bite eagerly into a tender XLB it sprays soup all over the place, including yourself. Maybe I'm just a messy eater.... . The servers time the service at DTF (when you sit down, and when you get all your dishes) which is awesome, because although you sometimes have to wait awhile, at least you'll get served very speedily.. . Overall, 5 stars! I LOVE this place for its consistency in flavor and preparation (I've never been disappointed, and all the dishes are always high quality).. . P.S.: The menu never changes here, unlike DTF's in Asia, which is the only negative. But there's enough selection that you'll be satisfied for sure!
