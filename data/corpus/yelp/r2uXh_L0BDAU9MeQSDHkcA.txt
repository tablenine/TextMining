My Pinot Grigio was unremarkable but my meal at Craft was interesting, starting with no bread plate and bread that tasted like anise.. . Then we tried fried veal sweetbreads, which tasted like The South.. . We ordered the $34 prix fixe lunch.  My diminutive baby beet, avocado Valencia orange salad was pretty and tasted okay.  The John Dory fish with summer vegetable ragoût was light and delicious.  Dessert - a berry tart with lime sorbet - was the best part of that meal.. . Last time I instead ordered the burger, and I think it was a good call.  My companions seemed jealous!  The burger tasted a little unusual, but it was satisfying.
