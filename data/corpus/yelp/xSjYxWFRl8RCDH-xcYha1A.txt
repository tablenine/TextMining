My favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The Fessenjan chicken with pomegranate sauce and dill rice is delightful.  The hummus is great. The White Fish Persian Style was also quite good.  Huge servings just the prices.  . . The dining room can get quite hot on a warm day.  We were seated in an adjacent section on the left and the seats were literally hot.  That being said, the atmosphere is usually nice.  The service and delivery are fast as well.
