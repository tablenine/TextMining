Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Joan's on Third's cupcakes are a heavenly delight. I had the carrot cupcake, coconut chocolate cupcake, and vanilla coconut cake. All of the cupcakes were moist and baked to perfection - the frosting can be too sweet for some. Though the coconut frosting was decadent and reminded me of cloudy delights, the cream cheese frosting was painfully sweet, so much so, that my teeth clattered upon first bite. . . I do want to try their sandwiches the next time I visit!
