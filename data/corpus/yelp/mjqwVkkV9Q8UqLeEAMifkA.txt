Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Cant' go wrong with this place. Unless you have high cholesterol that is. The fried chicken/ waffle combo is a strange thought but just tastes so right. The sweet syrup mixing with the seasoned chicken is is the perfect hangover cure.. . I usually get the tried and true Carol C Special - chicken breast and waffle combo. simple and straight forward. I've heard the gravy is the stuff of legend by friends, but haven't tried it yet. (next on the list) . . Go early to get a good seat. It gets busy with lines as you expect with a cornerstone of cuisine in this city.
