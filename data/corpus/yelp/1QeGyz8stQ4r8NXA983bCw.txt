I don't give 5 stars often but this place really deserves it. Everything about this place is fantastic. The decor is so stylish - elegant and modern - very sleek. (loved the light fixtures in the dining room.) Our server was super nice, helpful with the suggestions and very friendly. Plus, the food was perfectly timed, which is always a bonus.. . The place has great wine list - we had a delicious Malbec. Unfortunately I didn't try any cocktails, but will have to remember for next time. We started with the lamb flatbread - so delicious. Bf had ordered the bacon flatbread previously and said that was also very good. The flatbreads are a great appetizer - perfect for sharing and not too filling. . . For the main course, I ordered cobia, which I had never heard of before. It reminded me of swordfish, and it was delicious. The sauce it came with was a perfect compliment - it had squash and little pieces of sausage. So unbelievably good. Bf had pork chop which was ginormous and really tasty.. . For dessert I had the chai creme brulee (very nice) and bf had this peanut butter chocolate thing - which was amazing. Seriously one of the best deserts I can remember - I was jealous I didn't order it for myself! But it was all good because the creme brulee was great, too. . . But the icing on the cake (and the reason it's a 5 star) was their tea selection. I cannot say how disappointing it is when you go to a fine dining restaurant, order tea, and they bring you a selection of Lipton teas. It's like, really? And it's 7 bucks. Not so at Sepia. They serve loose leaf tea AND bring them out in small glass bottles so you can smell them. Really nice touch, and I'm shocked more restaurants don't do the same.
