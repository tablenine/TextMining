Restaurant: Brazzaz
Category: Steakhouses
Me and My Wife visited this over-rated eatery. I was so full of great expectations but we were rally disappointed with the food. The service was "OK" we felt a bit rushed ... . I have been a chef myself and I think the quality of food used is really low quality for the price and pizzaz of the place. the salad bar was the most Â unhealthiest and cheapest Salad bar I have seen in my life.. . I have not been to Texas de Brazil or Foga de Chao.. I hope people deciding should serously not consider Brazzaz,. . Best of Luck.
