A lot of people really don't get this place. Think of it as a bar that happens to serve food. But the beer is the best selection this city has with the most knowledgeable bartenders anywhere. And the food? Quality and inventiveness like this should be nowhere near a bar. This is not a cheap night out but you're getting more than Miller and buffalo wings. Okay, there is a line and it's long. It's not their fault the place is popular and it's much better than just letting everyone squeeze in. Plus, we wait in pretty long lines at In-N-Out as well. People who go here know the rules and that's how it is. For all that trouble, they get the latest Craftsman and the tastiest duck confit salad anywhere. Where else can you satisfy those cravings?
