In the last month and a half I have eaten here for dinner and brunch. . . Brunch...wonderful.  Delicious mimosas and bloody mary's.  I had the breakfast burrito and it was really well made.  The ingredients were all very fresh and everything had a delicious flavor.. . Dinner, was also wonderful.  I had the black bass, which was on special.  It was sooo good.  It melted in my mouth like butter.  It was served upon spicy mashed potatoes and served with grilled fruit and veggies flavored with fresh lime.  My mom had the snapper, which was very good and was a large portion.  Allen had the new your strip, which was flavored and cooked to perfection.  Very good.. . Our waitress on Saturday night was so sweet.  She served us a complimentary dessert because Allen and I are getting married in a few weeks and my mom and I had been shopping that day in preparation.  She gave us empanadas with ice cream...we literally ate them in under a minute.  They were very good.  If we could have we might have fought over who got to lick the plate!. . Good wine list. Great outdoor seating with great people watching.  . . This is my reliable bet for this neighborhood...I will definitely be back.
