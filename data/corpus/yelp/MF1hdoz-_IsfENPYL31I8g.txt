So I had my B-day dinner here this weekend and man did I get the champagne alright :) The quality of the meat isn't what it used to be but for a huge party, the price of food, and the loud atmosphere, it's still great! The service was great and they were quick to respond to all our needs. This is the place for large groups and decent all you can eat buffet. I would do it again and bring an extra shirt :)
