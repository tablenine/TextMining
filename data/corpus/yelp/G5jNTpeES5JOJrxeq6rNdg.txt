I stopped by while meeting a friend who works selling some sort of fancy denim at one of the super fancies on Michigan Ave.. . I was starving...that said...I admittedly wasn't really paying attention to the price per pound at the salad bar place in the corner. I can't even explain the sticker shock I got when they rung up my salad and soda. . . I am a pretty pulled together lady...but I did mutter out loud " Holy Shit...$25 dollar salad Ah Yo!" and looked at the cashier with a sort of shock and genuine humor...She must already had her soul sucked out by Midwestern tourist children because she just seemed confused. . . I wanted to shake her and say "This is funny because there is no way these noodles and ranch are worth $20. But, I still have to pay for it. Funny!". . Instead I just wandered off and ate my $20 noodles and ranch dressing in my shame alone by the elevators. They tasted like $5 noodles and ranch...
