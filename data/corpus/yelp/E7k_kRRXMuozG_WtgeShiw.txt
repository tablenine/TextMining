I've been eating here since I was about 10. 18 years later it's still a fave and the go to place for my birthday cake every year! . . A must have for meat eaters are the potato balls. Next I would have to recommend one of the many mousse cakes. From chocolate to mango. At least give one a taste. The guava pastries are a close 3rd on the list of things to nom. . . They also have a fantastic selection of sandwiches. Some are meaty and others are veggie friendly. Nothing is vegan friendly, that I know of.
