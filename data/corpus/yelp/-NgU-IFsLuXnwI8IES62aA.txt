I first head about this place many years ago through my sister, when she was talking about another ramen place 3 doors down. . "When the wait is too long @ Daikokuya, people go here.". When I asked her about Daikokuya, she said it's the best bowl of ramen in the greater LA area. I have to emphatically agree.. Their ramen is very old school with very little variation. No curry cutlet or fish ball ramen here, just an old school bowl of ramen that you can order with extra "flavor" or regular. (I'll return to the "flavor" later.) . This particular visit was special, because I decided to try the kotteri ramen for the first time. This extra flavoring in the ramen is achieved by adding the back fat from the pork. It sounds odd, but it definitely added that savory kick that seems to be missing from every other bowl of ramen I've ever had. Also had their deep fried spicy tuna wrapped in shiso leaf and tempura battered. It was all good and for relatively little money. . The only detracting factor was the almost interminable wait. Do not come here already starving, as the wait is usually around an hour during meal times, longer on the weekends. However, if you keep this fact in mind, you should have a great time.
