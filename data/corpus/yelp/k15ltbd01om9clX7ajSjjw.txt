Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I don't think Orochon is not good anymore.  The broth is heavily MSG'ed or powdered and it is really salty.  The noodles are all bent out of shape because they're kind of hard and taste like they've just been opened out of the package.  Sorry, I'm a little harsh, but I'm serious about my ramen!
