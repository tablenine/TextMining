I came here a couple weeks ago around 1pm on a week day and thought I got lucky because we were seated right away.. . We were approached immediately with the menu but then we had to wait and wait before anyone came back. Â It was not that busy so I could not understand why the servers seemed to run around but do nothing at the same time.. . Most of the food was above my expectations but a couple items were a disappointment.
