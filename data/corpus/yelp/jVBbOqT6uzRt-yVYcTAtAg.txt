oh lord almighty. this place had me up all night long yacking my brains out. I got the veggie burrito with cheese and while it tasted alright at the time, 1 hour later i was married to the toilet for 15 hours. . . i give it one star because the waitress was nice. not an enjoyable experience post-devouring of the burrito. beware!
