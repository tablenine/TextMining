Amazing food. to say the least. It has all the qualities of the no frills style and attitude that all authentic japanese sushi places should have. The fish is incredibly fresh and well prepared. The daily specials list seems to be actually longer than the menu itself and the inconvenient sized classroom style white board its written on gets pulled from table to table every 10 minutes while bumping into surrounding objects and people along the way. The service is lackluster but I wouldn't expect anything less. The price is great for what you get. If I lived closer, I'd frequent this place all the time. I haven't been to it's more loud and fashionable younger brother in Hollywood but I hear the quality is better here.
