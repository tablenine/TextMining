A little piece of heaven!  If Anthropologie opened a food store, this would be it.  I think this is my favorite food boutique in LA.  A lot of effort was put into the adorable, mostly white, vintage decor.  Has three sections; gourmet food store, bakery, and deli.  So far I've only had several items from the bakery, which were all absolutely delicious, and I'm very picky about baked goods and desserts.  Wondered how they managed to make everything taste so impossibly good!  High-quality ingredients?  Lots of sugar?  Plan to try their panini on my next visit.  Employees are always very nice and attentive.. . Update: Yep, the panini are yummy too!
