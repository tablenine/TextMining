So, I went here a little over a month ago. I had heard from a few friends that it was a good place to eat. I am vegetarian, and sometimes when I am presented with so many options, I get overwhelmed. There were quite a few menu items for vegetarians.  I went with pasta; it had some plum tomato sauce. I was slightly disappointed in the lack of flavor. Some of the items I wanted to go with had some spice factor, and I'm a wimp when it comes to spice. The portions were too large. The dessert was good, though.  I would give it another try before I rule them out entirely.
