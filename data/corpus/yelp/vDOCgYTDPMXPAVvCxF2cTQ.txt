Why do people like this place so much?   Are they hypnotized by the weird faux texture painted walls?  The unlimited bread???. . This was my second try at RA and honestly, there is much better Italian to be had in the city for the money.    Everything on their menu seemed just a bit too creative and complicated and when it arrived at the table it was nothing special.  Oh and why does everything have pine nuts in it???  It seemed most of the pasta dishes were meatless which prompted speculations of their using foods with a longer shelf life.   Also, below average service: no one came by and asked our table of five how our food was and I think we saw our waiter three times the whole evening.. . On the plus side, it's cheap and sort of romantic.  But for better food I prefer Mia, Pizza Doc or Topo.
