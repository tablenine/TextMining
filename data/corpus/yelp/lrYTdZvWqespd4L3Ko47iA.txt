I apparently live under a rock.. . Yeah, I know about Ted Turner and that he used to own CNN, TBS, Sports Teams, blah-blah-blah. I even remembered that he and Jane Fonda were divorced. So far, so good.. . But, the fact that he is the largest private landowner in America, owning over 2 million acres with over 50,000 head of Bison--well, that completely eluded me. And, he owns a restaurant chain with 50 locations.. . So--here I am. And I'm very pleased. Bison is the theme here (Hell--if I raised 50 thousand of them, I'd sell 'em too!) Other reviewers have done a good job describing the decor and I'm never good noticing that, so I'll talk about the food.. . The waiter, Christian, was very helpful. When he found that two of us had never been to the restaurant, he brought us a small cup sampling the bison pot roast with garlic mashed potatoes. It was quite good. I was quite stunned at the "recession-buster" dinner specials. For $15, I had a cup of soup (A very flavorful and spicy chicken and sausage gumbo), bison meatloaf with garlic mashed potatatoes, and a snickerdoodle cookie.. . All quite good. The only trouble was that I had to hear a couple of conservatives moan about how biased CNN is. Â I told them that as far as I knew, Rupert Murdoch doesn't know crap about raising Bison or running a restaurant business...
