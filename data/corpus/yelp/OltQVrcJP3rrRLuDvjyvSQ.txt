comme ca..comme OH YAH!  yup..i love this place.  food..wine..decor..service.  check, check, check and check.. . SC was playing oregon and i wanted duck, so a reservation was made for last friday evening and we went the distance.  to start we ordered the marrow, half dozen oysters and french onion soup.  it was my first encounter with marrow.  my first thought..."where have you been all my life?"  i love foie but i might now love marrow more.  mmmmmm.  the oysters were also uber fresh and the spoonful of soup that i had was bueno.  . . as for my entree i of course went with the duck confit which was served with slightly pickled cabbage and spatzle.  the duck was prepared perfectly as were the accoutrements.  about half-way through i actually had to submit but i was crying on the inside thinking of all the beautiful food i was wasting.  so much so that i powered through and eventually left only a few bites.  :P  others in my party nibbled on the special dry-aged steak , friday special (whole roasted fish-la mer) and mac&amp;cheese.  all tremendous.. . are we done yet?  not quite but after the brioche pudding and ice cream we were.  chocolatey ooey gooey goodness.  put a fork in me..i am decadently done!. . my only gripe that was our party of 3 was seated at a table that would fit 2 comfortably but was a stretch for the 3 of us once our dishes started arriving.  perhaps they didn't anticipate us ordering like we hadn't eaten in weeks.  but it was a busy friday night so i could understand why they'd put us there rather than a 4 seater....sooo after some thought (and that marrow) i let it go.. . p.s. many of the other reviews talk about how loud it is...i didn't notice.  we were at a table near the back and even with a full house it was not unbearable or too much.  i quite enjoyed.
