I really dig this place. It's a no nonesense establishment that's been in LA forever. There are two free parking lots nearby (gottaluv free parking). And the sandwiches are delicious! I've never had a french dip sandwich before, but the meat was fresh and the mustard really clears your sinuses. Whooooa! . . The relaxed vibe and the ladies behind the counter though are fantastic. You go up to the counter to order. I love how it's old school. . . My boy was shocked that all he had to do was take me to a place like this to make me happy. Maybe I ain't into all that fancy shiiiiite after all, because on a saturday afternoon this place really made my day for lunch. . . We got the turkey and beef sandwiches, macoroni salad, and pickles. Mmm pickles. The sandwiches are medium-sized. I was still hungry after one, but then, I loooove food. . . And there's sawdust something on the floor, whatever is up with that...I don't know. All I do know is that the place was packed. . . Reasonable prices. Each sandwich is around 5 dollars and change. . . I'm definitely going back. Yum!
