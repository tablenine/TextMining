Hands down the best French dip. They advertise as the place that originated French dip and I kind of believe them. So good. Try their chili with the French dip. YUMMM! . The decor is old-school cafeteria style and you order at the counter. It is like a time machine journey walking in their. I LOVE it! It definitely adds to the experience.
