The service is not fast. The staff are not polite. The food is excellent. I got engaged here. And I see Rodney on the Roq fairly frequently. I've come here after the bars closed and stayed until 6 in the morning. Â You have to have the matzo ball soup. I also recommend the Reuben, and the egg salad. The hummus is pretty good as well.
