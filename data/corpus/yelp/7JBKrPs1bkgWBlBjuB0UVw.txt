Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
Sometimes I think I have a slight problem: I have a tendency to give restaurants second and third chances when my friends seem to love the place. I did this for a cafe back in Santa Cruz, California and I did this for Joy Yee.. . I came here for a total of three times. The first time I came here, I ordered some kind of pho. Meh, it was okay. The second time I came here, I don't remember what I ordered except that it was a Japanese dish but it was just as mediocre (hence the reason why I don't remember the dish). The third time I came here, I ordered some kind of Korean dish plus a mango smoothie. The mango smoothie was the only thing I liked -- I find it hard for anyone to mess up on real fruit smoothie. . . Yes, their prices are affordable. But is it really worth it? Not really. I enjoy good food, and well, this place has not done it for me. If I revisit the restaurant, I'd order a smoothie and that's it.
