This place has great deserts but the food in my experience is just ok .  The coffee is perfectly strong and the waitstaff is very nice and, of course, good music can be heard playing most of the time.  I usually go to Handlebar or Thai Lagoon which are also around this area but this place is a convenient place to go to if you are going to a show at the Empty Bottle (obviously).
