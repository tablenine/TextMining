Category: Italian
Garlic, Garlic and more.......Garlic, what more is there to say?  BTW go here if you are a garlic fan (haha).  The restaurant sets up a nice atmosphere right away when you walk inside.  I came here on a Wednesday evening and much to my surprise it wasn't very busy.  The service was great as well as the food. The intimate tables behind the bar area separated from the restaurant is a nice touch.  I would recommend a request to sit there if on a date.  Chow. PS  For a party of 2, if you both order an appetizer, entrées, and 2 drinks (no wine or hard) plan on spending anywhere from $20-45 a person  (The reason for this amount of difference is because they have steak, etc on the menu thats around $28.00 while on the other hand they still serve a entree portion BBQ Chicken Pizza for under $10.00.  I don't know if that's helpful but I find it nice when restaurants have a nice range of price.
