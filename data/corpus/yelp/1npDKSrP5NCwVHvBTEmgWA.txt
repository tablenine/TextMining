Had brunch with the girls today and we ordered the bottomless bubbly, mac and cheese, crab cakes benedict, penne, grilled cheese with tomato sauce and breakfast panini... bread pudding to top of the meal. . . The mac and cheese was ok for the first few bites but after that, the saltiness and a slight chemical after taste started to kick in... definitely far from Morton's $5 Mac and Cheese. . Crab cake benedict was over cooked and over priced, dry and tasted fishy... which tells you that the freshness was not all there.. . Grilled cheese was lighter than expected but nothing extra ordinary, same for the breakfast panini and penne.. . The bread pudding was okay, the best part was the vanilla bean gelato but the dessert was not plated well. Â There was far too much bread, not enough gelato or pudding.. . However, people like trendy spots because of celebrity sightings... today's celebrity sighting was Vivica Fox, enjoying patio seating and a the company iof a couple of good friends.
