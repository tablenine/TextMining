Fish tacos, and everything else we had, were fantastic.  My husband and I had dinner here after trompsing around the cemetery for a few hours, and it was exactly what we needed.  There were families, couples, groups of friends, and individuals all sitting in the same restaurant, all having pleasant meals.  We actually went back the next day on our way to the airport to pick up take-away dinner, which was also awesome.
