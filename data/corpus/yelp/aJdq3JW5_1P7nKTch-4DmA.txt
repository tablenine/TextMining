Super pricey, but super delicious!  Just awesome all around.  The staff was so friendly and very friendly.  The GF and I ate in the Side Bar last night instead of waiting for a table.  The place was filled when we arrived as was the bar area.  After a few minutes a table in the bar opened up so we grabbed it and moments later a waitress set us all up for the meat extravaganza that was about to ensue.  . . We had drinks (generous pours on the wine and vodka with a splash of club soda) first, then ordered up a feast.  The bread (4 different kinds) was so delicious, we stuck with the pretzel rolls and onion focaccia and couldn't resist that lavender and thyme dusted butter.  So yummy.  Then the first courses arrived: Bone Marrow Flan and the Tuna Tare Tare.  Both each were 5 star dishes alone.  The Bone Marrow Flan was delicious with a spreadable mushroom (almost like a tapanade) to go with it on toasted brioche that made the whole thing just melt in your mouth.  The tuna dish had just the right amount of wasabi already infused and it was just divine. . . Then we ordered the 35 day dry aged Rib Eye.  The meat was so tender, besides being drizzled in butter, melted in your mouth (I know I just used this modifier, but hey it did).  Then we weren't wowed by the sides but the brussel sprouts were the best part, and I don't even like em.  The little sprouts came with bacon and pearl onions, just a great combination.  The potato tart tartin had the right idea, but just wasn't the best and lacked flavor a bit.  The creamed spinach without the egg was just fair.  . . But over all, it was a great meal.  A great special occasion meal.  A fun bar to watch people in as well.  The clientèle were certainly not bad looking at all.
