If you're in the mood for a glass of cold water...this is the place to go! Anything beyond that...not so much. . . When the first words from the hostess' mouth are "there's a two hour time limit on the patio tables," you know the new hire customer service training was neglected. Needless to say we left with 1 hour and forty minutes remaining.. The delta is how long we waited to be recognized by a waiter...who by my count there were four within 20 feet at any given time. . . Hey hostess...when I'm sitting 6 feet directly in front of you and you've noticed no one has waited on our table...time to do something other than talk to your wait staff friends.. . Wait staff. I get you can be busy sometimes (didn't appear to be so), regardless, all it would have taken was a 5 second, "I'm sorry, I'll be with you in a moment.". . Once the timer [Oh yeah, we use a timer (thank you Android apps] went off and we got up to leave, and the waitress miraculously appeared, that's the time to do something to save the moment...she seemed totally clueless. . . Finally, we rode our bikes (no bike stand I saw) and spent a few minutes unlocking them and getting ready to go, again only a few feet from the hostess stand/front door...again another opportunity to try and salvage the event....not even an attempt.. . We didn't make a scene or act out, just got up and quietly handed the menus back to the waitress as she approached and left. It's not my job to give on the job training. That said, Market, you better get some quick because not matter how much lipstick (or silicone) you put on a pic....it's still a pig.
