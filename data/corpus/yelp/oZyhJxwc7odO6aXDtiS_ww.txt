Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
How dare you hate on Palms Thai?! . . The heavily-cologned valet guys aside, this place is fantastic. Yes, Thai Elvis is kitschy, but he's really pretty cool if you think about how intrepid he is about performing for his public all these years. The waitresses are all very cute and friendly --- and patient (I ask a lot of questions and make very bad jokes when I come here --- probably b/c I am usually giddy with delight whenever we come to this place). The new space gives me enough of a comfort zone so that I don't have to press up against the hipster-doofuses who also like this place. And finally the food is not only flavorful and served quickly, it's also very affordable. . . My friends and I always order the Jerky Beef (which is not on the menu) served with tangy and veddy, veddy spicy sauce, and ultra-sticky/dry white rice -- make sure to wash your stanky mitts since you eat this with your hands by (a) break off a piece of the beefy, (b) break off a tablespoon size of sticky rice; then (c) dip it into the spicy sauce. . . Then (being the voracious omnivores we are) try two other things on the menu (the last time it was boar meat --- kinda redundant, I know, since we already had the jerky beef). Then, to quench our thirsts, Tsingtao beer (so light and refreshing to cool the fire)!. . In short, you're wrong if you don't like Palms Thai. Four stars!. . The end.
