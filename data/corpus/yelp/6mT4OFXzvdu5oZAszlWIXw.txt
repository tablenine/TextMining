After about an hour of waiting for our table, I leaned over to my baby and said, "if this place is not spectacular, there is no way I'm coming back!". . Well, it wasn't spectacular, but it was pretty damn good. Aside from the spicy king crab legs and the fried shrimp w/ cajun fries, I must say that I really enjoyed the gumbo. Â I could tell that it wouldn't appeal to everyone, but I liked the layers of complex flavors in the thick soup and the abundance of shrimp and sausage.. . The service was excellent as well.. . So yea, to make a long story short, in the words of our famous governator......"I'll be back!"
