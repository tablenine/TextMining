Just had lunch there with a friend today. We split a couple of dishes and they were both delicious! We had the halibut fish tacos with sweet potato fries and the uncommon breakfast melt with home fries. I preferred the fish tacos - they were really good (and I'd like to say that I'm a fish taco connoisseur!).  The fish is lightly battered and served on corn tortillas (you get 3 tacos) with a jicama slaw and a tasty ranchlike sauce with a kick.  I like the fact that they added a slice avocado on top - nice touch.  OMG - the sweet potato fries were amazing! The best I've tasted! The breakfast melt was good too, although common, pretty much an open-faced breakfast sandwich - over-easy egg, bacon, spinach, and cheese (although I really couldn't taste it) over toasted black bread. The potatoes it came with were alright, again kinda just tasted ordinary. . . Good atmosphere. Service was nice and attentive. Can't wait to go back and try out other dishes that I was also eyeing, like the Uncommon BLT (instead of bacon, they use pork belly - yummm), a couple other sandwiches, and salads. Definitely getting the sweet potato fries again for sure!  . . Oh, I was able to use my "a la card" $10 discount so it made the meal a better value!
