Restaurant: Los Nopales
Category: Mexican
I have actually been going to Los Nopales for quite some time and  figured it was time to give my opinion.  The consistency of this place amazes me.  I think the skirt steak is next to none, but have had several different entrees and they have all been great.  I would not hesitate to order anything off the menu.  If you go on the weekend, there is usually an average wait of about 45 minutes, but truly worth the wait.
