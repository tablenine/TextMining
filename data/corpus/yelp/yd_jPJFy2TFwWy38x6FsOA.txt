Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
cash only.. . moody burger, medium, american cheese, white russian, and a pitcher of berghoff dark. sloppy joe, white russian, and a pitcher of dark. onion rings, basket of fries, white russian, and a pitcher of dark. mixed drinks are consistenly well-poured, and they also have a pretty good pitcher of sangria, if you're into that kind of thing. . . cash only.. . on sweltering summer evenings, moody's beer garden is the perfect place to kick back and cool off under swaying, patio tree leaves. cold winter nights are warmed by two fireplaces in the most dungeons and dragons pub this side of hobbiton.. . cash only.. . a neighborhood haunt reflecting the diversity of edgewater: families, singles, old, young, white, black, yellow, brown, hetero, homo, home, visitor, after-school, after-work, and despite the mass of tables, relatively private. plus, they got a parking lot. . . cash only.. . if you're cta-bound, it's conveniently located on broadway, a block west of the red line thorndale stop. just keep in mind if you're getting loaded into the wee hours and gotta catch the train, it's not a good idea to walk that block with your head in the clouds- act like you know where you are and where you're going (even if you don't), cuz the overflow of got-nothing-better-to-do kids from the winthrop-kenmore corridor, just east of the train, can still be pretty elemental. but it's best to watch your back anywhere you go, i don't care if it's in the middle of a south of france vineyard. just some friendly advice.. . and sorry, cash only.
