Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
As I recently quoted, "Only the best restaurant ever!"  Beware, once you go Mastro's you'll never feel the same about another steakhouse again.  I've frequented many steakhouses from coast to coast but this one definitely takes the cake.  For the love of god even their bread basket rocks my world (an assortment that includes warm pretzel bread)!  Don't miss out on the mouthwatering bone-in-filet and the amazing side dishes. The Gorgonzola Mac-N-Cheese, Au Gratin Lyonnaise Potatoes (sides of heaven), and everything and anything else you have ever dreamt of.  Save room for Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake with a huge slab of whipped cream on the side for dipping.  I'm salivating just thinking about this place...mmmmm.
