The ramen here is delicious!!!!  i love their broth..make sure when you order ask for strong broth....its so good.  the staffs were very friendly...they open and close the door for you...which is very nice.  they are also very helpful...when you ask them for suggestions.  also their agedashi tofu was very good too :)
