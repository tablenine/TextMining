Restaurant: The Original Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Best coffee in town!. I've never had a server there whom I didn't immediately want to stuff in my pocket and keep with me forever! The waitstaff is beyond charming!. Yummy pancakes but, their bacon is a little too thick for me. However, that's my personal problem. . A great breakfast treat.
