Ridiculously good + super accessible fine dining (read: non-pretentious). . I had always strayed away from this place because I thought it was stupid expensive, but its really not (especially when you have places around the corner charging you just as much for crappy food and disguising it as casual dining.)  I actually eat here about twice a month now.. . If you see anything on the menu with banana and miso - GET IT.  Same thing with the foie gras gyoyza topped with beef carpaccio.  I actually have dreams about these things.  Skip the sushi - there are way better things on the menu that require your attention (like the skatewing or the scallop).. . Sometimes I hit the bar before going out in the area because the drinks are just as inventive as the food.  (think Violet Hour minus having to wait outside for an hour like a dbag).  Plus you can order off the bar menu and do small plates and share if you're with a bunch of people.... . Mondays their drink menu is only $7 and you can order things like Mexican Cock Fight - which is just plain fun to say.  :)
