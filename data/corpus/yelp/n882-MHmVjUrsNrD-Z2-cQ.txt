I've decided to bump my rating up to a full 5 stars. Where else in Atlanta can you see a first run movie for $5*?! Â That alone makes up for any issues I might have with the place, which are actually quite few. . . I've been a dozen or so times since my first review, and must say I still don't like the chairs. They are just a notch above cheap office chairs. I don't typically order entrees from the menu, and I really don't think its that big of a deal that they serve alcohol. . . But $5 movies make Fork &amp; Screen a winner in my book. I can buy a couple cokes and some popcorn with what I save on admission to the theater at Phipps just a few blocks away. . . Parking is validated by the staff but if you see a movie and it lets out after like 8 or 9pm, the parking attendant has left, and you can leave the parking lot for free. Just be careful you use the right exit... if you use the exit on the 2nd floor of the parking garage you have to pay... don't ask me who designed the garage like that, its really ridiculous, but that's Tower Place's fault, not Buckhead Backlot's.. . (* Admission is $5 ANYTIME Monday-Thursday, and Friday-Sunday before 4pm. It's $10 otherwise.)
