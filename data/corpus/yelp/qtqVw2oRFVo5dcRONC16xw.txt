Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I wanted to give this place three stars, but despite the disappointment of Thai Elvis (who I'd have been wanting to see for a long time now), I have to one up this place... just because I met Thai Elvis.. . I don't particularly like Thai food, but I don't not like it either... if that makes any sense; I guess to keep it simple, I'm indifferent. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp, and got it spicy. And actually, it was really good. If it's anything that the Thai's can get me excited about, it's the spiciness of their food.. . This place is worth the drive, and for $2.50 to park, it stays within a budget. Just don't get hyped up for Thai Elvis like I did.
