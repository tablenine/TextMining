Great and not that pricey concept! We ordered bunch of salads for dinner for a late night at the office, and everyone was extremely satisfied with the quality and portions. Let's face it, anybody can make a "salad", but there is a huge difference between making it right and making it superb. Well, Tender Greens got it, it's superb. The best fresh ingredients, like butterhead lettuce, leafy spring mix greens, top it with tuna, beef, chicken or veggies, and just the right amount of amazing dressing! Plus the bread, oh, the bread, yes, slightly covered with olive of oil, goes perfect with the soup! Oh, did I mention the soup?? OMG, this was the best tomato soup I've ever eaten (at least in States). So fresh, so tomatoey, so basily, with olive of oil. Wow, this really tops the deal. For does who prefer more bread, they have sandwiches with the same goodness ingredients that are in salads..... Ah Tender Greens, you are truly tender and will be revisited again!
