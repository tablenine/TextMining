I love this restaurant.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting - good for meeting up with friends, but also suitable for a date.  I had the pollo afumicatto and it was absolutely wonderful. The pesto mashed potatoes are amazing!  They have a nice menu and what I consider to be perfectly reasonable prices for dinner in the city.  Parking was a bit of a challenge, although their website says they now have valet, which is a huge plus. I will definitely be back to try more of their great food.
