Restaurant: Hashiguchi Jr.
Category: Japanese
Most people refer to Japanese food as "sushi". While they're not wrong in saying that sushi is Japanese food, that's not all that Japanese cuisine has to offer. Hashiguchi Jr. seems to be doing their job at filling that void.. . They have an amazing menu, that even for me, growing up in San Francisco, where we have a "Japantown", seems to exceed any experience I have had before in this country. They always have a "specials" menu as well, further heightening the enjoyment of this place.. . Some personal favorites are: Kobu onigiri, Ton-kotsu Ramen, Tori-negi Yakitori (shioyaki), Sanma Shioyaki, Katsu-don, Mochi-Age (sometimes on the "specials" list)... The list here can go on and on... Oddly enough, none of what I mentioned above is sushi.
