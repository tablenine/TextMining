I had the burger here awhile back. My buddy the ultra-epicure Erik M endorsed the burger. J Gold endorsed the burger.. . Me? Gross. GROSS! limpy weeds, nappy sauce. 10 kinds of wrong with the bun. Maybe the weekend lunch crew in the kitchen was off that day. Most probably not. Still would rather have Bar Marmonts, 25 Degrees over this. . . Like Katherine W, I'm beyond done with this place. The crowd's douchey, the food not French, the burger, not quite American.
