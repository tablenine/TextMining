Went here for my surprise birthday and the food was great and cheap compare to other restaurants in Westwood.. What I like: Cheap, great food, nice setting, and 5-10 happy hour (1/2 off everything). What I did not like: Service was bleh and took a long time because it was really busy. And they have a B rating.
