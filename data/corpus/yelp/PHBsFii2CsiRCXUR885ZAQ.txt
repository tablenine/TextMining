Friggin delicious.  Two of my favorite foods, fried chicken and waffles, on one glorious plate.  Prepare to wait though, I've never had to wait less than 30-40 minutes each time I've come here.  The waffles here are gigantic and fluffy and come with a heaping pile of butter.  The fried chicken is crispy, not greasy, and moist in the inside.  When eaten together it is truly tear inducing.  They have other items on the menu besides fried chicken and waffles but I've never deviated from what makes this place world famous.. . For the standard 1/4 chicken and 2 waffles plate it comes out to around 12-13 dollars including tip.  Not a bargain but worth every penny imo.
