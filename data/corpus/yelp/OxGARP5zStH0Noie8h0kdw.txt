Really really good! Went here for breakfast on a Sunday-- managed to miss the brunch rush that seemed to start at 11. . . Everything was really tasty and the menu selection is great, I wanted to order 4 different things. I got the fruit plate instead of the potatoes and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and selection of the fruit. Not just melons and a few skimpy grapes, it had pineapple, berries, banana, melon, kiwi...really good! I had the California omelette which was really good. My friend had the special eggs benedict which he said was really good.. . Just an overall great breakfast place.
