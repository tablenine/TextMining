Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
It's been a while since I reviewed anything. So, here goes nothing.. . Butterfly is the sh*t. . The End.. . Fine... Sushi &amp; Thai ftw.  BYOB.  Good for a date cause it registers fancy, but pretty cheap.  Basil rice with chicken blew me the [expletive] out if the [expletive] water.  Sushi chefs are up front like a REAL sushi place... except they're all Mexican.  . Hey, it's Chicago all the cooks are Mexican, even for raw food, deal with it.. This might sound prejudicial but I feel comfortable when the wait staff seems to speak the language of where the food comes from.  I like the Brazilians at the churrasceria, and the nice Asian couple at Blue Willow Chinese restaurant.. I order take out at least once a month from B-Fly, and when I'm single or want to take my suburban friends to a hip place, I hit B-Fly.. . Butterfly is the sh*t.. The End.
