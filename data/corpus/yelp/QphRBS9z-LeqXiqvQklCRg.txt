Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
This place is quite exclusive and expensive but worth a try! You'll need a guest pass from a magician/member in order to enter. A guest pass can work for a group of people. The shows were amazing and entertaining. I like the close-ups where the magician perform their best tricks within 3 feet from you. All the performers were very talented. The cool part is that you'll be surrounded by magicians or comedians. Aspiring magicians often have a chance to learn tricks or tips in the hallways. Â There is a $20 entrance fee with the guest pass.. . As for FOOD: I had dinner at Magic Castle. IN MY STOMACH: House (complimentary) Bread, Lamb Racks w/baby squash and risotto, New York Steak w/mashed potato, Chicken and a Chili Bowl. . IN MY MIND: Expensive meal but quality food. I paid probably 30-40 dollars for Lamb Racks w/ baby squash and risotto. The prices are about the same for the Steak. The lamb racks were tender and juicy. It's definitely one of the best i've tried. The risotto was a little too salty, so if possible switch the risotto for mashed potatoes. The Chili bowl was delicious, it will amaze your palette. The house bread is okay, not too great. The Chicken is a little dry. Overall, this dinner is on the expensive side but quality is great. Servers wore penguin suits and were very friendly. . They offer Valet Parking for $8 so no parking problem. It's a Fun and Magical Experience but not a place to go everyday, perhaps once is suffice.
