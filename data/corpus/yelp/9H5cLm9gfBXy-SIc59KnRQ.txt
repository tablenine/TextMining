portos.  man.  so, so, so good.  the opera cake.  the chocolate cake who's name i don't remember.  the mouses.  the sandwiches.  the potato balls.  the dulche de leche latte over ice on a hot day.  the price is always right.  the lines, which can be daunting, move fast and everyone there is so nice and helpful, no matter how many times you mispronounce something.  one of my absolute must visits when i'm back in LA.
