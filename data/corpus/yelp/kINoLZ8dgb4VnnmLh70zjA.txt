Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
Been in love with Kogi since the first time Mr Pete n' I tried it. We have turned a few friends into addicts as well with plans to convert more. We will stand in pouring rain just to get their delicious short rib burritos and the Black Jack quesadilla along with the awesome Kogi dog.. . Remeber to try the creative and unique specials offered every week.. . The most memorable is still the Pac-Man. . . Also, anything they serve with SPAM. Salty and dericious.
