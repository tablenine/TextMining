It was okay.  Definitely not worth the $145.00....even if that total included a fancy martini and two glasses of wine.   No way.. . My husband had gone to Opera years ago and I had never been.  I'd been really excited about going and checking out their vegan menu.  I started off with the vegetable muushu which really was very good.  And for $8.00 is was a huge app.  I gave half of it to my husband.  He had some  tuna, salmon tar-tare something in a champagne flute which he seemed to enjoy.  Entrees.  He had a fish special w/ blood oranges and I had the stir fried rice noodles with a spicy coconut sauce and mushrooms.  It was tasty.  But honestly, it was nothing extraordinary and similar in quality to a dish I could get for $7.99 in any Chinatown establishment.   Dessert was good.  I tend to get ultra excited over vegan dessert options and the pana cota was definitely worth over stuffing myself for.. . I have to say though... we saw something a bit disturbing.  Each table has a round or square white paper "tablecloth" and we watched two members of the bussing staff cut around a table w/ a butter-knife and then leave that said butter-knife on the table for the next customers to eat with.... I'm sure the paper was clean and such, but who knows where the large rolls are stored?!  Just kinda set me off a bit.... . Our sever was very sweet.  But the timing in the kitchen was very off.  Apps. then about 45min later we received our entrees.  . . I'd like to try more of the vegan menu...so I might go back, but I'm not making any promises.
