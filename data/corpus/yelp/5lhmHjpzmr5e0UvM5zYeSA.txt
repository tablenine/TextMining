Do not go to Panes if you are on a low carb diet (who does that anymore anyway?) or are in a big hurry.  This place is usually pretty crowded and its NOT fast food, but it's crowded for a reason!  Trying the bread here is an absolute MUST.  There are a ton of reviews on here already, so I am going to try to keep it simple.  They have a great array of sandwiches and salads, mostly under $6.  Everyday they have a couple sandwich, salad and entre specials.  I have never had anything less than delicious here and I have never walked way unsatisfied.  Cash only, blah blah blah.  Just try it!
