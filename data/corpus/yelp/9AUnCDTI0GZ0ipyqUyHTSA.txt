Restaurant: Ruen Pair Restaurant
Category: Thai
I can't compliment Ruen Pair enough.  Their food is truly authentic, the service is super friendly, and the prices are freakin' fantastic!  It's definitely a no-frills kind of place.  My family and I have been coming here forever and although we love many other places, this place definitely stays up there on the top of the list.  Sure, parking's hard... but for this kind of food and these kind of prices, it's definitely worth the minor headache!
