Restaurant: Les Deux
Category: Lounges
I've accompanied friends many many times to Les Deux, Mood, Opera, and the rest of the Hollywood clubs.  It's possible to live the life of "The Hills" girls without any money -- no cover charge, drinks are free if you find a table of guys that find you attractive, and no one can tell the difference between a Marc Jacobs or H&amp;M/Forever21 or hand-stitched minidress.  But if you take away the celebs and TMZ camped outside Les Deux, all that's left is a club full of insecure douchebags wanting to see and be seen. People won't want anything to do with you unless you can advance their career.  . . I've never been in a room with that many good-looking people in my life, and the decor is beautiful and makes you feel exclusive.  I'm glad and grateful to have experienced it, but I'd take a gritty Irish bar with real people and real conversation over this anyday.
