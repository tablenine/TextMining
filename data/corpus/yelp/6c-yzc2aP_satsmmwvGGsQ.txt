There aren't many hot dogs I'm willing to eat, but this is one of them.  Man oh man, the char dogs are tasty.  I'm a big fan of "stuff" on hot dogs when I do eat them, too, and "stuff" might be good on these dogs, but they're also lip-smackingly good plain.  Delish fries as well.. . As for the staff, well...the fact that they get around to giving you exactly what you ordered in a pretty damn timely manner considering the crowds is impressive.  (During our visit tonight, a rather large tour group of French persons created a bit of havoc:  "I said, do you want SALT on your FRIES?"  but we got our food exactly as we ordered it, and in what I thought was a fine amount of time.)  . . There are other restaurants that might be more of a must-visit, but this would be on my week-long tourist to-do list.  Maybe not three-day, but week-long, for sure.
