Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Whenever I walk into The Pig I just want to curl up in the corner with a book...and take one of their yummy looking cookies or brownies with me.  The people behind the counter of this cozy cafe are always friendly and greet you with a smile.  I've enjoyed their East of Eden sandwich...the veggies are fresh and the bread doesn't get much softer than this.  . . Although their wireless Internet is not free they do have a wireless connection so it's the perfect spot to get some studying or other work done!
