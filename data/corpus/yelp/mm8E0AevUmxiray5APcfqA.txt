Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
When I first moved into the area, I went all the time--just because I didn't know any other area in LA.  But I haven't been in a while.. . First, very clean.  Exceptional for a Vietnamese restaurant.. . Second, efficient, though somewhat terse, service.. . Third, it's not inauthentic.. . Simple menus: phos and buns, and some appetizers, and that's about it.. . My favorite: #8, Pho with everything.. . Best appetizer: the omelet.. . Negatives: it does tend to get packed during lunch and dinner, but they have a take-out service.
