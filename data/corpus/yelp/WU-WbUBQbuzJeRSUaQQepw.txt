A friend took me here for Sunday Brunch, as we had made plans to go to Handle Bar but they had a huge line, so we drove off to Chicago Ave instead.  We see this cool place FLO, across the street and took off inside. Flo looks awesome from the window.  The service was very good. I really didn't care for the back room because it felt so closed off from the rest of world, (no ambiance or comfort).  They were busy so the host had no choice to give us the worst table the backroom, (the corner). The exposed brick was another issue in terms of design and layout, just feels so depressing. The menu was impressive and it appeared that once reading it we were going to be eating Latin infused breakfast, awesome. Our waiter was pretty great, simple laid back service, and he gave us great suggestions. We both ordered the "Chilaquiles": a breakfast classic of corn tortilla pieces in roasted tomato, poblano salsa w/ scrambled eggs and red onion, topped w/ pico de gallo, cheddar cheese, served w/black beans and 1 warm tortilla. It tasted awesome, and hit the spot perfectly however the dish was very wet,  just too much fluid going on 1 plate. It made the tortilla soggy and everything else soggy too. I would suggest putting less cheddar cheese as well and less whatever they cook with that makes you want to tily the entree w/a napkin before serving. For breakfast I want to feel energized and full not late night drunk taqueria full so def' order coffee so you won't feel so heavy. The artwork was cool just if your going to have a backroom with no windows or anything to make the room feel open then please decorate over that huge brick wall.
