It doesn't get any easier than this. We scored a parking space out front--free since it was Sunday night--walked up to the counter, and ordered a mezza plate and the grill sampler. Al had our mezza plate ready in 5 and shortly after that, the grill sampler came out. Yelp was spot on -- fantastic food! At the end of the meal, Al dropped by some baklava "shots" on the house. Sure fire way to win my heart any day.. . Oh, and if you're lucky or maybe unfortunate depending on how you look at it, Al will hand feed your husband a few bites from the mezza platter. He decided that my husband looked like a picky eater. Mwahaha.
