This bar really hasn't changed much in the last 15 years.  I good place to hang out and drink in the afternoon and late night.  Usually filled with lots of regulars fron the area.  Located in what arguably used to be the funkiest part of Atlanta "little five points"  or L5P.  Little five feels way more comercialized that it did in the original skin head infested 80's.  Still lots of freaks around though.
