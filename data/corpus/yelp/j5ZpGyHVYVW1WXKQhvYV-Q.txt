Based on yelp reviews, I expected a fantastic meal, but I was a bit disappointed.  We ordered:. . Eggs benedict with smoked salmon on a toasted croissant -- for the feast I expected, it was lacking flavor which seems impossible with the amount of butter and artery clogging ingredients in the dish.  . . Blu toast -- French toast layered with blackberry jam &amp; cream cheese,. topped with bananas and powdered sugar -- the server said it was amazing.  It unfortunately did not live up to the hype.  . . Everything was just okay -- I'm still searching for the best Eggs Benedict in L.A...
