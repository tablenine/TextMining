A friend and I went to celebrate her fabulous new job --- she was in the mood for steak so we decided to do it up right. And at Cut, they do it OH SO RIGHT.. . We started with the tuna tartare. It came with wasabi aioli and these crispy chips that were crunchy and delicious. I wanted to try the Kobe burgers too but passed...we're only 2 bantamweight gals. For the main event, we both had the filet of American Wagyu...half Japanese, half American. Everyone loves a hapa but this steak was truly sublime. It was tender and marbled, which I recently learned is one sign of great beef. Now that's equal opportunity dining.. . We paired it with some a la carte sauces and sides. I had the shallot red wine and my friend had the chimichurri. We also had the sauteed spinach and side of fries. All good but the steak still took center stage.. . The service is amazing and Wolfgang came out to greet all the tables throughout the evening. The space is beautiful -- clean, chic, and modern. You've also got your celebrities, Hollywood heavyweights and suits dining nearby. The best part are the cougars. These ladies are professionals.. . Dinner here will cost you a pretty penny -- bring your ole' pals the Benjamins or some trusty plastic.. . Valet through the hotel or park on the street during off-peak nights.
