Oh snap, this place is delish!! We had almost everything on the menu as we were lucky enough to fit in with a large party (while we weren't on the guaranteed list, just enough of those in front got tired of the 2+ hour wait). I've never felt happier getting my hands dirty and throwing shells around the table. Oh so good!
