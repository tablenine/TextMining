By far one of the finest sandwich shops in So-Cal, the good news is Portos has some of the tastiest, most reasonably-priced sandwiches around.  Lots of meat combos, one helluva veggie/eggplant sandwich, and you can mix and match your bread (but the plain old Cuban bread is my fave).  The bad news is that you'll have to park a mile away from the place, because the main street out front--which also happens to be the main street through Glendale--is perpetually blocked off due to construction.  Oh, and yes, the lines can get pretty bad, so be sure to pull a ticket from the ticket-roll near the doors in the waiting area.  But--here's a secret--if you want to skip the wait, and you truly can live without the potato balls, the chorizo pies, the fried ham sticks, and their gorgeous pastries (no, really, they're gorgeous), you can actually just walk right up to the register and order just your sandwich and drink.  But let's be serious; you're at a great Cuban bakery; you might as well wait in line for the tasty appetizers and desserts; they're easily as redeeming as the sandwiches themselves.  All in all, it's one of the best sandwich joints around.  Last I heard, they were opening another one in Burbank on Magnolia.
