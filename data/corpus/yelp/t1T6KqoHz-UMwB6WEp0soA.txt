I came here last nite with my 3 angels.[Sound like charlie angels.!!]. Anyway, we had a good time eating and the food was amazing.. The service, well as expected, and the bottle of Bordeaux red wine made it for pleasant.. . The buffet was filled with lots of goodies and they have my favorites.. At the time of pying the bills, it was wonderful, the price was not what I was epxected, but far better for me as I only paid for 3 diner instead of 4.. What a deal a free diner, because it was my beautiful personality that plays in it.. . I will definitely go back, and I know I slept very well after such a nice feast.. YEA...
