OMG!! I Love Canoe! This was my second visit in 3 days! My boyfriend and I dined here to celebrate my 26th bday and it was absolutely phenomenal. Our server, Lindsay, was awesome. Never once did we have to look for her or seek her out..she was on the money!! The servers at this place really are unbelievable. They don't stalk you, nor or they overbearing...but they are right there when you need them to be. They even come by and wipe the crumbs off or your table with a neat little sweeper before your dessert comes!!!. . The food at Canoe is ridiculously incredible! My guy and I chose the yelp 3 course pre fixe menu for only $25...hey, why not save a buck or two when you can?? You cannot beat the value, especially at a place as nice as this one...I had the watermelon salad, shrimp fettuccine, and the chocolate peanut butter bar for dessert. I have two words to describe the cuisine...SIMPLY DECADENT! . . This place will be one where we come to celebrate special occasions. It's soooo amazing...we don't want to over do it. My guy and I have dubbed Canoe to be our favorite restaurant in the city...and that's saying a whole lot because I am one serious foodie...and sometimes he's choosy when it comes to his likes and dislikes but hands down Canoe takes the cake by a looooong shot! Oh and BTW, the ambiance of the outside patio along will have you coming back for more!
