I love this place for lunch.  It's exactly what you want on most days - a good sandwich and a variety of soups to choose from, all good and all very flavorful.  They have good prices and great quality.  It's so good, I don't even care that it's cramped on most days and that you may have to give a dirty look to someone who is obviously done eating but chooses to linger in order to snag a table.  Really, I don't mind.  Just wish it was in a more convenient location.
