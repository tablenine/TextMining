I've been here twice and both times I visited, I had to wait AT LEAST half an hour. Thus I would not recommend this place anyone wanting a quick round of ramen in J-town. When I came here, I always ordered the combo. It's the best offer when you wait that long to be seated. Also it is a bang for the value (Ramen, small salad with their secret mayo dressing, and a choice of which ever side you order). . . So people mention this is the best ramen house in Los Angeles and I agree. The secret to their success I think is the berkshire pork they use to flavor the broth. The fat saturates the broth and it leaves a lovely taste. This place gets my vote as the BEST RAMEN HOUSE IN LA. . . The reason for four stars is quite simple once you have been here. THE WAIT. Due to small limited seating, It's the busiest ramen house in LA. I don't enjoy waiting that long for something that only takes 10 minutes to complete my meal.
