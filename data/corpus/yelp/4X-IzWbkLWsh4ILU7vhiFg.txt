Soft and tender chunks of boneless and skinless chicken make the Savoy Kitchen's Hainan Chicken the best I've had in the past 15 years.  The Hainan Chicken comes with delicious rice (lightly flavored with Chicken Broth) and three perfect dipping sauces (spicy, soy, and garlic). I almost ordered seconds because the combination was so amazing.. . My wife went with the Seafood Pasta with Scallops and Octopus.  She liked it a lot, but did seem to keep adding pepper and/or salt to bring out more flavor.. . For an appetizer, we tried #8 which is escargot (land snails) that was surprisingly delicious without being overly flavored to get the "ickiness" out of the snail taste. I'd definitely get it again although I hope to try the Shrimp Rolls which many other tables were sharing.. . We got lucky at 9:00 on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait at all.. . The only thing I didn't really get was the "smell" of the Pizza Bread. I still don't know how to describe it.  It was unique, but I ate 4-5 pieces anyways.. . Finally, the prices are extremely reasonable.  The Hainan Chicken with White Meat is only $6.75 while dark meat is an extra $2.. . After a disappointing Yelp-experience earlier in the day, Savoy Kitchen restored my faith in Yelp by leading to such amazing Hainan Chicken. Can't wait to come back.
