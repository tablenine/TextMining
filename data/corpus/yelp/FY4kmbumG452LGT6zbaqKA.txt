Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
I have been to Ian's a handful of times and have been fortunate enough to sample their ridiculous array of pizzas.  Even after all of those visits, and a greater number of slices, I don't think that I have repeated a type of pizza yet.  Their gyro pizza, mac and cheese slice, bbq chicken pizza, pesto-tomato pie, plain cheese pizza, and chicken parm slice have all been quite good.  I have no real complaints because I have never been dissatisfied.  Yet, perhaps the pizza artists at Ian's could concoct more pizzas with traditional pizza sauce.  Out of all of their pizzas that I have tried, the only one that had regular sauce was the cheese pizza.  Maybe I have been ignorant of such pies, but if they had more pizzas with traditional pizza sauce I would boost their rating from 4 to 5 stars.  Until that time, and I hope it comes soon, 4 stars it is for Ian's.
