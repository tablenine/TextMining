Bakeshop is a pretty nice chill place during the day, especially for breakfast. It's got a great outdoor patio with very nice scenery around and a fountain of water that just brings more peace to the scenery. . . That aside, I've come here a couple times for breakfast and have really enjoyed my meal. It's basically an upscale eatery and cafe, as a friend put it, and that is reflected upon the food and decor. I've had the breakfast egg sandwich with bacon, and it is pretty freakin good and satisfying. You walk up and order in the a line in front of the baked goods, and they bring your order to you with a smile whether you're outside or inside.. . Last time, I was pretty hungry so I got a huge cookie while I was waiting. Seriously, huge; it was larger in diameter than the Â sandwich! It also tasted pretty great for having been in a jar, being hard enough for a cookie at room temperature but not stale or hard.. . Overall, this is a great little place in a good location, and the positive attitude of the staff towards customers is definitely a plus.
