Restaurant: Caf√© Agora
Category: Turkish
I am in Buckhead on business for the week and was checking out Yelp for a place to eat. I came across Cafe Agora and had to try it based on the reviews. It was a bit of a hike from my hotel, but well worth it. Al was very friendly and wanted me to try everything. He brought out the Maza platter and started feeding me from it. Can't say I've ever experienced that before, but I didn't mind, it just adds to the eccentricity of the place.. . Everything that can be said about the food already has. I was not disappointed and will definitely be making a return trip before I leave.
