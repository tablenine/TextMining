For the prices this places charges, it'd better be freakin awesome... which it was :). . I had a glass of syrah which was just the right balance of tannin, fruity, smoky.  grilled sweetbread came in a slighly sweet oniony emulsion and all the veg used in all their dishes were so fresh!  I'm pretty sure they were all locally procured.  Some of the servers seemed a bit pretentious to me, but I guess that's part of their job.. . We rolled in w/o reservations on a Saturday night, so we didn't get to sit in the dining room, but we were promptly seated outside and when they overheard us talking about being a little chilly, they promptly brought out the heatlamp :)
