I went awhile ago but I now have some more prespective having had some really nice steaks in the interim.. . I had the U.S.D.A. PRIME, Nebraska Corn Fed, Dry Aged 35 Days New York Sirloin 14 oz.  It was good but a rather forgettable steak.  The large head shots of Spencer and Heidi also probably did not help the digestion.. . For the cost, it just wasn't worth it.
