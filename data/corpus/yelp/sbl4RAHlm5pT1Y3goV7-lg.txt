This little piggy had previously been to Market for dinner but wanted to return to see if the later party scene was any better.  I think one of the World's Most Interesting Man's pithy tenets is a fitting answer: "No." . . My previous dining experience here was a big time let down.  I should have heeded the Yelp reviews and never gone.  I figured the night scene couldn't be quite as bad as my dining experience here.  Well, shame on me for being fooled twice.. . I think I asked in my original review what this place was trying to be.  It still doesn't know.  Like a certain political leader, It tries to be all things to all people.  I wouldn't be surprised if they tried a Beer Summit night here - and then canceled it without notice (see previous review).. . Later at night, Market turns into something attempting to resemble a club.  That means dance music blaring at absurd levels even though there's no dance floor.  That means people doing show and tell acts.  Pubs not clubs, people.   . . In general, the dress code here for later at night is slovenly for guys and dresses for ladies.  Just so you know.. . The crowd here post-midnight was mostly 20-somethings, with some 30-somethings and a few 40-somethings sprinkled in.  Glad I look young.  I was expecting more of a Tavern on Rush vibe.  That wasn't the case.. . I think this little piggy will stick to the old stand by, West End, and avoid coming back to Market.  Someone seriously needs to take charge of this place and pull it out of its identity crisis.  Market is just simply trying too hard and overshooting its target.
