Good and definitely a great addition to the north end of the Lincoln Ave. strip.. . Great presentation and overall ambiance.  However, I dislike how close the tables are.  And at night, it can seem a bit dim to some.. . Decent selection of rolls, however I thought they were a tad bit overpriced.  I would prob. come more so during the half price periods.. . Server was extremely attentive at first, but again, like others, if you tell them you need another minute, you really do need to flag them down to get further service.
