As much as I love living in the Valley, I miss a few things about the West Side, and Versailles is one of them. (Don't even mention the Versailles at Universal Citywalk because I will just laugh in your face).. . I have never ordered anything on the menu except the roast pork (#1). It's the perfect meal. Chicken?! If I want chicken, I'll go to Roscoe's.. . The meat is so tender, moist and succulent, the perfect combination of tangy and savory flavors, that it would be reason enough to love Versailles. But it's only one part of a finely balanced composition that includes rice, black beans, onions and plaintains... when you get all these elements together on your plate, it's gastronomic nirvana.. . Word to the wise: Don't go for dinner on the weekends unless you want to wait in a long line for a table.
