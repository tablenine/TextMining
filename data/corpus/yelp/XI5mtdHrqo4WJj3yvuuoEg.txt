Restaurant: MF Sushibar
Category: Sushi Bars
If you like to overpay for bad service and overpriced sushi, you must then go to MF Sushibar. After sitting at our table for over 15 minutes without a server, our waiter decided to make an entrance.  It not only took him 1 hours to get us our appetizers, but I had to tell my waiter two times about my sake order.  We had to make eye contact with our waiter and remind him that to get our sushi entree.  What startles me is that the restaurant wasn't even busy.  The sushi chefs butchered my salmon roll with too much wasabi.  I can take wasabi but this was a big lump of wasabi in my roll.  I had to spit it out, because it.  Other pieces of my salmon roll did not have wasabi.. . Stay away from this place!
