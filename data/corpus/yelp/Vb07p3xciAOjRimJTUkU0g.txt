Ok, I'm going to start off a bit cynical here, so, I'm sorry, but I think this has to be said so all the "too cool for school" server kids in this world can get a clue.. Here goes....You're sole reason for doing what you do is to get something, then put it on a table... That's it. You're not a record producer or film director that can make or break, you just pick things up, then put them down. I waited tables for years and still do at times, I always knew that's what I did. I never had an attitude problem about it. . Now, some people at The Righteous Room need to start understanding that. In the past the service was perpetually terrible. Now, after some time, I'm a regular to some degree and they are awesome. Tim... wicked cool guy. Heather... wicked cool chick. Don't get me wrong, I still have never talked to these people, but I think they know my face now to the extent as to where I don't have to wait forever anymore.. The crowd in this place is great Sunday through Thursday, then the suburban kids come in to flood Urban Outfitters next door and the scene gets a bit ruined on weekends. But other than that, it's great people watching, the drinks are always strong and the beer is always cold. And for some strange reason there is always something on the tv that I'm interested in. I don't get it.. Go to this place for an after work drink and you won't regret it.. The food is good too!
