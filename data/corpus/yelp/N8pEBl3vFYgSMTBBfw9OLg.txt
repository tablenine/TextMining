I have been to this restaurant 3 times now and I may be a little less impressed each time I go-the food gets worse but the service improves, and my dates definately have gotten progressively better as well:). . The first time I went there for dinner, ordered several drinks and courses and apparantly they called last call-and failed to tell us.  So at maybe 10:01pm we had to switch to water because the bartender wasn't making any more drinks.  Mind you we were at a table, NOT the bar.  Whatever.. . Went again a few months later.  Good, not great.  Scallops and Polenta was good-albeit garlicky.. . Third time was last week.  Server was phenomonal.  Some tall guy with glasses and a lot to say about each dish which I totally appreciated.  The sad part....the chef has changed-I heard the old one left Opera for a suburban country club.  The new one served my 3  scallops on a pile of freaking corn.  Seriously??  So dissapointed.  I was craving that truffle polenta and to be served corn instead? Totally killed it.  Real imaginative.  Boyfriend had some awesome noodle and shrimp dish.  Yum.. Not in a hurry to go back but would try in another few months to see if the new Chef has improved.
