Restaurant: The Varsity
Category: Fast Food
A local person from Atlanta (an Atlantan?) told me that you go to the Varsity for the experience, not for the food. That is certainly true.. . I had a chili dog, a chili burger, onion rings, and a frosted orange. The onion rings were teh highlight of the meal -- it was a huge portion, adequately battered and fried, and extremely delicious. The frosted orange was also good - tasted like a creamsicle. The burger and hot dog, on the other hand, had a lot to be desired. They were extremely greasy and reminded me of food that I could get from a school cafeteria. . . Of course, I do enjoy my share of greasy food, but that's usually reserved for a late night food run. I went to the Varsity for dinner, and it really didn't feel like an appropriate meal to me.. . So, you should certainly stop by the Varsity whenever you're in Atlanta -- just be sure it's after a long night of reveling.
