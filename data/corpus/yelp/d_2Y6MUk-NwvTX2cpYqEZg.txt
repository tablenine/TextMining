Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
First off the Service there was wonderful. I mean the Waiters there were almost too nice! the food was really good. I had the Stuffed Pizza and was pleasantly surprised. it's not the best deep dish pizza I have ever had but it was still really good. my dad had one of there Micro brews and thought it was really good. I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant though some might find it really irritable. overall an excellent experience.
