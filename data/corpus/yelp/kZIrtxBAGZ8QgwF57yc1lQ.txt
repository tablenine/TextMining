The original is the best :) Even though it's not in the original building any more, this location rocks! I can't wait til it gets warm again so I can hang out on the rooftop bar. The service &amp; parking situation here is way better than the midtown location too.. . We recently visited when we got on the interstate the wrong way after a Falcons game. We thought, hey let's stop at Six Feet Under since we're over here anyway. Well lo &amp; behold, because we had been to the Falcons game, we each got 50% off our entree. Amazing! They give you this discount for Hawks &amp; Thrashers too.. . I got the crab boil - 3 or 4 clusters of snow crab, potato, corn for $9.50. I would have paid full price for it though, it was sooo good! Sweet and perfectly cooked. I also adored the sweet tea. Another of our party got the shrimp boil, and he had to have had at least a pound of shrimp on his plate, each one delicious. Their cocktail sauce is reeeeally tasty too. My sister tried the surf &amp; turf and the filet was huge and also perfectly cooked. Her only complaint was the "surf" half was a skewer of shrimp that was only ok.
