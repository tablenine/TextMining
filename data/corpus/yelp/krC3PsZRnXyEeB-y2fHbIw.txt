The have a wonderful selection of pre-made food. But that's just what it is. Pre-made. It's definitely good for pre-made food...but I'd rather get something elsewhere. I gave it the extra star cuz of their grilled vegetables. That was pretty good. But the space is really small and cramped and the staff not so nice. But as it's mostly a take-out togo kinda place, so I guess I shouldn't be expecting too much.
