Im so used to going to the crowded Chinatown Joy Yee or Evanston, its nice to find one that actually seems like it has ROOM. I didnt have to wait either. Yay.. . My personal favorite is the Malaysian Seafood bake that comes in the log thingy. Im still trying to find out whats in that sauce.... . As with all Joy Yee's, Â portions are good for big eaters, and everything is tasty tasty. . . The chairs here are kind of narrow though.My gf is a size XS and even she mentioned they were small and uncomfortable. So wide people beware!. . Its located on the busy University Village Halsted strip so parking might suck at certain times of the day.. . I really like this place.
