Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
I went to Ping Pong last week after hearing great things from a few friends about the food. My expectations were high when we got there.. . We started with the crab rangoon and edamame which were both delicious. The edamame seemed like it was infused with salt, so the flavor was great! The crab rangoon was a little heavy on the cream cheese, but I loved it.. . We started running into problems when the main dishes arrived. All four of our dishes had chicken [green curry, sesame chicken, pad thai, and red curry]. Except for the green curry, all of the chicken was a bit dry. Both of the currys were good, but were very simple and didn't have much to them. . . I don't think we would have been as disappointed if the food wasn't so expensive. For what you get, it was not really worth the money. Overall, the food was just OK and was much too expensive for what you get.
