Fabulous.  Absolutely one of the best restaurants in LA.  You cant order anything bad.  . . Went last nite for my second visit.  I had the poussin, kinda random, but still delicious.  My mom had the short ribs with Indian spices; this was fantastic.  Dad has the American Kobe.  Not a big steak person, but this was absolutely delicious.  Crisp on the outside, pink, juicy and bursting with flavor no the inside.. . Starters:  beet salad.  It looks like multi colored jewels.. . Sides:  mushrooms, onion rings, brussel sprouts.  Onion rings thin and crispy; brussel sprouts prob my fave.  Pick out the pork belly chunks though.  Too fatty.. . Dessert:  caramel apple crisp.  HUGE.. . I'll be back again... when I'm not paying!  Great special occasion restaurant, not romantic though.  Also, its not as "clubby boys club" as other steak houses are.  It's mostly couples or groups of people.
