Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
Sometimes you just want a ridiculously good (and absurdly priced) piece of meat.  After living here for almost three years, and not having been to a steakhouse, I decided to fix that on my birthday.  Let me say, David Burke's dry-aged 20 oz. bone-in "Southside" filet met, nay, exceeded all my expectations.  It was perfectly tender, flavorful, and suprisingly slightly marbleized.  It was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  . . The service was attentive and knowledgeable, without being overbearing.   The popovers were sinfully delicious, the table-side caesar exquisite.  The only real miss was the side of mac and cheese, which was bland and uninspired.  However, the rest of the meal more than made up for it.  . . But that steak... wow - that's why I'll be back to Burke's!
