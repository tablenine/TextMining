Every time I'm in Chicago, I look forward to going to Wow Bao. I'd give 5 stars if everything was good, but I only like the Thai curry buns and the coconut custard.... they're delish! I did enjoy the pomegranate ginger ale also. The other flavors are only ok. I brought home to Cali, 4 boxes of the Thai curry buns... I would have brought back more, but they were out of the coconut custard... rats. Oh well.
