It's okay. I mean it's good, but sometimes it's not so good.. . It's a cool spot to come with your friends and eat, drink and smoke cigs. But, the food isn't the greatest.. I've definitely had better. The atmosphere is lively and fun. The food is good, not great. I've had better chimichurri, but theirs is standard. . . I'd recommend if you've been shopping on Melrose and need a spot to drink and get your smoke on.
