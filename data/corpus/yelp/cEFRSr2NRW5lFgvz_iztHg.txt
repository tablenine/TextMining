Spicy togarashi burger with a $2 PBR is what I'm missing right now! . I like Rodan for it's ability to cater to different people. The decor has a more upscale, yuppie feel but the food and drinks are all across the board. Â So basically you can eat and drink well and affordably, while hanging out in a modern setting. There's nothing wrong with that?
