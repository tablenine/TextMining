Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I eat at Pink's Hot Dogs about once a month. . . Sometimes the wait can be up to 2 and a half hours. I would avoid going during the weekend or in the evening. I think its perfect for lunch - shorter wait plus you have more time to digest the thousands of calories per serving. In addition, parking is horrible and annoying during peak hours.. . I would recommend the polishes. Also, if you want cheese, you should ask for the nacho cheese to avoid the cheese singles slices.. . My personal favorites are: Ozzy Dog, Planet Hollywood Dog, Today Show (aka The View) Dog, Nacho cheese chili fries. . Oh, almost forgot. It's cash only. So remember to bring cash because theres no ATM on site. If you need an ATM, you have to run to the bank across the street.
