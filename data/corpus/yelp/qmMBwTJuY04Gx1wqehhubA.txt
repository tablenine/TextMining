This is only a brunch review!. . If you are looking for an impulse brunch and don't want to wait, COME HERE.   . . 12:45 on a Sunday during a bears game, and my friends and I were able to get a table of 5 immediately.  I love the rustic interior, and in the summer, this place is probably the bomb (HUGE OUTDOOR PATIO).  . . I got the chilaquiles--huge portion, not overly expensive, especially because I brought home extras. Oh, and they were AMAZING. Everyone had a bite and agreed.  We also split the chocolate brioche french toast amongst ourselves--it was not too sweet, and really a nice sweet offering for brunch.  . . I'd love to try their bloody mary, it looked great, i just didn't have room. My brother had the hot toddy (he drank it quick; must've been good).  Any place that has a hot toddy on the menu for winter = good in my book.
