Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
My visit hre started with WAY too long of a wait, so that got us off to on a bad note, but then the food finally arrived and it was very good.  . . The ham was a little bland on one pizza, and the fennel that my bf got was ... interesting.  But the salads and chicken were really quite good.. . I have to give it only 3 stars bc it really was just too over the top in ambiance and someone else here described the service as smug and I would have to agree, not warm and helpful which what you really appreciate.  It was more an atmosphere of "aren't you lucky to be here" which yes the food was good but I like a restaurant where they are happy to have you and not the other way around :)
