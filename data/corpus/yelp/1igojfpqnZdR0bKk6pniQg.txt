Came here on a Wednesday night not too long ago &amp; sat at the bar. I had the Jidori chicken with mashed potatos. The food was great, but the bartender, Ray, really made my experience stand out. He made me a special drink &amp; I had a lot of fun. The bar lay out itself could be a little more organized.
