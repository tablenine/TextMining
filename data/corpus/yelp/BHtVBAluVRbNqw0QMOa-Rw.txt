Category: Dim Sum
This place has the best dim sum in Chicago and is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chicago.  The owner is always very friendly, welcoming, and accommodating to special order requests.. . I have been to all the better restaurants in Chinatown and this place is hands down my favorite.  It is a little pricier than the other options in Chinatown, but I think the ~25% premium is worth it: higher quality ingredients, better service, cleaner tableware, and very clean by Chinatown standards rest rooms.. . Some of my favorites here are: Peking duck, stir fried fish fillet slices on top of a deep fried fish, any of their tofu dishes.
