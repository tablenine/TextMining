Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
We laughed when we first saw the name, after all we are not in Ensenada...but man is it good! The shrimp tacos are so soft and fresh and delicious!. . And the hot guacamole is incredible. There is a whole salsa bar of different flavors all full of yumminess.. . 5 bucks for two shrimp tacos and a huge horchata....so so good.
