Good prices, good atmosphere, quick service and the long line goes fast.. . Order:. 1) Potato Balls (less than a dollar each). 2) Cheese Rolls (less than a dollar each). 3) Any sandwich with Pork and the Cuban Bread (I ordered the Pan con Lechon--$4.99). . This place is definitely worth the trip.. . Some drawbacks include:. 1) Proximal parking might be hard to find. 2) Not in the nicest area. If these were not true, then this place is definitely a 5.
