My first attempt at ramen was at Mitsuwa market and it left me with a feeling of never wanting to try the flavorless, boring meal again. So naturally when the idea of eating ramen came up, I was hesitant to try, much less pay $9 for something that wouldn't taste as good as shinramen. When the bowl of ramen came, I hesitantly picked up my chopsticks and spoon and went at it. The broth was warm, flavorful, meaty, fatty and so inviting while the noodles have a chewy, al dente style texture that are surprisingly flavorful on their own. As I was eating it, I couldn't believe this was ramen. Where has this been all my life? In between "mmmm" and "this is so good," the pieces of pork and the perfectly marinated egg started to disappear from my bowl. Daikokuya lives up to their reputation. Well worth the 1+ hour wait if your stomach doesn't beat you up first.
