Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Do you ever go to a place where you know everything is good, but you can't help yourself and always order the same thing? That's Joan's on 3rd's tuna sandwich for me. . . "Best Tuna Sandwich in LA!" - me. . I quote me so it's more legit. But seriously I love that sandwich. I've had many things there, we us them to cater various parties for us, highly recommend their catering! Always great, and make us look good when people see and taste the food. . . My tip for the weekend, park on Beverly (seriously) and walk there since parking at peak times is nay impossible on 3rd.
