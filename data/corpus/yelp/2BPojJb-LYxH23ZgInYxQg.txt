Restaurant: La CrÃªperie
Category: French
There are two things I have been raised to love: the Cubs and La Creperie. My parents have been going there since before they were married (over 30 years) and still continue to go. I love living less than a 5 minute walk away now but can't help but wonder if my parents really want to see me or are looking for an excuse to dine here.. . One item I am sure never to pass up is their French onion soup. I am yet to find a French onion soup I like as much, even after living in Quebec for 4 years. The brunch crepes....amazing. The savory crepes....amazing (I either get the ratatouille with goat cheese or the creamed spinach). The sweet crepes....out of this world! Now, most of my friends have been hesitant when I say this but after always admit that I was right. Go with the straight up chocolate not nutella. Trust me, you'll thank me later.. . The atmosphere inside is charming but if the weather is nice, I always opt for the outdoor patio. . . So, all in all, I absolutely adore La Creperie. It is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I bring all of my out of town friends here when they come to visit and I also recommend it to all of my friends living in the city. Every single one of them has loved it too!
