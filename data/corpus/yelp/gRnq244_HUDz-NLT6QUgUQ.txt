Love it! When I first moved to Andersonville, it looked like a fun place, so I went. Now my roomates and I know the staff's name, as they know ours. Great environment. Mary's Attic (the bar on top) is never crowded and has a hot bartender as well, though not as fun. Portions are big enough to eat for two meals, so either split or doggy bag it.. . The icing on the cake is the receipt coming in shoes.
