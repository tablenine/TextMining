I tried this place for the first time on new year's eve. My friend was able to make reservations for dinner that same day. The decor is very charming, we sat outside and were very comfortable due to there are heaters all around. The place was pretty much packed but the service was good, we were seated very quickly. Our server was very friendly and professional and did not seem flustered at all even though they had a packed house. . . Service was very timely, we got a bottle of wine and had some bread and an appetizer. Our main course took a while to arrive but we didn't mind since we had bread and the appetizer and we were enjoying the ambiance. . . The food was excellent! As an appetizer we ordered the phyllo stuffed with cheese and mint, the outside was nice and crispy and flaky and the filling was delicious, I couldn't taste the mint though. For our main course, my friend had the mushroom risotto with sausage which was very tasty. I had the fettuccine with shrimp and scallops, sooo yummy! The scallops were perfectly seared and there were roasted peppers and wilted spinach on top. We left the place very happy. I will definitely be back.
