It's a charming place but food here isn't so great.  Perhaps going on the hottest day ever and sitting outside where my skin was melting as I ate probably didn't help.  I came here for Sunday brunch and had the caprese omelette.  What I got was overcooked eggs with bit of tomatoes and mozarella.  My friend also got an omelette but that too was served with overwhelming amounts of egg with bit of other ingredients.   Also the food here is bit overpriced. . . I would come back because I like the restaurant and it's outdoor patio....perhaps on a day with better weather and I'll definitely try something different.
