Restaurant: Cafe Sunflower Buckhead
Category: Vegetarian
I never knew I could love a vegetarian restaurant but I love Cafe Sunflower!  Everything I've had here has been great.  Every carnivore I've brought here has liked the food and been impressed and surprised that they're not eating "real meat".  My favorites are the blackbean quesadilla, sweet and sour chicken and the chocolate raspberry cake is amazing!
