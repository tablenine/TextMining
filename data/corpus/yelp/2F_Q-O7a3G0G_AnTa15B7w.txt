So strange.  After being disappointed with Roscoe's, my body couldn't stop craving them.  It's like the have crack in the waffles.  Oooh is that ok to say?. . I ended up going to the Hollywood location and loved it my second time around.  Definitely worth trying again if you didn't like it the first time
