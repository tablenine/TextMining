Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've never had so much fun eating a hot dog.. . We went on Sunday afternoon. I picked up Mr. P and Mom. Daughter was already in the car.. . I parked across the street at a meter because the spot was available and I didn't want to hassle with the minuscule lot. We waited for about 45 minutes in a line that stretched around the building. If Pink's has a slow time, I've no clue when it is.. . Mom had a chili dog. Daughter had a chili cheese dog. Mr. P had a stretch chili cheese dog, no mustard. I ordered a Huell dog - TWO hot dogs, ONE bun, chili, cheese, onions, and mustard. (I don't know why anyone would wait in line for an hour and NOT order an unusual dog.) We also ordered french fries and onion rings. They assemble the dogs in front of you, and you pay as you pick up your order.. . My Huell dog (dogs?) was great. It snapped when I bit in. It had onions and chili mounded on top, and yet the whole thing didn't collapse or fall apart as I ate it. Pink's chili is bland, so it needs the kick of the mustard. Mr. P wished he had ordered his with mustard. The onions were soft and sweet, but I would have liked them grilled more. I couldn't finish the Huell dog, it was so big. But I would order it again. Mr. P wished he had ordered it. I need to teach him to be more adventurous.. . The fries were unmemorable. The onion rings were tasty and crispy, and I should have ordered a second order, because everyone got into them.. . They have bottled drinks, and also have cups so you can draw your own filtered water.
