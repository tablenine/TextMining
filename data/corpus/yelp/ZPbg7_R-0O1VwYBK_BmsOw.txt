Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
No thank you! This place is so over hyped. If you like boiled hot dogs with old buns and drippy chili, and a long wait to top it off, Pinks is just the place for you! I have given this place a couple chances but am always dissapointed. Its not even a fun novelty, the dogs are just no good. Sorry I want to love you Pinks, but just cant
