Mmmmm.. . Me: "Hey Breakfast Burrito, why don't you fill my belly with an abundance of fresh deliciousness, ASAP?". . BB: "Don't mind if I do!". . The service was fast, kind and attentive. The ambiance was nice, upscale and comfortable (even if it was 100 degrees hot in there). The bloody was a bit watery and mild (I like em thick and spicy), but the mimosas looked delectable! The four of us cleared our plates of all their delightful deliciousness and it was very reasonably priced. Quite possibly the best breakfast burrito I have ever eaten.
