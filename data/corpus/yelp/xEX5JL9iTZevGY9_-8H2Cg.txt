FINALLYYYY!!!!!!!!!! it's funny, ive been wanting a taste of the delectable tacos from kog(eeee) and i finally was able to try it last night on accident.. . my friends and i were on our way to daikokuya and lo and behold! the kogi truck was parked in front of the japanese american history center....SCORE! we couldn't turn down this magical opportunity and so patiently waited in line (about 40 min wait) to order tacos, a burrito and a kim chi quesadilla. an NPR reporter was on site and was interviewing people too...which was pretty cool. he told us that the chefs who created the concept are all 4-star chefs. that i did not know...but even better!. . anyway, on to the food. we ordered a short rib taco, chicken taco, short rib burrito and kim chi quesadilla. i didn't care for the quesadilla cuz i'm not a huge fan of kim chi but at least i can say i've tried it. my friends, however, loved it. i really loved the tacos. every bite was SO good. definitely lived up to all the hype and was definitely worth the wait.. . another thing i learned that u can order off menu: spam sliders. hmmm, not really my cup of tea but it looked cute anyway.. . apparently, kogi just opened a kitchen inside the alibi room in culver city. i'm hitting that place up next.... . ps. we still ate at daikokuya afterwards...gluttony!
