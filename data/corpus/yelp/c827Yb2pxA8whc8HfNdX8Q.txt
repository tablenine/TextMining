Sooooo *sigh* we just got back home from C &amp; M. I don't know what to say at this point, we love the staff so much!! Our dinner was pretty horrible, again. We had the asparagus(always delish! oh, but where is the manchego cheese??????), the mushrooms(the "new chef" *ugh*) had the spice but parmesan cheese(pizza style, seriously).. I mean, I know times are tough but pizza cheese on the oven roasted mushrooms? Groooooossss. Maybe if it was freshly grated it would have been better. We had the sweet fries.. oh, hello ketchup, nice to see you again! They USED to have the most AMAZING sauce with the aioli, it was authentic! So delicious. Then comes the skirt steak----- *hands in face, sighing*. It was a severe "portion" of the orginal which had cucumber and lime, the new one is a third of the size, the same price AND is apparently served cold with a Mexican sytle "portion "of white corn with mayonaise and cheese that you can get in certain parts of mid city LA in front of Jr high and High schools. . Oh thank GOD they had socca cakes this week. With the goat cheese. Honey. Love it always.. . We LOVE the staff. Thank you for bringing us back :)
