Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I love Shin-Sen-Gumi and all of its employees.  They really do make you feel welcome coming in and leaving the restaurant.  Service is superb considering the size of the place.  It's pretty tiny so you should come early to avoid waiting.  Personally, I think the ramen here is pretty good most days.  I study abroad in HK for 5 months and never did I feel a ramen place that could compete with this place.  then again, I should have went to Japan for the real deal.  -__- lol.  I love how they let you choose soup base, noodles style, and amount of oil you want--I'm all about the customization and it makes each bowl special.  I usually get light oil, heavy on the soup base, and hard noodles.  it is delicious! Do try the gyoza, they are super cute and good.  But overall, my favorite item is the green tea creme brulee--can't find it anywhere else.  It is absolutely yummy! If i could, i would eat it everyday, all day.  but then i would get a stomach ache too.  I love green tea everything.  Have fun treating yourself to your own special bowl of shin-sen-gumi hakata ramen, fellow yelpers.  you will not be disappointed =)
