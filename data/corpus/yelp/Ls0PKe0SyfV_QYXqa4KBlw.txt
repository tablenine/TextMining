We decided to give in to our cravings and went back to get some more.  The place is crowded as usual and we got our take out as usual.  The food tasted good as usual, but we found a long hair (5 inches) in our ai-cao-gao (green pastry made of ai grass).  Yikes!  Are we oversensitized now because of the county shut-down?
