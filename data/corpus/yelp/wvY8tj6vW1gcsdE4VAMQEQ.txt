This is another favorite in the West Loop.  It's more Asian fusion than flat out Asian, so it will appeal to those who are afraid of eating "real" Asian foods.. . Everything is great here.  The Kung Pao chicken is really good, and probably one of the best I've had.  This is also one place you want to get appetizers and side dishes.  All their appetizers are great, and the side of glazed green beans is one of my favorites.. . This is a great place for lunch, or dinner before a night out with friends, or even before heading to the theatre or a game at the United Center.
