Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Wow, their burgers here are really that good. Great flavors. Their fries ARE NOT worth the $3 price tag. You get 9 short and fat fries stacked like Lincoln Logs on your plate. The onion rings looked amazing though, will get those next time. Not a huge fan of their homemade ketchup, there is something simple and wonderful about good old fashioned heinz.. . This place was slammed today. The J Gold review brought everyone and their mother out. Food probably took about 20-30 min to come out. They were starting to run out of things so we settled on the umami and triple pork burger. Both were delicious. It's hard to pick a favorite. Their burgers come very rare, if you want it cooked differently be sure to mention it. They don't ask you.. . They were so busy they had to close up shop so they could restock for the dinner rush. I feel sorry for the couple who walked up as we left. Hopefully they come back and give it another shot.
