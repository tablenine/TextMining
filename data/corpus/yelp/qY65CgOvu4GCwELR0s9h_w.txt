I like this place very much, its good ramen.  The wait is sometimes long but its totally worth it.  If you really like ramen, try coming to eat by yourself to get in much quicker.  First time coming here I loved the bar seating to get a sneak peak at how they fix up my bowl of noodles.  I give it five stars for having delicious authentic Japanese ramen.
