Went here for brunch with my fiance on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was packed at around 12:30 pm.  Luckily for us, we only needed a two person table and we were able to be seated quickly.  Larger groups were waiting outside, but it didn't seem like their wait was too bad.. . The waiter was real nice and helped s with the questions we had in regards to the menu.  We received our drink orders pretty quickly too.  The bread and olive paste that you dip the bread in was really good, so good that we got another basket.  . . I ordered the Gourmet Benedict and my fiance ordered the Roma Via Paris omelette.  Both tasted awesome and were large in portion size, which is a plus for me.  My fiance couldn't finish the omelette... I don't think I could have either.  The gourmet benedict hollandaise sauce was a bit different than what I am used to, but it was still tasty.  Not the best breakfast ever (as the signage says on their window), but pretty close to it.   I have had eggs benedict at other restaurants and the salmon/hollandaise combo just didn't go well.  . . We found the restaurant on yelp by doing a search for brunch and we recommend Blu Jam to anyone interested in a good breakfast/brunch option in the LA area.
