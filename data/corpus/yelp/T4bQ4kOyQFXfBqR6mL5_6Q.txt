Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
It's not your ordinary burger place. Period.. . I came here on Saturday to taste what everyone's been talking about. I came here 6pm and it was almost completely full, except for that really dark room where they have a bar and one table, which was occupied. I don't even understand why they have that room. It's so dimly lit! As for the rest of the restaurant, it's kind of small but well-lit and the door is somewhat contemporary. They also have an outdoor patio that was empty when I arrived. However, during my meal, the restaurant, except for that dark room, was completely filled and the patio was also filling up to the point where they were making a waitlist. If you want to go during the busy times, I wouldn't go with more than 4 people in your party. It might be difficult to get a table. . . Since I was the only person in my party, I was invited to sit in the really dark room at the bar and after going in there, I declined and asked for a table. I actually would like to see what I'm eating especially since it was my first time there. Luckily some people did leave when I came in so they cleared that table for me. . . I ordered an Umami burger, the onion rings, and a Mexican coke. Service was pretty prompt and attentive. . . As for the food--wow. I have never had a burger was so tasty. It wasn't like anything that I had before. The onion rings were perfect too. Both of those with a Mexican coke--amazing. Despite a lot of reviews on here, I thought the burger was well-sized. The burger, onion rings, and coke was very filling for me. The food itself is 5 stars.. . Parking. I didn't valet my car. I just parked a couple blocks away in the neighborhood. Saved me $2.50. . . As for the rest of my experience there, it was just ok. There is a pretentious and stuffy vibe to the place. As much as I enjoyed the food, I would rather order out than eat-in.
