Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
We tried it a year ago, and was very disappointed by the pizza. . . We decided to give this place a second chance becasue we kept hearing so many people calling it one of the best pizza joint in LA. Â Ordered a small pepperoni pizza. After two slices, I ate a bowl of cereal. It's deja vu all over again. I got better things to do then write about this place. But if you must know how the pizza tasted, go to Vons and buy Tombstone pizza in the frozen section. You'll save a few bucks.
