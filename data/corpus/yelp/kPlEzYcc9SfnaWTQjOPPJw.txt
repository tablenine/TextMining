Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Things I liked: . . -SWEET POTATO FRIES!!!!! . -Great beer selection . -Cool decor . -Outdoor seating . -Really tasty burger- I didn't even look at a menu. My SIL told me you have to keep orders simple at this place, so we all just ordered the same thing. A burger. It was really good- served on a roll of some sort with grilled onions and bleu cheese [i think]. It didn't even need ketchup. . . Thing that weren't ideal: . . -1st come 1st serve basis to get a table. Kind of sucky and you have to "hover" around tables where it looks like the people might be close to leaving so you can snatch the table before any of the other hungry patrons. Then you experience the flip side when you are almost finished and people start hovering around you! . . The good outweigh the bad with Father's Office. I would visit again!
