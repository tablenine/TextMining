First off, I had heard so many people say this was a great restaurant that I was excited to try it. So the good first..... . Our waitress was the best part of the evening. Â Very professional.. . The food was OK.. . We ordered the empanada appetizer. One was hot the other cold. They should have both been hot.. . The rabbit dish was tasteless, lacking in character. Such a shame to waste good bunny on such a dish.. . The steak was prepared well but again, not much flavor. Just average.. . The noise level was really bothersome. Granted it was a Friday night around 8pm, but we sat in the back and it was still noisy, largely due to the architecture and lack of sound deadening.. . When I mentioned my experience to one of my friends who had recommended the place, he said, "oh, I don't go for the food, I go for the bar scene." Yuck.. . I probably won't visit them again.
