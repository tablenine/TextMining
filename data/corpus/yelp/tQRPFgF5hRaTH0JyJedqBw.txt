Can anyone say crispy halibut tacos with jicama and sweet potato fries!!!  Maybe duo of duck or perhaps bone-in porkchop with pear glaze, risotto and winter squash puree!!!!  Come on, they have Ephemere on tap.  I really really love this place.  The dishes are creative but always have a downhome comfort feel and thier mixed drinks are strong and delicious.. . Oh yeah...the coffee.  Good stuff.  They make one of the best soy lattes around.  . . I am absolutely in love with the ambiance of Uncommon Ground.  Warm and welcoming, the decor screams arts and crafts with an urban artsy feel.  Yes, i know that often equates to yuppy land, but I don't feel that way at all here.  The walls are adorned with local art and the fireplace and leather couches are all too inviting.  Did I mention that they play cool tunes and have a live venue with shows like every night. . . The only complaint that I have is that sometimes you'll get an off server...a bit snooty perhaps.  I was in there once with my cute little aunt from Northbrook and she ordered a latte.  Our Hitler mustache donned server asked if she wanted a bowl or a cup and she got a little confused.  They don't serve bowls in the burbs, so she was a little thrown off.  He looked at her like she had 5 eyes and got a little mouthy with her.  Totally awkward for all parties involved. I ordered the bowl, cleared it all up and we moved on, but it was quite uncomfortable.. . Bottom line:  Awsome food, Awesome environment, Awesome Awesome Awesome.  I'm giving Uncommon Ground 4.5 stars.  The only thing holding me back from giving the full 5 is the dude who rubbed us the wrong way.  Oh yeah...and like ablock away from my place so its easy.
