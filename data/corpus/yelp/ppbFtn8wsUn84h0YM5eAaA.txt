I'm convinced that the reason that they give you a ROTD is to bribe you into writing more reviews if you've, say, taken the last two months off from yelp.  Well, dammit, you got me.  Here I am, writing a new review.  I'm a sucker for free publicity, what can I say?  It's in my blood.. . Aaaaaanyway...went to Bone Garden last night.  Not only was it in an area of Atlanta that I never knew existed (seriously, ATL is like the Secret Garden of cities), it had the most skeletons-per-capita of any restaurant in the city.  Maybe even the country.  Possibly even the WORLD.  (Oh, jesus, my brain just made a REALLY inappropriate comment to itself, that I will definitely NOT repeat in this public setting). . It was great because of the following:. 1. The Skeletons.  Plus, earlier that evening I had actually said "wouldn't it be weird if everyone on earth were just skeletons without all the flesh and characteristics that come with?"  (these are things I think.). . 2. The Skeletons that were riding motorcycles.  I mean, aaaawesome.. . 3. The food was good.  Fish tacos = yum.. . 4. The ceviche was also quite yummy.  That's a professional food-critic term, I'll have you know.. . All in all, it was a well-priced, pleasant, skeletal experience.  I'll surely be back.
