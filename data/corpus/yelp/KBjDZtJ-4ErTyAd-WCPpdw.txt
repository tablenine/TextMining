Went here for lunch today, and I'm not sure how I feel about this place. . We had the ceviche app ($8), which was phenomenal!! It had such a great lime flavor with pieces of cilantro, fish, shrimp, and scallops. yum!. I also had the Senora Platter which consisted of. 1 taco. 1 enchilada. 1other thin covered in cheese. The food was excellent, and fresh, and I really got a kick out of seeing them make tortillas.... Here's the thing... Our waiter was really bizarre. Not just OUR waiter, but the whole waitstaff... I can't quite put my finger on it, but it made me, and my friend a little uncomfortable.. Our waiter would walk away while he was talking to us, so we didn't hear what he said, he was so nervous, he was almost shaking, and he didn't quite know how to speak to us so that he made any sense.. Very wierd.. Anyway, I thought it was good, and I love the free valet!. (Thanks Veronica for not making me eat a hot pepper!!!)
