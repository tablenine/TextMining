Stopped by this tiny joint ("slow fast food") to kill some time before meeting up with some other friends.  I got the chili fries.  The chili fries were so-so, but the shoestring fries were damn good!  They had some kind of bits of fried coating on them that made them crunch in my mouth.  Forget the chili, I'm getting the plain fries next time.  My friend got the burger w/out the bun, which she said was good.  I also recommend the Oinkster drink, which is a mix of orange juice, lemonade and other healthy ingredients like sugar.
