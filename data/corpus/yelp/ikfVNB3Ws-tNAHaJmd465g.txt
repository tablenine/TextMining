Though I'd had an opportunity to dine at JCT Kitchen almost a year go, it was only last Thursday that I enjoyed the bar and patio. I swung through for a post-work cocktail with the girls and am pleased to share that, for $5, you can't beat their "special" drinks offerings. I had the blueberry lemonade which was reminiscent of Kool-Aid but refreshing nonetheless. Â I chased that with a Perfect Margarita...it was so perfect that I to verify its placement on the "special" list. For it surely tasted like a top shelf 'rita. This is a cool place for cocktails and bites. I'd go again and again.
