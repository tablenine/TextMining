I will admit to going because of all the hype but let me tell you THE HYPE IS FO REAL! I had a slice of mac n cheese and a slice of bbq chicken bacon ranch........OMG!!!!! I will be back alot! They were real busy the whole time I was in there and the staff was awesome! Talk about friendly...So glad they came to Chicago. I have to go back and try some other types of pizzas soon. My mouth is watering while I write this review.........LOL. . YOU ROCK IAN'S!!!!!!!!
