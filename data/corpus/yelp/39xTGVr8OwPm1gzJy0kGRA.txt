This place is just okay for me. I've been here multiple times but EVERY TIME the line is just way too long, (min. 40 minutes ish) the restaurant is too dingy, service isn't that great, and parking costs almost as much as the meal. I like their ramen, but it's nothing stellar, I can however appreciate their eel bowls. Those are yum.
