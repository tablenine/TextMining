Pretty good tapas place. Really, because this place served the biggest portions for tapas. We didn't make reservations but the three of us got seated right away creating a table for us outside. It was a warm evening so the outdoor seating was perfect. We ordered everything we wanted on the menu (their menu wasn't THAT extensive but good enough) and we ended up being full.  . The gaspacho was yummy, their salad came with TONS of walnuts. I've never got a salad with more than 6 walnuts or pecans on it and this had SEVERAL that you can have at least one in every bite. Because of such a minor thing like this, CYM got a huge thumbs up from me.  . I liked the hip atmosphere of this place. It reminded me of some of the tapas joints up here in SF. (Minus the guys that pull up in their $100K+ car right up front with the valet with their leggy supermodel-esque gf/escort.) I will definately be back whenever I'm down in LA.
