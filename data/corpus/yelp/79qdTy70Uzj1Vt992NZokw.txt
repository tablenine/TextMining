Very disappointed will be the two words to describe the attention and service received. While Wayne the bartender poured great drinks, the response to an event gives me pause to ever return or even recommend this restaurant.. . Last night while drinking at the bar prior to dinner, the valet was broken into with the majority of keys stolen. A car was stolen and patrons were left without keys to their cars. Interestingly, the owner of the restaurant took almost 45 minutes to go around to tables, ask about their cars and to tell them what happened. Many patrons had to go out to the valet and find out they had no keys. . . No comps, no real apology but was provided was a brush-off that amounted to I don't know how to handle this, I hired the valet company and you'll have to deal with them. Are you kidding? Good thing there was a group of us since no arrangements were even offered to go get an extra set of keys nor to replace the keys that were stolen.. . A new restaurant? Yes. A new owner? Perhaps yes. A sign of inexperience and only thinking about the bottom line and not the customer? A wholehearted yes.. . When leaving, the owner said, I hope you won't hold this against the restaurant. Hate to tell you, I do.
