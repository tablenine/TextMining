Everyone else may come here for martini's, but I come here for the mac-n-cheese. It is oh so good. Not as good as mine, but a close second ;).. . The martinis are good here too. I have tried several on the menu and I think my favorites are the orange cream and the lychee martinis. They are too yummy. . . I also like the environment. It's so easy to go and start talking to random people there. (See what booze will do to you?) It's fun. I also like to watch the people playing pool at the table. Great place to people watch.
