Restaurant: Highland Tap
Category: Steakhouses
Despite the great steaks and the classic drinks, Highland Tap manages to feel like a local watering hole more than a steakhouse...Maybe it's the fact that it's hidden down a flight of stairs in the dark makes it feel like a well kept secret.. . It's classic steakhouse decor with lots of wood and dark recesses where you can have a business meeting over a steak or a romantic carnivorous experience. The food is excellent, and the drinks are serious: not fancy for the sake of being fancy, and with a big kick. Definitely a place to get your martini dry or your bourbon straight.
