We celebrated D's birthday here over the weekend and were impressed in many ways, but felt several of the dishes (which sounded to die for) were lacking in one way or another. . . I want to be "wowed" when I am dining out and spending a bit more than on an average meal, and we didn't really feel that way on our way out. . . We were seated in a back left corner room that was very secluded, which I enjoyed, however half our group faced a server's station with a brightly lit computer in the otherwise dim area. I had to convince one member of the group it wasn't worth requesting another table over, however it was definitely annoying. . . We started with the sausage and the pepper and onion flat breads: super tasty, especially the sausage version. We also choose the sea scallop appetizer, which was not overly enjoyed by anyone in the group. . . Out of our entrees, we dined on the flat iron steak, duck, rainbow trout,  chickpea crepes and halibut. Mushrooms abounded in most dishes, and were delish. However, I found disappointment in the lack of flavor in several of the dishes, especially mine, the rainbow trout. I felt like each entree lacked *something.* Let's call it a generous dose of flavor.. . The house cocktails are great, I happen to love mules, so try the Sepia Mule if you enjoy the type. . . I would probably give it another try.  However there are so many places where I have been constantly wowed, such as Avec and Blackbird around the corner, that I probably would be more easily convinced to be blown away in their dining rooms.
