Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Food good but not great.  Not something I would go back again and again for.  The dumplings are kind of expensive compared to other dumpling restaurants and the other dishes are TINY!  We ordered some fried rice and it came on this itty bitty little plate.  It's 1/4 of the portions I normally get outside.  The price for it was just the same as a regular plate of fried rice at other restaurants.  Another thing that was disappointing was the service too.  Please keep in mind that you'll see mostly rich older Asians there mostly Taiwanese and you can tell by their made up face and their monogram purses.  So I know my husband and I look kind of young and we weren't dressed in our best gears but the mainlander waitresses keep ignoring us!  I couldn't believe it!  I guess they thought I did not belong there and that their food was way too hoity toity for me!  OMG!
