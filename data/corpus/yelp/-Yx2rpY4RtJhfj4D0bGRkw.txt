I checked out the jazz club with a group of guys and we felt a little out of place.  Most of the people there were couples and it was no surprise considering the low lighting, cozy couches, and candles.  This would be a great place for a date.  The jazz trio and singer were talented and played a mix of modern and traditional jazz, including a rendition of Cyndi Lauper's Time after Time, one of my favorites.  I also thoroughly enjoyed watching the dexterous and knowledgeable bartenders.
