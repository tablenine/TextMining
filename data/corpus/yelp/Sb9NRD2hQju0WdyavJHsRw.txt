Restaurant: Osteria del Figo
Category: Italian
I am not one that generally digs chain establishments. But on occasion I am known to frequent them. Figo has a laid back atmosphere, is reasonably priced and serves some nice dishes. . Their menu boasts a wide variety of items. Primarily a multitude of pastas, varied sauces and  panini. . . I generally feel pressured to know what I want as soon as I walk in the door. It feels as if one must cajole the hostess to be seated with a menu. Generally one must  order immediately upon entering at the counter.. During my last visit I ordered the corn ravioli with a vodka sauce drizzled with truffle oil. It was lovely. The sauce was creamy with hints of roasted red pepper and sweet paprika. The ravioli tasted fresh with an underlying sweetness from the corn, and the truffle oil added an earthiness to the entire dish. Paired with a Peroni, one can't go wrong.. . Will I make a point of dining at Osteria del Figo each time I am in town? No. . Will I be back? Most likely.
