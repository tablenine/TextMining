The outdoor seating is lovely and a necessary respite after the harried and uncomfortable process that is ordering your breakfast.  It is torturous standing next to a ginormous (yes, it's officially a word according to Webster's) display of butter-laden cakes and sundry baked goods while you wait in line.  The staff is impressively on top of it, given the confusing disorder at the counter, but I'd still rather pay a few bucks for table service.  I've had an omelette and a scramble here, both with toast and rosemary potatoes.  Nothing terribly impressive. I did cave and buy a piece of cake the size of my head on one occassion.  Definitely a place for dessert and coffee rather than a meal.
