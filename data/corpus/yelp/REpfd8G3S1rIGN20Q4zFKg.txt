holy yum.  i've always wanted to go here, and i'm so glad i did.  the food is amazing - five stars.  we had veggie maki and massaman curry - both of which were great.  the curry blew all other thai curries (in the neighborhood, anyway) out of the water - i loved the lotus in it.  so. amazing.  i just wish it came with more rice.. . the decor is what did the -1 star for me.  it was so odd, i couldn't get comfortable.  i felt like i was in a space ship or that i was on a set and we were being filmed.
