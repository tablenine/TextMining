"is everything ok in there?". . so after eating here about a billion times and trying just about everything on the menu at least once, i ordered up some caldo de res. not realizing i had never had it here, i was, as the limeys say, gobsmacked. all this time, i never knew, the best caldo de res i have yet had in chicago (and i have had many) was right under my nose. i still love my longtime standbys, the tostada de ceviche de pulpo and the tacos de arrachera, but five stars for a welcome surprise at such a familiar locale.
