Fi-nal-ly.  After several best I ever... my top... hands down... recommendations from the Doanut he got one right.. . Savoy Kitchen should change their name to Savory Kitchen or Succulent Kitchen.  The Hainan Chicken is legit.  Their special sauces makes this dish something I could devourer on a daily bases.  I wish I got to try their rice they cook with chicken broth but guess they were out when I visited, just my luck. =[. . I'm definitely gonna tap this ass again.
