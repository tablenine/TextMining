4 stars, yes.... . Food-wise, although they are not top quality meat, they are certainly fresh. It's probably because there are a lot of people going there. . . 5 types of meat, . all you can eat,. Follow the beat,. ...... me no good in Engrish..... . Anyhoo.... . Atmosphere: Young crowd with loud music, and everyone is laughing and eating and drinking and puking...... everyone is enjoying, having fun... I like this place, it brings me back to Hong Kong [I know Hong Kong is not in Korea] where you sit in those Dai Pai Dong.... (Cooked food market(?)) ... you don't even get that feel in Chinatown.. . This is a place I will definitely go back, except that their alcohol price is higher than a normal korean place..... I will just drink less.. they are doing a community service .. to me... at least.
