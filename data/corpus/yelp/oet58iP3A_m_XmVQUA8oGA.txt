this is a great place for any occasion. you can be dressed up or casual. its also a great place for a larger group. . . the atmosphere is nice. very open so it can get a little loud. . . i have been here many times and the food is great. i recommend getting the taco combo and sharing it with someone. you get 8 tacos (you choose which ones) and its only $30. . . my fav taco by far is the ahi tuna. it has great flavor and spice. very light and fresh. . . i also love the battered shrimp and the tomatillo pork. . . all are very good though. . . highly recommend if you're looking for a place to please a bunch of different people. there are many choices and everyone should be able to find something they love.
