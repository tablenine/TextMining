let's get it together folks - the rat toes have hit the fan as the shrimp have shrunk and the peppers are stale.  Service is getting spotty while the deep fryer is still boiling.  Seems like this place is going hit or miss.  Great location.  Views of Oakland Cemetery are excellent and a nice change from the usual urban landscapes.  You want tv's? good for that too.  Wicked beer selection.  Too bad when a good thing so close to home starts to go sour.
