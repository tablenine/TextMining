Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
There's nothing I hate more than having to be an asshole to get ahead in life. Which is why the Santa Monica Father's Office pissed me off. . . Food and beer are two of my favorite thngs. And FO had em both in spades. But I could not deal with the atmosphere. . . Enter the Culver City loc. Omfg. Yes! 3ish times the size of the original, and with a much longer bar, I am allowed to enjoy my beer and office burger (one of the best around). I can casually chat instead of getting stared at by table vultures. . . Get a beer youve never heard of. Arent new things great? Dont be afraid to try the other food either. Marrow anyone?
