I really wanted to love this place, instead I just liked it.. . Stopped by solely to get some pastries.  I like what they've done with the space.  All the goodies looked delicious: cookies, cakes, fruit tarts of all sorts, croissants, breads, etc.  Ordered a chocolate almond croissant, pistachio pear tart, and a flourless chocolate tart with graham cracker crust.. . While all the pieces were good, they just weren't as good as I expected them to be (especially for the price).  The pistachio pear tart was ok, nothing to write home too and the chocolate tart should have been smoother and dare I say it, richer.  The best thing was the chocolate almond croissant - nice and light with a lovely chocolate filling with just a hint of almond.
