not much left to say that hasn't already been said.  Its a flavorful broth  with a strong pork and somewhat smokey notes.  Had to put in our name on the list - and was called by number - not name when our table was ready.  Place is slightly dirty feeling  - but ramen was very good. . . will go back again.
