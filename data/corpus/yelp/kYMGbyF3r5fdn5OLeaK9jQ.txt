I was a little torn about what star to give this place. A few years ago it would have gotten a solid 4 stars but it's just way more inconsistent than it used to be. I also think that coincided with Song opening in Park Slope.. You probably can find better Thai food in New York but this place is another "scene" type place for the neighborhood. Who needs all those Hell's Kitchen joints when you don't need to leave the hood? I usually stick to a few choices including the Pad See Yue with chicken or tofu depending on my mood. The summer rolls are tasty and the calamari does seem to delight folks. Plus, you can always get take-out and avoid the crush and you'll get it about 5 minutes after you order no matter what.
