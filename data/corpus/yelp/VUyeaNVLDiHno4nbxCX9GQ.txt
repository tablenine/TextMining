Ok, I will admit that about 1/4 of the reason I come here is on the off chance that I will run into Indiana Jones himself sitting at the bar while snacking on some sort of delectible cured meat. I've been here a handful of times now, and each time, have had a very good experience. I have typically come during non-peak hours, so maybe that has something to do with why the service I received has seemed so much better than some of the other reviewer's. I LOVE the pub burger. The blue cheese is really delicious and the burger is super-juicy. Do yourself a favor and try the fried ipswich clams with meyer lemon tartar sauce. They are always perfectly fried and seasoned.
