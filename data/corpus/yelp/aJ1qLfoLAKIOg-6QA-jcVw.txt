Again, I'm sure there isn't much I can say that the 224 before me haven't already. I like this place, because it's casual and laid back...definitely not a fancy, schmancy wine place. I tried the "It's all about ME" flight, and it was good. There was nothing outrageously memorable about it, though. I did like the stemless wine glasses.. . My companion was excited to order the tempura green beans, and, lemme tell ya, I'm glad we did! They were perfectly crisp with a side of amazing aioli. We had a couple of cheeses, again, none of which really stood out. We then sampled the "white" pizza, which neither of us found to be particularly exciting. If anything, it was way too rich for my taste buds. . . The waitstaff was knowledgeable enough. Just a heads up, though...the bus boy, while extremely attentive to my water glass, soaked me in ice water every time he refilled. And the waitress didn't seem surprised, as if it happens all the time. Huh? . . Because it is a wine bar and has such a casual atmosphere, I'm sure I'll be back! Maybe next time I'll wear a rain slicker...
