This was kinda a fun place to stop in before a Second City outing.  It's a large, colorful restaurant that handles large crowds, and fairly efficiently (at least at 6;15pm on a Friday).  There are no reservations per se, but you can still call-in to get in a queue.  We had a party of 10, and we waited about 30 minutes.  There were an adequate number of large tables also.  You can valet park there for $7, as street parking is pretty limited.  We opted to park near Second City and walk the 3/4 mile to the west on North Ave.  The food itself was ordinary Mexican fare (at least what we ordered) but everything was fresh, as the kitchen must have been really busy.. . The wife had grilled jumbo shrimp with guacamole and flour tortillas, for $20.  I had a platter of cheese chile relleno, chicken enchilada and a pork tamale for $15.  The shrimp were pretty salty, but the tortillas helped.  Import beers were $4.75 -  so the prices were moderate for the area, and not outrageous for what we had.   All in all, an interesting change in scenery for us, but a bit of a hassle to get there and a bit on the intensely crowded side.
