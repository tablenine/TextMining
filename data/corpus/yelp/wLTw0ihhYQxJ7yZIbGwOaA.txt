I haven't been here in years and I've really been missing out because apparently I forgot all about this amazing Italian restaurant. We had dinner here tonight and it was incredible. We ate quite a lot and I think I may be full for the next 3 days! . . We started the meal by ordering the pizza and grilled calamari for the table. The pizza was really good....loved the sauce in the middle of the pizza! The calamari was OK, but it was the only part of the meal that was just "OK". Then we ordered the "special" salad and the Cesar's salad...both were great!  I was pretty much full at this point, but couldn't resist the duck filled tortellini I had ordered for dinner.  It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time! I also tried my brother's pasta stuffed with salmon and it may have been even better than my tortellini.  . . The meal should have ended there because we were all ridiculously full, but everyone insisted on getting the bread pudding and another dessert for all of us to share. The chef decided to send out a total of 6 desserts just to be nice so we ended up having a little taste of everything. Wow....it really was all so good, but if I had to go with my favorite dessert for next time I would probably choose between the tiramisu or the white chocolate mousse.  Overall it was an incredible meal with some of the best food I've tasted in a long time and very good service.  I don't think I'll be forgetting about Rose Angelis after this meal!
