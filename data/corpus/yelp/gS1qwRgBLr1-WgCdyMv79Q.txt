I've been hearing about this place for a couple of years now. Then, every time that I drive by there's a line out the door. Last night I finally made the effort. I waited in line made some friend while standing in line. It was about 10:00 at night and there was still a line. It took about 20 minutes to place out order. When we were in line one of the employees took our drink order and gave us our drinks while were waiting. I appreciated it. I opted for the green chillies &amp; cilantro sausage with grilled onions, Belgium fries with white truffle oil glaze and lemonade. My friends had the vegetarian sausage, not sure which one. I really enjoyed my meal. Once you place your order you make your way to the dining room. Its a large room with communal tables and a smaller tables against the walls. Love the music, it may have been a DJ. I loved the atmosphere and energy. It was packed and I am happy to see that this restaurant is doing well. Especially that this was a 10:00 PM on a Wednesday night. I'll be back.
