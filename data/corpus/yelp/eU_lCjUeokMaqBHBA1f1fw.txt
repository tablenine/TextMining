After being in NY for a couple weeks I was getting worried that nobody ate breakfast. Today I just happened to walk by Tom's with some friends and we freaked out. The place is awesome. Old, quirky and just real good traditional breakfast. Oh yeah and it's... . . BREAKFAST ALL DAY!!!. . Tons of interesting pancakes and waffles. Good eggs and they're not afraid of getting you some greasy bacon. . . The owner was walking around joking, being really friendly. He brought us cookies, which I guess is a pretty regular thing for him to do. . I am coming back here every weekend if I get my way
