#1 reason for 5 stars - They have Arden's Garden Juices. Though they are pricey, they are the yummiest things I've ever tasted. Sometimes, they are a meal in itself, kinda like Guinness. ;) . . #2 reason for 5 stars - Efficient staff. Sometimes they may be dismal, but they always come back and refill my coffee, they always ask if every thing is okay, and they sometimes even smile and joke around with you. . . #3 reason for 5 stars - They make french toast on Challah, the way it should be served and it's stellar.  Plus the syrup is rockin.  The potatoes are heavenly. . . #4 reason for 5 stars - My parents really like this place as well. Impressing the parents is always important, especially when I only get to see them 2 to 3 times a year. . . #5 reason for 5 stars - Their coffee is really good. . . And as an added bonus, they have wifi. Though I would probably feel bad hogging a table for wifi on the weekends while people are waiting 20-40 mins to get in and eat. *shrug* It's awesome nonetheless.
