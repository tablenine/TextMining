Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Fogo de WOW!  . . Two words:  MEAT COMA!. . We just had our office holiday lunch here on Friday and OMG it was so good!  I've been to Brazilian in Burbank and Glendale and those do not stack up to Fogo.  Hell naw.. . Fogo's salad bar is the best and freshest selection I've seen. Ever. From the cured meats and cheeses to the hearts of palm, huge asparagus stalks, artichoke hearts, giant mushrooms, fresh beets, roasted red peppers, garlic green beans and various salads.  So, so good!. . What is different about Fogo is that they bring you your side dishes to the table: fried polenta (so so), garlic mash potatoes (can't ever go wrong with mashies) and plantains (wow!).  . . Like most others have said, don't fill up on the salad bar or the bread.  Total rookie move.  Also, do yourself a favor and pass on the sausages, ribs and chicken thighs.  Yeah, pass on those.  Serious.. . The key is to be patient and wait for the good stuff.  Here were my absolute favs:. . -Rib eye (what's good is they have varying temperatures...AWESOME!). -Garlic beef. -House special beef. -Filet Mignon. -Lamb chops (super wow, so so tender and very flavorful). . Our table had a variety desserts served: Tres Leches, Creme Brulee, Papaya something-or-other, chocolate martini and Fragile Baby (coffee with Bailey's and Kahlua...i think.  It was damn good!). . Since this was on the boss' dime, we got to thoroughly enjoy the entire experience from the food to the valet.  It is best to come at lunch since the prices are so steep but as long as you follow the rules...you should get your money's worth.  Mos def.. . Thanks Boss.
