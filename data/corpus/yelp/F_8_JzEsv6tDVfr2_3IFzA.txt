Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
We walked in and the little short bald guy behind the bar was very rude asking if we were staying or taking out.   When we sat down, they only have one daily special and they were out of it at 7:00 p.m.  (Bad planning by the chef)  . . They have a bunch of sandwiches and one or two other dishes.  Steak was tough, was not real cuban bread and the service was ok.  I am from Miami, so I know real Cuban food and they have a long way to go.   . . Hope the little short bald man behind the bar learns to talk to customers a bit better...that is a first start.  . . I heard Coco Loco in Atlanta is a better spot...
