like a little sausage speak easy hidden in downtown LA!  What a treat!  A friend recommended we go there after a modern dance performance in LA. This place was totally happening on a Sunday night!  Love it!  Almost 20 unique sausages to choose from... my friends fave is the Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit... after taking  a bite, I agree!  So good.  I opted for the Chipotle Veggie Dog and was pleased!  . . Topped with either Sour Croat (sp?), grilled onions, spicy or sweet peppers... their Dogs are rockin!  AND, I KNOW DOGS!!!  . . Get some delicious fries and a groovy dipping sauce and don't shy away from the super fabulous variety of amazing beers... oh, visions of Bavaria, Beers, and Buns... oh my!  Had the Triple Klein...something or other... then another, and one more for good measure!  . . What a gem... Giving this place four paws up!. . Meow ;)
