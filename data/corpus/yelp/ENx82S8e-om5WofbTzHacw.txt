Restaurant: Pura Vida
Category: Tapas Bars
My friends and I loved Pura Vida.  My favorites were the button mushrooms, white asparagus, el burrito, and mi media noche.  The service was excellent even though the restaurant was very busy while we were there.  It was salsa night, and apparently there was only one couple in attendance who knew the dance or cared to participate.  Still, we enjoyed watching.  My only complaint is that as we were finishing our final cocktails, the hostess came over to "check on" us, as did the server multiple times.  We really felt as if we were being rushed out.  Still, I'd return because most of the evening was SO good.
