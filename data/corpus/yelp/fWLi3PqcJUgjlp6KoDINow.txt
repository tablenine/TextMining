Simply put the friendliest servers I've ever had. Super happy during the whole meal. Add to it that the food was great and well priced and I'm sold.. . The hype is true. This is the place to go.. . The menu is huge and filled with normal chinese dishes and a few surprises. I really want to try the Peking duck at some point.. . We had crab rangoons which were huge and super crispy. I didn't like the cherry sauce, but the duck sauce was fine.. . The mongolian beef was not overly sweet and was a good portion. . . If you like meat get the mandarin beef ribs. They're the best! I got them along with sweet and sour shrimp and the ribs were gone before I even touched the other stuff. See the photo Pam A took!. . If you live in this area and want chinese there is no better place!
