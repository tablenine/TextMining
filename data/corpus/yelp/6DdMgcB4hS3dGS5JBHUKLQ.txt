I shouldn't spill the beans on this, but this is one of the BF's and my regular brunch spots. It's never crowded and I really prefer to sit in a cool, dark cavernous space on bright, sunny, post-night-of-boozin' mornings (especially during the sweltering months of July and August). I know, call me crazy. Plus, I don't really love breakfast food (Gasp! There, I said it) and Highland Tap has a good assortment of BOTH breakfast AND lunch food, which is nice. I've been once for dinner and dropped a pretty penny, but I feel that for the amount of food and the quality, it was well worth it.
