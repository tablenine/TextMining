I loveeee this place!! My problem is that I can never finish the food! It's probably just me but their sashimi lunch is always too big for me and I always feel bad for wasting anything I have left. Talk about ironic, especially when it comes to sushi!. . The fish is always fresh to the point where every bite is creamy and delicious and come on now, how can you beat this price?! I also love the green tea, makes the fish go down really nice.
