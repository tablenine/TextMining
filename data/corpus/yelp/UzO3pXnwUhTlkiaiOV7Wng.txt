Yummy in my tummy! I never pass up an opportunity to go here or to send my guests here. The only bad thing can be the wait.. . I like to say...If you do something well, stick to it! That's what they do here. There are not many options (if that's what you're looking for), but what they do, they do well.. . I love the meat pizza bowl. CHEESE, CHEESE, GOOEY CHEESE! I can't get enough. My second favorite is the Med flat bread. It is huge and I love all of the spices! A nice way to round it out is to add a salad. Again, the salad is huge! It will easily feed two people. Mixing the two dressing makes for a tangy treat!! Enjoy the nice, simple selection of beers on hand at the bar.. . Finally roll out of the restaurant if you can fit through the door and hop a cab home.
