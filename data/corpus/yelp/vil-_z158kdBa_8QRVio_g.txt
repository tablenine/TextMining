Great breakfast! I got the special omelet where you can choose 4 toppings and bread and choice of potato, salad and fruit.  I love that you have choice of fruit!! The omelet was really full and fluffy and good. And the portions were pretty big. My friend got the Paris Omelet and that also looked really good too. Really cozy and nice open cafe. We went on a Wednesday brunch and it wasn't too crowded
