Firstly, it has smelled awful inside the front door every time I've been here. . . The woman and I walked up here a couple weeks ago to tie one on. We started off with the salt and vinegar popcorn and made it clear to our server that we were in no rush to order dinner. The popcorn is amazing.. just don't breath too deeply while eating. We were alternating bites and coughs until we got the hang of it. . . They have like 6 different varieties of Hitachino here and in my book that deserves an automatic 4 stars. I may have tried them all. It was an interesting walk home. . . Eventually, we got around to ordering the Sausage Bahn Mi and the Brisket tacos. The Â Bahn Mi came with a side salad with beets and goat cheese...totally delicious and unexpected. Her tacos were slightly less memorable but she really enjoyed them. . . I REALLY like The Porter....minus 1 star for the funky smell.
