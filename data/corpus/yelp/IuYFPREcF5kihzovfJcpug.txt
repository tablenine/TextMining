First the negatives...too loud inside...servers kinda just take whoever it seems to be a lack of order. . Now for the positives. I'll be back several times because... . 1. French press coffee, I've never had coffee out of a French press until today. 2. Louisiana hotsauce, another thing I've never had. 3. Delicious Griddlecakes. 4. Baked Potato omelet with apple sausage...even though I knew I was full, I still shoved it down. 5. huge butter. . I will be back tomorrow, at 3! I could eat there every day. . PS park in rite aid and walk
