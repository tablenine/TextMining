Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I always called this place Manuel's even though its official name is El Tepeyac.I've eaten here several times and all of them have been very good. It's cramped in here, a little dark, and sometimes smells funny.. . I can't even think of everything I've eaten here but they were all decent. What sticks in my mind though is their large portions guacamole (served with their taquitos) that's the best I've ever tasted. . . I don't remember the name of their huge burrito but if you do order it, share it with someone. I tried to eat it all myself but towards the end I was just shoveling food into my mouth instead of actually enjoying it. Now that I think about it, that applies to nearly everything that's on the menu, well of course, except the guacamole. . . This place is rated as cheap but if you're like me, you can't only order one dish. It's always taquitos w/ guac and something else for me.
