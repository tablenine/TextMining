Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I had a horrible experience at Jerry's last night.. . I live in the area (2 blocks walking ) and had friends in from out of town and since it was a nice night, I thought I would take them to Jerry's (since it is different than the sports bars on Division) to sit outside and have drinks before meeting up with other friends. . . We asked our waiter for recommendations on beers and he said that "he hadn't been in for a week, so didn't know what they had" and couldnt recommend anything.  Once one of the girls decided on a beer, he brought the wrong one and then when he came back he spilled it all over the table. . . Then we thought we would order an appetizer  and we ordered the beer cheese/pretzel plate (they are known for having home made pretzels). Our clueless waiter came back and told us they were out of Pretzels (this was at 430pm) and when we asked if they could do a pretzel roll, he looked at us like we were crazy for asking and told us there was no way they could do that. WTF?!?!. . In the end, we went to the bathrooms which were super dirty and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in days!. . All in all it was a horrible  experience (and I was a little embarrased to bring out of town guests there) and I will not be going back.
