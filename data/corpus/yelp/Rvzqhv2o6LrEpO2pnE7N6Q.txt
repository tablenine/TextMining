Came in on a Monday night.  It was about half full, but the service could have been better.  Our server was nice, but every course was slow, including just getting our drinks.. . We had a veeralassi and a shankar sangria to drink.  After a long wait to get them, it was a mixed result.  The sangria was good, the lassi tasted more like coconut than mango -- it was just too sweet.  . . Because we have eaten at a lot of Indian places, we wanted to try their Indo-American creations for something different.  We had a naan burger and a chicken paratha flatbread.  They were both good,  but not that different in flavors from any other Indian food, they were just physically structured differently.  And the portions were very small.. . Would I go back?  Definitely not.  It was overpriced because of its location, but not as innovative as they would like you to think with portions that were way too small.  I would just prefer to go back to Devon Street and leave it at that.
