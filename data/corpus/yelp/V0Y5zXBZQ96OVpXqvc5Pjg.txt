Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
i was watching the ted allen show on food network about how new york pizza is different from anyplace else specifically because of the water being used; it made me think of a discussion with my friend about something lacking in the dumplings at this U.S location compared to the one in taipei. He being somewhat f.o.bbish confidently said it was because the water here is essentially too "clean", completely different from the water used in taipei. So while the dumplings here are incredibly juicy with the perfect near-translucent pouching, the ones that i recall from the Din Tai Fung in Taipei really were somehow more delicious and juicy. Even the steamed chicken broth that I was awaiting eagerly because of how good it was in Taipei tasted less flavorful-I think in that case it was both the difference in water and the type of chicken being used since it's hard to come by those huge gangly ones that they have in Taiwan. Regardless, everything was still fantastic and if you haven't randomly gone to Taipei or aren't native Taiwanese you won't feel that anything is lacking in the food-I've introduced this place to friends who now crave pork dumplings in their sleep.
