i've known porto's forever and have always been a big fan from there famous bread to potato balls pasteries galore and the best cakes in town ............. they so rock ........... it can get intense in there always super crowded with that pick a number market like atmosphere....... you better prep to get there early to pick up your cake because the lines are ridiculous....i always have to get there an hour early to stand in line to pick up a cake........but people will wait........they decorate their cakes so beautifully like a piece of art and the cakes are worth the wait and money to impress friends at a party or just to give friends and families a mouthful of scrump deli up tious flavorable fun...........bottom line ........ 10 yums and lip smakin fun for your tum.........!
