Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
Frou Frou Mexican.  How does that even make sense?  Shouldn't mexican food and the locale make you feel like you're in Tijuana?  I mean, that's how you know it's authentic, right?. . The food actually wasn't bad.  I went with a veggie quesadilla which I would rate as great (that's a rhyme) except that the tortilla(?) in which it was cooked was more like a bland pastry dough, not so awesome, but I would eat it again.  The queso fundido was delicious and would absolutely suffice as a meal unto itself.  As a matter of fact, a table of four sat down next to us, asked us about the queso fundido and then three of their group ordered it as their meal.  Awesome.  . . All in all, the place is ok.  What really holds it back, however, is the price.  It's a great location with a great patio but not worth the price over la fonda, tin lizzy's, or taqueria del sol.  I'd go back at someone's suggestion, but I wouldn't crave this place.
