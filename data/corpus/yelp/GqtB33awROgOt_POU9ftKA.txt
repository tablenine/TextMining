I've been here 4 times. Each time I had the special of the day. Each time I left mighty satisfied! I love how not pretentious this place is. One of the few places in Chicago where you can get sweet tea (iced). Great place to take a date who wants something very low key. Wish they were open late. Overall it's da shizzle baby!
