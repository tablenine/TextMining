FInally got to venture over and try the infamous sausage eatery with a few of my friends that are from Northern California, Orange County and San Diego.. . I loved the variety of sausages available, from vegetarian ones to chicken to turkey to multiple meat sausages! The truffle fries are fried twice and are a MUST buy.. . I had the mango jalapeno chicken/turkey dog with veggies and sauce...and it was spectacular. Unlike it's "rival" (if you can call it that), Pink's, they TAKE CREDIT CARD, HAVE A FULL BAR and don't layer a thousand calories of condiments on top of the otherwise, plain hot dogs.. . I loved it. I will come back at night for their local band nights and such sometime soon.
