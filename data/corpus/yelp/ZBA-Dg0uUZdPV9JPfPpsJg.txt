Not sure what all the unfairly horrendous reviews are all about, but the place is great, albeit a bit overpriced. I went here for lunch several times and had a wonderful experience each time. . . Service was great (we were seated outside on the patio -- so maybe it's different out there?).  Definitely no rudeness that many other reviewers have complained about.. . The food was definitely rock solid.  Sandwiches and burgers seem to be their specialty, and I highly recommend sticking to those options.. . The lunchtime atmosphere is great.  I will be back.
