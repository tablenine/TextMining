oh #19 sandwich, how i love thee. . from the warm rye bread with the super crunchy crust, to the refreshing coleslaw, to the tasty sauce, and finally to the THICK and OH SO JUICY pastrami, if i had to choose a sandwich as my last meal, the #19 would definitely be the sandwich i choose. . beware everyone, the sandwich may look small, but it s EXTREMELY filling, i always, and i mean ALWAYS have trouble finishing it when i'm halfway through. . but the sandwich is just so good, that i can't let the other half go to waste!. . there's also a parking lot (with 1 hr validation) just down the street at the next corner, which is convenient. . my only gripe, is that the sandwich costs around $14. . so expensive, but just so gosh darn good!
