Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
I'll admit, I learned of Cemitas Puebla from Guy on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives.. . All i can say is amazing...!. . If you're in the city, you MUST try it.. . My eyes have a tendency to roll to the back of my head when I talk about amazing food.. and as I type my eyes are disappearing.. . The Cemita Milanesa is heaven in between a sesame seed bun..... . Cemitas Puebla is a MUST! . . This is the bestest Mexican food in Chicago I've EVER had.. Â I've had my fair share of Mexican food, but nothing compares.. . I dream of Cemitas after I have it, and crave it the next day. My best friend and I try not to have it so often, just so it's so much more of a reward when we actually get to go. Whether your a block or a few miles away, making it to Cemitas is a must.. . Who ever thought of sesame seeds on a torta? Whoever it was, is a genius :D the horchata is a great way to help the cemita down... . My best friend can't help but order the Cemita Atomica, and if I weren't already in love with the Cemita Milanesa, I'd cheat on it with the Atomica.. . So, stop reading and get in your car... Cemitas isn't goin anywhere, but you need to be there.. . the only downside to Cemitas is that you walk out smelling just like it, but it just adds to the dreams you have about it later on :)
