I like this place for the location, the view, and the building.. . I don't like the price of the valet (as you drive past numerous empty parking spots), and on my last time there the food wasn't that great.  I had the sweet and spicy shrimp.  It was neither sweet, nor spicy.  It didn't have much taste at all, and I almost sent it back.  Will return if someone I know is having a party/event there, but will not be going on my own again.  :(
