Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
This place would've gotten four stars. The food I got, which was bun thit nuong (vermicelli noodles with grilled pork), was on par with the restaurants in Anaheim, California (the standard for Vietnamese food). However, the place was infested with ants near the table I was at. Ants were crawling on the table every 30 seconds and I didn't notice the ants till after I was done with my meal. Other then the ant problems, I would recommend this place.
