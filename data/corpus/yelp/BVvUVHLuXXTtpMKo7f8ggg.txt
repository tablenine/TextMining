One of the great things about my trip to Peru a few years ago was the rotisserie chicken readily available at every other stall in Cuzco.  Moist, succulent chicken with great markings.  It is so very enticing and every bit as good as it looks.  . . Pio Pio approximates this food decently well, though not fully, with their small restaurants around the city.  I loved the chicken here.  The white meat here is juicier than most dark meat elsewhere which is quite the accomplishment.  I opted for the Peruvian combo on my visit, which offered up an entire chicken as well as french fries and an avocado salad for $24.  It turns out that you can make substitutions though, so I changed out the fries for tostones, and have never regretted the decision since.  These were pretty good too.  . . The restaurant itself though is a bit unfortunate.  It is narrow, and the tables are closely placed together.  Even though I was sitting down at my table, I always seemed to be in the way of the servers or runners.  Also, there was no place to put my jacket, backpack, scarf, or gloves.  It quickly became frustrating.  The service was more miss than hit too, with the waiter needing to be reminded of our requests each time we made them.  I will still give them four stars though for their delicious food, but I will recommend them for take out and not eat in service.
