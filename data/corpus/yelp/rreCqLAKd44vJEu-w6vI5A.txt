Restaurant: Los Nopales
Category: Mexican
Hidden amongst the Thai restaurants on Western, between Lawrence and Irving Park, sits a gem of a Mexican restaurant: Los Nopales. I've been living in Lincoln Square for about three years now; I have sampled all of the Thai places in this area, but I am ashamed to say that up until this past Saturday, I had never been to Los Nopales. I bury my head in embarrassment.. . My sexy lady friend and I were seated right away without reservations. We were given tortilla chips and the two salsa (we were especially impressed with the salsa verde, but both were delicious).. . For an appetizer, we had the ceviche, and while this is technically not a Mexican dish (it's Peruvian, if I am not mistaken...but don't quote me on that...uh oh, too late!) the ceviche was absolutely perfect. It has a perfect salt to sweet to spicy ratio. We serisouly could not stop talking about how good it was.. . For the entrees, the lady ordered chile rellenos and I had the camarones al chipotle. The shrimp was, again, cooked perfectly (not stringy or too chewy) and the chipotle sauce was spicy, smoky and sweet and complimented the shrimp very well.. . I also really like the fact that it's BYOB; You don't see too many Mexican places that are BYOB. Most of the time, Mexican places aren't BYOB. Instead, they feature huge ass frozen froo-froo fuck "margaritas," Corona and Dos Equis. It's nice to be able to bring a bottle of white wine (I thought that the bottle of Sauvignon Blanc went quite well the meal, especially the ceviche).. . Plus, they've got some really interesting pictures in the back dinning area. Chech out the painting of Jesus made out of people.
