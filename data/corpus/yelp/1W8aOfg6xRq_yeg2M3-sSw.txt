Two words. . . Fresh Horchata. . . Yeah, made in house. None of that powdered icky stuff. This is the real deal, all creamy and cold with just the right amount of sugar and cinnamon. I will seriously stop in just for a hug from Chico, and a glass of that goodness. I'm still trying to convince him to let me buy it by the gallon.
