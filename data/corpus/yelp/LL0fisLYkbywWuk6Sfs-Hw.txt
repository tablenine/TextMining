it didn't totally suck, but either chicago has bad sushi all around or the other chitown yelpers have no taste, because based on their reviews i went here and was supremely underwhelmed.  The service was quick, but when we truthfully answered her question of how our meal was (mediocre at best, nearly bad, honestly) she got all snippy and defensive and asked us if we had ever eaten japanese food before.  "Well," my girlfriend replied, "I grew up in Hawaii."  Nevermind we ordered everything in Japanese,  The oysters were sub-par New England muckies, the tuna was sliced too thin for sashimi, and the seaweed was too fresh (to a fault). And the rice was moist.  who wants loose sticky rice?   Highly disapointing. The gyoza were good, though.  I will not return here unless every other sushi place in town is worse, which will be quite a feat since i usually eat sashimi.
