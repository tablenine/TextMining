This was a fantastic meal. Don't waste the money to valet, there is plenty of neighborhood parking. This is a chic resaturant that offers a great menu; and great wine list. I ordered the stuffed zuchinni flowers, they were devine- perfectly crisp and flavorful. The pizza had a crisp, thin crust, my friend Erin ordered the classic Margheritta, and I the fennel saussage e panna; both spectacular. Great place Mario, love the cozy atmosphere- this seems more like a quaint restaurant in Southern Italy, not Southern California.
