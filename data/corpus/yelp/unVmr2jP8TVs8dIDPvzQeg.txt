Category: Thai
Food? Let's just say, that I think I have gained serious amount of weight due to Palms Thai. I have not seen Thai Elvis YET. Apparently, he only performs Wednesday- Sunday. Don't let the interior turn you off...sure it makes you feel like you are in junior high cafeteria BUT the food is the bomb.
