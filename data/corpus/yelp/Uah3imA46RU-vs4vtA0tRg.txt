From scrumptious cheese-balls to savory bacon-wrapped chicken, the appetizers are worth the extra bucks. I happened to order the Flat Iron Steak, but much to my disappointment, it was over-cooked. Still, the steak was flavorful and all was forgiven after a couple glasses of sangria along with the good service.
