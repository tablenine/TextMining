Reminds me of the cafeteria at a hospital. Nuff said. But we buy pounds of their corned beef for our St. Paddys day party every year cause there simply is no substitute for that wonderful menu gem. However, I must share with you the experience I had there last fall while enjoying a quiet morning brunch with the boy. I was forking at my cafeteria cole slaw in my beige-colored bowl, when a well-to-do family of mom, dad, daughter, and son-in-law sat down at a table five feet away from us. Didn't pay much attention to them, but was aware that the dad had a MASSIVE corned beef sammich on his tray, filled to the brim with meat. No biggie. But all that is wrong in this world and with people's idea of table manners and just plain "ickiness" came to be in a single moment...when the dad dropped half his corned beef on the floor, scraped it off the table leg below him, ignored his wife's comment of "you're not going to eat that, are you?", and continued his blissful munching without a single thought as to what he had just put in his mouth. Are you kidding me? I put my fork down, tried not to think about the last time that table leg had been thoroughly cleaned, and have been unable to return since. Call it a mind block, but I simply cannot go near that place without thinking of that rancid pig eating meat off the floor. People suck.
