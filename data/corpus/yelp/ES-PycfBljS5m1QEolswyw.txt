Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Sports Bars
I hate lengthy menus.  I like it when the chef actually makes a decision about what tastes best, and I don't have to.  I hate salad bars.  I hate choosing between 50 different burgers.  . . Anyway, Barney's Beanery is a fine place to meet friends for some drinks and food.  It's not particularly objectionable, it's not particularly delicious, it's just fine.  They seem like they have a lot of beers on tap, but it also seems that they don't have any special beers on tap.  . . So, a solid three stars.
