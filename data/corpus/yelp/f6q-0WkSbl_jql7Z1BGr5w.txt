Very cool, hip looking place serving Thai "tapas". One more on the small-plate gravy train that has swept Chicago.. . The space itself is cool. There is a bar area that looks like it will be a fun, funky little spot once they get their liquor licence. There's a dj that spins for the bar and dining room, so be warned: this is not a quiet place. The dj plus the open layout of the room make it a better spot for people watching than for having an intimate conversation with a date.. . Most of the food is great. We had about a half dozen of the small plates. The Hung Lea steak and seared scallops were favorites. The ginger calamari tasted over-flavored, rendering the flavor of the calamari itself indetectable. The same was true of the coconut-crusted shrimp. All coconut flavor, no shrimp.. . The service was very friendly, and the prices were fair. We got out with a $35 bill for our food for 2 people. All said, a good experience. I'm looking forward to seeing what this place will be like once it's got the bar up and running.
