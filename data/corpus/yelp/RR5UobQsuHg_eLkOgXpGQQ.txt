Man I love this place. I've only gone when I've been drinking in the area and by the time we get here, I'm drunk enough that anything greasy will hit the spot. . . I always get the NYC style sausage pizza. I don't remember if they offer other menu items. I get my pizza, sprinkle red pepper flakes, and process to shove it in my face. Soooo good.. . If I were sober, it would be way too greasy for me, even for pizza.
