For all the vegetarians out there, WHY GO HERE IF YOU DON"T LIKE MEAT!!  It's like me going to the best vegan/vegetarian place in the world and saying it was crap.  Or going to a seafood place an ordering a burger.. . Anyways for $17 I thought it was great.  I knew we were going there to eat meat and only meat.  And the meat was of pretty good quality for all you can eat.  I also knew that we were going to come out of there smelling like a bbq so I wore junk clothes.  I also knew that we were going to eat a lot so ate a small lunch.  Knowing all those things I was happy with this place.. . Things I didn't know that was good was we could smoke cigs in here because it is technically outdoors, lemon soju was made how I usually make it so that was good as well.  Wanted to try the pineapple soju as I haven't tried that before.. . This would be 5 stars if the sides were better.  But then again I came here for all you can eat meat not the sides.  I left full and very satisfied.  I also listened to my friend and found decently close street parking.  I must say that walk helped digest some of the food.
