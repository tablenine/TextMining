You're visiting your friend who is a high-powered Los Angeles attorney famous for defending C-level business executives that have been charged of killing endangered baby animals with fully automatic assault rifles. "Your honor!" he routinely exclaims. "Well I ain't no big-city lawyer, but I can tell you this much. Long as he didn't have a SCAR-H with a holographic sight equipped, ain't no way he could've teln if he was shootan at liddle penguins versus the penguin-like tarhgets he set up in the same area those otha liddle penguins was loytterin at!" He plays a lot of Modern Warfare 2.. . "I got money in my pocket. I got money on my block. I got the money and the power" he casually tells you as you get into his Darth-Vader Black Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4. He roars out of his private garage at 987hp and upon exiting, immediately plows over a passing pedestrian. "Well, aigh't nothing you could do about that!" he chuckles. He will take you, at around 150mph, to Canter's, where he tells you they make" the biggest and best-damned sandwiches in the world." Then, in your disbelief, he will order the Mish-Mash, a matzo-pasta combo served in a tiny bowl with mini-crackers. And you will laugh at him. Because they do make the biggest and best-damned sandwiches in the world And he ordered a Mish-Mash.
