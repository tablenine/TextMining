This place is still very popular so you'd better get there super early for a seat because they don't take reseravations for lunch.. Pizza and pasta are yummy and very reasonably priced.  Tapas style smaller dishes were okay.  Dessert is fabulous.  . It's a noisy place- huge dining hall and the noise just bounces right off the ceiling, glass walls and stone floors.  not good for an intimate date.
