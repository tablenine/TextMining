Restaurant: Crepe Revolution
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place is out of this world. Normally I've had poor experiences trying new things in Atlanta, either because of the food or because of the service. 9 times out of 10, if either is poor, I'm not going back. I honestly think we usually get crappy service because we dress casual and have lots of tattoos. Maybe I'm speculating, but I get the impression the servers think if we're not dressed like yuppies, we can't afford to tip. Sad too, my tattoos cost more than the average yuppie car. Their loss.... . Crepe Revolution excelled on both points. The service was immaculate, and the kitchen was definitely bringing the A-game. All the ingredients were fresh, everything was nicely balanced, the food was light, but still filling. We couldn't have been happier. . . Oddly, the prices were very low compared to what you got. We had apps, drinks, entrees and desserts, and still didn't break $50 pre-tip. Everyone there, including our server, was super nice. We actually ended up in casual conversation with a handful of the people that worked there, owner included as well.. . We'll be back for sure, and very often at that.
