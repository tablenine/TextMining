Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Imma see if I can write this review without clicking any stars - since this place clearly does not deserve to get the "pity vote" of even one singular celestial stand-in. Nay.. . But alas, it won't let me. Okay, fine. One. One star. Because tacos are fried. And we all know that anything-a taco, an empanada, a car--is always better after it's been sacrificed in cheap, scalding vegetable-type oil for three minutes or so.. . I'm from Chicago. Surprisingly not like New York. We have great Mexican food in this town - whether you are going to a sit down spot or any of the "La Pasaditas" - go to Chicago and you will know what I mean.. . So. There are no choices - only "meat". Meat and cheese. Meat and beans. I asked if they had avocadoes and they looked at me like I was tearing off my skin and was a member of V. Eighties V- dammit- none of this pathetic re-issue stuff.... . I could get into it more but all I have to say is that these people don't. carry. green. onions. or. cilantro. . . But I'm not stopping you from going here.. . But I wil say that Cinco de Mayo is right next door.
