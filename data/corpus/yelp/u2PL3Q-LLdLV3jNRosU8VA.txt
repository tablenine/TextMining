I haven't been here in YEARS. I used to live about a half block away, right at Roscoe and Clark, so we went there from time to time for late night snacks. Maybe I'm getting old because I don't got for late night snacks very often anymore. All things being equal, this is a fine establishment and I have many fond memories there. I remember them having good milkshakes or malts or something like that. Service was always excellent. This place just reminds me of that non-chain diner from a small town...except its in the middle of the north side.
