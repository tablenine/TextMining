I personally think this place is really great.  The sashimi here is pretty unbeatable in terms of freshness, taste, and quality.  They've gotten rather expensive (sad to say) but I still like to come here for really good sashimi.. . If you're looking for rolls, Sushi Gen isn't really the place to come for rolls packed with a billion things, i.e. Americanized.  It's all about pure, tasty sashimi with rice (i.e. chirashi deluxe, or sashimi deluxe, YUMMMY).. . My only complaint is the wait, but I suppose with any highly coveted restaurant in LA, the wait will always be impossibly long... If you make a reservation, do NOT be late, not even 5 minutes, otherwise you will be forced to wait with all the first-come first-served people.. . Also they have AWESOME green tea here :)
