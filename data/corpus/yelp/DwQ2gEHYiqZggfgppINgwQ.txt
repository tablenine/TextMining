Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
This place is a really a sight to behold. If I remember correctly, they have a section for bakery goods such as pastries, cakes, bread etc, and another section for coffee and pastries if you'd like to dine in. Lines are unbelievably long so anticipate the long wait for your goods. Their customer service is exceptional. They treat each with care and make sure they leave their bakery satisfied with their goodies. . . My personal favorite is the cheese danish. The flaky crust surrounding the cheese inside just falls apart in your mouth. My mouth is watering just by this review. mmmmm~. . My father's personal palette would be the french bread. Growing up in Brasil, he knows good french bread when he tastes one. And further compares Porto's french bread, with the ones "just like home". He goes there every Sunday for them with a side of coffee.. . All in all, this bakery delightful.. . Bathroom 4/5. Very clean!
