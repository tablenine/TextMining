Different.  . . I never thought that someone could put garlic in absolutely everything, and I mean everything.  The pesto-y garlic dipping sauce that is served with bread at every table was very strong... definitely requiring mouthwash to get rid of the garlic taste afterward.  The rest of my dinner was pretty good however.  The 40-clove garlic chicken was tasty as well as the garlic mashed potatoes.  I would have loved to have tried the garlic ice cream that everyone raves over, but the portions are large and I was stuffed by the end.  . . The ambiance of the restaurant is New Orleans mixed with carnival mixed with a palm reader's lair.  Service was good and parking convenient.
