Restaurant: Marietta Diner
Category: Diners
I find this place a bit pricey for a diner, but they do have lots of options, like everyone says.  Since the restaurant is run by Greeks, you get a free spanikopita appetizer which is pretty tasty.  They definitely have a great desert selection and they give you huge pieces, so split it with your honey.  Also, they keep it freezing in there, so bring a sweater, girls.
