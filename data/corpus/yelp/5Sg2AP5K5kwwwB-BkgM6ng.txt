Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
If you want to have a burger with a twist, this is the place. I got the Umami burger and and regular cut fries (they are cut huge!). The burger was cooked perfectly and juicy. We also ordered onion rings and thin fries which were ok. The thick cut fries were pretty good because you can actually really taste the potato...usually fries are just salt and bland, but this was different. I would come here again if someone suggested it but not crazy about it. Definitely different...a must try.
