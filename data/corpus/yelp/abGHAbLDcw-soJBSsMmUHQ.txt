Decided to get lost driving around the city, and passed this place. Name looked somewhat familiar, so I turned around. . . Sat at the bar, service was great. . . Best brisket I've had in the city. If the brisket burger is on the specials menu, have it. Then block off the rest of your day. Generous amount of meat, with the standard onion, pickles, tomatoes, plus melted pimento cheese, jalapeno mayo (yes, jalapenos. no salmonella here.), and two slices of bacon. Side of mac and cheese to garnish. . Found the will to eat the banana pudding after. Well worth it. . . Knowledgeable staff, friendly management. Standard lunch crowd, so parking/wait/etc. can be longer between 12 and 1. Â . . I'll be back.
