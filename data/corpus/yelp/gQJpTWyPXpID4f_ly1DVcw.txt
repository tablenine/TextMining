On a Saturday night, my boyfriend and I waited for an 1 hr, 20 minutes starting at 8:30PM. It was definitely NOT worth the wait....but since this place got the most ratings on Yelp by far - we decided to check it out.. . So when the ramen guy was loading up my noodles with a mountain of green onions, I started getting excited. Â However was soon disappointed by the soup. It needed more salt or lacked some kind of interesting dimension... but was so thick and creamy, oozing with piggy essence. that my brain went dead afterwords. If you don't want to go into a coma, or waste time waiting, do not come here. You'd be happier going to Shin Shen Gumi or Santouka.
