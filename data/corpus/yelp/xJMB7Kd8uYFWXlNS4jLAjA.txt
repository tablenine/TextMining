WARNING:  this place gets crowded.. . japanese food is not just sushi *rolling my eyes*.  i hate it when people say they love japanese food but think that sushi, teriyaki chicken, and tempura is all the cuisine is about.. . there is sooo much more.  japanese little dishes are the best.  course you have to know what to order.  depends on what you like..  but this is what one of my favorite meals in the whole world consists of:  beef tataki, agedashi tofu, karei karaage, nabe soboro.  don't forget the rice.  i order chicken wings when other people want it, but i'm not as in love with them as everyone else is.  maybe it's because i already know the best things on the menu (besides chicken wings). . . when it comes to food, believe me...i know what i'm talking about..  ;)
