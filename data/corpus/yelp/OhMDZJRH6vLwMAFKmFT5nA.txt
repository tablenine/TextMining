Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
With so many wonderful Mexican restaurants in Logan Square, it is always impossible to choose which one to go to.  El Cid is my go to option when I want cheap, casual Mexican food.  It is not the best Mexican out there, but the food is always consistent and good.  There are two El Cid locations, Kedzie and Milwaukee.  The Kedzie location is newer, cleaner, and cuter.  The Milwaukee location doesn't have the same charm, but I find the food to be a little bit better, with the exception of the refried beans.  If you are in the mood for tacos, enchiladas, or your standard Mexican fare, El Cid is a great place to go. My favorite is their cheese enchiladas, they are fantastic! El Cid is authentic, the service is always good, and it is very reasonable.
