For the mojitos alone, I must give them a 5 star rating!  I crave them every once in a while... who am I kidding, all the time actually :). . They put a stick of sugar cane (which I chew on to intensify the sugar taste) in the drink as a garnish and also, rim the glass with sugar.  It's almost like a dessert for me and I love my dessert!  . . Aside from the best mojitos, the shrimp adobe, tuna/watermelon ceviche, and steak chimichurri are my favorites.  The ambiance is very swanky which makes it a very lounge-y and fun place to hang!
