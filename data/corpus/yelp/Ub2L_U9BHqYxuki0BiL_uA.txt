This place is so yummy! Me and my friend ordered two one pound of shrimp. One was the cajun spice one and the other was the whole shabang. We ordered the Medium Spicyness. The cajun spice was so goooood! The whole Shabang was a bit disappointing though. Order the corn too, it was really good. Parking was bad, but I went there at 3 in the afternoon so there were plenty of parking on the streets. Me and my friend are going back this Friday. It was really good.
