Category: Food Stands
BIG PIECE OF ADVICE: If you are impatient, only have 1-2 hours to eat, are alone, and/or have no one to let you cut ahead, then maybe Kogi is NOT for you. . . Although Kogi has pretty good food, it comes along with a heavy price--LONG ASS LINES. I swear... i've never waited so long to just ORDER. It was like a disneyland line. My only complaint is that Kogi has a wait that's not very fun. I waited a total of 2 hours just to order... FUNNN! Although my situation is sort of unique..but that's another story... . Onto the pluses! Despite the sadistic wait, Kogi's food is pretty good although I believe that the food is overhyped. With a blend of Mexican and Korean culinary tastes, Kogi serves refreshing and unique entrees.. . The meat is succulent and i love the sauce that they put on everything! i dont know what it is, but it's YUMMAY! . . You will have to track down Kogi, but if you can get your hands on the food, DO IT. It's tasty on a new level. So haul your ass to the nearest Kogi location!. . Though, if you are going to have to wait 1+ hours, you may want to reconsider because unlike a restaurant, they have limited resources AND it has to be off to its next location. So... tough foodie love!. . Overall, Kogi is a must try. It's like an adventure trying to hunt it down (: but beware of the killer wait. You may be sinking your fangs into the short rib burrito of deliciousness, but Kogi makes you work for it.. . Recommendations: tacos! burritos! quesadilla! basically everything? HAHAHA
