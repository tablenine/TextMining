Restaurant: Willy&#39;s Mexicana Grill
Category: Mexican
It's just another chain like Moe's or Chipotle - not at all a place that I would frequent.  The food is prepared, then stuffed into plastic containers where it dries out completely, then it is packed into a tortilla that is soggy from the extreme steaming it got beforehand.  After that, dried overcooked rice is added as well as terrible produce.  Not to mention the way all of these chain mexican restaurants pack their burritos so miserably - first they make it ungodly huge that no human can take a bite out of properly, then the ingredients are all lined up on the burrito in a row, so each bite you only get one of the ingredients.  One bite is just rice, the next is just guac, then just meat.  In no way can anyone get a bite that includes all the ingredients.  Yeah, its clean, its quick, and makes you want to like it because everyone else does, but in reality, in your own mind, its terrible.
