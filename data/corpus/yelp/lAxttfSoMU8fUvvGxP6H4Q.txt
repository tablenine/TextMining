Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
joan's on third is a really good place to get a quick bite to eat.  be forewarned that this place is super popular at lunchtime and the weekends, so getting a table (most of them are outside on the sidewalk) can be a little challenging.  . . there is a bounty of prepared salads to choose from, as well as sandwiches and larger salads made to order.  i love ordering the 3 salad sampler, which consists of 3 salads of your choice.  the baked goods are yummy, too.  the espresso coffee cake is one of my favorites.  . . this place is a little pricey, although really no more so than comparable places.  if you have out-of towners visiting, this is a great place to take them for celeb sightings... there always seems to be one at lunchtime.
