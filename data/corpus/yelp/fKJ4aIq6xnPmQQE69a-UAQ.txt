This place is a nice little place. It is like a little shop. There are two things that I love to eat there. First one is the eel and rice. It is only $7 for eel and rice. Typically at a Japanese place, this would cost about $15. It is pretty good here. The Other things I really like is the chicken tenders. They are really crispy and good. This place is closed on Tuesday, and many times, it will take about 30 mins to get a table. The other food is pretty good, but these are really the only reason why I come.
