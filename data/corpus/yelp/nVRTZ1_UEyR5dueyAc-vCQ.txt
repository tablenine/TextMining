Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Way too expensive. I think this place is fast becoming one of those "tourist attractions".. . Don't get me wrong... the taste is decent. But not 20-times better as the prices suggest. "20-times better than what?" Well, what's available in Taiwan at one of those open-air restaurants with everyone sitting on cheap wooden stools around a broken plastic table that's missing one leg but instead has a broom handle tied in place of it. You might even spot a fat cockroach crawling on the ceiling scoping out all the people eating. Unfortunately, that will never happen in LA since the first sign of an "infestation" by rodents or cockroaches results in the shutting down of a restaurant for a thorough detox session. So, we can just dream on.. . BTW, notice how I'm not comparing this Din Tai Fung to the one in Taipei. Sorry guys, the one in Taipei is overrated too!
