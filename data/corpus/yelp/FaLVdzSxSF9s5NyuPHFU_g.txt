Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This is probably my favorite place in the world.. . Well, let me explain:. My favorite meal of the day is breakfast. If I could eat breakfast for dinner, I would. (and do!) . I love Hollywood and LA. "The Griddle" as my friends and I call it (as if there is another one?) is a fun hollywood type place to go to. Its right next to the WGA headquarters and lots of interesting hollywood (see:homeless and really rich) people walking around outside. . I love the outside patio!. Also my favorite breakfast food is chocolate-chip-banana pancakes.. This place just happens to have the best (and the largest) pancakes I've ever found!. . So, in review:. . PROS:. -Tasty, large portioned breakfast and lunch food. -Mimosa's AND french press coffee . -Outside seating (its quicker to get seated if you sit outside too!). -Friendly, Cute servers. -You can feed a family of 4 off of one order of pancakes.. -Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes (NO IT'S NOT ON THE MENU, but they will work with your needs. I think it comes to about 10 bucks when i order it.). . CONS:. -Parking can be hard to find  (on the street, or in the tiny parking lot behind it) though, not impossible, if you are patient.. -It will be very busy and crowded, and there will be a wait. Unless you go after noon. -BUT it closes early. No breakfast for dinner here, just breakfast and lunch! (Dang it!). -Don't expect the servers to have time to keep coming back to your table, they will come for the order, to drop of the food and to bring you your bill. THEY ARE BUSY!. . BUT ITS SO WORTH IT I PROMISE!!. . *also note, this is vegan-picky kid friendly menu! lots of options!
