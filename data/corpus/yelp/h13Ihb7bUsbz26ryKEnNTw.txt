Restaurant: The Modern
Category: French
Great RW Deal @ The Modern!. . The Squab squabbingly pokes fun at me for calling this Danny Meyer establishment the "Moderne".. . We went here for dinner during Summer 2008 Restaurant Week (reservations are a must).  For $35, you get an appetizer, smaller sized entree, and a dessert.  I ordered Arctic Char as my entree and was pleasantly surprised.. . The ambiance is very nice and trendy.. . Now that I'm finally reviewing here, I wonder why I haven't been back?
