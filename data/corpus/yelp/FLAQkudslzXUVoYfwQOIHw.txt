This was my first try at Algerian food.  I have to say it wasn't bad, although I prefer my crepes a bit more on the true french or Greek side.  The vegetable soup was delish and I love that they throw mint leaves in everything which is ultimately refreshing.  . . Decor was cute and very Mediterranean and it was bustling, which is good to see on a Saturday afternoon.  Definitely a good lunch spot after shopping in Uptown/Andersonville.
