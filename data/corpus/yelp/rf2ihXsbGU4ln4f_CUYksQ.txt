I've gone here a couple times and always found the atmosphere nice.  They have a jukebox which is somehow mysteriously synced to my cd collection circa '92-'95 (okay, okay, I admit it's all still on my iPod's rotation).  The service is good and they kindly kick out old drunk men who stumble in here, barely standing, after the Cubs games.  The downside with this place is the food is so overly greased, it literally turns the paper it sits on in the basket clear.  Yes, folks, just like that Simpsons episode, "if your paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain!"
