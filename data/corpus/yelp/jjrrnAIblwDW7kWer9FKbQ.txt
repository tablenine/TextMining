Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya has a good (although rather small) selection of Japanese dishes. I liked the setting and the decorations alot though! The waiters were very nice and quick. I came here with 2 friends and ordered tendon (very good), my friend ordered the special ramen (I forgot what it's called DX) and my other friend got the chahan. All were very good ^^ I will check out other restaurants when I go back to Little Tokyo, but I will be back here too :)
