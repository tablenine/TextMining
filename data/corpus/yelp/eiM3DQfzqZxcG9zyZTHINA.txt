Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I have been looking forward to Joan's ever since I saw a show at the Hollywood Bowl LAST summer and drooled over someone's Joan's picnic box.. . It was a beautiful Southern California day, parking was too easy, and I hurriedly scurried across the street to get to Joan's, nearly leaving my husband behind. I get pretty excited for food. When we got inside we were greeted with a delightful selection of my favorite thing in the world... cheese! There is just about everything that I love to spend too much money on in the market area...chocolate, coffee, tea, vanilla extract/baking goods, olive oil, et cetera. and then there's the dessert counter... OMG.. . I got a chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting, my husband got some berry cake and it was delicious. for our main course we enjoyed a tuna melt (the best tuna I've ever had in a restaurant. ever!) and a pressed chicken, bacon and brie (with caramelized onions!). They were the best sandwiches we've ever had, ever.. . I can't wait to come back to Joan's. The seating situation was a bit competitive, but SO worth it. a lovely place, delicious food, a lot of fun.. . Forgot to mention: also some amazing black iced tea.
