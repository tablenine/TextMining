Bossa Nova, how I love thee!. . First off, I love Brazil, the people, the cities, the lands, holly crap their bars!!!!  . . So what's to love about Bossa Nova?  . . The place is beautiful, not elegant, but just beautiful, a combination of indoor/outdoor feel, very nice.  . . The food is freakin fenomenal!  (yes I know, f for emphasis, cmon ppl please!) I have stated before, I am a Pizza fanatic and Bossa Nova has some of the best Pizza in the LA area.  . . Now, I need to start a list of the best chocolate mousse, for you chocolate lovers, and guess what, Bossa Nova would be in my top three in the whole Southern California area, is a worth a 30 minute drive from the valley to Hollywood for a serious chocolate craving?  F-YEAH!!. . Love the fact that this place is open late, I mean flippin FOUR AM late.  That, is when every place should close in Hollywood man, I mean seriously!!. . The ladies usually love the Platanos, fried plantains for the non-latinos, but if you have never had them, please try them.  . . To top it off, one of the best drinks in this world, comes straight out of Brazil.  Now, stateside have I found an authentic Caipiriniha? No.  Honestly, no, but Bossa Nova's Caipiriniha is pretty dam close.. . Little bit of Brazil, right here in Hollywood!
