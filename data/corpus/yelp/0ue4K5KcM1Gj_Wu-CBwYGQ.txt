The food here isn't bad, but it's not exceptional. The service is usually pretty mediocre, but with good reason as they seem constantly understaffed. I can't really fault them for that, but I'm generally impatient and it's worth noting if you are on a severe time constraint. Really, I can't understand anyone going here during normal daytime hours, but hey, if you're drunk and are down for hanging with tranny's and other assorted characters in the middle of the night, this is the place to go.
