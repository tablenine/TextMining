I like the atmosphere. It's not over frilly or presumptuous. With the exception of the large fountain crammed into the entrance of the patio-ish area. Fire hazard.. . The food is good- every item on the menu including the pizza, pasta, and salads.... . It's open til 4 am! Nothing unique to say that hasn't been said..
