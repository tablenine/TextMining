The space is extremely tiny-- but the huge, deep, juicy, crisp flavor of the sandwiches make up for that. My two friends and I were lucky enough to get a table in the far corner. I ordered the extra spicy catfish sandwich, which was a very delicious, memorable sandwich filled with cilantro, carrots, spiced catfish, siracha, jalape√±os, red onions, and some other ingredients I can't remember at the moment ( but it was SPICY-- I thought I could handle it, but its pretty tough to eat it without gulping down water between every two bites). . . Our server was quick, efficient, and curt-- no time to be all friendly and nice. The place was crowded with lines trailing down the block . . Overall, a great place-- its fast paced service make it ideal for a quick take out lunch or dinner.
