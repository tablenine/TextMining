this place looks nothing like the old Newport...it looks way more modern and stylish...and the food is just as good!!!  we had a banquet style meal and almost all the dishes were pretty darn good, especially the lobster! =)  i am going to take my parents here one of these days since they have never been.  i recommend this place to anyone who likes good food! haha
