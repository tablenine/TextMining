Well, I finally hunted and captured some tacos from the unicorn known as Kogi taco trucks (thanks to their expansion) and.... I dont think ill be trading kogi visits for any regular visits to my taco truck any time soon. . . Sorry! . Its a great idea and the people are nice but the fact that it lacks convenience (its never in a stable location I could swing by in a half-asleep daze), is constantly surrounded by "all-knowing" college foodies and just isnt as supremely awesome as its touted to be makes me stick to a 3-star rating. . . Ive had it twice and the tacos are pretty good, but for me, they're always soaked in a super salty sauce that if left unattended for a few minutes, renders the taco soggy. The meat on my pork and beef tacos were drowned in it and the meat really doesn't speak for itself. . The (what im calling)"slaw" on top of the tacos has a nice spice to it but is reminiscent of "asian chicken salad" at a chain restaurant. . I've tried bites of friend's burritos and i think that if im having kogi again, i'll opt for a burrito. . . Maybe its the fact im not a fan of food attempts at "fusion". At best, It's kinda like if you were to go to an american chain restaurant and they had a "asian-blankity-blank" dish. Â Its edible, its not disgusting by any means but im not about to go hunting it down just to have it again. . . If Kogi could pull up right in front of my house (kinda like how they do, or maybe used to do, near the student housing at UCLA) then sure, I'll eat it again. As for looking it up on twitter and driving to it within that 2 1/2 hour window--no thanks.
