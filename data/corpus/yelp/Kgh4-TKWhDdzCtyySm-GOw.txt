So as most people in the SGV (San Gabriel Valley) already know, Savoy is infamous for its Hainan Chicken Rice. DUH! It's pretty good but I would have to say that I'm a bigger fan of the rice itself (since it's cooked with chicken broth) than I am of the actualy chicken. However, I like how you can choose whether you want dark/white meat... otherwise they usually just give you half and half. Â It comes with different dipping sauces but I prefer to use the oil one with the mashed up green onion and ginger in it. The darker "soy sauce" -like concoction is also quite good.. . I also love their conch and proscuitto pasta which I usually get with the white wine and garlic sauce as opposed to the marina. Yum! . . Usually don't order coffee with my meal but their Iced Cappucino is dee-lish! Get it! Their Curry Beef is also quite tasty so give that a shot as well. . . Cute place to meet up with a friend for a quick dinner but be prepared to wait outside... helllaaaa dinky.
