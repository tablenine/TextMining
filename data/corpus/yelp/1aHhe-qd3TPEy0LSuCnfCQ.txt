Went here on this past Monday to get a salad after I enjoyed a matinee across the street at Culver City Plaza 12. Great food, quick service. 4 stars because the prices are a bit high in my humble opinion. I paid $10 for the chicken cobb which was pretty yummy with the warm chicken on top, etc. Also, after reading the review who gave it 1 stars (a few reviews below me) I a skeptical of going back. I don't want to find live varmints in my salad...especially caterpillars!
