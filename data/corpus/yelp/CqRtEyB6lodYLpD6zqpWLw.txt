Thoughts:. . A garlic lover's dream.. Food is great.. Love the garlic ice cream!! (Side note: Even though you love garlic, it does not guarantee that you will like the garlic ice cream.). Service is not consistent, there are some douchey servers.. Fun decor.. Valet parking.. Ask BF to take me soon!!
