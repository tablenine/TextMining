This is probably the only Chinese restaurant I have given 4 stars to. And the main reason is the Old World Egg rolls are the bomb. It is listed as an appetizer, but you get 2 burrito sized egg rolls with hot mustard and sweet sauce per order. They are huge and you can actually taste all the ingredients and see them. Even the shrimp.. . The rest of the food meets my standards as well. Probably the best Chinese I've had in the city. Including China Grill, which gets 2 stars for being way overpriced.
