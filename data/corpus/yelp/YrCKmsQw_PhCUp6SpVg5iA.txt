This place is as good as everybody says. I had the Brisket Plate with Mac n Cheese &amp; Baked Beans. It was excellent. Great service. The brisket was full of flavor &amp; really tender. The Mac n Cheese &amp; Baked Beans were delicious. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE their BBQ Sauce, especially the Carolina vinegar based sauce. I loved my entire meal &amp; will go here a million more times.
