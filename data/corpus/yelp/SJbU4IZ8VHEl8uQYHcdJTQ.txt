Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
Wow. Another amazing find in the Chicago dining scene.  Las Tablas is a Colombian steakhouse with a beautiful interior, great service and kick ass food.  . . We were seated immediately and ordered a couple of appetizers, the empanada combination plate (a sampling of beef, chicken and cheese...the chicken was the best I thought) and the Arepa Chorriada, which was melted cheese over arepa (basically a cornbread)  sautéed in criolla sauce.  We then decided to go with the Picada Colombiana, which according to the menu serves two.  Two what? Two Chicago Bear linebackers? Two starving Japanese sumo wrestlers?  Oh my god people, seriously this is a TON of food.  Believe me when I say you are NOT going to want to order appetizers, dessert, or any other extraneous foodie items if you get this entree. . . A heaping helping combination of  Entraña skirt steak, rib-eye steak, pork loin, and chicken breast all grilled and sliced into small pieces.  Also comes with homemade chorizo, pork ribs, arepa, crunchy green plantain, fried sweet plantain, yuca and potato. . . Delicious yes...stomach busting...Oh.My.God. Yes. We had more than half wrapped up to take with us...it was just too much. But I have to say I found the chicken, the crunchy plantain and the skirt steak to be the stars of the show.  Especially if you add the Chimichurri sauce.  The flavours just explode in your mouth...yum!. . My one gripe is that they are not BYOB but they will let you bring in a bottle of wine for an $8 corkage fee.  OK that's just stupid and please do away with that option, Las Tablas.  It is completely unnecessary and kind of makes you look like jerks when you really aren't! . . Thanks for a great experience, we will definitely be back!
