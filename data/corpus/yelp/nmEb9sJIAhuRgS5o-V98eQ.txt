Category: Sandwiches
Philippes, a part of an imaginary (probably) by-gone (definitely) era, Americana at its sawdust-on-the-floor best.  The sandwiches are delicious, the prices are reasonable and the staff incomparable.  I ate there just the other day and the waitress who served me upon my first visit in 1993 was still there, carving away, double-dipping (that's the best secret for a sandwich ask for DOUBLE DIPPED which means 2X the au jus) and smiling.  I mentioned to her that she was the server on my first visit so many years ago.  A few minutes later, she reappeared, at my table, with a Buddha and a hug and effusive thanks for remembering her and saying something about it.  That is the potential experience you might have any time you go, great food and even better service.  The lamb, double-dipped, with blue cheese is my favorite sandwich.  Their breads, their pies, their cole slaw, pasta salads, ALL made right there.  Each day.  Freshness that even In-N-Out would be hard pressed to surpass!  You can't go wrong here!
