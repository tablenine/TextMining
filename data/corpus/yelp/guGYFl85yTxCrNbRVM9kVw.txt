because of quentin tarantino i love diners. i've often dreamed of gathering with my cohorts in a nondescript diner plotting our next big score; belittling each other about our given code names and arguing about the validity of leaving a tip.. . anyway, i thought it was peculiar that a deli would have curb side pick-up. i brushed it off as just another la thing. when i found langers, i quickly learned why. the area around langers looks like a parade just went by. a parade of rioters that is. i see why most people review this place at their lunch hour and not dinner. the only way i would come here for dinner is if costco's started selling bullet proof vests. i'm sure you think i'm exaggerating and to an extent i am. but i think it would be best if you carried your car keys with your finger on the panic button. parking is on 7th and westlake. 1 hr free with langers validation. . . of course i ordered the #13; pastrami w/ cole slaw. there are debates that a pastrami sandwich should only be served with sauerkraut, and this and not that.. blah blah blah. Â "whatever!, i do what i want!" . the pastrami was excellent. i'm no pastrami expert but the meat was thick, tender and exploding with flavor. however, because the sandwich is so massive, the bottom half of the second half of the sandwich can get rather soggy. but that necessarily isn't a bad thing depending on how you look at it. . . my only beef (pun intended) is that this sandwich is $14. just the sandwich, sides are extra. it really was a phenomenal pastrami sandwich but for $14 at least lie to me and tell me it was beef from one of those talking happy california cows. or better yet, a bull who killed a matador. something that my gang and i can bicker over while we insist that the guy who drove here in the miata has to be mr. pink.
