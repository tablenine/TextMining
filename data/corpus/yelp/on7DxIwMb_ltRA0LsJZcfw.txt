Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
When I moved to Atlanta from Florida, one of the things I missed most was good Cuban food.  Thankfully, I've got Las Palmeras within walking distance to my house!  They're tucked away in the Midtown neighborhood.. . Las Palmeras makes authentic Cuban standbys like empanadas, rotisserie chicken, masitas de puerco, and boliche.  Most entrees include sides of rice and black beans as well as deliciously sweet and gooey plantains.. . They have a huge patio, which is awesome to sit back and watch the stars while having a great meal.
