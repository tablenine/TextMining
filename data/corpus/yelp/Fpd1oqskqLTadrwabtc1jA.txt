I absolutely love this old Hollywood breakfast house. It is hyped, and you will have to wait to get seated - but I think you'll find it's worth it. The pancakes are enormous and come in every variety you can imagine. We had a contest to see who could finish them because they are just packed with fruit and nuts and carbolicious goodness. The scrambles are also amazing - especially with plenty of hot sauce. The french press coffee just adds to the fun charm of this greasy little diner. The interior is loud and exciting and everyone seems to be celebrating the joys of a wondrous late morning breakfast. Good people-watching while you're waiting on the sidewalk too.. . Scrumptious, charming, Hollywood legend.
