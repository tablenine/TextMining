Spent most of my 20's at this Hollywood staple after a heavy night of drinking.  Stoppped by after a meeting late night.  . .  For Breakfast I order the Matzo Ball and a bagel w/the lox and cheese a cup of joe and a side of cottage cheese.  For lunch I always ordered a sandwhich, either pastrami on rye, french dip with the aujou sauce and a order of fries.  Good place to watch the old and the new may even spot a few celebs on occasion.
