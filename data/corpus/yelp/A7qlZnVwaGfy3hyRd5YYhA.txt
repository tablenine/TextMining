Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
One night, you will go to Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles with a group of your friends. You will sit next to a 94 pound French girl who is studying for her PhD in Existentialism. She will eat twice the amount of chicken, waffles, biscuits and eggs that you do. You will try to keep up with her, but you can't. You will be embarrassed and shamed, as you should be. Later that night, when you are vomiting off the rooftop of a 50-story downtown Los Angeles housing facility, your friends, who are floating lazily about in a freshly heated jacuzzi drinking Mccallan 18 year old single malt straight from the bottle, will laugh at you. But, the last laugh is on them. Because Roscoe's tastes just as good coming up as it does going down.
