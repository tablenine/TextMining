Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
The moment you walk into Soowon you know you're in for a treat.  First off they have this really hot hostess with a quirky personality working the front of the store.  Usually I'm skeptical of these type of places but all my worries were dispelled when they brought out the meat.. . We ordered a combo B between 5 people which included brisket, marinated galbi, thin sliced dekkle, pork neck meat, and soup.  The meat, presented on a glistening white platter, looked delectably fresh and finely marbleized.  The pork neck meat was a real surprise as I have never had that cut of the swine.  It is much richer and more sinful than the classic pork belly.  The meat literally melts in your mouth.  Couple this with some kimchi fried on the pan, and you have a flavor explosion of unparalleled heights.  (make sure you ask for the fermented kimchi, special just for the pork) . . Have a bit of soju with your meal and you will be rolling yourself out of the restaurant in sheer ecstasy.  Really rolling.  Go get some!. . -TK
