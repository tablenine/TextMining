Warning: Shout out to Detroit.. . Ever been to the Bread Basket? They have the best blintzes. Ever. Show me a blintz not from Bread Basket and I will show you a sub-standard blintz.. . Enter Langer's. A food critic at the New York Times said it was the best pastrami sandwich IN THE WORLD. That's pretty high praise, but I had other menu items on my mind. I had the blinders on as I walked into Langers (PARKING IS FREE FOR THE FIRST HOUR SO CHILL OUT EVERYONE). Ordered the blintzes, got them quickly, ate them even more quickly. Turned around in my seat and saw Mr. T. Apparently it's one of his favorite places. Good enough for me.. . As for the blintzes; not the same as Bread Basket but pretty damned tasty. Tried some of my friend's pastrami and was delicious (like I expected). If you're into deli food, you need to hit this place up. A little cheaper than Jerry's which is refreshing.
