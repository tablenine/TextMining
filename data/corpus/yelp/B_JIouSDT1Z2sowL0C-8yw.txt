TDF french toast! At first I thought, well, what's so special about pancakes and french toast? After looking through the extensive menu (which includes colossal creations packed with ingredients such as oreos, pumpkin, kahlua, banana, streusel, coconut, etc), my friend and I ordered Mom's French Toast, 'Tis the Season (the pumpkin pancake), Banana Nana, and The Golden Ticket (amped up version of Banana Nana). The star of the meal was definitely the french toast, as I have to say that this is hands down, the best french toast I have ever had! I echo another reviewer's sentiments: whose mom makes french toast like this???!! I know my mom didn't. Not even close! The pumpkin pancake was good, but I'd skip the Banana Nana, since I could barely taste the banana. Nevertheless, it was a sinfully delicious meal. I'm definitely trying out the french toast options next time!. . I came in a little before 9AM on a weekday, and there was no wait to be seated. However, it was starting to fill up, and I had trouble flagging down my waiter for service at times. So service could be a bit spotty, but I would definitely come back for food. Maybe takeout next time?
