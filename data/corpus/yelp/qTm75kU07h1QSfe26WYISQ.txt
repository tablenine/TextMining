Why must everything close so early? . I want a late night sober up meal. . This is where Fred 62 comes in...I automatically give stars for being open forever thumbs up on that buddies. . Food is OK. Kinda pricey but after a night of partying $15 on a meal is cheaper then a $1500 bill from the state of California and a night a jail cozying up with a hooker and a toilet paper roll blankey.....courtesy of driving under the influence. So a $15 greasy slimy meal sounds fantastic!! . Chicken sandwich-greasy as shit. A patty melt-greasy as shit and gave me a little bit of poo poos...I wont go as far to blame beef with grilled onions though....I think it was the gross ranch.
