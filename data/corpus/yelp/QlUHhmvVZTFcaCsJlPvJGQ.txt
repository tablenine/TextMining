I finally got to eat at this place.  The last couple of times I tried, the wait was waaaayyy to long to wait for.. . I popped in there around 130pm for a Tuesday afternoon lunch with a buddy.  We walked in to find a near full house, but 2 open seats at the bar and we slid right in.  The bartender was gracious &amp; very helpful.  We ordered tap water that came in these nicely chilled bottles.. . Since we were there for our lunch hour, we decided to grab a couple of quick pizzas.  Although they weren't the quickest, we soon found out why.  The crust was perfectly baked &amp; well worth the wait.  I ordered a spicy salame pizza w/red peppers which had enough kick to make me break a little sweat.  My buddy ordered a new take on a hawaiian that had a gourmet hamlike meat with pineapples &amp; thin slices of jalapeno.  Both pizzas were delicious!  Great mix of ingredients &amp; very carefully distributed.  Just like everything else in the restaurant, the food was finely detailed &amp; placed intentionally.  From the paper place settings, to the decor, and to the furniture---great details all around.  Definitely the most uppity pizza joint I've been to.  Not the best pizza...but for what it is---a gourmet pizza joint for a different class of joes...its great.. . I'm more of a Village Pizzeria or Greco's kind of guy.  But I certainly enjoyed my trip to Mozza.  The next time I'm willing to drop $16 on a personal pizza, I'm going back...
