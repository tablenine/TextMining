When it first opened, my friends and I would stop by for lunch almost once a week. Lunch plate/boat + boba drink = one happy and stuffed stomach. After a while, though, it got old and we stopped coming by regularly. The food is still good, but I think we just got tired of fighting the crowds. The boba is still good, though for sheer taste of milk tea I prefer Tealeaf in old Chinatown.. . Have they moved yet?
