The food was good and the atmosphere was fun, but it's pricey!  We ordered the rack of lamb plate with polenta and pistachio pesto for $18, imagining this must be a sizeable portion, but it turned out to be two small pieces of lamb that yielded about 3 bites each with a big ball of polenta and the pesto sauce.  It was very good, but $18??  We also had lovely grilled asparagus with romesco sauce, Argentine empanadas, eggplant stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes and topped with crema, and the seafood paella.  Everything was quite good, except that it was kind of expensive.  Definitely worth trying at least once, though!. . Validated parking lot available just up the street.  Be sure to make a reservation ahead of time--you can do this online through their website.  At 4:45 on a Sunday, we made a reservation for 6:15 without any issue.  When we arrived, other people who came without reservations were being asked to wait 25-45 minutes!  Customers' dress style varied from very casual to dressy.
