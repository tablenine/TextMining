Hallelujah, cheap delicious crab rangoon!  My sisters and brothers, a light has shone on the humble Thai restaurant just steps from my L stop, a beacon of fellowship, fast friendly service and foodie-love that called my name, that beckoned me as a burning bush THREE TIMES this week to indulge in their heavenly tasting and practically free crab rangoon!  Can I get an AMEN?!  Six, I'll say it again, SIX delightful fried pockets of salvation for a mere $3.95... the pearly gates opened and I found my Nirvana.  And a mean green curry as well.
