Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
In order for a business to be successful you have to do one thing better than anyone on a consistent basis and have a real vision for what your customers want that thing to be. There is a market for Gen. . Sushi Gen is traditional Japanese to the very core, nothing more, nothing less.  The sushi is a good, fresh, quality grade but nothing really got my attention. No vibe.. I've been to at least a hundred Japanese restaurants in my life. Ninety of them were exactly like this one.  It's the other 10 that I remember fondly. This is not one of them. . . Parking is $2.50
