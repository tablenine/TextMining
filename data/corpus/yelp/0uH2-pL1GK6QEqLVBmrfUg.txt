Let's talk.  It is overwhelmingly pompous.  The matire'd was STUNNING in his general air of "asshole."  The bar was empty, because we were forced into such an early reservation.  I refused to stare at any patrons and act as if I have remotely gave a crap about how the looked, what (who?) they were wearing, etc.. . But, here's what happened.  Our waitstaff was competent, efficient, and totally humorless (I guess some people are into that?).  The saving grace was the food, which I thought was excellent, particularly the appetizers.  Standouts include: chicken salad (seriously), chicken samaosas, pork potstickers, coconut shrimp, vegetable chow fun (outstanding), and crispy curry chicken.. . Drinks are weak and overprices.  Go for the food and screw everything else.
