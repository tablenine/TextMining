Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's has one of the best tacos in Southern California.  And if you're from LA, you know that's saying something.  No matter what time of day I've gone, there is always a huge line.  They have like 5 things on their menu and they do them well (kind of like In-N-Out).  Their shells are fried to perfection, the taco meat is shredded beef that is perfectly marinated and fried.  The only improvements I would make would be to add sour cream &amp; green onions . . . but maybe that would make it too TacoBell-esque.  They also make their own tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa which are excellent as well.  . . Just make sure you don't end up goign to the taco stand that is right next to Tito's.  That place serves not only tacos, but hamburgers, philly cheese steak, and if I bothered to look more closely I'd probably find that they have chinese food on the menu as well.  If you are standing in front of this stand (which will undoubtedly be deserted) turn around and you'll see the crowd lined up in front of the place you want to be.
