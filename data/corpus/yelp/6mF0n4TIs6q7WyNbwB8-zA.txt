Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Ford's Filling Station has run out of gas! . This is the 4th time I've eaten at Ford's and my last. My friend and I each separately ordered a beet and fig main course salad. Mine had no beets, and her salad had no fig. For a main course salad, it was BLAND. The dressing had no flavor. There was nothing to compliment the figs/beets . . . a candied pecan or crumbled blue or goat cheese would have been nice. I could have made a snappier salad at home.  When we complained, it was explained to us that the chef was on "vacation". Then they also said that both of our salads were tossed together hence the lack of even dispersing of beet and fig.  Our waiter was nice, but did not offer to get the manager. The hostess came by and asked us how our meal was, and upon our feedback and said- "Oh, I"m sorry. It's really meant to be a side salad" . . . for $11.00? I don't think so.  Then I gave them more feedback upon leaving and politely asked to see the manager upon which no one was really not going to do. I said that I felt that given the level of banality of the food it would have been nice if they'd offer to take one entree off the bill or at least offer us a free dessert.  But there was nothing, but again simply a "sorry."  Well, sorry I won't continue to be a Ford's patron.
