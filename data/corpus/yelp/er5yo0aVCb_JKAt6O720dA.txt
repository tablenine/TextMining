Restaurant: Highland Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Highland Bakery is my newest obsession and I don't think it will subside anytime in the near future. . In the course of 3 weeks I went 3 times for breakfast and 2 times for lunch. Each and every time my egg whites were perfect, the grits unbelievable, and my sandwiches out of this world. . When out of towners come visit we take them here now for a great start to the morning or a midday snack. The muffins and cupcakes alone are worth paying this fine establishment a visit!
