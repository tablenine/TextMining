Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
The Little Door:. . 1. Romantical to say the least (especially on the patio). 2.The wine selection is mouthwatering. 3. Service...great. 4. Skip the apps and meals and go for the $50 appetizer platter and a good bottle of wine. It's more than enough food for 2 people (way more) and it's fun trying all the different foods. Makes for a great date, I would know since I've done the same with 3. HA!. . Definitely one of the best all around restaurants in LA! It's in my top 2.
