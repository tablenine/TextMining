sushi sushi sushi... mmmmm. . I love sushi and this place hit the spot. The prices were a bit pricey for the small portions but overall delish.. . Appetizer: We ordered the pepper something. It was REALLY good. I was skeptical because it's peppers and I'm not big on pepper-spiciness... but it was REALLY GOOD. get errrrrrr. . Entree: We ordered the red samurai roll which is definitly the thing to try. All the servers will recommend it. It even tastes healthy with it's sauce. Ocean Dragon--- mmmmmmm.... good. But seems like I've had this roll a million times at other restaurants. Sweet and good though. Red Robin???? Some tempura flake roll.. not bad, larger roll (3/5 rating in my book) NEW HOUSE roll... some new roll they came up with with lobster, seaweed salad, peppers... don't get it-- texture and taste wasn't pleasant. . . Dessert: molten chocolate cake.. MELTS in your freaking mouth. def get it. . . Wine: wine is wine... riesling was the normal. didn't sake it up this time. . . Atmosphere: madddd chill. Def a nice date place or a cute get together place. The music was a bit loud but necessary since the tables are so freaking close to each other. Music drowns out others conversations so you can actually feel somewhat separated from other tables. The lighting was really dark. Hard to see the menu at times.. . Service: all the servers were dudes.... eye candy :). . Overall: good for pricey rolls and not bad for a upscale sushi restaurant in hollywood.
