The mood of this restaurant is great, dark but warm. Their food was well prepared, I got the chicken egg drop soup and hanan beef. The soup was nothing like I've had before, it had a slightly sweet taste, like sweet corn. Hanan beef had plenty of flavor to it and the serving sizes would feed more than one person.. I'd definitely go there again.
