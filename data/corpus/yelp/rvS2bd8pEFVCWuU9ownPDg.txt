Great ambiance and tasty food but it's way too pricey!  Should a side of jambalaya really cost $8.95 when it's the size of a small cereal bowl?  . . I have no quips about the quality of their cooking -- we ordered a Louisiana Soul Deluxe plate with cup of gumbo, a side of Mardi Gras Jambalaya , an Angry Chicken Po' Boy, and finished with a slice of chocolate pecan pie.  All were tasty and satisfying (I would order the entrees anytime again) BUT it was hard to swallow a $60 lunch bill....
