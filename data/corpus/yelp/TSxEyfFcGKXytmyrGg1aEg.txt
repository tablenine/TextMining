Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
amazing.. a friend suggested this sandwich shop and as a vegan, i got scared, however i was able to look up the menu beforehand and found out quickly it was very vegan and vegetarian friendly.. however, when we arrived i did not expect it to be half as nice as it was! i was expecting subway/jimmy john's inside but no way.. the beer list was from heaven. so many too choose from. same with the sammiches!. so good and so addictive!. the only thing i wish they'd add is vegan cheese, then i'm pretty sure this would be my favorite restaurant in the city.
