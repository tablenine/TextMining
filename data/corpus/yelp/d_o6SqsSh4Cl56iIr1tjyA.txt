When you come to Buddha Bar..,you enter a whole new world. It's romantic, hip, eerie, trendy....all of that combined. Music, beautiful asian decor , dressed to impress people sets the mood. When you're in the restaurant, you never know what time it is as there are no windows. I think they try and make you 'get lost' in this place and have a total 'different world' experience. Too bad the food is just bland to say the least. . . You can get a better deal and tastier asian food at Panda Express (and no, I'm not a major fan of the mall chinese food chain). The price...not worth the food.One night there were only 3 guest in my party and we racked up a $600 bill!!! Absolutely not worth going there for dinner. However, if you like good drinks/ bar- lounge, trendy atmosphere/ get all dressed up to the nine to socialize with people from all over the world/ and be aware of the A-list celebrities that might be seated at the VIP section...this is the place for you. Definately come here for the drinks and the socializing, but my suggestion is to eat somewhere else first.
