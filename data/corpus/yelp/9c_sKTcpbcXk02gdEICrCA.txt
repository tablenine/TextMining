NOTE: Originally posted at . http://www.food4talk.com.  on  Feb 1, 2009. . On Friday, January 30, 2009, Reva, Charlie and I went to Opera Restaurant to Celebrate the Year of the Ox.   Reva had the soup of the day, which was Oxtail soup.  For her entree, she had a noodle dish but I cannot remember the name at the moment.  Charlie and I shared the Beijing Five Spiced Short Ribs and we both ordered the salmon.. . Although, it was a very good dining experience,  I am not sure I would have called it a Chinese restaurant but a Chinese-inspired restaurant.  There also was something missing that I cannot put my finger on.  It's like a dance movement or a piece of music that is technically very good and the artist does everything right but it doesn't move or inspire me.  That's what I felt about Opera.   Seeing the decor, which is exquiste, was worth the trip.
