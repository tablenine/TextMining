I dont know where to begin.  I want to cry whenever I think of Porto's.  When I describe food as orgasmic, it is really that good and Porto's is orgasmic.  I really want some right now but I am 300+ miles away.  If I lived anywhere within an hour of Porto's, I would make pilgrimages to pay homage at least twice a week (I figure I would be able to stock up with 3 boxes a visit).. . I discovered Porto's on a business trip when I was trying to find a supplier of local baked goods in the LA area and man, did I luck out.  I was on a two day business trip and staying near LAX and went to Porto's 3 times (it is that good).. . Go here and try in this order:. . 1. Cheese roll. 2. Potato ball. 3. Sandwich. 4. Everything else. . Prepare for a sugar over load and a possible coma after going to Porto's but you must go!
