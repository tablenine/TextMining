Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I'm over letting Asian restaurants off the hook for bad service just because they're Asian.  Manna was too crowded and the ladies were rushed and really busy, which is no wonder why they were irritated and literally  throwing the dishes of banchan down on the table.  . The kalbi was tasty, but the lame service, techno music, and having to share the table with a party of strangers due to lack of seating, did not make for the best dining experience.  I was there with my family, but  I'd probably give this place 3 or 4 stars if I were just some hungry dude eating and drinking with a bunch of my bros who like really bad techno and funky cuts of bulgogi.
