Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I heard so many good things about the burgers from the Father's Office. My automatic assumption of the place was that it was a diner. Then I heard that there's no table service. Then I went, WTF? What kind of a food place is this?. . So I went with two friends at 5:30 on a weeknight. We found out that this isn't a burger joint nor a diner; it was a pub, and they only had ONE burger.. Fine, I said. I'll take that burger. And some sweet potato fries.. . Their burger is VERY untraditional. So if you're looking for a good ol' American style burger, stay away.. They use french bread as the bun, baby arugula instead of lettuce, maytag blue cheese + gruyere cheese instead of sliced "american" cheddar, and caramelized (almost turned black) onions instead of raw or grilled onions.. The taste? One of a kind. . The sweet potato fries were also amazing. On par or better than those from Barney's. The blue cheese dressing that comes with their fries are very tasty too.. . As for drinks, they have great non-traditional (again) beers from breweries all over the world. When I say all over the world, I mean anywhere from Hiroshima, Japan to Pasadena, California. All craft breweries. No Coors Lite, no Blue Moon, no Heineken, no Stella. All the beers tend to be malty (not lager-like), so If you are not a huge beer fan, you might not appreciate them as much.. Go for the 1903 pre-prohibition lager or the Alaskan Amber (personal fav). . . They also have wine in both glass and bottle, and some classic cocktails like martini and sidecar. . . They tend to get VERY populated at nights and especially on the weekend nights. Very populated = easy 1+ hr of waiting. So brace yourself, or come early, or be lucky.. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.
