Best addition to downtown!. . It's my new favorite spot downtown.  I ate here just about every day the first few weeks that it opened and did not have one bad meal.  Love the feel and ambiance.  It's bright and airy, but still has the feel of a bistro.  Feels like I've left LA and landed in  SoHo.. . Try the pizzas.  Full bar.  Valet parking.  Perfect!
