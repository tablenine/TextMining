Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I guess I'll add my two cents like the other 1900 plus patrons of Pink's in Hollywood. Of course the hype for this place is huge due to it being on just about every TV travel show ever made. I must admit I fell for it. Unless you come late at night plan on being in line for a good 30 minutes to an hour. I can't believe I waited in line. I'm one of those people that can't understand why people would wait in line or wait to be seated at a chain or average restaurant. But like I said I fell for the hype. . . But don't get it twisted. The hot dogs are good. Worth waiting in line for...uh that's another issue. I had the mayor dog which had guacamole and bacon with a jalapeno hot dog. We also had the chili cheese fries which were not so good. The chili is very oily and kinda gross. The prices are relatively cheap as well. Behind the building there is a spot with tables where you can sit down and eat, When we made it through the line I was surprised to see a lot of empty tables open. For some reason the line is long but nobody eats there I guess. . . I'd come back here if there was no line and I was binge drinking all night and needed my late night fix.
