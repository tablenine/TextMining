The food and service here is always top notch. I usually order fish- the salmon or whitefish are my favorites. Definitely get the shrimp popper thingys that come in a little white basket of sorts. The area is really cool- you walk down to the dining area where there is a bar in the middle, and a bar off to the side. Then there is Ghost Bar upstairs. The booths are comfy and high for privacy. I really enjoy restaurants where I get up from the table and come back to my napkin folded, good as new. Lets me know I am in good hands.
