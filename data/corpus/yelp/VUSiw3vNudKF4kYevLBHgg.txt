Joan's does a fabulous Thanksgiving menu~ each year we make sure to pick up some of the butternut squash and pear soup. It's thick, sweet, and just this side of spicy. Try it mixed with a dollop of creme fraiche.. . The sauteed green beans with toasted hazelnuts and shallots, wild mushroom bread pudding, and maple brown sugar yams were also fantastic and got rave reviews from everyone in the family.
