Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
Doc Chey's isn't anything fancy, but they offer tasty semi-Americanized Chinese food at a reasonable price. What makes them stand out for me, though, is that they clearly label the menu to show which dishes/sauces are vegetarian or can be made vegetarian, and they're really accommodating of special orders. As someone with food allergies, I feel comforted when a restaurant shows that they understand my dietary needs and will do everything they can to meet them. . . I'm partial to the noodles with black bean sauce, myself, but everything I've tried has been good (although I thought the garlic eggplant was a little too sweet). Grab a fortune cookie and a glass of the house-brewed iced green tea to round out a nice meal. You'll even have some leftovers for lunch the next day!
