Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Holy shit the line here is LONG!. . I thought the wait at Rosamundes in SF was long, this place was even longer!. . It took about 45 minutes to get the hotdog, but maybe 3 to eat it. . . The selection is mind boggling. You can get a hot dog burrito for fuck's sake! I'm surprised there weren't more fatties in line (I sure felt like one after devouring 1500 calories of questionable meat goodness).. . I'll come back for sure and try that 12 inch jalapeno hot dog (and a jacket too, waiting in line in January, even in LA, at 1am can get cold!)
