I waited 2.5 hours for Kogi, which seems pretty normal from what others have said.  . . If it weren't for the wait, I would give Kogi a 5 for sure.  However, because they only have two trucks right now, the demand for these delicious tacos is just too much.  . . But damn, these tacos are the real thing.  My favorite is the spicy pork taco.  Chef Roy sure came up with a genius recipe.  It's simple, yet full of flavor...as well as savory, tasty...it's like sex in your mouth!. . It was definitely an experience ordering tacos from this truck.  It seems ridiculous waiting so long just for some tacos...but I'm glad I did it.  Everyone in line can totally relate to what you're feeling - like when some ass in front orders 20 tacos, or someone in front of you leaves you get all excited; it's like survival of the fittest!  Then, when you finally get it, you feel like you climbed some giant mountain peak and made it to the top.  . . I am most definitely eating these again, just in a matter of time...I don't know if I would wait 2 hours again for them, but hopefully they roll out some more trucks soon.
