Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Hot dogs here are hot dogs... Sure they've got all different kinds of hot dog with all kinds of different toppings... Okay I guess they are good... But they don't make me want to wait in a 3 hour line for them. My favorite thing here though is the chili cheese fries. I get the chili separate and the cheese separate and a few sides of jalapenos. That way your fries stay crispy the whole time. Again... GREAT chili cheese fries although I haven't been back since I got a $60 parking ticket with a $15 fixit after being 5 minutes late to my car... That is one EXPENSIVE order of chili cheese fries.
