I actually really like the food here.  Meeting friends for breakfast at this location on a weekend morning is all about the experience, the free coffee outside, the chaos inside......I enjoy it.  The coffee is the BEST and the creamy grits are very nice.. . My ONLY recommendation would be to buy the hostess an electronic paging system (you know - those coasters that light up and buzz RED when your table is ready.)  It is a bit unsettling to have someone SCREAM your name right in your ear.  It definitely would improve the customer service.
