I absolutely love this place. It is super busy every time i go, but it's totally worth it. the patio setting is so peaceful.. . Amazing breakfasts, lunches. Their orange juice is to die for. Their desserts are awesome as well...the fruit tart and the carrot cake stand out in my memory.. . You will have to wait in line, but in the end it's totally worth it.
