This restaurant is a perfect cheap/good restaurant. Whenever I go here, I usually order the Ice Shave, which i think is the best shaved ice i have ever tried in my life. The Mango slush has real mango in it and not only mango concentrate. The sausage and fried chicken rice are awesome. Definitely a must-try
