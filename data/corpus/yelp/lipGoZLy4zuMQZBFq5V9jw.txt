My girlfriend had the number one, and she finished the whole bowl, I had the number 4 and it was perfect for me, my girlfriend is gonna try the special 2 next time and try to get on the wall of winners. The noodles are very delicious, and the miso flavor is really Â they're best soup flavor.we will be back for another try again
