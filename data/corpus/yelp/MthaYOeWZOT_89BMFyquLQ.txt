So, I get it that there's like a million reviews for this place already, but I still want to add my $0.02 because I guess I don't agree with the majority. . Some friends mentioned this place last night when we were all out drinking in DT LA. We spent the night at the Omni, and this morning, after much deliberation, we finally decided to go here to see what the hype was all about.. The place has a barn-like look to it, what with wood shavings on the floor and food-hall-style bench seating. My first thought was, "this is interesting, now let's check out the prices." Well, the sandwiches themselves are almost $6, cheese not included. Now this is just bread and your choice of meat (pork, ham, beef, lamb, turkey), so I thought the pricing was a bit steep. I also got a lemonade, and it was served in a tiny 8oz glass. We don't even have glasses this small at home. . In addition, service is waaay slow for a place that's this popular. . The meat was tasty. I got beef and my other friends got pork. I hijacked my friend's pork one and it was better than the beef one, although the sandwich itself would benefit from better quality bread, to make it worth the price.. Also, the fact that they don't accept credit and/or debit is a hassle. . All in all, it's good but not great; overrated and over priced.
