I've been here once now, and I have to say that I prefer the Gardena version better.  I'm not sure what it is precisely, but I think it has something to do with the sense of what a ramen-ya is supposed to be.  I guess I feel like my trips to the Gardena one was better.  . . This shop is good, a little smaller, perhaps but definitely serves quickly and attentively.  Everything was fresh, and the Kaedama came briskly.  I had an asahi and a standard broth, standard texture ramen with a seared spam roll.. . Tasty.. . I've got to try Santouka Ramen some day to compare its regional competition...
