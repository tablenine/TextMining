Good food, nice ambiance.  We went there for Restaurant Week with a large group and it was wonderful.  They seated us in one of the private rooms that they had and it was great.  They immediately offered us the restaurant week menu in addition to the regular menu and told us about all of the specials.  Sometimes when you go for these types of specials, the restaurant treats you like second class citizens.  Not this place!  Portions were good and meal satisfying.
