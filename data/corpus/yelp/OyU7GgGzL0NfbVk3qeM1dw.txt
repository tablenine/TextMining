Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Oh boy!  Another over-hyped LA restaurant.  . . We got there 30 minutes before they opened and there was a line with about 30 people in it. . . Horrible service. Had to ask three times for chili sauce before someone slapped it on the table. . . We ordered a rice and pork dumpling, but our waitress herself recommended we get the shrimp and pork dumpling.  But we didn't want shrimp, she said they would make without.  But when they arrived there was shrimp in them.  This is the type of crap that really pisses me off. Of course the waitstaff barely speaks english so getting attention is hopeless.  . . Also ordered the Fried Noodes w/ chicken.  Hardly any chicken and the noodles were very bland. . . Over-priced and over-rated. Left hungry and angry.
