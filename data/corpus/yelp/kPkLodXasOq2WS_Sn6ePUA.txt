I heart this place SO MUCH!!!!  One of my favorite restaurant in the world!!!  Mmmmmmmmmmm..... . I always get the "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast and it's beyond yummy!  All the entrees are HUGE so you can definitely share with another super buddy. =)  . . Can't wait to go back already...ENJOY!
