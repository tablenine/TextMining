The service was impecible and the yellow curry (can't remember the name of it) was very tasty.  The owner - who trained in Thailand as a chef before coming to the states - told me that their papaya salad is the most popular along with the noodle soups (particularly among the late-night crowd).  They are also open until 3 or 4 AM most nights so good for that post-bar food craving.  Like a lot of the places in the neighborhood they are cash only so come prepared.
