my girl friends and i decided to try out wurstkuche a few sundays ago for lunch at about 12PM. we parked across the street at a meter (free on sundays!) and walked around to the entrance where there is a small area with a deli display case of various sausages, a counter to order and the grill behind. there was a small counter with high chairs along the wall and i thought wow this place is actually kind of small. and empty. we ordered our food and beer and got our numbers, then the guy told us we could go down the hall but make sure to face the numbers towards the hallway. we walked down the hall and into a large room with benches and tables covered in brown butcher paper and booths along the wall and a bar area. i really liked the whole atmosphere. there was probably only about 6 other people there but by the time we got our food, the whole place was packed.. . i ordered the duck and bacon with jalapeno peppers with belgain fries and a chimay on tap. the sausage was so juicy and slightly spicy. the fries were pretty good. i got the dipping sauce of chipotle aioli sauce. the aioli was okay.. . my friend ordered the chicken and apple spices with belgain fries and erdinger. she said it was pretty good. she got the chipotle ketchup which was like a ketchup with a little spice. my other friend ordered the classic bratwurst with belgian fries and franziskaner. her dipping sauce as the pesto mayo, which was really good.. . overall i really liked wurstkuche and want to try the rattlesnake next time :)
