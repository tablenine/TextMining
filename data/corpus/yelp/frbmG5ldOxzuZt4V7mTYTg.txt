My husband and I declared June "Pizza Appreciation Month". I mean, there has to be a reason you eat pizza 4 times in one week!. Perfect excuse.. . Anyway...next on our "Chicago thin crust, east coast inspired pizza tour" --. Coal Fire Pizza!. . I found the service to be good, great actually ... It seems the quirks they might have had in the beginning have been worked out..  - You walk in.  - They show you a seat.  - You look at the menu.  - Go up to the counter.  - Order.  - Pay.  - They bring the pizza in under 10 minutes (2 pizzas..).  - We ate and enjoyed!.  - They brought us a carryout box for extras.. . I am new to this style pizza, and the east coast raised husband has been teaching me the ropes.  According to those standards, Coal Fire is a winner!  . . I personally just know it was delicious...simple toppings, not over done, just right, crust was chewy in the middle and crusty on the outside.. . Don't forget BYOB though.. . The inside decor could use some work...and yes, it is kind of noisy.
