I love this place and find myself craving it often.  It's a fun and lively place to go to and the food and drink is great.  My friends and I come back for the wine and cheese flights which are simply SUPER!  I'd definitely recommend trying their cheese flight specials.  Another favorite was the french fries they offer as an app - I think I remember some kind of amazing garlic aioli with it and I swear, I could have eaten a platter of those fries as my main meal.  The only thing that stopped me was common decency (forced to share) and we still had our delicious cheese flight.  Anyway, I always find the service friendly and leave happy.  I'm dying to try their brunch!  Mimosa flight?  Genius.
