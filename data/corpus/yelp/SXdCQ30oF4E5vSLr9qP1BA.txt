We have been to this place several times and each time we are happy with food and service.  No problem giving either 4 or 5 stars.  The one time we ordered take-out, the shrimps were not fresh!!!  It was a disappointment as we threw it away after eating less than 1/2 of it!  There seem to be less sauce for take-out also.. . The 3 stars is an average of several visits giving them a benefit of a doubt.
