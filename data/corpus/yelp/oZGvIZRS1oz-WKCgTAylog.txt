Ugh...... . From all accounts the real Mexicali in Mexico is a complete dump, how apt that this place has recreated it's food. . . How can you screw up Mexican food in Los Angeles, someone please tell me??  This place was absolutely woeful.  First piece of advice, DO NOT ORDER THE GUACAMOLE APPETIZER!!!  From memory this appetizer was $8, the laughably small portion of guacamole we got for it was a complete joke.  Bland and tasteless too.  I asked the waitress was that the standard size of the guacamole and she rolled her eyes and said 'uh huh' as she must have been asked the same question a thousand times, she was then pissy with us for the rest of the meal.. . Completely thrown by the small size of the appetizer I thought I had better order something big to fill me up.  I ordered a Kobe Beef Burrito for my entree.  Now I have eaten Kobe beef (or the US version of it) many times in the past.  If that was Kobe beef I'm Kobe Bryant.  Tasteless mince in one of the worst burritos I have ever eaten.. . To emphasize how bad this place was I went to a La Salsa for lunch the following day and the burrito I had there put Mexicali's food to shame.. . I definitely won't be back.
