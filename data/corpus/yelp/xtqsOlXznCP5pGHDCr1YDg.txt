One word: Perfect.. . I was in town staying at the Four Seasons, and decided to try Crustacean on a recommendation.  Glad I did!. . The food was delicious (the Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles are must-tries), the atmosphere is wonderful (There's a beautiful Koi river running through the place), and the service is top notch.. . AND ask to be sat in Audrey's section if she's working there.  She gave the best recommendations, seemed to know when we needed something without us having to wave her down, and was entertaining on top of it.  She made the evening more than just a dinner.. . Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!
