There are few things I would willingly wait in a long ass line for:  IronMan 2, Bottled Jessica Alba Bathwater, and the chance to throw a pie at Sarah Palin.  Sorry Kogi, you don't make that very short list.. . Don't get me wrong, I love that the tacos don't require me to put a mortgage on my left nut.  The tacos and burritos are really quite savory and tasty.  Having to wait in a long line just kills it for me though.. . I'll hop on over when I'm working away at a nearby cafe and see the truck parked outside with what looks to be a 5 minute line but that's the extent of my patience.  So three stars.  I do believe they deserve some major credit though for utilizing twitter in such an awesome way.  One extra star for techie awesomeness. *wink*
