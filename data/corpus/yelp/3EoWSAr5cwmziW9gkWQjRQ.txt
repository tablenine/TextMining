Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The prices are pretty reasonable for the experience you'll receive here. My best friend and I LOVE this restaurant, so much that she ALMOST rented it for her wedding reception. Such a nice look and feel to the place. I love the uniforms/costumes worn by the staff. I've never been in such a large establishment that felt so cozy and like home.. . Make a reservation and you won't wait. Walk in and you'll enjoy cocktails at the bar and complimentary meatballs in the waiting area - they provide plenty of seating for those waiting for a table, so you'll be comfortable. Don't fill up on the meatballs, there's much better to come.... . The spinning salad is not your typical salad. It can win over the taste buds of even the most anti-vegetable, meat-devouring type. Best prime rib around! The Lawry's cut is perfect for me, but there are plenty of choices. Be ambitious and order the beef bowl. End cuts are highly recommended. The Bread pudding is delicious, especially when soaked in the gravy. And the cream of corn is a MUST try! Try all of the above, and you will indeed have a taste bud tantalizing experience. You'll be back for more. No doubt.
