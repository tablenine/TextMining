Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
I saw Cemita Puebla on the Food Network and decided to give it a try, . and I was not disappointed. Both of my carne asada (steak) cemitas and my dinner companion's Milanesa (Breaded Butterfly Pork Chop) cemitas were delicious. I really liked the texture of the bread, and the avocado spread and adobo chipotle peppers really added flavor to my sandwich. . Even though the neighborhood seemed a bit shady at night, the tasty food and friendly service will definitely make us go back.
