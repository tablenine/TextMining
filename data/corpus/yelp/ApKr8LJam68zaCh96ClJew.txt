I'll TRY to keep this short as possible since I came here amongst a group of five and we ordered many dishes.  The service here is exceptional, so no complaints about that.  Beware that there is a long wait about 30 minutes for groups greater than 4.  And lastly, this place is not cheap nor that expensive.  Let's say a roll can range from $13-20, based on how special it is.. . So this is what we ordered.. . - Albacore and crispy fried onions - AMAZING, a must have. - Albacore and garlic sauce - AMAZING as well. - Izakaya roll - so-so, I wouldn't order it again. - Crispy rice and spicy tuna - definitely an original, the rice is pan-fried and spicy tuna on top, very good combination of textures. - Creamy rock shrimp + spicy tuna - so-so, i thought the spicy tuna roll underneath was too mushy. - Baked crab roll - too mushy. - Lobster dynamite roll - too mushy. - BBQ kalbee ribs - really really good, better than most places I've been to. - yellowtail tasting - fresh yellowtail with a slice of jalapeno on top, yum yum!. - noodles with chicken - good as well, the sauce is not sickeningly thick, and has an original taste compared to most noodles out there. - for dessert, hot chocolate cake with ice cream - eh, don't order this, tasted like it came out of a box and was microwaved.. . So overall, I love this place for it's sashimi.  As for rolls, I'd pass.  But definitely order the albacore with crispy onions and albacore in garlic sauce cuz it'll definitely bring you back here again.
