Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place has become landmark  to LA residents and the food is good for what it is.  I repeat, good for what it is.  This isn't a gourmet restaurant, it's independent fast food.  You won't find the ultimate taco here.  There is nothing creative going on, they're not even serving traditional soft tacos.  In reality, their food isn't high quality, but it is tasty.  As long as your expectations are reasonable, you're going to like it.. . I rarely stray from the tacos... occasionally I'll throw in a cheese enchilada for variety, but it's all about the tacos (w/ cheese).  Generously pour on some salsa and away you go.  The burritos are mediocre, but like I said, it's all about the tacos (w/ cheese).. . There will be lines, but don't let them scare you away.
