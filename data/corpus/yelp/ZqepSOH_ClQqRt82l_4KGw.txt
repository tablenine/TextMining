Ok.  This ain't my first choice as my neighborhood bar, but since it is the closest, it was the only one I cared to venture out to in last night's miserable weather.. . First let me say that the decor is pretty impressive, although it's a bit too institutional and glitzy for my tastes.  It's sleek, stylish, and trendy...which I'm not.  They have a decent draught selection with some high gravs mixed in...and not a "working class" beer in sight...oh yeah they have Miller Light(at $4 a bottle).  I tried their house ale which wasn't all that bad and it was the same price as ML.. . I haven't tried any of the food yet.  I've heard mixed reviews about it from friends.  From what I gather, the burger is good but a bit steep.  . . Although I wasn't exactly smitten with The Prince of Wales, I did find it a little more laid back than Tap.  But alas that is no more.  I'm not saying Tap is all that bad.  It's just not a place I'd count as a regular watering hole.  It's more of an "impress your out of town hick friends kind of place."
