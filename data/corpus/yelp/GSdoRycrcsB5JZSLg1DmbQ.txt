If one of you like savory &amp; the other likes sweet - you found your new spot - Blu Jam does both very well.  I love all versions of eggs benedict. They even tolerate all my additions of tomato, spinach, ect to my benedict &amp; even get the eggs poached right.  . . My man loves the blueberry french toast.  It's so good I have to have more than one bite - and I normally dread sweet fluffy breakfast stuff. But damn that's good!
