Ok- just ok.  I came here for pho noodle soup, on the recommendation of a Vietnamese friend.  Pho places have their own little nuances with the pho broth and people like it or don't like it.  For me, it was a little too sweet and had too much star anise flavor...maybe it was just like that today or maybe it's always that way...but it was decent.  Most of the pho noodles featured beef...wish they had thought to add a couple more seafood or chicken combinations as well.  The plate of garnishes that is provided for pho is standard- crunchy bean sprouts, thai basil...but had a lemon wedge instead of a lime.  Good value for a little over $5 for a small bowl, but for some reason, I found it lacking to pho I've had in the past and I'm trying to put my finger on it.  Maybe some lime juice would have cut the sweetness of the broth better than than lemon?  Who knows.. . Large space with lots of big tables for groups and families- mint green walls and multi-colored lights make it "festive".  Definitely casual and screams "we're authentic".  Service is brisk- I barely sat down and had not even picked up the menu before a server was hounding me for my order.  Chill out, dude.  . . For all the Yelp rave reviews, I think I may have been expecting the noodles to knock it out of the park...this was a solid double base hit.  OK, enough with the baseball analogy...I may try this place again, but only after I try a few other pho places.
