I do not recommend this place.  There is just nothing about it to tickle your taste buds or stimulate interest, even if it is owned by Harrison Ford's son.. . Though the host was friendly, the service overall is really bad.  We got seated and no one checked in or took our order for 10 minutes.  It wasn't even busy when we were there.  The host ended up taking our order.  Once we got seated, our waiter asked us if we wanted a dessert menu and our food didn't even come out yet, to which our waiter was like, "Oh.". . The food is bland.  We had the mussels to start.  It looked good, but it was flavorless, pretty much tasted like low-sodium chicken broth.  It could have used some garlic or something.  I had the flatbread with shrimp and hummus--also lacked flavor.  My friend had the meatloaf burger.  The texture was mushy and again flavorless.  The onion rings were good in that they used red onions, but the batter was thick and burnt.. . Disappointing.  My mouth was sad.
