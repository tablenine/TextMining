I went to NYC for a short trip early this month. We stumbled on GOBO after a night out. I read "vegetarian" ... normally I'd walk to a different direction but thought I should be more open and experimental.. . THIS PLACE SURPRISED ME! The food was gooood.. . I had Roti curry for appetizer! Yum! Singapore stir-fry mai-fan was delish! My partner ordered green tea noodle miso soup which was a little bland, .. but overall ... this place is good ... for vegetarian!. . I am a fan since this could be a good transition to purely veg!. . I wish they have something like this in San Francisco! :)
