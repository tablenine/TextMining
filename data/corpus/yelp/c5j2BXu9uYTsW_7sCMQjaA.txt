A lot of people obviously love this place. I was excited to try it out, but am sad to say that my dining partner and I literally had the most tasteless salads we have ever had in our lives. Perhaps it was just an off night. I want to give it another shot, but something tells me that they will survive without me patronizing their restaurant.
