I'd have to say OK Cafe is really just OK.  It's definitely not the worse food I've ever had.  But it's definitely better than IHOP and the like.  . . However, the OK Take-away is where it's at.  It's a bit pricier than let's say Boston Market, but the quality is a bazillion times better.  Plus it beats having to cook after a long day at work.  . . I also personally dig the retro uniforms the waitresses wear.
