Went to the Magic Castle for my birthday this past Sunday.  It was awesome!  The food was great, and the magicians were great!  I'm looking forward to going again!  Be sure to have the photographer take your picture while you're there.  You get a guest pass with your picture so that you can go back.  Other wise you have to know someone who's a member.  Can't wait to go again! :)
