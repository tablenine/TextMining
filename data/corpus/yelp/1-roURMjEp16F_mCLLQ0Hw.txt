i go to Letizia's for one reason, and one reason only: the coffee.. . &amp; i can't drink coffee - stomach aches are almost immediate if i drink more than one cup a week, and even once a week is painful. but i LOVE good espresso and if i could drink coffee but be restricted to only one roaster, it would be cafe umbria, hands down. I discovered cafe umbria when i lived in seattle. And in a city where there are no shortage of coffee snobs, local roasters and coffee shops, I had a lot of choices. i tried them all (weekly, of course) from the well known places to the little hole-in-the-walls. . . and, on a quest for cupcakes one rainy afternoon i decided i needed coffee. oh, cafe umbria is like the orange coloring on my doritos. it's like heart's above my i's, the pasta with my sauce, the buttercream on my cupcakes. it's very serious.. . so, when i found cafe umbria at letizia's i immediately beckoned a stomach ache. and it was perfect!. . so, i go to letizia's for my weekly cup of coffee. i've been trying things to go with my coffee.. . bagels: yum. they are almost a meal they are so large, and they are pretty tasty. i love toasted sesame bagels with butter. there's cream cheese and the option of having panini toppings on your bagel as well. i am pretty sure they have lox?. . the cookies always seem dry!. . the panini's are yummy and cheap enough. . . i haven't tried the muffins... mostly because half the time all of the varieties Â  all look the same. which is weird to me. . . you have to pay for internet, which is bummer. but the spring-summer-fall outdoor seating in the front and the back more than makes up for that. especially when the coffee negates the need to do anything resembling work.
