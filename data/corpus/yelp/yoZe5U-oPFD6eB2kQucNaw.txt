I gotta admit when it comes to dinning out I'm kind of a creature of habit; I like to stick to a handfull of restaurants that I like and I usually . order the same sh*t all the time. My husband on the other hand is exactly the opposite, he likes to try new restaurants all the time and orders the most unusual things! There's been plenty of times when I forced him to stop at a fast food place AFTER dinning out at a "NICE" place to get ME something to eat!!!!!!!. So when I decided a couple of days ago to try out Chico's place on a rainy cold day, my hubby was bitching (about my driving ) non-stop until I got us there!!!. When Chico offered to get us his choise of their best dishes I was already thinking that there's going to be a " Jack in the box" pit stop on the way home!!! . We started off with two appetizers that were to die for - pork and cheese pupusa and home made green corn tamale, both were excellent!!! Then he hooked us up with chicken tortilla soup that was kind of vertical with so much in it that I can't even remember but it hit the spot on that cold rainy night .... Finally he brought  out two platters, one was shredded pork dish with red sauce (carne adobada) and the other was garlic shrimp/prawn, dish similiar to scampi but better. The pork reminded me of the very tender kahlua pork I've had in Hawaii!!!! I don't even want to mention chips and guacamole and all other side dishes we've had on our table, I felt like stuffed turkey, we even split a flan desert!!! I guess I'm a pig!!! . And just to let you all know - NO  we didn't stop at "Jack in the box" and yeah no divorce party planned after my driving in the rain, Paul was happy with food as well!. . Prices are very resonable, portions are huge and I love the decor. . Loved it /Highly recomend it!!!! Chico you Rock!!!
