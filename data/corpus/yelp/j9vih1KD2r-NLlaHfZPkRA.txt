uhhhhhhh how is at least a one hour wait worth a trip , i will give you a clue ...shabu shabu house. I love every bit of this place. The customer service is amazing the owner loves to talk to the fans. The panzu sauce is a secret and made by the owner, who also ages and picks out the meat himself. I know I might be making a huge mistake by writing this review, lord knows how long the wait will be now ... but it is that good. The dish is simple and traditional. The staff works together and they validate parking. so after you have waited and stuffed your face with their carnivore friendly menu of small or large you get the money you paid for parking back in your wallet!!! I have been to almost every shabu shabu restaurant and this is still my favorite not to mention they play old country music while you eat, so cute
