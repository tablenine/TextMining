I love me some pulled, slow-cooked, smokey BBQ! Yet only the texture of the meat resembles the flavorful experiences I've had at other BBQ joints. I had to try Oinkster a few times in order to write this. . . My ole man and I thought  WE were BANANAS because of our lack of understanding the propaganda given to Oinkster by the likes of Gold and Fieri. Thanks to fellow Yelpers, we no longer feel as if we've got handicapped taste buds! The pulled pork is kinda whatevs. The chicken? Also whatevs. Pastrami ... meh. The sauces and texture are the savior here. (Aioli!)  . . If I want this style of grub, I'd rather drive out to Jr.'s, or Portos (where the Cuban sandwich is WAY better and only $4.50!).  The restaurant itself is very pretty,  but overall, much of the hype is just, well ... HYPE. Oinkster does not beckon cravings that would make me eat there very often. I rarely even think of it as an option. Honestly, there's no problem in paying eight-bucks for a GREAT sandwich and a side, (like at the almighty Gus's). Maybe if Oinkster tweaked their pricing, I'd eat there more? It's just a fancy sandwich stand with average food.
