My Kogi Truck virginity has finally been taken! I went over to Sherman Oaks tonight Â to try food from the Verde truck. There wasn't a terribly long line, but it got longer after some time passed. I ordered their SHORT RIB BURRITO ($5) &amp; KOREAN CHICKEN TACO ($2). This came out to be $7.30 I think. The taco was VERY small. It was two mini corn tortillas piled with chicken, sesame seeds, lettuce, green onion, and chili sauce. For a person who can't even eat a hot cheeto, I was able to eat this....although I kinda wanted something to drink, like a soda. The beef short rib burrito had beef, green onions, white onions, eggs. &amp; potatoes in it. It was sweet with a bit of crunchiness here and ther from the beef (nice surprise). . . As I mentioned, the line wasn't too long. I think I might have waited 15- 20 minutes in line and it took them 5-10 minutes to get me my food. . . Overall, I LOVED the flavors of the food. I was disappointed at the small size of the taco but it packed a serious punch in the flavor department. I would sOoOoOo order the beef short rib burrito again. Both of these items were delicious and the flavors danced in my mouth like a bit of heaven fell from the sky. YUM! . . Tomorrow I will have more Kogi Truck yuminess. Methinks I will try the sliders. I will report back on that experience tomorrow!. . FYI: Dress comfortably since you will be standing in line for awhile to order. . . Verde Kogi Truck. Sherman Oaks. 8pm
