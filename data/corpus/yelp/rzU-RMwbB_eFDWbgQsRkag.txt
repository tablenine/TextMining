I LOVE this place. I've been there at all hours of the day and night and it's always fantastic! They have a separate vegetarian menu, including FABULOUS meat-free versions of a lot of the dishes I've missed since giving up meat. All my carnivorous friends love it, too - the regular menu is very extensive. The service is great and the decor is simple but classy. I cannot recommend it enough!!
