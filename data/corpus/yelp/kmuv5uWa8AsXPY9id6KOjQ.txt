Both times I have been to Sola the overall experience has been great.  The service is alwasy professional, the food is delicious and presented very well.  However, both times I've left wanting more...literally.  The price-to-portion ratio is all wrong here.  At $20-$30 an entree, I would expect a large plate of food that I can barely finish.  Instead, it seems the dinner portions are more comparable to a smaller lunch portion.
