I took my wife for her birthday as we both saw the Garlic Noodles featured on the Food Network.  I figured lets give this place a try and see what happens.  Wow!  We were seated immediately  upstairs overlooking the restaurant.  Service was amazing as our waiter acted as if we were the only people he had to take care of.  Food was incredible and those Garlic Noodles are one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Crab was amazing.  Dont forget to leave room for dessert as the Coconut Cake and Pineapple Bread Pudding were incredible.  The whole meal came t0 $125.00 .  Not bad in this neck of the woods.  We will be back.
