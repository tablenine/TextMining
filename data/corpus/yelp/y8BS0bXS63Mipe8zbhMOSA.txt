This is not a bad spot for dinner.  On a Friday night there was no wait, albeit the ambiance in the restaurant is quite loud.  . . I ordered some sort of fish that I can't even remember at this point.  Ah, it was swordfish.  I probably wouldn't order it again.  My friend got halibut, and I thought that was much better, although he had stomach issues afterwards.  :/
