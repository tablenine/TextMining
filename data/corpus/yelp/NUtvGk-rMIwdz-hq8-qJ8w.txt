Category: Diners
Fred's get 5 stars from me for a couple of reasons.... . First of all, great coffee.  I don't know why, but their coffee is always so good and fresh. . . Second, great people watching if your sitting outside. . . Third, small things, like pricing the items in non standard denominations, and the cool decor.  . . Only problem is, of course, parking can be an issue.. . The breakfast food here is great, one of the best places in Hollywood to come enjoy breakfast and sit outside.  . . You gotta give Fred's a shot.
