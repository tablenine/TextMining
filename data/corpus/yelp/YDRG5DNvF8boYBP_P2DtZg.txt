Don't even tell me if you don't like it.... . I'M NOT HEARING IT GIRLFRIEND, TALK TO THE HAND!!!. . Phillipe's is famous, has character and is a landmark.  Then add a douple dipped french dip, some chili, a lemonade and some chocolate mousse pie and its over!. . I really dont have to sell this one...I would rather not have anyone know about it.  That way the line will be shorter at the counter for me.
