Very tasty.  I think the owner was at an event, which I was a little disappointed about, but I will definitely be back again to try to catch him!. . I took an adventurous coworker here for an informal lunch meeting, and it turned out perfectly.  We both ordered the sampler appetizer platter, which was a great size for lunch, and the sweet girl who served us brought out a pile of warm pita squares.  Really tasty!  Since we arrived a little after 1pm, it wasn't very crowded and we could talk freely.
