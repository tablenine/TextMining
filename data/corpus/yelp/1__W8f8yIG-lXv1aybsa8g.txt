WOW!!. . This place is off the hook!! I've tried lunch and dinner and IT IS BOMB!!. . this place made me become a ramen fan, because the past ramen places I've gone wasn't all that great. BUT this! this place is authentic and you can feel like your actually in tokyo eating ramen, (just saying :P never experienced it), but yeah its really goodd!! you will not be disappointed on what ever you get on the menu!!. . My favorite is the Daikokuya ramen with a side of grill eel!! ITS SOOO GOOODDD!! and also shredded pork is amazing!. . MUST GO!!! also customer services and portions is GREAT!. only down part is that the place is very small, so there is waiting, but its worth it :D. . btw bring your appetite!
