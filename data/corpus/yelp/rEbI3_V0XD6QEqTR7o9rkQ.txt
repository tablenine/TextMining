Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
i have to do this..the stinking rose, well, stunk! signed up on yelp just for this review..  I was entertaining two girlfriends that came up to visit prior to the lady gaga concert. . we ended up here after an hour of making our way to Beverly hills for some Thai only to realize the restaurant was closed til evening dinner...starving beyond belief we pulled into the stinking rose. now i had  read reviews everywhere saying that this is a must try place for LA. . okay seriously no! sadly to say the three of us wasted our precious carbs and calories on food that was bland and not special and overpriced!..we ordered the garlic fries and they were meh-ok. the roasted potato onion soup was just OK as well..the pasta dish a Friend ordered lacked salt and pazazz...worse? we left with stomach aches due to a slight carb overload..now i am noo stranger to carb overload however when its worth it its no prob..this place is not worth your calories or your curiosity! service gets a 2 stars..checked on us twice... . oh yes then the inevitable valet. 5 dollars for someone to get my car which is literally twenty feet away.. i could've walked to my car..then he confused my Lil corolla key for an escalade?! so we had to  wait for the valet attendant to run around trying to figure out which of the 5 cars there were mine....ugh. i guess it was more frustrating after leaving unsatisfied. only only only positive? the mini cabanas they sit you in were adorable and lovely to look at . felt like u were isolated in a restaurant. c
