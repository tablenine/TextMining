I love Lettuce Entertain You but I was kinda disappointed by Nacional 27.  The drinks were great but the food was only OK.  We went there on Wednesday and got their "wine down Wednesday's" special which included four courses and wine parings.  The wine was terrible!  And not a single one paired well with the dishes.  I got the "famous" suckling pig, and it was not good.  The sides were great and so were the apps.  My boyfriend got the vegi paella, but it was nothing like paella.  There was no saffron nor paprika, it was more like a rice pilaf.  . . The service was great, our waiter was very nice and very attentive.  I will go back another time and order differently and only get cocktails.  I hope it is better next time!
