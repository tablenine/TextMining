Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
The food is good, but the reason to visit the Alcove is the desserts.  Amazing cakes, tarts, and cookies.  On one visit, I counted six different chocolate cakes!  I just told the cashier to give me her favorite.  I ended up with the See's cake, chocolate cake with bits of See's candies, topped with chocolate frosting.  Slices are huge (brought it home and couldn't finish it after a few days), so bring a friend!  Atmosphere is good, too.  Lines can get long on weekends, but it is worth the wait.  If you can get a table inside in the back, do it.  The scene outside can be a little annoying, with loud cell phone conversations and name dropping.
