This place gets 5 stars for the patio alone!!! Come here when the weather is nice and you'll feel like you're sitting outside of a restuarant in the suburbs. Well, you almost are since this is a bit of a hike north on Broadway. . . The fare is standard burgers, steak sandwhiches, and some chicken. You know what, i really don't know what else they have besides the burger b/c that's all you should really go for. They also have good prices on some upscale beer. They serve Anchor Steam by the pitcher for 8-9 bucks, which is a pretty good deal. . . See you there in the summer, summer, summer, time...........
