Likes?. =Raspberry Lemonade- (Basically lemonade with sugary Raspberry puree...yum) . =Carrot Ginger dressing -pretty similar to the carrot salad dressing that I absolutely love at "7a". . =Cheap prices- $5-$9 dinner platters. . . I tried the Hijoki Tofu platter [Fried tofu/seaweed ball that comes with a side of brown rice and salad] and the Lamb curry stew which were both ok but not amazing. The fried Hijoki Tofu was a bit too bland and oily for my taste. The lamb curry stew was tasty but wish they would've toned down on the salt.
