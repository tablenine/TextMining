Yum.  I really liked this place.  After an afternoon of walking all over downtown, while I was in Chinatown, I wanted to check this place out, especially after I read all of the reviews.  Fiance and I needed an afternoon snack and this was the place to go.  We took the dash bus to get here and it drops you out right in front.  It wasn't very crowded, and sure smelled good.  We ordered a beef sandwich, potato salad, and 2 lemonades.  The sandwich was nice, especially with some hot mustard, great potato salad, and fresh lemonade.  the only thing I did not like was that the sandwiches don't come with a little cup of au jus, which is what I am used to.  Decent prices and yummy sandwiches, definitely a place to stop when you are in Chinatown.  And the best part, when we left the restaurant, the bus was there waiting, so we just hopped on again.  Gotta love public transit.
