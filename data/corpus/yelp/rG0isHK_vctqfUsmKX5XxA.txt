It was incredible!!!  You don't expect the restaurant to be in the warehouse-looking building in the middle of nowhere, or expect it to look like you walked into a posh downtown trendy restaurant when you walk in.  Our group was seated right in front of the meat roasting and next to the porch which had an unexpectedly amazing view of downtown Atlanta.  Only complaint is that the tiny cocktails were waaaay overpriced.  I highly HIGHLY recommend the brisket empenadas and flatbread lamb gyros.  they were incredible, especially the empendadas.  both had soft moist meat and had an amazing spicy kick to it. i cannot wait til i can go back!!!
