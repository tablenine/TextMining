Came in here on Friday with 3 girlfriends and it was a great way to start the night. The Caprese Salad was amazing! We all loved it. I made my own pasta - just rigatoni and arrabiata. FF was very accommodating with my request. And, it was really good! My friends kept eating from my bowl : ) The other girls ordered Liguini with Clams (one of the specials), Pizza Marg., a salad (but I can't remember what kind) and side of asparagus. We were all pleased....and the wine was very good at $6 a glass.
