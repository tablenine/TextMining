Whenever I'm craving a Goi Cuon and too lazy to cook, which is almost every day, I head to Pho Cafe because they don't give me a dirty look when I want it without shrimp. I know it's strange, I'm Asian and I'm allergic to shrimp; my mom thought I was lying but it's true. . . I also like their bun cha gio thit nuong (beef vermicelli noodle). The banh xeo (w/out shrimp) is a bit too greasy for me. Overall, it's simple, fast, and the staff is friendly. I dig Pho Cafe.
