Restaurant: Bonnie&#39;s Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
Yes.  . . It's so good.  I was lucky enough to live near here for about a year - Saturday afternoon I'd wander down and begin pretty much every weekend with Bonnie's.. . I love the chili and the burgers - oh man - when you're in the right mood - this place will make you so happy.  I like sitting at the counter near the door so I'm not too close to the grill - it gets a bit warm - but I love being close and hearing all the back and forth and participating now and again - though I try to stay out of the way really - they're huge Buffalo fans and on Sundays during the season - it can be hard to find a place when the Bills are playing.. . The owner is totally awesome and funny - the waitstaff is very cool and play some amazing music.  Often I wish I knew who the bands were and when I do I'm always happy to hear them in a good restaurant eating amazing food.. . They have an excellent beer list which occasionally changes.  The special board can be a lot of fun if you dare leave the burger.  The wings are excellent and authentic - these are proud men and women of Buffalo remember.. . I love the peanut butter torte - I can't help it - no matter what - I have to have it at the end - it's better than it used to be - I ran into the owner on the street one day a couple years ago and mentioned that I didn't know if it was me or the torte - but now I was addicted to it.  He laughed, said he'd changed one little thing - maybe he was being nice - but I prefer to think he was chasing one small corner of perfection.
