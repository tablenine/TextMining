We read some review where the mixologist said something about how anyone can pour a drink, but only mixologists can make special drinks (such as those poured at H&amp;F).  . . The quote was annoying. But OMG this restaurant and that mixologist are both doing divine things.. . I actually saved the menu so as to remember what food we ate (in case the delicious memory slipped my mind).  But I really don't think it was necessary.  . . I've decided H&amp;F is like sleeping with your high school thing years later.  You know when you get down to business that it's going to be good--so your brain will kick into memory mode and saves each detail.. . Highlight for hubby: chopped steak served tar tare.  He said it was a revelation.. . My highlight: all the food I didn't get to try last night that I know I'll be going back to enjoy (hello head to toe---I know where to find you).. . Fried haters and oyster haters do yourself a favor and go get some of that cornmeal fried oyster madness.  I promise it'll change your life.
