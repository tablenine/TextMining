HILLS PARK REPRESENT! :D. . Its so exciting to see a hot new place open up in our neighborhood. I saw Julie's review last week and had to try this place. It used to be a meat-and-three called Good Eats that I never got around to visiting despite its really close location. With Carver's Grocery nearby I guess I just felt that GE couldn't compare or something. Dunno.. . Well, I finally managed to visit today, two guys at the taco counter greeted me right away and asked if it was my first time. I mentioned I saw the place on Yelp and had to try it. One guy suggested the chicken and pork tacos. As much as I love pork, I decided to go for one Chicken taco and one Beef taco. Having read Ivan's review, I asked if they were spicy, the other guy said no, and I asked them if they can be made spicy. He gave me some kimchi to try and I said that would be great for my tacos. They still weren't as spicy as I hoped (I think it was Kit that once said.... "round eye, chinese stomach") but if you don't have a strong tolerance for spicy food, the kimchi probably makes it spicy enough. You can get your tacos without it if you prefer no spice at all.. . The tacos were $2.25 each, about the same as Taqueria Del Sol, but easily had twice the filling. Generous portions of meat, kimchi, cilantro, onion, sauce and just a few small shreds of cheese for flavor, not like the overcheesed tacos you'll find at some cheap "mexican" place. Â . . And best of all no long wait! Go here now! :D
