*sighs* Once again...I've been around for way too long. Over the years, their menu has changed ...and not really for the better. Some of my all-time favorties got some tweaking and now...let's just say it's not the same. It's an awesome late-nighter place...the food is still good...but if you've had their food from the their previous chefs/menus...you would agree...they used be ten ga-jillion times better!!!!
