This place has a huge menu and everytime I eat here, I am forced to pine over the menu for an eternity. However, they somehow manage to deliver a pretty good meal with almost everything I've ordered from sandwiches to salads to lamb skewers to pizzas. It's a wonder that they can produce such a good tasting meal with such a small kitchen and massive menu. But they manage! . . I highly recommend the Goat Cheese Special Pizza and the chicken brouchette appetizer. Don't come here on a diet. The servers are always sweet and the service is attentive and prompt. Cute patio, and I believe they are accomodating BYOB requests now, in light of the Great Recession. Worth a visit!
