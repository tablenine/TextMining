Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
Okay, I've been going to Reza's since they opened, haven't been to this location in a while and went there on Thanksgiving (no need to question why, I'm not complaining about the Thanksgiving offering of a Persian restaurant).  Anyway, my complaint is that they removed Dolmeh from the menu, you know, the traditional stuffed grape leaves.  When we asked why it was removed we were told it was because it was the only thing on the menu that they used the grape leaves for and they didn't sell that well so they removed them.  Ahem, many people LOVED them!  My husband would have me pick up an order EVERY time I went without him, and now he cannot get them.  Unfortunately that leaves us to eat at other Persian eateries now, in order to obtain the tasty little leaves he's grown to love.  . . The food is still good, but to lose a staple from the menu did sting a bit and left a bit of a bad taste in the hubby's mouth.
