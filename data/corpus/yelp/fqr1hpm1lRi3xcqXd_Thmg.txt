Restaurant: Social House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Today my gf's and I brunched here. I love restaurants that were once old homes converted into cute, quaint restaurants. This place is one of those. When were got there, we had to write our name down on the list for a table. We were the 2nd on the list, so we didn't have to wait that long for a Saturday brunch. Then again, we got there around 9:30. . . My friend and I both ordered The Social Breakfast, which included 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage patties, choice of grits or hash browns, and biscuit or toast. It was your usual breakfast order. My other friend ordered the spinach, bacon, and feta omelette. She said it was good. Â We also shared an order of the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes just melt in your mouth! They were so delicious! It did take a while for our food to come out. . . Our service was good, but not great. I will definitely come back and get the pancakes or the shrimp and grits. It was busy all morning while we were there. With good food and great friends, what more can you ask for?
