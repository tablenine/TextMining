LOVE THIS PLACE!  Went on Friday night - place was packed - somehow got prime seats at the bar.  Bar staff was AWESOME - as busy as it was I expected slow service but what we got was fantastic service.  The drinks are amazing - those guys know how to do it right.  I love the old school choices and dare I say they make the best martinis in Atlanta.  Just my opinion of course!  Food was very good too - had the bacon wrapped dates and one of the flatbreads - yummy!  I can't wait to go back for more!!  Oh yeah - dessert - get the Churro's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!
