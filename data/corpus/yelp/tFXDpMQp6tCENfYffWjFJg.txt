Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Wow, this place was a total zoo today (but the host said it was highly unusual for a saturday). I suspect it was a combination of Valentines weekend, and runoff from the nightmare la street food fest.  I originally drove to LA for that, but once I saw how ridiculously long the line was just to get into the lot (so excluding individual truck lines), I came to Bottega Louie instead. Sure enough, I ran into some LA Food Fest hopefuls who had also ditched. They claimed the wait would have been 3-4 hrs if we had bothered. . . So, instead, we waited 45 minutes to be seated here.  We got the smoked salmon eggs benedict, and the meatball pizza. We had asked about the clam pizza, but our server gave an immediate and confident, "Not good."  . . The eggs benedict were quite tasty. The smoked salmon was delicious, and the eggs were perfectly creamy, half between fully cooked and fully runny.  . . The meatball pizza was actually kind of disappointing. It was still delicious, but after the relative complexity of the eggs benedict, the pizza was just boring. It had all the elements of a good hand made, thin crust pizza: a crisp crust, fresh seasonings, good cheese, and light on oil, but it just lacked "oomph." Some mushrooms or greens could have helped it. . . Anyway, I'd like to come back again and try out their dinner menu. The portobello fries sound delicious. . . Oh, and their strawberry smoothie is pretty tasty.
