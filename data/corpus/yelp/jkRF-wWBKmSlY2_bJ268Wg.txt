Restaurant: Bhojanic
Category: Indian
I had Bhojanic at a catered event. I had been hesitant to visit the restaurant because the reviews aren't especially favorable, but it was delicious. Their samosas are amazing and the channa masala is great. I plan on stopping in to eat sometime soon.. . The deliverer did get lost and showed up a few minutes late, and very flustered. That said, the location was sort of off the beaten track.
