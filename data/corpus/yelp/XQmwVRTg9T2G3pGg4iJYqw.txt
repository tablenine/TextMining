Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
So we made the pilgrimage and waited for an hour with everyone else mobbing this strip mall. A wait made more bearable by wandering through the bookstore/gift shop in the complex and sipping the mango tapioca.. . SO...the dumplings were luscious but not any better than you'd get at one of the fine dim sum establishments in the Southland. But there was also great shrimp shu mai (imagine a soup dumpling with a shrimp sitting on top...two great tastes together), the shanghai rice cake and chicken noodle soup. Â And despite the long wait outside, your food comes flying at you once you sit down.
