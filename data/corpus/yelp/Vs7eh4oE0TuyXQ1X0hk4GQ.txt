Toms gives you a warm feeling as soon as you walk in.  The friendly service, christmas lights, and tiny booths remind you of a simpler time.  It makes us want to write a poem..... . Toms we love you so, we even come during the snow.. . We like to eat so many things- pancakes, eggs, and onion rings. . Your delicious beverages quench our thirst and that is why your thought of first. . Whether its a hangover cure or brunch date we choose you...its always worth the wait.  . . We enjoy your little sausage treats - because you have a nice selection of meats. . Corned beef hash, burgers, or pork with your hands or a fork! . . The bottom line is..."your food is yummy" so thank you Toms from my tummy!!! xoxo
