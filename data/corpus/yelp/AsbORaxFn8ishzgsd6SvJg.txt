Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
FOOD: Its all about Garlic - They load their food with lots of garlic, and the taste is Strong.  (A "STINKING ROSE" IS GARLIC) The quality of the food is average - 3 of us agreed and also agreed we would not return.  if you love heavy garlic in your food, this place is for you.  My stomach was upset from so much garlic.. . ATMOSPHERE: A nice place and clean (I give it a "B" grade).  It is an upscale atmosphere on La Cienega.. . SERVICE: Very Good and Polite.. . PARKING: Valet
