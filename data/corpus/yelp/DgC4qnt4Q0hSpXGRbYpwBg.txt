This place is delicious.  I was meeting up with friends at DBP for dinner on a Thursday night.  Since I don't eat meat, I checked the menu and was happy to see there was a selection of entrees to choose from.  . . We ate...and I kid you not...2 popovers each, Tuna and Salmon Tartare, East Meets West oysters, Caesar salad w/anchovies (the best Caesar of all time and they make it table side!!!!), crab cake, 3 steaks, I chose the ahi tuna (I had mine cooked rare and it tasted like butter---it was so delicious), creamed spinach, truffle fries, twice baked potatoes, mushrooms then for dessert the lollipop tree, sorbets and ice creams.. . I would have given the restaurant 5 stars but:. -Even though we had a 8 pm reservation, we were not seated until 845 pm . -Sides were not up to par to the entrees . -The waiter was giving us sh!t for taking pictures during dinner
