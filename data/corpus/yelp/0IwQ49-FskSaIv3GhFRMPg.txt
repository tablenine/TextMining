It's the first place I think of when someone mentions cuban food. The sangaria isn't bad either.  The garlic chicken is great, but make sure you try the other dishes too.   Oxtail is my favorite.  Rarely lets me down.  They ran out of bread once, which made me bummed out.  The food has a great homecooked taste and the prices are reasonable.  The service is friendly.
