Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I love Milk! It's such a cute place and the ice cream and bakery treats are amazing. I recently tried one of the sandwiches (ham and cheese panini) which was great too. They've been doing shaved ice on the weekends lately. You can choose a variety of flavors for $3. I tried mango and strawberry...really good! . . It's a little pricey and parking can be challenging...otherwise it's wonderful!
