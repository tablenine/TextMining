Usually only go here for breakfast but they serve lunch, dinner and brunch. . . Relaxing atmosphere with no thrills except for the farm and rooster theme going on. . . Friendly and hard working staff go out of their way to make you feel at home. . . Foods great and not expensive. If the place gets packed and you're a party of 1, 2 or 3 there are some larger tables where you may be sitting right next to strangers.. . Oh and get the side of ham when getting a breakfast. Their ham is thee best.
