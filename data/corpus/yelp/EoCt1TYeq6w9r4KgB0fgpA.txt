Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
It's an average pancake house.  There's nothing special about it.  I think the only reason it's so busy is b/c its location.  It looks likt the kitchen is small, which explains why it takes so long for the food to get to your table.  My table ordered pancakes, french toast, eggs, their special hash browns, and none of it really stood out.  I wouldn't go again.
