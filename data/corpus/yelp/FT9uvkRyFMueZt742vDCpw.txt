What's the greatest deal in town??? . . The $10 sushi sampler lunch at Sushi Go 55! That's right, for a mere $10 you get 5 well cut pieces of nigeri (the usual, salmon, yellowtail, red snapper, halibut, and tuna), 1 crab hand roll (real crab but not blue crab), miso soup, and some cute tiny dishes. . . If you are in Little Tokyo during lunch hours, you have to drop by here. No wait! . . Why the 3 stars only then? It's cuz i was very disappointed in their dinner. I got a sashimi platter and I felt like I was eating steak! Yes, it was THAT thick. OK I'm exaggerating but it was pretty darn thick for sashimi. Bang for your buck? Yes. Bang for your stomach? Hells no.
