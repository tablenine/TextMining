Came here last night with a friend and even though it was pouring rain, this place was packed.  I had the burger and it was fantastic, the sweet potato fries were also really good.  My friend and I each had a beer, I think mine was some belgian beer, she had a hefeweizen and both beers were really good.  The place is nice, really long bar that people can eat at, a lot of tables inside and outside.  There's also a cool beer and wine selection.  I'd say overall it's a really good place to grab a burger and a beer, and chill out with people.
