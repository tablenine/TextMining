Just had a horrible experience here.  I had the $6 taco bar and 2 warm beers.  I ordered a draft beer and it was warm.  Instead of getting me a new one, the bartender "topped it off" for me.  WTF?  After about 2 more sips, I told him I can't drink this and I got a blended margarita instead.  When I decided to go back to beer, it was warm again.  Generally, the food is pretty decent so I decided to go out on a limb and dive into the taco bar.  Bad idea.  It was terrible.  I was one of the first people to go through and everything was already all dried out and the meats had no flavor. Honestly, terrible.  Stick to the burgers, sliders, wings, and corn dogs.
