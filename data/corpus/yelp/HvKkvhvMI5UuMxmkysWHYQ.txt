Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Maybe because I've been here since I was a little kid, but despite the reviews I love this place.  True, their salsa is watered down and their lines are long and cash only sucks when you rely on your credit card all the time but someone needs to speak up for this establishment.  You need to keep in mind that this is not a traditional sit down Mexican restaurant - it's fast food.. . People come here all the time because the food is fresh, hot and cheap.  The decor is lacking but it's always very clean and the service is great.  I haven't sampled everything on their menu since I always order the same thing every time - rice, beans, salsa, chips &amp; tacos.  There are gobs of melted cheese in their beans and their chips are crunchy and fresh.  Their tacos are the hard shell kind but you get plenty of meat, lettuce and cheese.  What more could you want?  You can't help but stuff your face with two tacos and pile on the watery salsa and beg your mom for a quarter so you can play a game of Pac-Man afterward.  . . Tito's Tacos satisfies a craving for cheap, good Mexican food and it delivers every time.
