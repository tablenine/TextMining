Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
Okay, so we decided to go try Yeah!Burger...except it opened the NEXT day.. That's okay!  We'll go instead to Agave...except we kept getting re-routed, traffic-wise, away from our destination.  So, hungry and beginning to get cranky, we pulled out our handy Yelp app and saw that Pure was relatively nearby with no discernible traffic impediments.. It was early so we didn't get any of the issues listed in other reviews - what we DID get was a BUTT-load of food!  Man, talk about value feed!. . Okay, we did the queso fundido (which was pretty darn good), the the fish tacos (which were also really respectable) and the trio ceviche which were really really good.. We left food - which rarely happens.. We sat outside and had attentive, if bland service; the chips and salsa were really good.  We left with the intention of coming back with hungry adolescents to get fed.. . P.S. They jammed, surprisingly, some fried green plantains in there - nothing wrong with that!
