the ravioli with squash was very tasty and overall the food was good.  i just don't think this resturant deserves the praise of recent.  I found that they seem to have a bit to much of an attitude for an non michelin rated new restaurant.   The chef was not present at my visit as he was opening another restaurant or something.  I was at the restaurant for a friends birthday who is a huge foodie.  He was expecting to do the chef's tasting menu to which he was told that he couldn't.  That they will only do this when the whole table is partaking in this.  Problem was that two people at the table had dietary restrictions and couldn't do this.  The restaurant didn't care.  I found this incredibly rude for a restaurant of this caliber to employ such a practice.  The wait staff was very friendly and helpful.  The service was excellent minus this one silly rule.  I will also say that the food was a bit to pricey overall.
