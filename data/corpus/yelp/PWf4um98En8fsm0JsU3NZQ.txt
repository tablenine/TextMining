Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I came here with my cousin the other day and I must say they have set a very interesting authentic standard for a restaurant. The design is based on the indoor homey experience of the owner. The meat is the best cut you can get and ofcourse his seasoning is excellent. If you come here, you must let the host or waitress to give you a little history and then begin to enjoy their dishes. I ordered their house salad and was impressed the salad came on a freezing cold plate and the fork that came with the salad was actually so cold it still had ice on it. That was awesome! The steak is cut at the side of the table, and their side dishes are standard. I think if you're a meat lover and enjoy the taste of pure meat/ beef then this might be a place you can appreciate. I throroughly enjoyed and there's so much to say yet I don't know where to begin, so I simply recommend this place. I recommend it to anyone to try at least once. It could be the best Prime Rib's you've ever tried.
