I really enjoyed my Mood's Pub experience although it was in the summer and outside.  The outdoor seating is very nice, but it is extremely dark outside and it is so large you may not be able to find your friends without calling them first.  . . The waitresses were friendy and efficient.  I did not actually eat here but they had the best long island ice teas ever.  It was not bitter like most bars, but slightly sweet and super strong.   I remember the inside bar was not anything spectacular but I would love to go back here in the summer for a burger and of course another long island.
