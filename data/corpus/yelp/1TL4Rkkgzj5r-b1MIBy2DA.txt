Wow.. Talk about flavor. Everything is fresh. The price is right and the people who work here are friendly. They even have organic beer and one winery who is all organic as well. Sweet potatoe fries are yummy. I had the portabella sandwhich. My friend had the chicken sandwhich. Its so amazing how the chef can create such amazing flavors. So check it out.
