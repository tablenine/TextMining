I took my bitchy client here one day.  Julie if you are out there, listen up.... your a real bitch and your husband is a loser and and a weirdo.. . Alright back to food.  I did love this place.  I took bitch Julie for a holiday lunch.  The food and atmospere is really cool.  Its kinda hard not to get a little sucked into the whole Wolfgang thing.  Its very nice and the menu has a lot to offer.  I had fish.  Amazing.  The staff is great.  This place needs a reservation of course but its worth checking out.  I really did enjoy it.  Heck Wolfgang even came to our table and shook hands with us and talked for a minute. Pretty cool.  Very nice man.
