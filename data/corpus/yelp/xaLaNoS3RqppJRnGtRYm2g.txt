UPDATE:. Went on a Sunday evening, and the place is as bustling as ever.  Service was impeccable - better than the first time I went.  Pasta Tasting Menu w/ paired wines was sublime.  And yes, the music is still loud, though less obtrusive in the main room, since the ceilings are higher.. . *********************. . It's all been written about already - the food is amazing.  Delicious, satisfying, mouth-watering.  Loved the burrata w/ bacon, loved the ravioli and the tagliatele, loved the orata fish.. . What I didn't love is the music.  Needlessly loud in an already boisterous setting.  I like Nirvana and all, but I prefer it in the confines of my car stereo while I'm battling traffic on the 405, not blaring over my head as I try to enjoy Batali's finest culinary efforts.  It just seemed out of place.. . Otherwise, I can't wait to go again.  They are now open on Sunday evenings, so maybe that'll make it easier to get a reservation...
