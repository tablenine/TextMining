Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Toast is def. the trendy breakfast place in Lincoln Park, and I was skeptical when trying it for the first time. However I would have to say that it is pretty darn good. The french toast, which I usually dont get at breakfast places, is really really good.
