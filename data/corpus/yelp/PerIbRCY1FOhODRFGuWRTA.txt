Fat Cat is a welcome addition to Uptown. A large bar that serves good food was needed in the area, as the popularity attests. The space is visually pleasing and hip. We had a larger group that had reserved a table prior to a show at the Aragon and once we got there we were told we couldn't be accommodated. It's just not a good destination for a group during peak times, and gets way too crowded.. . I have still enjoyed myself here a few times. Their beer list is extensive, and the food is good. You can't miss with a burger, and last night I enjoyed the curried chicken salad wrap, with some of their tasty fries. Last night we kept getting the delayed kitchen report from our waitress, and I have to say by the third delayed report without a Free Appetizer or Drink offer along with it, I was getting a bit annoyed.. . I'll definitely be back, but just probably not on a weekend night.
