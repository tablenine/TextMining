Tender Angus Skirt Steak with cilantro, red sugar, and radish sprinkled with crushed peanuts on a light  Bao bun? Count me in.... . I tend to rave alot about the amazing little arepas at Caracas, so if you want to know what i think of this place, its basically the Bao version of Caracas and arguably just as good, with the downside of a smaller variety. . . But who needs Variety when your main orders are this good? . . The Sweet fries are GREAT... i have no clue what that sauce is they pour over them but its awesome. it literally looks like facial scrub lol for lack of a better descriptor, but it compliments the fries very well. . . The Pork belly bao was also good but the Hausbao is unmatched.  Warning... These things are minuscule so be prepared to order more than a few. . . nothing much to say about the locale... small hole in the wall with decent beats playing in the background
