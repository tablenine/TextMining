Went here around 1pm on a Monday, the place was dead yet we still had to wait for our drink order, meal order, meal arrival, etc.  There didn't seem to be any reason for the delay, and put quite a damper on my meal.  Bloody Mary's were great* fresh pressed tomato juice and spiky seasoning &amp; a good beer selection, but my meal was far less impressive.  My husband got the burger, which although tasty was incredibly messy and a bit over the top- bacon, blue cheese, avocado over a dripping beef patty.  My salmon tartar was flavorless, apple chunks and cucumber should have livened it up but instead seemed to cancel any taste from the dish.  Overall, would not return.  Decor is cold and lifeless, service iffy, not worth the hassle of parking in Hollywood.
