I popped in here for lunch the other day, and it was A-OK. That's it, A-OK. The space is small, and oddly shaped. There are numerous booths that end with a giant half circle booth (reserved for 5 or more), a couple tables in the very front and very back, and then a giant triangle table in the center of the bar that several groups can share. . . I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Not the biggest piece of chicken I've had, actually, it was on the small side (I hate to say that, but in this day, people want so much food, it needs to be carried out on 2 plates, when in all actuality, this piece of chicken is the size a person should actually eat), but the buffalo sauce was very flavorful, and real Blue Cheese dressing. The sandwich came with a heaping mound of fries, all for $7.95. . . I feel the beers were expensive. $4 for Lites, I was drinking Gumballhead and it was $5.50 a draft. The beer list is very extensive, ranging from bottom of the keg domestics to a couple of Belgium imports. . . I'd go here for lunch, a couple of beers and watch a game (can see the TVs from pretty much any seat), but might not be my first stop on a Saturday night.
