I brought my wife here for her birthday.  We were initially seating in the middle section -- where there are numerous tables surrounding a pillar lined with booth seats.  They shoe-horned us in, placing my wife on a seat that already had a purse sitting on it from the party sitting next to us.  I politely requested that they moved us to a table a little more comfortable and private.  Thankfully the hostess obliged and we were moved to the back area for our dinner.. . The menu was a little intimidating.  I honestly had no idea what to order, so asked the waitress what the best dish they offered.  Without even a brief hesitation she said that the Pan Seared Diver Scallops.  Fortunately that was what my wife was already going to order.  So asked what the second best dish would be.  She recommended the Shrimp Ninety-Nine, so I went with that.  And to top it off, we got an order of the Tempura Sweet Potato Fries.. . The scallops were FANTASTIC.  Very flavorful, spiced correctly and the sauce was very tasty.  The shrimp, however, was a bit underwhelming.  It was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't really at all.  The whole dish was just very bland.  The fries tasted incredible, but the order has WAY too much.  Enough for a party of 4 (at the least).. . We ended it with the Chocolate Bavarian Mousse Cake for dessert.  Very creamy and tasty.. . Final Verdict (out of 10):. Pan Seared Diver Scallops = 9. Shrimp Ninety-Nine = 4. Tempura Sweet Potato Fries = 7. Chocolate Bavarian Mousse Cake = 8. . Ambiance = 6. Service = 8. . This was the last Jerry Kleiner restaurant for us to eat at.  I would rank it at the bottom of the 4, but it has some pretty stiff competition.
