Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
"Din Tai Fung came highly recommended as the best dumplings I'll ever have.  It was...in California.  There were many comparisons I've read between this and Joe's Shanghai in New York, and no matter how much I wanted the West Coast to hold the title, it stays in New York.  . . I ate here with 2 friends and was in line when it opened.  Putting all our money on the quality of the dumplings, we went with 4 orders: 3 pork and 1 crab, just for kicks.  While none of us were disappointed with the average sized dumplings exploding with soupy goodness in our mouths, having the memory of Joe's Shanghai dumplings fresh in my mind still left me wanting more.  More so much in size and the associated soup that comes with the bigger size.  . . Don't get me wrong, eating a bigger dumpling may not be possible for many others with less accommodating mouths, but my personal preference is to stuff it as full as possible, which I experienced at JS in NY.  . . In the end, I had a delicious meal and even got 2 orders to go.  They are serious about their ramen.  As I took my goodies away, the gave me directions on how to steam it, for how long, and how long it'd take for me to get to my destination so that I can refrigerate it.  I can appreciate a restaurant like that."
