Some hits, some misses.  One of the guys in the kitchen is profoundly attractive.  I've come back a few times because it is convenient and novel.  I never left hungry but I never left happy.. . Mostly I just find it irritating that street food is so overpriced.  Especially when you aren't exactly paying a premium for expensive boutique-y ingredients.. . Sure.  . . Good on them for finding a niche.  . Good on them for realizing that white people will pay almost anything for something Trendy and Vaguely Ethnic.  . Good on them for a few menu items that are thoughtful, creative and tasty (I'm looking at you, huckleberry and lime soft serve.  also you, the delicious pickly goodness that comes along side the too fatty lemon grass chicken "sandwich"). . However: if you were willing to go to the brown parts of town, you would get the more delicious, less confusing, inspirations for each of the dishes... and you would not over pay for the exact same ingredients.  Also, you won't have to assemble your own GD sandwiches.
