Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
wanted to go to cha cha cha in la and it was closed...then thought about going back to bacaro (yes it's that good that i would go there 2 days in a row) but that was closed so my friend recommended bossa nova...he explained it was brazilian cuisine and that there was pizza and pasta...i didn't get it but whatever we were all hungry and we checked it out.. . and i'm glad we went...everything was amazing! the portions are huge and the service was great. the food is amazing!!! i had the seabass which was amazing and my friends had the smoked salmon pizza, the new orleans pasta, and raphael's pasta and it was all good! i'm not Â a pasta person, but i will definitely come back the next time i'm craving pasta! can't wait :]
