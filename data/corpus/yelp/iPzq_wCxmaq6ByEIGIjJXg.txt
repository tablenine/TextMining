I think in my year and change in LA, this place is the most endearing eatery I've come across. Rarely will delicious come for so little money. The sandwiches range from $3 to $5 and you can't go wrong with any of them. I always like to get a ham croquet or two with my sandwich and nibble at them slowly as my brain surges endorphins. I can't think of a better way to pass the time until your order comes. . . A funny thing about Porto's is I will always leave with something for later and I will also buy more than I intended. It's rare for me to not have to get in line and order a second time. Even if I order pastries to have with lunch, I get more to take home. . . Anytime a friend flies into Burbank, that's the first place I take them. Their breakfasts are really a treat as well. My only knock on Porto's is that it's not open later. I mean, should a place that produces this level of joy be allowed to close?
