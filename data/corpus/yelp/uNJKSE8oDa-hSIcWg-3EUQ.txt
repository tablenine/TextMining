Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Mmm mmm mmm. The waffle-fried chicken-gravy combination did indeed turn out to be delicious... so much so that I stole a bit from my friend. The sweetness of the waffle is a perfect counterweight to the greasy goodness of the chicken. I recommend the number two (2 pieces of chicken smothered in gravy and two waffles). My only complaint is that the waffles aren't cooked the way I like it... they come out unbrowned and a still soft, not crispy. So minus one star.. . Be warned, though, that this place gets PACKED (at least on weekends). I think we had to wait in the blistering sun for about an hour, although it was worth it. Bring a magazine and park your butt on a nearby bench (one of which is a car seat that got ripped out of some unfortunate vehicle) while you have a conversation with the Ethiopian mobile shoe salesman who sets up shop outside.. . One more thing worth noting is that the staff was still patient and friendly when taking our order, despite the madness of the lunchtime rush.
