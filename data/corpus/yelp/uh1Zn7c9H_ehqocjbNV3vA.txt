Great burgers and fries, Surly old men working the counter, cash only and great pie makes this 1950s type diner a great place to eat. Yeah it sucks if the place is packed and you have to wait to be seated but suck it up losers. I love this place and glad i drunkingly stumbled upon this place one oct morn.
