Now that's what I call a steakhouse!. . FOOD:  Love, love, love.  Heirloom Tomatoes WITH Goat Cheese AND Anchovies...I think I've died and gone to heaven.  What a combo!  The heirloom tomatoes were the most vibrant I've ever seen.  The Asparagus was also delicious.  Oh where does thy beautiful produce grow??  Maple-glazed Pork Belly just melted away.  Bone Marrow Flan...do not be afraid; there's not much there (you've gotta scrape it out), but the flavor is ooh, la, la!   I ordered my favorite cut, Rib Eye (served bone-in) and it has never been so perfect!  My husband had the Filet and it was like buttah.  And last, but certainly not least, the wine list was also top-notch.  5 stars...nuff said.. . DECOR: Hello??  Richard Meier!  How can you go wrong?  I love that he didn't succomb to the traditional steakhouse look and feel.  The only thing I found a little odd was the seating on wheels.  I kept rolling around, but overcame it quickly once the apps were served.  5 stars...again R. Meier.. . SERVICE:  Everyone was super-friendly from the moment we stepped in.  No attitude whatsoever.  Our server was wonderful.  I'm glad we trusted her recommendations.  And besides, Mr. Puck himself came to our table and made introductions.  SOOO CUTE! And as if we didn't know who you are......5 stars.. . SCENE:  Hmmm, let's see.  Renee Zellweger dining with Bruce Willis.  Don't ask.  Matthew McConaughey my second visit.  The Beckhams my third visit.  But nobody beats the Puck himself.  So yes, it's a scene.  5 stars easy.. . I shall dream of the day that we shall eat again.
