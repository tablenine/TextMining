what do you get when you combine $15 and a large plate of the most delicious sashimi you've ever had in your life???  SUSHI-GEN. . . for me, hands down, this is the best sushi in the history of all sushi in the entire universe.  if there ever was a sushi heaven, then sushi-gen would be it!  go there right now.  the line is long but it is worth every minute of your life.
