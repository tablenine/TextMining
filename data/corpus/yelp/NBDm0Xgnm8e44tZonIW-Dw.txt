Wow, I can't believe how rough people are being on a place that has been open only two days! I'm not a Silverlake local so I have no opinions as to what I expect to find in my 'hood and what I don't, but it seems to me that in most neighborhoods there should be room for variety. I wouldn't want everyplace to have the same atmosphere.. . I'm not a big fan of modern design as decor, but I think they did a nice job - it's upscale, sleek, and interesting in the details. This is a bit of an ambitious concept to be combining fine dining with a serious coffee bar, so I give them points for treading into unknown territory.. . I had one of the signature drinks, the orange-infused cappucino, and it was thoroughly enjoyable, made with fresh orange zest. I also tried the aged Sumatra clover coffee, which was an excellent coffee as well. These guys are really serious about doing coffee right, and it shows. I can see how it could be a bit confusing at first figuring out where to go if you want just coffee vs. if you plan to sit down and dine, but it shouldn't take long for most people to figure it out.. . As for the tea menu, I found the whimsical tea descriptions for the tea blends quite entertaining, and they still had a "serious" selection of teas for those who want to swing that way. Again, I think there's room for both. Next time I'd like to try more of what's on the menu, but from what I saw so far, I think LaMill's first foray into coffeehouse/restaurant territory has some great potential. The place looks beautiful, and the coffee I had was divine.
