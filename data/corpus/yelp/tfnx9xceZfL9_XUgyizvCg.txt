Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This  is a great dumpling house.  Everything we ate was delicious, the food was very affordable, and the servers actually spoke English!!!  . . However, I have two large complaints.  First, the waitress took something we ordered and said we didn't want it.  Then just crossed it off our list.  Now, I'm always up for helpful suggestions, but I really don't like when restaurant servers tell me what I cannot eat.... . Second, and the more important of the two, is that this place doesn't have pork buns.  Well, actually they do have pork buns, but not the ones I was thinking of.  The ones with sweet red pork in the middle... which I love oh so much.  They have something called pork buns, but it's completely different (though still pretty tasty).  For the false advertising (and false hope) they get minus one star.
