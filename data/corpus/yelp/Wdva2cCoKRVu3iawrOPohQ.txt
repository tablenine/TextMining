I actually decided to dine at Devon Seafood Grill because of all the good reviews I read on Yelp. It did not disappoint! Really great food and fantastic service!  . . We started off with a few appetizers: the Lobster tamale, which I highly recommend;  the roasted Duck Flatbread was especially fantastic, the Fig barbeque and the Gorgonzola goes really well together; seared Scallops was just ok; I was a bit bummed about the coconut green curry Mussels since I'm a curry lover, it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I had the Macadamia crusted Opah and was very pleased with the dish. It was very fresh and perfectly seasoned; the crunch was just right and I thought the seasoned berries really complimented the dish. My friend had the vegetable Ravioli w/Lobster, I didn't try it but was told it was very much worth the $24.50 + tax. . . The restaurant itself has a very romantic setting, but great for a dinner out with family (not so much children) and friends as well. The hostess was very friendly and our server was very attentive. Food came out pretty quick even though it was a busy Saturday night. Overall, a great dining experience.
