Classy, good looking place. Over priced food but it was delicious and the presentation was nice. A friend's steak &amp; eggs were uniquely plated (or should I say "bowled"). I had granola with steamed soy milk. It looked like a small portion when it came out, but it was filling and tasty.. Waitress was wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable. She walked us through the crazy first few pages of coffee choices since we'd never been there. She asked us our preferences as if she were going to get us a bottle of wine-do we like light, medium or dark roast? Dark. "I'd recommend the Black Onyx. It's really rich and dark, but not bitter at all." Excellent. I love a server that makes intelligent suggestions based upon a series of intelligent questions asked to the diner. The coffee was great.. I had a great experience here this morning. The only thing is the price. But if you have money, why not spend it on a nice experience?
