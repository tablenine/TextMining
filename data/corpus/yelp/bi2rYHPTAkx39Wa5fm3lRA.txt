I want to add my 2 cents too.  Fabulous! Need I say more?  Best steamed pork dumplings with broth inside that I have ever had in the United States.  There's something about the dough they use that the dumplings don't get soggy and the juice doesn't leak out without the wrapping being too thick.  Though their prices aren't cheap and there always seems to be a wait it is totally worth it.  They also have really good shanghai rice cake but somethings it may taste a little bland.  I come here strictly for their dumplings, their shaomai is not the greatest so I usually don't order that.
