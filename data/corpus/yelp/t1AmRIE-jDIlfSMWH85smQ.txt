Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
All this place is hype for their Spicy Ramen challenge. When eating something I always want my food to feel complete, well balanced, and thoroughly tasty. Orochon is not. . . I ordered a soy sauce based ramen. Noodles were meger in a whole sea of soup. The soup lacked bold flavors. Noodles were ok. There did not seem to be a complementing wholeness to the dish. The items did not blend well.. . As for the #2, a friend ordered it. Similarly there was a tiny portion of noodles compared to the large amount of soup. So basically if you're doing the challenge, you'll be drinking a huge bowl of spicy red soup.. . Overall I find this place a novelty. It's not that impressive and I don't think I'll ever go back again.
