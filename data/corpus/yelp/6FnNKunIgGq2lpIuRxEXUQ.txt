On this Day of Days, Motivation is smothered in gravy and served with melt-in-your-mouth waffles.  We passed by a Church's, KFC, AND a Popeye's, knowing full well there was only one place to get awesome fried chicken.. . Special #2, biscuits, mac &amp; cheese. It's a good thing my buddy and I toned down the number of sides, because they give a lottttt of food:. . Chicken - juicy and rich.  Best tasting chicken I've ever, ever had.  Best gravy to go with it, too.  For a sometimes-slow eater like me, you might want to consider the gravy-less #1 to prevent soggy chicken.. . Biscuits - so damn buttery, so damn good.  Glad I had a bunch of extra gravy to deal with these.. . Mac &amp; Cheese - really rich and flavorful.  I felt my arteries clog up with every bite, but that's never stopped me before.. . Alas, I couldn't finish and took a wing and the mac and cheese home.  And when my body realized I planned on having soul food two meals in a row, it resisted.  But only half-heartedly :)  Good times.
