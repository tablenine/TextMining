This place makes me totally happy. I haven't been awhile, hopefully nothing has changed. I agree with some of the other reviewers about an occasional annoying crowd... Â any 24hour place will have those people and really the "ambiance" of Buddha is so enjoyable that it's hard to notice them. I'm pretty picky and this place is okay by me. Thanks for the good food and good times!
