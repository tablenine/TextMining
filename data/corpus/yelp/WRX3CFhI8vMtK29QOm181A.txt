Coming from a brunch fanatic, you def need to check out this place. My girlfriends and I opted to try the place out since we'd be shopping around Melrose. I decided on the Blu Jam Benedict. Eggs benedict on a fluffy croissant. It doesnt get any better. Our waitress was also super friendly and attentive. Two thumbs up :) will be going back for sure.
