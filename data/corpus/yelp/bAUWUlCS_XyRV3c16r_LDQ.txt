Category: Wine Bars
Last night I ventured into Bluebird Bistro. I have to say that it was very nice. My first impression was that the decor seemed very industrial, but after a while I really liked the vibe. The wine list is great! They have so many options. Food wise, I can't complain, the menu was interesting and the prices were not bad. I like this place and would go back. I can't give it 5 stars because the mussels weren't amazing.
