Category: Mexican
We walked north to Randolph street and on a whim went into de cero. The slick latino-chic decor embedded saucy energy into the atmosphere. The food took traditional roadside flair and added a modern update to it. The chile rellenos oozed with queso and coupled with smoked tomato salsa.. . But the highlight of the night was the Grilled Chicken Mole. Seriously, my demeanor completed changed when i took a bite out of it. The boneless half-chicken was grilled to perfection--skin crispy with its hash marks but still retaining its juicyness. Served atop sauteed escarole and basmati rice the mole sauce wasn't blanketed on top but put at the bottom of the dish.. . And the intenseness of the mole sauce. A perfect melange of flavors and texture.
