Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
If you have another sushi place within walking distance that you like-save your bus fare-if not, it's worth the bus fare.. . My husband and I decided to try Toro Sushi because we wanted to see if Toro Sushi was all that people say it is and whether or not we enjoy this sushi better than Oysy Sushi in River North...We prefer Oysy.. . Pluses: . If you sit at the bar you might get to try some fish for free.. The Maki rolls we tried-avocado, shiitake, and california were all great.. You can BYOB. If you sit at the bar you can watch them put your sushi together.. You put your name on a list and they will call your cell when your "table" is ready.. Minuses:. There was a 45-60 minute wait at 7:45 PM on Saturday and when we did get a place it was at the bar (we did prefer a table).. The maki rolls were smaller than we're used to.. They only give you about 5 pieces of ginger and we got all three roles at once (18 pcs)!. The wasabi was not very hot at all which makes us think it wasn't that fresh.. . So-overall it's good tasting but these minuses were why I gave it a "3."
