Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Probably one of the strangest pizza places I've been to.  . . I listened to all the hype, bought it,  and ate here some years ago and just had the life sucked out of me when I saw and tasted the listless frozen-looking pizza.  WTH, why would anyone wait an hour and pay for this pizza.  Then, some time after, leaving the Chalet(an earlier review), a few friends bounded up with Casa Bianca pizza leftovers and, curious, I took a bite and wondered how in the world did they get so good?  I checked chowhound and found out that you have to order their sausage pizza, or their sausage and eggplant pizza.  Once there, they have never failed again. . .  Don't go there expecting every one of their pizza to be a knock-out--they aren't, you'll be disappointed and bewildered and think good people have lost their minds.  Get their sausage and eggplant(oh yeah, it's fried), and you'll be happy.
