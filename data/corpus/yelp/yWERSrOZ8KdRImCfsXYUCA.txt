Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami is very solid but the burgers really need to be bigger.  These are like little appetizers.  That being said, they ARE delicious so it's tough to rate this any lower than 4 stars.  You can always fill up on the little side dishes they have and you should absolutely try the ice-cream cookie sandwich.  Pretty strong...although not sure how you can screw that one up.  Oh yeah - this place's food is better than 8oz burger...but at least 8 oz burger has a full bar.  . . Finally...you gotta love the cups they serve their drinks in.  They are plastic, circular and have a thumb indentation spot that is pretty exciting.  I know that has nothing to do with the food - but if you can't get excited about plastic cups with thumb indentations...there is something wrong with you.  . . Definitely go to Umami burger...but order two burgers unless you are a ninny.
