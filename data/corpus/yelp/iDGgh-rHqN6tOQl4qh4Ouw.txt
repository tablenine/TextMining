I likey. . . Scored gift certs on the . http://restaurant.com.  website and used those and since have been back a few times. Check them out.. I think it's Tuesday nights when entrees are half price. I look forward to a night when I can get seated with ten people and then try every dish they have. Portions are made for 2-3 so be aware when ordering. Crab Rangoon's were very good, still not the best in Chicago but close. The food is clean and crisp, not heavy like a typical restaurant. Easy to have a meal with wine and go do other things afterward. It's BYOB, across the street there's a liquor store connected to a karaoke bar, wine and assorted beers available (Few IPA's and surprising choices). . There is probably seating for about fifty, it's an intimate small place great for dates or an easy going group. Behind a curtain in the front is a coat area I always wondered why no one ever mentions it, not sure if its for customers or only staff. There isn't any space for waiting, once that area has four people the rest of you are standing outside, so take that into consideration and call ahead. Parking can be found on the street no worries.
