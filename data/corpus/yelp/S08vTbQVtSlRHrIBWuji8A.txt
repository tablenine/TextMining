AWESOME.. . I liked the energy of the restaurant right when you walk through the door.  The space is beautiful and elegant with good lighting.  . . I don't know if there was music playing but if there was I couldn't hear it because the restaurant was very loud.  I didnt mind it though.  I love restaurants with big energy.  If I was gonna be at a boring and quite restaurant I'd probably be 80 yrs old looking at the early bird special at some empty diner in New Mexico.. . We got there at 9:00 with no reservation and there was a 30 minute wait.  I didn't mind waiting because I preceeded to enjoy a refreshing goose on the rocks while walking around and looking at the pastry and dessert display in the front of the restaurant.  . . After we got seated we were given a complimentary bottled water and the wait staff was very friendly.  We ordered a burrata and prociutto pizza, roasted chicken and a side of spinach and mini hamburger sliders.  Our bill was only $35.  Amazing!
