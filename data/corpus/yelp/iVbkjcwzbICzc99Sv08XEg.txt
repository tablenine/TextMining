This place is a great hang-out. Â I just came from there with friends and, once again, loved my experience there. . . I had the Darjeeling Tea and split the Kitchen Sink cookie. WARNING: The Kitchen Sink cookie is dangerous! If you have any desire to lose weight - STAY AWAY! If, however, you want something delightful and eye-closing-good-because-they-warm-it-up-first-and -you-will-never-ever-ever-ever-be-able-to-stop-eat ing-this-damn-cooking-because-it-is-so-freaking-am azing-and-wonderful, then this is the cookie for you!. . I also had a bite of the carrot cake, which was also very good. . . I love this place and wish I were getting my Master's degree or something so I could go there and read.
