I used to hang out ( in a manner of speaking) in L5P back when it was fairly seedy. I was more attracted to that element back then. . . the element that was there, back then (some might say "back in the day") is not really there so much any more.. . Larissa G made a good point: it is like an Atlanta version of Melrose in LA. Interestingly enough, VA-HI was more like Melrose a few years ago. It is interesting to see the neighborhoods evolve as time goes by, seemingly mutually-exclusively. But upon further inspection, maybe they are more inseparable than that.. . My observation of Melrose is that it is genuinely an "organic" mesh of very high-end boutiques and grungy indie shops. but, alas, this is LA and we all KNOW what goes on there :). . VA-HI is the new buckhead. L5P is the new VA-HI.. . but where oh were is the bottom of the ladder? EAV? hmmm - not as far as i can tell. where oh where is it?. . some say that when a starbucks comes to a neighborhood it is all uphill or downhill from there. depends on how you look at it.. . sheena was a punk rocker.
