Category: Breakfast & Brunch
when i moved to Hollywood, i heard of a place where you get chicken and waffles. i was, to say the least, intrigued. what an odd but good sounding combo i thought. . . so late one night i make my first trip, 1am on a Thursday. holy eff it's packed! like out the door and loads of guys hawking their wares on the sidewalk. what an odd site. . . finally we get a table and i notice a drink list that has 2-4 different drinks mixed into one! now you're speaking my language! so i get some 3 part drink that comes in nice sunrise looking layers. very cool. . . with the help of the server i get half chicken with waffles and onions gravy something like that. it comes and smells like a slice of sweet chicken heaven. i try a bite of each part, chicken rocks, waffles are great, and gravy is da bomb yo. so then naturally i next mix it all into a giant mush and start to chow down. . . I'm in a blissful state the entire time, gravy is running down my neck but i don't care. all these artery cloggers are melding into the most unhealthy of sins. syrup, butter, gravy cover every sweet bite of waffle and chicken. i clean it all down the place and bones. ahhhhh I'm lost in meat coma. so nice. . . I've been back half a dozen times or so in the last few years and it's always been good. i almost prefer late at night just for the crowd. they can be pretty fun.
