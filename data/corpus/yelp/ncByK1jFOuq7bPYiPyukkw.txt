Ive never had real shabu shabu Â before and never really wanted it, but i got dragged to it. Cook your own food are you serious? It took me forever to try korean bbq. Its alot of work, and im not very good with chopsticks. they do give you alot of meat, and i did use all the fixins. And we worked the garlic, green onions and horseradish. I did enjoy it after i figured out how to use everything. Even went again a couple days later. My only knocks are that its hard to talk to who you're with, really long wait, and they close early. If you havent been, here's the menu: Medium Plate or Large Plate.
