Restaurant: Panahar Bangladeshi Cuisine
Category: Restaurants
People have got to align their expectations with reality. In terms of affordable, tasty, hole-in-the-wall Indian (Bengladeshi) food, Panahar is 10/10. Not too greasy, carefully prepared, and well spiced, it's hard to find ethnic food like this in the states. . . Cheeky service and BYOB no fees are added bonus. . . Catfish Doppiazza and raita are peerless.
