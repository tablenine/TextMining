We are pretty much regulars at Wishbone at this point, and I just wanted to update to say how much we enjoy this place.  The food is consistently excellent and it's just so nice to go to a reasonably priced place with great food where the staff is GENUINELY FRIENDLY.  It really lifts your spirits.  Go to Wishbone!
