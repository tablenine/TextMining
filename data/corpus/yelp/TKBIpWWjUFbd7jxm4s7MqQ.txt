You cannot go wrong at Little Bangkok! Their Mandarin Chicken is like no other that I have ever tried and...I have tried a lot. . . It is lightly breaded with big chunks of chicken in every bite! The glaze that covers the breaded delights is a wonderful mix of sweet and savory ingredients. . . I have to admit..looks a little sketchy especially that it is next to Southern Nights but I assure you that it is no "little gang bangcock" It is definitely the place to fulfill all Thai cravings!
