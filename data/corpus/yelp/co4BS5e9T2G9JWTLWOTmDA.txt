This would be 5 hands down, if not for the price.  It's just a little expensive as 4 smallish dumplings comes in at $7 and $8, however I'll be back a lot because the flavor was unlike anything else I've had.  The dumplings were packed with unique and delicious flavor that was a little different than expectation.  My husband and I each got a dumpling and a noodle and shared a phenomenal kimchi - really, really great kimchi - and it came out to $44.  A couple bucks cheaper on everything and we'd be eating here every day.
