We came here early Sunday morning for breakfast.  The place was pretty much empty minus two other parties yet we still had to flag someone down to take our order after waiting quite a while.  First problem- dirty coffee mug.  Second problem- one guy in our party ordered the oatmeal with fresh fruit.  Within the first spoonful, he found a centipede crawling around in the fruit.  Food was mediocre.  I had the pork belly sandwich but I might as well have had a Vietnamese sandwich in China town and could have saved at least $10.  Third problem- we were a party of 7.  We split the bill on three credit cards and included tip on each one- we did the bare minimum for a standard party of 6 or more ~18%.  The dippy waitress took it upon herself to charge us above and beyond that.  I'm fine with tipping my waiters and waitresses- it's a hard job.  But when a restaurant is empty and you're still a sucky waitress, a generous tip is not in order.  She came back to our table with the bill and said, "sorry, you guys didn't put enough money on these cards so I charged this person's card the difference".  When we added up what she was charging us, we discovered that she was essentially giving herself a 25% tip!!!  Usually when someone is going to mess around with your credit card and put more money on it then they should be, the proper protocol is to check in with the person/people- not just charge!  So we complained, and she looked at us as if we were idiots.  When we kindly explained we'd already included tip, she just kept looking at us saying "I'm sorry" but obviously not meaning it.  It took her and another waitress another 20 minutes(!!) to figure out what should really have been a simple bill!  I will never come back to this place again.
