For being the biggest seafood lover this place truly hits the SPOT. Amazing! Amazing! The best shrimp cocktail I've ever had, so plump and juicy! The oysters amazing! The crab cake sandwich... Shall I go on?... There house drinks are also very good and strong might I say! The also have a very nice wine list. A great place for dates and going out with your friends. I've been 3 times! Take my word for it, you'll love it!
