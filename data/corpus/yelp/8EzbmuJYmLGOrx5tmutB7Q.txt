I am giving Big Star - three stars because I was there 4 times - I had three good experiences and one really bad experience. . . The food here is really good and priced well so I can forgive the staff and their belligerent attitude....for the most part. . . My first three or four times there, I didn't have any problems. It wasn't all hugs and kisses, but nothing terrible.  My most recent visit was at the walk up window where I encountered, the Taco Nazi.. . It was a Tuesday night around 10pm, I ordered a veggie taco from the walk-up window.  I must add, I was the only person at the walk up window.  You pay at one window, walk 3 feet and pick up your taco - but NO ONE tells you to save your receipt.. . The Taco Nazi started to yell "62!"  "62!" I was confused, wasn't sure what the hell he was yelling. I asked, "Is that a veggie taco?" and he shrugs his shoulders and continues to yell "62!" I then ask, "Do I need my receipt?"  The Taco Nazi nods "Yes". . . I begin to look for my tiny receipt in my giant purse in the pitch black night.  No receipt.  Taco nazi watches my struggle in jubilation. . . I accept defeat and confess to the Taco Nazi that I cannot locate my receipt.  Taco Nazi shrugs his shoulders in protest and refuses to relinquish my taco.. . I am ready to jump through that little window and kick some hipster ass.  Instead, I growl at Taco Nazi "Keep the Fucking Taco" and head down Damen street back towards the safety of the Gold Coast.  . . In the Gold Coast, we may have douche bags and sugar daddies but at least they don't hold my tacos hostage.
