Restaurant: Ruen Pair Restaurant
Category: Thai
For lunch, a friend and I ordered the papaya salad with blue crab and the green curry chicken.  Both dishes were delicious, and Ruen Pair gave us such generous portions that we ate the leftovers for a light dinner.. . I prefer Ruen Pair to the larger, better-known Palms Thai for the tasty food and great service.  It's also quiet enough to speak comfortably without yelling over the background noise.  . . OVERALL:  Great low-priced Thai food (~$14 for our two entrees).  Bring cash, as they don't take plastic.  Parking in the lot is free before 4 pm.  It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall, and tables fit four people, so probably not great for a large group.
