Everytime I stop by, its like candyland!  I go crazy and want to buy everything in here!. . Parking can be a pain since this place is always crowded.  You can either do street parking which you have to pay the meter and also the back parking lot.. . Their pastrami is delicious.  Better than The Hat.. . The employees are very nice and helpful.  Ordered my potato balls and cheeserolls and left.
