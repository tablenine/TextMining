Birthday lunch here with my office girl LL, it was pretty damn good. The atmosphere is very bar'ish. It seems as if it is an after hours place....not sure about that but, just sayin'. Had Mussuman curry, very few Thai places do it really well. It is hard to get right, it can go very wrong.  The curry was really sweet yet had a kick. LL had the dragon maki. Great presentation, quick service, free miso soup.  We will have delivery.....
