VIETNAMESE + CANTONESE = GANGZTAAAA. Lobster, Clam, Catfish Soup, Kong PAo, Veggie MEAL = 10lbs. LEFTOVERS = 7lbs (maybe I'm exaggerating........mmaybe not). BIG SIGN BEHIND REGISTER = CASH ONLY  . . I dunno who put "ACCEPTS CREDIT CARDS" up on Yelp.  Whoever did almost made me lose face in front of my Dai Lo here and shall be placed on my hit list once I find out. =)  . . Let the waiter fill your beverage up to the brim and serve you like a crime boss, or according to our waiter, he will be "scolded."  Now that's gANGZTAAA for ya.  hahaha. . . mINUS one star for poor parking and cash only.
