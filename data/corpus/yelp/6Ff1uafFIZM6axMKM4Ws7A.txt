I work in the area so I've been to Goldfish for lunch on numerous occasions. Over the past several years the quality of their sushi has improved, however the restaurant maintenance has declined. If you are going to feature an enormous aquarium right as customers enter the door it should sparkle. Â I'm afraid that isn't the case. There are very few fish and the water is murky.
