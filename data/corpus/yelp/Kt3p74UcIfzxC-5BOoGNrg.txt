Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Woot I'm so happy that I've found bottega. Pizzas, pastas, and dishes are all authentic in their own way and very natural so to speak. Choco souffle is bomb as well.. Suggested a friend to take his girlfriend here on valentine's day and they were very pleased. Service is always great and there's never really a long wait. The ambience is very different compared to all the other restaurants in downtown
