5* for the quality and taste of the food.  i don't consider myself a food snob, but i feel i know when i've had high quality food.  it's kinda like buying $1.99/lb chicken breasts at Osco and then eating a chicken from a farm CSA...holy shit - so that's what chicken is supposed to taste like!. . I wish they had a bigger menu, but i understand if quality is what is most important, it's hard to focus on and perfect more than a handful of dishes.  ok fine...forget what i said.. . i'm mixed about the tables.  maybe if communal tables were more common we'd all be more comfortable with them.
