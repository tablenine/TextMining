Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
i've never experienced rude service at ping pong - they're just not overtly friendly. and yes, there's some gender bending going on here, but hey - you're in boystown. all of this is easy to look past once you realize how good their food is.. . first things first, if you don't order the crab rangoon, you're missing out. do not pass go, do not collect $200 - order the rangoon. beyond that, i've tried a variety of items off the menu (not only is it huge, it's seasonal,) and everything has been super delicious. and cheap. and in a huge portion. what's not to like? plus, it's a BYOB ($5 corkage fee - i don't blame them since they have a full bar.) the only thing i have to gripe about this place is that they don't take reservations.. . but the little ping pong paddles that carry your chocolate fortune cookie and the bill - too cute. oh, one more thing - go to the bathroom while you're here. the music is always cranked to the nth degree and there's mirrors on all the walls. never thought i'd feel like the star of a music video while taking a whiz.
