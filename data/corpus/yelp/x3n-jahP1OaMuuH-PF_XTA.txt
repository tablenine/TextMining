Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
Eating at Spago without seeing Puck is like going to Disneyland and being told Mickey and Minnie were killed in a murder-suicide in their Toon Town cottage - that is to say, righteous disappointment mixed with horror.  Maybe if he spent less time hawking crap on a home-shopping station and stocking airports with over-priced chicken chinois, he could spend more time at his flagship restaurant.  Just a thought.. . Anyways, the food was fantastic - when your meal consists of Hudson Valley seared foie gras, shaved black truffle with egg pasta, and fork-tender osso bucco, you generally can't go too wrong.    . . In addition to the Puck no-show, there were other issues: the cold bread,  the seating that was tighter than Nicole Kidman's forehead.    . . Overall, Spago is still definitely worth a visit.  After all, it's still the happiest place on earth.
