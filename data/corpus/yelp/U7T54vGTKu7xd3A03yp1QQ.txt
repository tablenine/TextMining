Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Sunday morning at 10:45...first stop Orbit Room not open 'til 11.  11:00...second stop Kuma's Corner not open until 12.  11:15...third stop Kitsch'n opened over three hours ago.  So much for trying to be the early bird in Avondale.  . . Don't walk out right away when you see that the tiny front room is filled to capacity because the better seating is in the back and if no room still there's a heated garden area beyond that.  Good stuff on the breakfast brunch menu.  Awesome "Eggs in a Basket" with bacon.  Serving Intelligentsia coffee and ok bloody marys.  . . Pretty easy parking on side streets for the day and time at least.  Other options very near by just in case.
