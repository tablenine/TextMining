i haven't been here lately but when i used to go all the time back in the day it was awesome.  good deli food(its all kosher) deserts are just right for the meals.  you have to try the cheese bagles.  they'er regular bagels that have been baked with all kinds of cheesy goodness on the outside!  well, from what i can remember at least.  and their pickles are the best!  i actually hate eating pickles, but for me? canter's is the exception.  . . you can regularly catch all kinds of daytime t.v. soap stars over there for lunch, and old school music producers for dinner..... . parking can suck depending on what time of day/night you get there.  i tried driving around a couple of times to find parking just to end up waiting in the parking lot for a spot to open up.  there is a parking attendant so you should'nt have to worry about your car.  expect to pay for parking if you dont have your ticket validated. . i dont know if she still works there but there is this one old lady that works there that you dont want to say anything smart to...  . . trust me on this. lolz!!
