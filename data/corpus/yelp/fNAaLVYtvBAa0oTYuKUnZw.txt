Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
There's a little bit of happiness in every bite of a freshly made dumpling at Din Tai Fung. I love this restaurant for its chivalrous "Dumpling Warriors" in the kitchen, its madhouse style service, and for its delightful dumplings. . . At my table of 5, it was 10 different varieties of dumplings handwoven by 12+ Dumpling Warriors in the kitchen. In the mix was 3 different orders of soups. All was devoured and we left Din Tai Fung perfectly satisfied. . . It's hard to dine at Din Tai Fung knowing that there is a long wait time. However, the kitchen view of the Dumpling Warriors from the waiting area makes the waiting "entertaining". Placing an order is simple yet complex. It's simple in that the menu is there and all you do is "check mark" the quantities of all your desires. It's complex in which you have to grab the attention of a server to ask questions about the dumplings, how it's made, or even get more napkins because tea spilled. . . As for the food, I love all the pork dumplings and its deviations thereof. However, my favorite is the red bean dumpling. Yes, I am partial to red bean and yes, it's a plain dumpling however Din Tai Fung maintains its delicately sweet and simplicity quite perfectly. As for the soup, I love them here. It's rich and savory broth is distinctively tasty. Â . . If and when you make it to Din Tai Fung; and I hope you do, expect the long lines and the chaotic service, but understand that a little bit of madness is worth it for the food.
