Okay, so never been here before!  5 stars because I had fun. :). . Came here to meet up with what I thought was only going to be one church friend to watch the Lakers game but it turned out being a large group.. . Anyways, the pizzas are good, the service is good, the energy was good and it's a good sized place with lots of television screens to watch the game. :). . Little note:  I liked how my Sprite came with a little marachino cherry.  I haven't gone out in awhile. :)
