Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
It's 3am on a Saturday night and I am drunkkkk. First thing that i think of is wiener circle! I wanted some food and entertainment. Well the lady "Pookie" (i think that's her name) wasn't there. I didn't get that good of a laugh. Ordered cheese fries and a burger. Can't remember how the burger tasted, but the cheese fries were horrible. That cheese was disgusting and I love cheese. I knew i should have gotten tacos.
