Well, my boyfriend and I have tried to go here several times, but have left b/c we were too hungry to wait 45 minutes. It seems that FOURTH time's a charm.  Alas, we still had to wait about 25 minutes, and since the owner doesn't take names, I was convinced it would take longer than he had predicted.  However, he proved me wrong, and he pulled through--calling our name exactly when he said our table would be ready.. . Luckily, we did not have to sit near all of the waiting people, and we had a nice cozy table.  Now, as lovers of pizza of all sorts, we had really been looking forward to trying these pot pies.  However, I must say we were a bit disappointed.  They tasted fine, but were not really anything special.  Although I did enjoy the little show of having the waiter flip it over for us at our table, I must say that the pizza pot pie was our least favorite part of the meal.. . Now, the meal was a great experience.  Not knowing when we would make it in the restaurant again, we decided the to try the whole shabang with the bread, an antipasta salad, a pot pie, and a grinder.  The antipasta was to die for!  As our waiter had warned us, it is not really a salad, it is an antipasta plate full of delicious meats, cheeses, marinated mushrooms, peppers, etc.  It was wonderful.  I think our grinder would have been better had we ordered one made of deli meat only b/c the sausage one we got was a bit mushy from the marinara.   Their other salads looked amazing, and I think I'd like to go back and just order one of those along with the antipasta salad.  Our waiter was wonderful, and even added to the charm of the place since he appeared to be Italian himself.
