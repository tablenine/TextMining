los angeles is known as a city filled with ethnic cuisine. kogi bbq truck is the the perfect example of it. simple korean food with a twist. i'm korean, and this really hits the spot. but i know that people that have not tried korean food before will love it as well. i worked with chef roy so i know that the food will be high quality. i'm eating the kalbi burrito right now as i write and it is soooo good. korean galbi, eggs, onions, potatoes, and the hot sauce. perfect. . . right across the street from green door.
