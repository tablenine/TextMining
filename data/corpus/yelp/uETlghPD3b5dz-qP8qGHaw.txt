Category: Mexican
I call it "Junky Julios", but in all honesty, it's a good family place that's run like a factory, they get you in and out pretty quickly. Yes, it's overrun by families, but they have to eat as well, don't they? . . the shrimp is pretty good, by the way, I'd recommend it. Â As for the people who complain about the wait on saturday night...did you notice most restuarants are busy at that time?
