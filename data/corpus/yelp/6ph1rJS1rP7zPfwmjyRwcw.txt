Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Loved the ramen!! You get to choose how firm/soft you want your noodles cooked. Personally since their ramen noodles are thinner compared to other places I have mine hard which really makes it more chewy. You also get to choose the amount of oil you want in your soup and how salty and spicy you want your soup to be. The broth has rich flavor so I wouldn't opt to go heavy on the salt or oil. Great service as always at shin sen gumi. Can't wait to make a trip out again!!
