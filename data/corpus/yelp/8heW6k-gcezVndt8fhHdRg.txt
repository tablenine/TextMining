My husband and daughter and I have eaten here a few times and each times our expectations are met and then some.  Service, ambieance and food are all superb.   The filet is to die for and the seafood towers are awesome.   Side dishes, espicially potato au grautin are a most and lobster mashed potatoes.  One of the best steakhouses!
