Restaurant: Craft Atlanta
Category: American (New)
Craft definitely lived up to my expectations, but my boyfriend and I both left feeling like it wasn't our most favorite restaurant in Atlanta. . . I was a little nervous about what to expect from our service after reading some of the yelp reviews, but we had impeccable service and our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations; especially given we were completely unfamiliar with the menu and style, so it was helpful to have her make recommendations. . . We started off with the mushroom risotto and quail, and while the portion of the quail was tiny, the taste was unreal and left me wanting more. The risotto was a larger portion and delicious as well. . . Then we tried the salmon and the monkfish wrapped in prosciutto. Both were really good, but the salmon was just a really good piece of salmon, nothing special. The monkfish was amazing though and I couldn't get enough of the lemon buttery sauce it came with. We decided to pass on the side dishes and we both left feeling full without them. . . We decided to splurge and split a dessert - the chocolate tart with tangerine sorbet, which was super yummy, but kind of like a glorified brownie. Â The sorbet would be perfect in the summer months. . . Overall, this was a pleasurable and relaxing dining experience and worth the price, especially with all the little extras they provide (i.e. granola to go, a little taster at the beginning of the meal, and shortbread cookies after dessert) but I would probably try Craftbar next before coming back here (mainly because it is only in my "special occasion budget").
