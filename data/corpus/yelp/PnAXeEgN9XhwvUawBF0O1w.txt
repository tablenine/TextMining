Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
My best friend and I tried El Taco out last summer after driving by nearly every day. We were fierce Taqueria del Sol fans... keyword, were. El Taco is the new Taqueria, at least in our book.. . I've had a little bit of everything at El Taco... fajitas, the mexican "pizza," tacos and sides. If you're a first timer, play it simple and go with the tacos. The mexican pizza was a miss for me, simply because it was too cumbersome to eat. Steak fajitas are great. I usually stay away from anything with shrimp in it here though... there is a fishy taste that overpowers it to me. . . The black beans with crema are amazing -- give them a try, even if you don't like black beans. They have the texture of refried beans, and the crema adds a really good flavor to them. The corn is a great side too, and is a great addition to the fried chicken taco. As far as tacos go, try the red chili steak, the fried chicken, and the grilled chicken.. . And please don't forget the margaritas. I don't know what they put in them, but they taste unlike any margarita I've had in Atlanta.. . You'll encounter a line on Friday and Saturday nights, but that can be said for most places in the Highlands. Service is great, even when they're slammed. . . If you like Taqueria del Sol, you'll love El Taco.
