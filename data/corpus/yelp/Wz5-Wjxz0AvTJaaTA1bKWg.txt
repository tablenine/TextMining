Category: Sports Bars
This place combines sports bar with a formal surf n' turf.  It's pretty unique and convenient.  I would say there's slightly more business people on the road in suits here than hipsters, but in any case not your typical sports bar with tons of college kids or locals.  It's good for if you want to watch sports and eat more upscale, varied dishes at the same time.  Even the late menu retains a lot of the surf n' turf stuff, not just nachos and chicken strips like a lot of places.  . . The food is okay.  I hated the philly cheese steak with a passion, but it's a sentiment that I seem to have about a lot of places.  The surf n turf dishes are better.  Bisque is a little bland.  Prices for food is actually quite reasonable consider its location and clientele.  Not so reasonable was markup on beers.  They carry many good bottled beers, but have a markup that's about 1.5~1.8 times as much as, say, Brick Store a.k.a. beer heaven.  Of course, with a cigar lounge on the premise, you might not be drinking beer and opt for the hard stuff instead.  Unfortunately, you are only allowed to smoke in a small area and the cigars are marked up badly also.  . . Service is very good.  Very comfortable environment and lots of TVs even on the patio.  Proximity to prominent Buckhead places.  All make up for the problems.  Can't say I'm a frequent customer, that's for sure.
