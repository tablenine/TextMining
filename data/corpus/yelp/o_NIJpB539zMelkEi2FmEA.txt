Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Can't hate on Roscoe's.... . everything here tastes good. theres a couple things I have to add to my plethora of reviews though.... you will find on the menu two kinds of fries... . -fries. -fries (alone). According to the staff fries alone is for when you eat fries and only fries and costs $7... where as the cheaper one is cool if you eat something on top of that as well.... . . and unfortunately I found something that I do not care for..... there's a liver omelette... didn't quite agree with me. o_0
