Restaurant: Buddha Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Went there on a weekday night, the place had about 4-5 tables then.. and they had 2 servers working that night. . one complaint that i have was that the server that we got seemed to be a little lost in the restaurant. it took him a while to just come over and greet us, then another few mins for our water to arrive.. and... yes.. another few mins for him to come back to take our order.. and the best part.. it took us about 30 mins for our roti canai appetizer to arrive.. it was about 12am and the place was not packed. i would expect my server to be a little more prompt. . service aside, the food was great. the sweet and sour pork was delicious as usual. and i just love the decor... it is brilliant how they could mix traditional chinese furnitures into a very modern and minimalist interior design. i esp. love the wall hanging (is that what it is?) by the bar.. with the chinese words.. . all in all, great decor, great food, but could use a little more prompt service.
