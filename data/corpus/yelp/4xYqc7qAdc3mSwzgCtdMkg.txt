Food = Fantastic!  Prices = a bit on the expensive side.  Ambiance = poor / very crowded / squished!  Drinks = AWESOME (bring your own).. . I've been to this place several times over the last few years and have always loved their food.  The quality of the food is pretty good, and it is prepared very nicely.. . Bacon Wrapped Dates with almond - Yum!  Perhaps one of the most popular items on the menu!. . Mix medly of sauteed mushrooms - Yum!  About 3 types of mushrooms sauteed in a little skillet with butter and garlic.. . Salumi (salami) Platter - AWESOME!  Came with proschutto, spicy salami, regular salami, roasted beets with olives, and bread.  ~$16. . Cheeze platter - pretty good.  Served with three types of daily choice cheeses (mine was asiago, brie, and provolone(?) - all very nice).  ~$12.. . Mushroom Risotto - DELISH!  Very rich sauce (tons of butter &amp; creme) used to make a nicely prepared risotto, complimented with tons of mushrooms.  One of my favorites!. . Fried Chicken - not memorable.  Typical fried chicken pieces.  No excitement here.. . The wait staff are really nice.  My only complaint is that this place has wayyyyy too many seats.  I was almost sitting on my neighbor's lap.  They have the tables so close together, that it is like you are sharing tables with strangers (2-4" space between tables).  Go early and avoid the crowds.  Inside and outside seating.  Bring your own booze!
