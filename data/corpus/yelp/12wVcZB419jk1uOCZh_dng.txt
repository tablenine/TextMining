I cannot wait to go back!!!. . I had the best salad (S.W.S) per the recommendation of the charming server, Cameron. Â . . There were so many things I wanted to try but didn't have a lot of time.. . Atmosphere is great, service is awesome - very attentive and extremely personable.. . Oh and don't forget - 24x7
