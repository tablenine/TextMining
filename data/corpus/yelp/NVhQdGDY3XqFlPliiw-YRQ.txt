Restaurant: The Nook On Piedmont Park
Category: American (Traditional)
We hopped over to the Nook for the last night of Midtown Restaurant Week. Even though the website said through Sunday, this particular place ended a few days earlier, at least according to our waitress. The rest week menu did not appeal, so no big deal. . . The redneck tato totts was really good, we shared them with our table. The Dragonberry Mojito, served in a mason jar went down smooth and was awesome! . . The steak frites was cooked to perfection, substituted in onion rings. Our server was quick, the outdoor seating on a warm summer evening made for a great experience. We ended the night by trying the tang fish bowl, found it to be overrated. Pass on that overpriced bowl of ice. It was just tang with alcohol, and BLAND. Another restaurant in Philly has the buzz aldren, which is MUCH better.
