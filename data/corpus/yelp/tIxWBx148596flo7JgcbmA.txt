************************************************* . RICK'S QUICK RECAP: . If you're in the neighborhood, stop for lunch or happy hour but skip for dinner . *************************************************  . . So I got wind of this new restaurant while reading the Southwest airlines magazine on my regular business flights.  I was intrigued by what was proclaimed as the first "gastropub" in California, and perhaps even in the US(?).  The concept of high quality, organic, and seasonal food in a casual bar environment peaked my interest so I decided to take a friend for her birthday dinner on Saturday  night. . . It was packed and it had quite a good buzz/vibe to it.  Very dimly lit..very loud with conversation.  We were early and they were running beind on dinner service so we grabbed signature cocktails from the bar.... Bartender was quick to server and was not overly friendly nor stuck up and rude... the best you can expect for some LA bars.  The cocktails were made with care (read not fast) and they were good.  So far so good.... . . Then I noticed a little swarm around a man in a chef's coat...sure enough it was the Executive Chef, who was also Harrison Ford's son... nice to see he makes it out to the dining area.  The second glimpse of celebrity was when the Executive Chef of AOC walked in.  Looked like she wanted to see what the buzz was about and decided to dine there as well... . . Ok, so that was the back story...here's the food critique...started with appetizers...I ordered the lentil salad...now I've never had lentil salad before so I have no comparison but it was served on a bed of frisee.  Way too much lentils...I would have preferred more frisee to balance the mouth feel of lentils overload!  Granted maybe that's what a lentil salad should be...fine...I'll give them that...but here's what I won't let slip.... as I was chewing the 100th spoon of lentils...I unexpected bit down on something hard as a rock... Not sure what it was, I just spit it out....could it be a lentil not fully cooked but still in it's raw hard form?  Unacceptable for the prices it was charging....My friend ordered the baked oysters with a spinach souffle...again... I've never had it before but it came out not looking very appetizing... visualize oysters on a half shell with some green glob on top... presentation was poor...not very creative... so perhaps it tasted better than it looked?  I gave it a try and a spinach souffle over a baked oyster was only as good as that description sounds....not very...call me a purist but I think I just haven't had a baked oyster that can beat a raw cold oyster. . . Moving on to the entrees...I ordered the Roasted Lamb loin with ramps and my friend had the flat iron steak with steak fries... the protein on both entrees were perfectly cooked... my side of ramps, however, was unacceptable as they were too heavy with the salt... even my friend, who normally likes everything on the salty side couldn't take it.  At this point, the celeb chef was at a nearby table smoozing with his girlfriend and other friends.... I have no problem with Executive chefs taking a leave from Kitchen duties...as long as they've left someone in charge of making sure dishes leaving the kitchen are seasoned just right.... in my case... the ramps got missed....again, unacceptable for the price I was paying..... . . For dessert, we split a strawberry shortcake...in a nutshell, nothing to write home about....that's it... . . Wrapping up this review... I'd give kudos to the bar service and signature drinks.... appetizers are not impressive (at least the two we ordered)...entrees were a mixed bag....the protein portion done just right but the sides....um...could just be pushed to one side on your plate and left there....desserts...again, just based on the one we tried, was not worth the $8..... . . If I ever go back again....it's during lunch so I can sit at the bar...get a drink, and order the italian cold cut (prosciutto, salami, etc) appetizer. . . Otherwise just go to see Harrison Ford's son in action (not related to Kitchen work however).
