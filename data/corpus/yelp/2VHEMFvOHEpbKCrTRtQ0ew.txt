This is a place I would of never walked in from the street on my own merit but a vegan buddy of mine wanted to grab some lunch and I was overly impressed with this place! I ordered a flank steak sandwich and a salad which I didn't have intention of eating but practically finished it was so good. . . That set me back over $10 so I was ready to hold a pretty high expectation to this meal. For beverages they don't carry Pepsi/Coke but had a nice collection of local microbrews which I thought was pretty awesome. I opted to try some of the local root beer which was spot on, 5 star for it alone. The steak was pretty good especially considering the name of the place is Tender Greens. I had a low expectation coming in but was thoroughly impressed. . . I actually even enjoyed the salad and ended up practically finishing it. The atmosphere is very fitting and they have ample outdoor seating. Parking is a pain here in downtown Culver City but 2 blocks away you can park for free in the deck behind Trader Joe's. It's free for the first two hours which should be plenty of time to eat.
