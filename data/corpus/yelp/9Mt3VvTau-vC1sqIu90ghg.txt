I went to Cole's two times and every time I had bad experience. First of all food was not that good and tasting stale. I thought it might be the one time thing but when I went second time, it was even worst. I complained about the food to the waiter and he didnt show the courtesy to offer me the replacement. Plus when I checked my CC bills after a month, I noticed that they charged me more than they suppose to. Compare to Philippe, Cole's is way better in food quality and service. I think everyone should try Cole's French Dip once in their life.
