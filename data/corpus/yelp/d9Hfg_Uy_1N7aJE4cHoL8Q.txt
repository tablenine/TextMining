Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Dude, Pink's is off da hook!. . Everytime my wife and I are down in LA, we gotta hit up Pink's.  Everything they serve is so damn good.  Unfortunately, there's always a long ass line, unless you get there before 12pm.  The first time we went, we waited more than an hour in line, with our daughter in a carrier.. . Great hot dogs, you gotta love the toppings!  I'll be there in August, can't wait!
