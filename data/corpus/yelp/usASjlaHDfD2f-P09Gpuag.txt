Out of laziness or indecision, I almost always order whatever the house recommends.  In this instance, there is only one item recommended by the menu: a Crab and Shrimp enchillada.  This thing was horrid.  It looked like someone poured a green and brown smoothie all over my plate.  I ate the whole thing, but it still sucked.  But, at least they're open until 2am.. . The margaritas are okay.  They have a bunch of tequilla that you can choose to upgrade to (most of which are from the same brands, though).  The waiter recommended sticking to the house tequilla and he was right.  The regular margarita tasted like the name implies; I took a sip of the watermelon flavor and, no joke, it tasted like a Jolly Rancher.. . I got there at 8ish on a Saturday night and was quoted a 45 minute wait.  I tried to sit at the bar but there was absolutely no room.  If you're single, this might actually be a good place to mack on the ladies.  Waited outside for no more than 20 minutes before we were buzzed in.  The table we got was probably the worst seat in the house; right next to the bar and buzzing of the waiters as they ran back and forth.  Service was friendly.  It took forever to get our food ordered and brought to the table, but drinks would materialize almost instantly.. . Park on the street or valet if you're smug.
