Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I have been eating XLB (Xia Long Bao) for over 7 years now and I am shocked how overrated this place is. Now I can't tell you where is the best place to enjoy XLB, but it is definitely not Din Tai Fung.. . This place has potential, but I doubt they'll ever change their recipe. I think the outer layer skin made with unraised flour is probably the best, but when you bite into it, it lacks so much flavor. The pork on the inside was meant to be juicy and bursting with flavor. If DTF can execute this, this restaurant could easily be crowned the best XLB/Dumping House. . . I've spoken to a lot of people who experience Din Tai Fung's XLB and most of them agree with me as well. It's "OK," but not thing spectacular. Now if you're spontaneous, I would recommend searching for other Shanghai style dumping house. The outer layer skin might not taste as well as DTF, but you'll see what they're lacking from the inside. My Chinese parents agree with me as well, they felt DTF is overrated, and they prefer other restaurants.. . In terms of importance, I would rank the soup and meat inside the XLB at 60%, and the outer layer skin at 40% when one is rating XLB.. . As I recall, there were long lines, service was slow, and the other food at this restaurant was pretty bad. If you're going to ignore my review, I'm ok with that, but you've been warned.
