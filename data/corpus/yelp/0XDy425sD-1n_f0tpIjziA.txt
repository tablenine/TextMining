I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  Just based on the location, I figured it would be full of tourists and suburbanites, but - well okay, it was that.  However, the food was really good!  And we were looking for a seafood place (since it was a Friday during Lent) and this place fit the bill that night.. . We started with a dozen raw oysters - the Blue Point and the Quilcene - and both were good.  The Blue Point were better - the Quilcene was a little "oceany" for me.  My husband had the char crusted ahi tuna and I had the scallops off of their fresh fish of the day menu.  The tuna was fantastic - seriously, probably ranks in the top 5 of seared tuna dishes we have had.  The scallops were good - very tender, melt in your mouth - but they didn't give you very many and the kind I had were not the huge ones.  They were barely medium-sized.  We also tried the lobster mac n cheese - also very tasty.  Finally, for dessert we had their chocolate lava cake.  It was excellent.. . All in all, I was really pleased.  I'm not sure if I will be running back to Devon anytime soon, but it was a solid dining experience.
