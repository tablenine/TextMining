Went here for a special occasion.  Dinner was not very special.  . . The decor is nice, but the layout is kind of weird.  There were not that many people there, yet we were seated right next to another couple.  It was abnormally close, especially for a half-full place.  We had a Groupon, and so did our neighbors, so I wonder if we were in some Groupon Ghetto.. . As for the food, it was just ok.  I was glad to see ramps and fiddleheads on the menu, especially since I have never tried the latter.  The ramps were buried in the onion soup, you couldn't taste any of that great muskiness of Chicago's namesake.  The fiddleheads were good, tasting rather like asparagus, but the dish they were in was otherwise bland.  Maybe these ingredients weren't intended to be the centers of their dishes, but the chef did not do a good job of highlighting the flavors.  I also got the fried chickpea dish, which did not sound like it was going to be felafel, but it was, and not very good.. . I knew beforehand  that GZ was a 'cheesehole' place, i.e. vegetarian and not vegan, and there were a number of vegan-friendly options.  However there were a few things on the menu, like the sunchoke ravioli for example, that could have easily been made vegan but weren't.  It just seems like they are doing the same thing to vegans that omnivores do to vegetarians, ironically.  And don;t get me started on the total lack of vegan desserts.. . Overall I'm glad I tried.  And I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  Though with so many better fancy restaurants out there, including a few all-vegetarian or all-vegan, I don't see much of a reason to come back.
