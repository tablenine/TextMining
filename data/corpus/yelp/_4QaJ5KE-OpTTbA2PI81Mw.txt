Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Of all the Roscoe's in LA, this one is easily the worst.  Not because it's seedy, but because it takes too damn long to get your food.  My mac and cheese was lukewarm.  Boo!   Go to the Hollywood or Long Beach one instead.
