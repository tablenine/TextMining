Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
I really dislike going to Decatur because theres no direct or quick way to get there from my part of town, but at the invitation of some friends, Jane and I finally made it out to the Brick Store for the first time last night.. . At first glance I was worried because there was a crowd of people standing around outside. Luckily our friends had already secured a table inside. They had a pretty good selection of food. My burger and Jane's pierogies were both delicious. They did not stock my favorite Strongbow cider, but they had several ciders I had never heard of, which was interesting, so we gave a couple a shot. Jane got some French cider (forgot the name, I was calling it Twelve Dollar Cider after seeing the bill) and I got some other cider that was served to me in a coffee mug. Strange but tasty. I also had a Rogue Double Dead Guy which I thought was ok and I don't really drink a lot of beer.. . The only real negatives I could think of were that parking was a pain and the place was slammed, making the service a little slower than I thought it should have been.. . Anyway, if you're a beer snob, you will love this place, so give it a shot if you want to taste beers you can't find anywhere else.
