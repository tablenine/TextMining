Lots of reviews for this place so i'm going to keep mine short.  The service was outstanding.  The food was good, but not amazing.  Desserts were outstanding.  Wine list was outsanding.  People were super great. . . But for the price, we did the six course taster which cost $110 a person, I wasn't impressed (and it won't be worth repeating).  I consider myself a bit of a foodie, and as there is so much good food in this city, it isn't worth going back unless someone else is picking up the tab.. . Entrees:. 1. Wagyu Beef Ravioli, Foie Gras and Chive. 2. Alaskan Halibut, Young Carrot, Ginger. 3. Glazed Veal Ribeye, Spring Garlic, Asparagus, Wild Mushroom. . Of the three entrees we ate, only the first was really interesting.  The other two were good but could have been cooked anywhere.. . To sum it up, its worth trying if you have never been, but if you have been to Charlie Trotters, Schwa or other places like it, you won't be blown away.
