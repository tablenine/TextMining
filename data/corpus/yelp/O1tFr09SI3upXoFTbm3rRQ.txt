Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Came to Griddle Cafe on a Friday morning before heading up to yosemite. I was surprised at how crowded it was on a Friday morning, don't people work around here? But the crowd wasn't too bad, the place was full but we didn't have to wait for a table! Yippee!! . . Griddle Cafe is cute...it's jammed packed with tables close to together your almost touching your neighbors or listening to their conversations which tend to do (bad habit, being nosy). But the place gets pretty loud inside and there are two large TVs on top. There are also some private rooms in the back. Very cool. . . I ordered the Fiesta Scamble!! Ole!!! I was sold with Fiesta! The other scramble we ordered was the Chicago Charlie's Scramble. I definitely loved the Fiesta...truly a fiesta en mi boca !!! And the portion is fairly large, I definitely couldn't finish it all. The Chicago Scramble tasted like a chicago dog or something....I think I liked the Fiesta more! . . I would definitely come back here!! For the fiesta and perhaps try some pancakes because they looked delish. Also the coffee here was pretty damn good. I always love a place with good coffee. . . http://static.px.yelp.....
