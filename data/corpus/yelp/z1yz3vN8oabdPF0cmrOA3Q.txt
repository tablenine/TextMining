Great prices for very yummy food =d  I remember when I first went in there, I was so overwhelmed!  I didn't know what to get and everything looked so good!  You'd think that I would've decided after waiting so long in that line of theirs but nopes!  I asked the girl helping me and she was very helpful.  I basically bought 3 boxes worth of food for about $20.  And while I was doing this, my friend was over at Yummy Cupcakes spending $20 on about 8 cupcakes...haha...loser =P. . So my DEFINATE faves:. Fruit tart. Creme brulee. Potato ball. Cheese roll. . Those are the 4 things I always buy when I step in there.  I also liked this pina colada like cake that they had.  It was purple with a white flower on it, very tasty but I'd be overdoing it if I got that along with those 4 things...right?  Haha!. . I've tried their Midnight sandwich, not bad but I'd like it more if it had more meat O=)  I really liked their potato and leek soup.  Their sourdough bowl was yummers.  And my friend got their turkey melt, I think it was, that thing was A-MA-ZING!  He usually can't eat onions but he had no trouble devouring that sandwich that day.  Their plantain chips weren't half bad but I feel like they were missing something =T. . But yes!  Good food at great prices, definately a winner =d. . Oh yeah!  Cups for water are right by the soda machines.  I was so confused when first wondering if I should stand in like just to get a cup for water XD
