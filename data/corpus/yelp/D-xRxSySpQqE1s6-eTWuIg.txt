Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Jerry's does have a zillion sandwiches that are tasty and delicious, but then they frequently run out of MANY of the breads. So be ready for some disappointment to come your way.. . You get to order two sides with your sandwiches. The listing of these sides is on a separate menu. Why don't they have the sides listing on the main menu itself? I wonder what on earth stopped them from doing that. . . The service is slow. very slow. It takes forever to get anything from the kitchen.. . As with the breads, they frequently run out of lemonade, cider and yada yada. . . I wish you all the luck!!
