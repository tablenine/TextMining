Good solid kabob joint.  I suggested Turkish food to my fellow 3 out-of-town business visitors, after overcoming some initial resistance ("But I don't like curry") I convinced them to go.  They hesitated again when we got there (the place doesn't look like much from the outside), but once I saw that they had Efes I figured it was the real deal and I insisted that we stay, and not go to the Capital Grille across the street. . And boy were we glad we did!  The large plate was excellent - who knew carrots could be so yummy.  I had the adana kabob which was excellent, and also had one of my co-workers kefte which was good.  My colleagues could not stop raving about the food. . We got there early, so initially the service was good, it tailed off once the place got crowded.  Despite there being a long line, they ignored us for a long time after we finished eating, and we had to beg for the hesabu - not that it was bad for us, just the people waiting.  The kavessi and baklava were soso.. . But this was a great find (thanks once again Yelp) and I would definitely come here again
