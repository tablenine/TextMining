I really love this place. Prices are a little on the steep side, but the food is just so good it almost balances out. The service is hit or miss, most the time I go early on the weekends to miss the crowd, and usually seems the watiresses just woke up from a long night, or woke up stoned, I dont know, the food is stellar tho:)
