Perhaps I should have gotten a dessert ... or some type of delicious baked good, but it was dinnertime. I wanted a sandwich. So I got a panini. It was the most mediocre panini I've gotten, and at 6 bucks with no chips or anything, talk about a rip-off. I got a lemonade, which at 3 something or other was also overpriced. I was hopeful, but it was disappointing.. . The interior is dark and dank, no free wi-fi, not really welcoming. The guy at the counter was helpful when I asked him a few questions, but I was dismayed to find out they were pretty much out of the day's soup. . . I should have gone elsewhere, but I wanted to give the local joint a try. If I go back, I'm sticking to baked goods and coffee (though I've heard even the baked goods are overpriced ...).
