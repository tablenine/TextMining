Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
I think I have been here more times than any other restaurant in Atlanta. Maybe not the best Italian in the Atlanta, but you can't go wrong here. Never had anything bad - and always something to take home for the next day. My favorite is the baked ziti and sausage, but it is all good. Make sure you get the big size and not the half - for 3 or 4 dollars more you get twice as much and just share it or bring it home. Also, try to make a reservation before you go - this place gets pretty crowded. . Great for kids and big parties - it gets a bit loud in here (and good for my crying baby too).
