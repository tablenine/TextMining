love it, but maybe amateur sushi eaters should not sit at the bar.  some girl shoved my date while trying to sit down next to us, and when the chef asked what she wanted, she didn't know and said, "umm, is your fish fresh?"  yes, at one of the best sushi places in town!  i've sat at both the bar and the tables, and service was great both times, but if you're annoying, then they'll probably be annoyed at you.  there is no shame in not knowing that much about sushi, just sit at the tables and ask your waitress, don't waste the sushi chef's time at the bar, they're frikkin busy as hell.  and they are not nazis in anyway.  Nozawa stresses me out.  if you want ambience, go to R23.  if you want to pay a lot more, go to Sasabune.
