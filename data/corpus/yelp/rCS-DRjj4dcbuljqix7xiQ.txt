Went here with a co-worker for lunch.  We sampled three things and shared them just to maximize our experience.  Since it was lunch time, we went with the following:. . 1927 (Italian Sub):  Was pretty good - 6.5/10 probably.  The ingredients seemed tasty but it was a little skimpy - too much bread and not enough goods!. . Italian Beef:  Also 'pretty good' but not spectacular.  The peppers had a small kick to them and that was pleasing.  The bread was tasty.  6/10. . Meatball Sandwich:  Favorite of all three.  The meatballs were really tender and kind of fell apart when you took a fork to them.  The sauce had a great flavor.  It could have used some melted provolone but that's another story.   8/10. . This leads me to my recommendation for this place.  Since the marinara was good on the meatball sandwich, I'd stick with the traditional pasta dishes here, like spaghetti.  I'll bet that's their sweet spot.. . I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool actually -although I was WAY under-dressed.  Expect a lot of suit coats in this place - after all, it is in the loop.
