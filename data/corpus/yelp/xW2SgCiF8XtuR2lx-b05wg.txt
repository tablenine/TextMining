I could not pronounce the name of the restaurant for the life of me. Did that stop me from enjoying it? No, not at all.. . Here's some tips to avoid confusion when you get there. You order at the counter that you see when you enter. There are different toppings you can choose for the sausages and different sauces you can choose for the fries. You can order beer there, too. Or you can go around the corner and order beer at the bar section. Water is in a silver cooler; you can serve yourself. The water is cucumber flavored. The tables in the main section are like long picnic tables, sit where you can find a spot. There are also circular tables on the sides.. . Sharing with friends, cutting up the sausages in threes so as to try all of them - Yes.. . Fries with truffle oil &amp; ranch dressing - Yes. . . Rattlesnake sausage - Yes, very good. . Alligator sausage - No for me, too spicy and "gamey". Mike L used that term so I will imitate him here.. . Sun dried tomato chicken sausage - Yeah, but I might not order it again. It's good though.. . The wait time was slightly longer than I expected and it did get louder towards the end of our dinner but part of that means the place is well liked. I could see why.. . P.S. Robert C, formerly of Aliso Viejo, gave me this pronunciation for the restaurant after reading my review: "Vorst-koosh-ey". Thanks Robert!
