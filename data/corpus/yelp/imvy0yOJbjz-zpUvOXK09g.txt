NOT all BYOB anymore! Last time i was in Friendship, I brought a beer and they told me they don't do BYOB for beer, as they now have a very crappy list of very expensive cheapie beers.. . The food was good as always, but now with the $6 cork fee for wine and no BYOB beer, it kind of lost that one final star for me.
