I really like this place. Been here twice. First time I had the apple tart with ice cream which is really good. A different twist to apple pie but very good. The second time I came I had the Wimpy Burger with grilled onions and french fries. There ain't nothing wimpy about this burger. Very filling and tasty. When I come to Hollywood again to visit my friend I want to come here again.
