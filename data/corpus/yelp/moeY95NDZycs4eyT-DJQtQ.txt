Category: Japanese
HANDS DOWN BEST RAMEN EVER!. I love that you can customize it to meet your needs. They give you a sheet of paper asking if you want a lot of oil, how you want your noodles done, how strong you want the broth, etc etc. Their specials are really good too. What I usually do is get one bowl that comes w/ spam musubi, and have a friend get a bowl that also comes w/ a side of fried rice.. and we split it! Perfect!!. . Btw you gotta try that fried rice. It's amazing.. . Oh and I love being greeted when I'm coming/going. It makes it feel so home-y (even though I'm not Japanese). But still. Definitely check this place out! And be prepared to wait if you go during prime eating hours.
