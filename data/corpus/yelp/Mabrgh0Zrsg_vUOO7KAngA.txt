Crazy wait.  But damn it, that juicy pork and crab dumpling sure makes the wait worth while.  Same with the pork and shrimp dumplings.  Had the string bean vegetable, and was quite good.  Also enjoyed the appetizer, which I heard differs depending on the season.  It was a chopped bean sprout mushroom medley, and I enjoyed it.  For dessert however, the red bean dumpling are holy F'in amazing.
