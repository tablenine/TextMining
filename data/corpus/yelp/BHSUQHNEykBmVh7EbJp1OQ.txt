Restaurant: Yeah! Burger
Category: Burgers
Went for lunch on the early side for opening day, but it was already packed to the brim.  I applaud them for having so much space, but the ordering process could not keep up with the crowd - tables were empty and the line wrapped through the restaurant.  I ordered a nice &amp; simple beef burger and fries, and had to go with Sweet Tea since the Coke fountain was not yet working (big disappointment - huge Diet Coke fan w/ my burgers).. . The food appeared about 10 minutes after the order; pretty reasonable considering the crowd and the first day.  The burger was solid but nothing crazy, the bun was soft and had good flavor.  The red lettuce was an interesting touch, but I was a little disappointed to see a small red tomato with most of the stem still attached sitting on top.  They also forgot the grilled onions both myself and my coworker ordered.. . That, and they charged me 50 cents for adding mustard.  Apparently,   our ever-mysterious sources of mustard are running out quick, and the demand is out-pacing supply.  To their credit, the fries were immense - more than I should have eaten alone.  Very tasty.. . All, in all, for a $15 burger/fries lunch, I wasn't blown away.  The taste was certainly good, but with the ridiculously over-populated burger scene now here in Atlanta, there are better options.  I'd hit Farm Burger, Grindhouse, etc. over this spot.  Although the bun at Five Guys isn't as good, the burgers at YEAH! weren't much better, and you can get in and out faster there for about half the cost.. . The spot was pretty cool - good, breezy patio, and I'm sure their take on milkshakes and blizzards would go well with the location.. . I'd say "Above Average", and hopefully they get better with time.
