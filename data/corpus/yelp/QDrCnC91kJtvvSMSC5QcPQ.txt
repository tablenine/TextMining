I've been to Kogi at their Granada Hills stop twice now. Their food is full of unique flavors. I like all the stuff I've tried here, even the tofu taco. They're probably a little bit pricey for what you get. Tacos are $2 and they're tiny. I've always been a quality over quantity guy though, so I don't mind dropping $15 on a quesadilla or burrito and a few tacos if they taste good. You healthy people will probably be content with a smaller order though.. . The only real negative is the wait. The first time I went, they opened up at 1030 and I got there around 1040. My group didn't end up getting our food until past midnight. Last night though, we only had to wait about 20 minutes and my friend who got there late only had to wait about 10.. . One more thing I don't like is the type of people this truck attracts. Too many hipsters for an Asian redneck like me. But that's not really Kogi's fault. Overall I rate this 5 stars for amazing food and the fact that I can namedrop it to women.
