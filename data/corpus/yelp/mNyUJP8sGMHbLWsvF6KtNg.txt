Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I consider this the real Katsu-Ya (though there may have been an Encino sister restaurant that predates the Studio City one; I guess I should ask... but if you care even 1%, you'll probably get around to asking first!).  My understanding is that the owners of Katsu-ya licensed their name and menu to the (in)famous chain that has opened up 4 (and counting) locations on the better side of the hill.  While the original version doesn't feature blaring techno and fun, fruity pre-dinner drinks, it does belong near the top of the LA sushi scene.  . . Food:. Katsu-Ya is a top tier sushi place.  They have a large number of non-traditional rolls and dishes (many of which are very good), which is why I like to sit at the sushi bar.  It's fun to see what other people order and then bite their style.  The Robert Roll is, naturally, awesome.  The albacore belly is almost impossible to beat.  Also, the spicy tuna crispy rice here is better than anywhere else.  The meal, with drinks, usually runs about $40 - 50 per person.  4 stars.. . Service:. As with many good sushi places in LA, the staff here is a bit too efficient.  They are nice enough and quick with refills of tea and water.  However, the dishes come too quickly, which (yes, intentionally) makes me feel a rushed.  Oh, and make a reservation or get here before 6!  2.5 stars.. . Decor:. Typical sushi restaurant set up: wooden tables or seats at the sushi bar. 2.5 stars.. . Summary:. Food (60% weight for Overall): 4 stars.. Service (20% weight for Overall): 2.5 stars.. Decor (20% weight for Overall): 2.5 stars.. . Overall: 3.4 stars (rounded up to 4 because the food deserves it).. . Creative-and-tasty, top-tier sushi.  Make a reservation.
