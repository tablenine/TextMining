this place is adorable! the food is so delicious and their lemon soju is s0o0o good!!!. . if it's ur bdai they pop a bottle of champagne all over u too. . Service tho is crap...they are slow with seating &amp; when you ask them for something...in fact service is so horrible that instead of saying "Excuse me" and asking you to move they act like you aren't the customer and how dare you stand in their path! They also have call buttons for the waiters but even those take awhile to get answered.
