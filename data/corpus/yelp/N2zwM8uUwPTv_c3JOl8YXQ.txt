Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
I just went here to watch the World Cup and the place filled up fast once the game started. I had never been to an Argentinian restaurant before so I was excited to see what the menu offered. I was not very hungry so I only ordered the Capellini pasta dish. It came with EVOO, tomatoes, angel hair pasta and fresh basil. I wasn't very impressed though. Didn't have a ton of flavor and IMO, I thought it could use some more EVOO. . . Anyways, what made this place for me was the free bread and sangria. The bread came with a mixture of EVOO, oregano, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper, etc. (waitress rattled it off to me) and it was amazing! I filled up quickly on the bread and yummy dip. My friends and I also split a pitcher of the sangria and it was really good. It had a good balance of alcohol and fruit flavor.. . If I go there again I'll try a more exotic menu item but if anything, go there for the bread, dip, and sangria!
