The pizza wasn't bad, but $4 a slice is pretty expensive in my book.  I really liked the place though... pretty small interior, but larger, cozy booths.  The dude working the register was pretty funny and all the items I tried were pretty solid.  . . Its right by my place, so there's a good chance that this is going to be my go-to for a slice from now on.  I have been meaning to get in for a while but never tried it.  Not amazing, but not bad either.
