My sweetie and I went to watch the Laker's game. This place is full, loud, exciting fan cheering, drinks being served, and people eating.. . I had a hamburger and fries and beer. My date a chicken cesar salad and pinot.. . This place seems ok to me. Next time I will really order some food and will let you know if the food here is good. We were here this time for the basketball game.
