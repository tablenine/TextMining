Not impressed. The chopsticks wrapper says "Over 70 Locations in Japan" - I can only hope that the locations in Japan hold themselves to a higher standard than this location.. . The chicken skin yakitori was extremely bland.  The ground chicken yakitori tasted great, but one side of mine was completely charred. The teriyaki steak was thin and small and cost $10.  The highlight of the meal was a soup that had tofu, meat, and radish in it.. . The claustrophobic environment, spotty service, high prices, and mediocre food do not appeal to me.  There are so many izakayas in West LA/Santa Monica so the chances that you'll find me in Furaibo again are slim.
