Category: Seafood
Ups and downs. I only ate here because I had a gift certificate and this place does have a touristy feeling to it. The fish I had here was good(Kona Kampachi special), nothing outstanding. I enjoyed the creme brulee. Lastly and most ardently I got the feeling of being profiled against for being a "young, unaware, twenty-something" upon arrival after me and my boyfriend had made reservations. (Maybe just my skeptical nature, but haven't felt this at other places I dined at.) Â Despite being on time for our reservation we still had to wait about 35 minutes or more. We were seated in the crowded back room, elbow to elbow with unhealthy looking tourists and shouting kids. Probably won't be back unless someone else pays. Overall, I was disappointed despite the high level of "Hugo's Frog Bar brand awareness" in the community and perceived highbrow appeal.
