I'm really picky when it comes to good sushi, and Thaicoon is always on my list when I go back to Atlanta.  On Mondays and Tuesdays, they have $1 special rolls.  The sashimi roll, double shrimp, and super crunch are all my favorites though, and they aren't included in the Monday/Tuesday special.  The ginger salad and chicken satay are both excellent as well.
