The ambience of this place is very modern and trendy for Culver City.  You'd expect to find a place like this on 3rd St. or Melrose.  This place is usually crowded, especially at night.  I decided to see what the fuss is about.  The menu selection was very intresting, typically american food.  I decided to have the burger, which was decent, but I wasn't wow'd.
