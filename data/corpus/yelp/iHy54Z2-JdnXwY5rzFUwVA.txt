Pulled meat nachos!  IF I could make one request, if it's your first time, ask them to hold the BBQ sauce.  SD's offers three kinds of BBQ sauce and it's best you try them first and then top the nachos yourself.  Their original sauce I was not digging and upon first taste I could've gotten up and left.  There was a sweet and sour BBQ sauce which the three of us found the most appetizing.  The pulled meat was more chunky than loose so it didn't top everything, all that's going on is the cheese, sauce and that's about it.  My thought during eating was about the pulled pork nachos at Bdubs, their meat is pulled evenly so it's distributed more.  . I would've liked having some jalapenos but that's a request you'd have to make when ordering.  No specials on alcohol I don't think, Smoke Daddys is a restaurant first, on that Friday night there was a live band playing indoors.  If you're on a Nacho hunt like we were, it's just a few blocks away from La Pasadita home of the Chachos.  Parking is more plentiful on Ashland, it's metered but at least it's there.  Practically every block near Smoke D's is zoned, don't risk it.. . I wonder if they offer a sampler, I don't think so cuz I would've gotten it if they did.  Maybe next time.
