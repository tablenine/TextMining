Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
Everyone raves about De Cero and many of my friends have recommended it. I have been here twice and each time I felt the food was sub-par. They are known for their tacos, and the tacos are quite unique, but they just aren't that good. It's nice to have an option for a tuna taco or other gourmet taco creations, but if they don't taste good then what is the point.. . Margaritas and guacamole is good, but it should be, so no extra points for that.
