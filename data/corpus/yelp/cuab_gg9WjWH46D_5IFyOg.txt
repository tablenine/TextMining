Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
I saw Smoke Daddy on Check Please and was also recommended by friends.  I make it a point to try ribs and barbeque as much as I can.  After eating at Smoke Daddy I'm afraid I'll never be satisfied with other barbeque again.  We had the baby backs, chicken, and pulled pork along with sweet potato fries, mac n' cheese, and green beans.  The ribs were perfectly smoked with an expertly cooked outer texture.  The chicken was juicy and the pulled pork was tender and free of any fat or gristle and also had the exact amount of smoky goodness.  The fries are excellent.  The mac n' cheese was the only sorespot, as it was pretty devoid of any cheese flavor, bland, and had me thinking about the mac at Fat Willy's.   Pair the great grub with a respectable draft beer selection, including Oberon and Lagunitas IPA, which both happened to go with the smoky fare quite well and what you have is a top-notch BBQ stop.. . Staff was all very relaxed and made you feel welcome.  The guy at the door was great and even offered a tour of the joint.  . . If you are looking for great BBQ in the near city Smoke Daddy is a no brainer!
