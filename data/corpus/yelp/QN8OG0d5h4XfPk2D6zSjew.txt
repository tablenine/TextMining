Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
Ethiopian is not for everyone (especially my bro-in-law who called it "eating with a wet towel"). That being said, I LOVE Ethiopian. Desta is great, the atmosphere has been improving over the last year (now remodeled) and the food has stayed consistent. I enjoy that they use very modern presentation which sets them apart from the 5 other Ethio places in a one mile radius! Nice atmosphere, good food.
