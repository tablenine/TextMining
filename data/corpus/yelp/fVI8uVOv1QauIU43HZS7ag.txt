The general rule of thumb for ethnic cuisines is you can tell how good and authentic the place is by the ethnicity of the diners.  Cho San Ok is always packed with Korean diners, and for good reason!  The food here is really good!  I always get the thin slices of non-marinated beef, cooked on a stone top right in front of you, and dipped in a sauce comprised of sesame oil, salt and pepper.  Simplicity at its best!  The drippings from the beef are then used to make a delicious kimchi fried rice.  Other things I've enjoyed are the yuk gae jang, a spicy beef soup, and grilled mackarel.. The only negative thing I can say is that service can be a bit cold.
