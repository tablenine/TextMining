When Chelsea comes to visit, we go here.  I think they had macaroni and cheese on the menu the last time and she almost died of pure unadulterated joy.  I prefer the TV Dinner. . . One star off because RFD is a SCENE; everybody in that joint is an oglin' bastard and I don't want to get looked at while I eat, much less overhear someone's exhortations about their beet juice.  Bore me fucking later and let me stuff my face with seitan and get the hell out.
