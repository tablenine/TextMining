It totally sounded like a weird combination to me, but I was just so curious that I had to give it a try! Expect a wait as there is a loyal following with crowds of people. Â You see people from all walks of life coming in for some great chicken and of course the waffles! Nice and YUMMY! The parking leaves a bit to be desired for as you basically have to find street parking, but it's a nice, casual place where you can enjoy good food at really good prices!
