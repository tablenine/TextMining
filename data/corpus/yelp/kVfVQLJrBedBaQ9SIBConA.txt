Standing on the corner waiting for a friend for lunch at Toast, you see all kinds of actormodel type people, both wanna be's and the real thing, girls in giant oversized bug sunglasses and teeny tiny dresses, dudes coiffed to within an inch of their lives, all lounging around on a weekday afternoon taking long lunches because they have nowhere else to be. . . I'm giving this place four stars because I had probably the greatest salad of my life here! The Garden salad - mixed greens, sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, goat cheese, pine nuts topped with strips of grilled garden burger and vinaigrette. I ordered the half portion and it was more than enough. . . I agree on the yummyness of the red velvet cupcakes. Although I'm not exactly a red velvet cupcake connoisseur, so I don't have much to compare it to. . . I'd come back here just for that salad, and to try the chocolate chip banana pancakes that my friend ordered. Yum.
