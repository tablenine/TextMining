Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Make a run for ... oh, never-mind. Paco's Tacos = great kitschy Mexican decor. Strong margaritas (try the strawberry ones), good times with big groups and some of the *best* home(as close to home)made flour tortilla's this side of the border. Their lunch combos are large and decently priced, their steak dinners look good, I had the chimichanga and chile relleno combo meal there this past weekend and I could not nearly finish it (that says A LOT trust me). My appetite for Mexican food is bottomless, so I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to regret failing miserably at their new years resolution for dieting :)
