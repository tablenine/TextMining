I never heard of this place, but I was watching a show called Man Vs. Food and thought why not check it out since I do live about 30 minutes inland from L.A.. . Let's just say it wasnt what i was expecting. I never had a french dipped sandwich before, but for me it was HORRIBLE! I had the turkey dipped sandwich and it was just disgusting. I dont know if I just wasnt feelin the sauce but it was gross. And i put the mustard on, and i dont know if you were supposed to be feeling like flames up your nose, but it had that affect on me. The mustard made the sandwich taste even WORST! My eyes teared up after biting into it. I was so disappointed, I didnt want to eat anymore. I just finished up my salad which was alright. . My boyfriend had the roast beef i think, and that tasted a lot better than mines, but it still wasnt the best.. . Never going again.
