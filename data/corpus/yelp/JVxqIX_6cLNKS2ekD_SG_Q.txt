eh. . . this place is almost insulting to go to. . . came here and was impressed with the decor and the vibe...sat down. waited. and waited. . . *doobeedoobeedoooo.....*. . where the *&amp;*%$ is our server??? AHHHHH there he is...sauntering over our server drawled...."you ladies ready?". . GOTTDAMN YES we are... i am so hungry i practically licked the foam like shrimp cracker crumbs out of the bowl.... . . me and my friend ordered:. 1) the roasted pork-came with a side of slaw and rice. pork was good. came in large portions with a sweet crunchy crust around it. rice was sticky and, well...it was RICE. and the slaw was tangy and almost was a kimchee like condiment. . 2) the beef pho-OK, i have to be honest here. i HATE pho. i hate the way it smells, the way I SMELL afterwards, the whole experience. BUT...BUTBUTBUT i will eat it and enjoy it because i love food...but dude, THIS pho was SOUR. the soup was like vinegar and extremely bland. whenever i have had pho in the past, the soup was almost sensual and DARK tasting..u know? but this was just... bleh. . . saving grace of this meal. the appetizer. we ordered the imperial rolls. which came with lettuce, cilantro, mint and cucumbers. you wrap the little fried roll in all these veggies and dip it int he sauce and it was DELICIOUS!! . . i don't look forward to coming back here. . at all.. . and my server. . whoever you are. . whom i didn't even care to remember the name of. . . you suck.
