I'm a huge fan of both locations, so depending on which is closer to you, and which one you can get a reservation at, feel rest assured that you will have an excellent meal.. . Speaking of excellent, their risotto is the best I have had in the United States. Yes, better than Thomas Keller and David Barber. I have even had two different preparations of it, one with bacon and the other with veggies, and both were far superior to any other risotto dish from Per Se to Capo.. . That said, they are far from a one trick pony. Just about everything here is great, if not superb. That is, with the one exception of the monkfish entree- which is just "eh.". . Decor is nice and simple. Nothing to write home about. Service is fine.. . And if you're lucky, like we were, you might even get a start sighting out of it, as the table next to us sat Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
