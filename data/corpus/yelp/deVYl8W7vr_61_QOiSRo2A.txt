Let's take a piece of cake from the glass case. The icing flows over the edge like waterfalls. I see your eyes widen as you dig your fork into the moist slice. Our mouths salivate as pieces float up towards us. We lick our lips before initial contact. Savoring every bite, the flavors mercilessly attack our taste buds. Every bite we take is like biting into the fruit of knowledge from the tree of life, it's down right sinful! Eve's fruit has nothing on this, so Adam take her back to Eden!
