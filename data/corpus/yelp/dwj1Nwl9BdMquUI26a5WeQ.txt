Wow, I've been waiting a while to review this place. All I have to say is what a dissapointment. I'm ONLY giving this place 2 stars because I had their tacos de cecina and they were delicious. BUT I tried the cemita arabe, atomic and asada...um yea...not my thing at all. Maybe because I'm not from Puebla but they did NOT taste good at all. The cemita smelled and tasted like feet!! The guy is right, they do not go with ANY other salsa, I almost threw up when I tried it. My sister found a long ass hair in her cemita which pretty much ruined it for her and she left "input" on the table along with the hair. . . Now, I'm not trying to be a hater or anything but I decided, oh what the hell I'll drive downtown and check this place out. First parking sucks. Second, we walk in and it's not as big as it looked on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives ok. Thirdly, the rude ass man sits us and asks if we're lost or if we were recommended by Guy Fieri. Are you f'n kidding me you rude a hole!?!? So I ignored his comment, he proceeded to ask if we know why Guy Fieri recommends this place. Well if I woulda know I had to take an f'n pop quiz before my meal I would have gone somewhere else. Finally I just said, ok can we order! So we did. You have to go up to order and pay! It's very fast foodish to do that but whatever, to each their own. The waitresses did not come around; we had to flag her down. Downright the most horrible customer service I've had in a while! . . Bottom-line, just because you had Guy Fieri in your place doesn't mean you should let it get to your head. Not everyone knows who he is first of all and I'm Mexi, so I wasn't looking for an experience! Just wanted to try it. Â Not worth all the hype.
