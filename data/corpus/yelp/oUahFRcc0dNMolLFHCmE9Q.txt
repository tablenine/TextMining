Ok, really, how impactful will my ONE review of the Kogi truck amongst the 784 reviews (as of this writing) be? But since I'm here, I might as well stay. . . I checked out the hype earlier this year, and sorry to say, I didn't have a mindblowing experience. We waited almost 2 hours (crazy, I know) for the short ribs taco, the chicken taco, and the spicy pork. A friend ordered the kimchi quesadilla (not a fan) and the short ribs in a burrito (hmm...still not a fan). Â So I've concluded that I will personally stick to the short ribs and spicy pork tacos. . . Would I wait in this long a$$ line again? Probably not. HOWEVER, if I happen to spot the truck and the line was say, 10 ppl long, then I would jump in.
