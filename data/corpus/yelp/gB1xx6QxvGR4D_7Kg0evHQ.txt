Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya - famous for their tonkotsu soup base, the rich and delicious flavor is achieved by boiling pork bones and joints overnight.  Topped with pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, some vegetables, and a shitload of green onions, I don't understand why anyone else can really complain.  . . -  Noodles not firm enough?  Have them make it firm.  It still may not be the star of the show, but the soup is there to more than make up for it.. -  Get it Kotteri flavor as well to obtain an even richer flavor; the soup is enriched with back fat.  . -  Ask for Oomori and get your food 1.5x larger. . -  Don't forget the tableside garlic!  I missed it on my initial visit.. . I came here after eating my 'Pre-lunch,' (which was Italian food) and I still enjoyed it.  Once we started eating, all I heard was silence, and a bunch of slurping.  (I think Wilmar D. was talking to me but I literally was, in my own world.). . Final Mood:  This is the best 'C' restaurant I've had.  Although I'm sure Ventura County has cooking environments that aren't even this clean!  (The grades aren't posted on the restaurants).. . Wait, you guys are still hungry?
