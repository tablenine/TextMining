AMAZING coffee, amazing.   really yummy home fries..! really cute place, I would def go there again and often if i lived closer to hollywood!. . This French couple next to us, ordered Pancakes, and when they came out it was literally as big as like a 12" plate, with like 4-3 pancakes... literally like 2 inches tall! Their eyes literally almost popped out of their faces! Classic! I too could not finish my food, but it was gooooood!
