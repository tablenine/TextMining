So, I can't lie, the service was terrible. Just downright awful. That said, they lost our ticket and only charged us $50 for a brunch table of 7. We tipped the hell out of them because the food was exquisite, and frankly, that's the heart of the story. All of us loved every last serving that showed up on the table from the coffee, to the bread in the panini, to the best BLT I have ever had. Well done. And even though the service was terrible, the waiter acknowledged his mistakes, emitting quite the southern charm for my northern disposition.
