Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
Got to give the five stars to this joint... . . Other than the occasional over crowding at peak times, this is a great Mexican Cuisine location.. . I was introduced by a friend who lives in the area and we now visit often.. . Summertime offers backyard seating as well.. . Enjoy.
