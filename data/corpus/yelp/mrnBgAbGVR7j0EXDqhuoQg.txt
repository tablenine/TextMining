My family and I have been coming here since I was a little kid - no joke.  This was before they moved down the street from that dingy shopping center.  They've definitely come a long way since then.  I'm kinda sad that they're always so crowded now, but they're nice people and deserve the success.  Oh yeah, their food is also the real deal, so step outside the box a bit and try the authentic Chinese dishes...mmm.. . And the fact that they open past midnight is definitely a plus.
