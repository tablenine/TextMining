How can you not love a restaurant that has the exact same menu as Surin, and includes yummy sushi!?  Since my eyes were bigger than my stomach (I over ordered of course); I needed to take my Spicy Pad Thai home.  Oh well, it is always better the next day. . . I was surprised to find they do not take reservations when I called, but we did not have to wait for a table which is always a treat.  Our service was a little slow, but the restaurant was packed and we were a group of 8.  A thirsty group of 8 .....if I might add!. . If you haven't stopped by, do so soon.  It is cozy, quaint and overall a great little restaurant to take a date, or a great group of 8!
