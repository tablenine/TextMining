Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Ever get the feeling you were ignored?  That is the feeling I got when we went to Tank Sushi.. . My fiance and I went with a Groupon and were seated at the bar since we arrived early for our reservation.  Our waiter was good to give suggestions, but more or less disappeared afterwards.  The reason being?  An actor was sitting next to us (nice guy, btw).  Our waiter and the hostess were fawing over him like he's a big star.  We had to flag him down to basically get anything. . . The food itself was good.  I had the King Crab Maki and it was excellent.  My fiance raved over his pork katsu.  The restaurant itself is somewhat pricey so the Groupon was worth it.  . . We may return for the half price maki, but service needs to improve greatly.  Hopefully, there won't be any actors.
