It was I and my girlfriend's anniversary and I heard it has a good view and tasty menus so I've visited here. I tried Salmon steak and it was just owesome! Also I loved rainbow roll. The sushi was very fresh and the roll was closed to the Japanese traditional one. (I prefer Japanese traditional fresh sushi and sashimi.) Seattle roll was too creamy but my girlfriend loved it. Don't expect any traditional Japanese menus here. Everything is fusion and it's totally americanized. . The service was good but you could expect this level of service in any other similar priced restaurant. . The view was nice but was not good as I expected. Griffith observatory has much better view and it's free. (I paid $100 include tips &amp; valet.) . Inside the restaurant, it's like a cabin. Not that fancy. The table was small and you will get the same small table if your party is just two. There're some big tables for 6 people though. I hope the valet fee would be cheaper. ($7.5)
