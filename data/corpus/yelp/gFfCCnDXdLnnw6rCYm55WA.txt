Met a friend here after work and before a charity art auction.  Not crowded at all.  Great waitstaff and the chopped pork sandwich was perfection.  Not sure how I feel about the bartender putting her finger on the opening to one of the sauce bottles when she was explaining that I needed to cover the hole before shaking or it would be disasterous.  I liked her but I don't know her well enough to have her put her fingers on something that may be ingested by me.  Hmmmmmmm...... . Worth the drive over and if you're in the area and haven't been, well, that's just your loss.
