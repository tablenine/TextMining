Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
O Starbucks my sweet love........ . I have strayed.. . I confess......I had a nooner today.. It happened at the Veggie Grill and I swear I didn't plan it.. It just happened.. I was swept away by Evolution iced black tea.  It came in a Greenware cup.  That's eco-friendly packaging, and it put a smile on my face.. . I needed that tea so bad, I tell you.  I needed to put out the fire caused by a large bowl of Bean Me Up Chili.. It was five star, five alarm chili.. . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . Whoever knew veggie chili could be this good?. Now I understand why there are already 160 reviews for The Veggie Grill, and why every table was full at 1pm today, with a line out the door waiting to order.. . Despite the crowd, my chili was delivered to my table during the time it took me to draw my iced tea.. . Even the crackers were good.  . Be still, my cheatin' heart.  I almost went back for a tea refill &amp; second bowl of Bean Me Up, topped with soy cream &amp; two kinds of onions.. . $4.50 for the chili, 2 bucks for the tea.  . Free parking in the huge lot.. Attractive decor, efficient staff.. . Create a great restaurant and they will come.. . Next time?  The V-Burger, baby.. Get down &amp; get veggie........
