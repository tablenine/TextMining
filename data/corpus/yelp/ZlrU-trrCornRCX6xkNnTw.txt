Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
I was excited to try Dolce and from what I read it looked like it was going to be a great date restaurant. Wow was I wrong. We had tickets for Cirque at 8 pm so I made reservations for 6:30 pm. we arrived a little early so we could have drinks at the bar. The bartender could have cared less about us. I am a huge fan of single malt whiskey and when I inquired about their selection he stared at me and gestured to the bottles. After finishing our drinks we checked back in with the hostess who dished out some serious attitude, answering questions with no eye contact and grunts, before taking us to our table, right next to the ktichen and bathrooms. The restaurant was 50% full. We asked for another table and she walked away. So we settled for the table. Our waiter was nice enough but had very little knowledge of the wine menu and only recommmended the most expensive items on the menu. We decided on calamari for appetizer, my husband had the sea bass and I had the scallops. The calamari with average at best, the calamari did not taste fresh and was a little rubbery. My scallops were perfectly cooked but the roasted red peppers had an unusually large amount of seeds still attached. Yucky! My husbands sea bass was over cooked and served with strange fried side dishes splashed with orange juice that overpowered the delicate flavors of the sea bass. We passed on dessert. In the end it was overpriced, poorly executed food with way to much attitude. After all it is a restaurant in a mall.
