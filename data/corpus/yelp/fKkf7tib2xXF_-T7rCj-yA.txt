Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
The beauty of the 24 hour Taco Cabana is the fact that it's a 24 hour spot. Yes, you may feel like you've stepped into a mediocre restaurant or bad resort in Cozumel due to the faded 1970ish pastel colors on the wall and the kitchy-come-corny decor (think Christmas ball ornaments above the salsa bar). But where else can you get a fajita bowl and queso at 1 AM? Or 6 AM? Oh, and a margarita? If you answered 'nowhere' you're right. . . You can grab that tray, head on to the patio for a little chip party and please your stomach with the introduction of something that isn't alcohol - unless of course, you opted for that margarita, too.
