I thought this place was pretty damn good.  The service was amazing.  When I got there, someone asked to take our coats while someone else showed us to a table right away.. . I ordered the Huevos Benedictos (mexican eggs benedict).  My fiance ordered Matzo Brei.. . My dish was perfect.  It was perfectly made corn bread, with amazingly poached eggs (just the right amount of being runny), a slightly spicy (not really spicy but tangy) sauce, and chorrizo.  All of this had a very light texture, nothing hard.. . Then there were my hashbrowns.  They were crispy, with specs of bell peppers mixed in.  It was a great contrast to the light textures of the egg portion of my meal.. . The matzo brei was some sort of omlet.  It had matzo, brie, eggs, and spinach.  She said it was pretty good, but nothing too special.. . I'll head there again.
