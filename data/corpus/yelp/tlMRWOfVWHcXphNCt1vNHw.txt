Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Over rated!!! I have passed the Apple Pan 500 times at least and almost always thought to myself that I would have to try it! I actually stopped in twice but it was packed and I did not want to wait. Well finally after all these years I stopped in last night with my boyfriend and we were able to get seats! The menu is about as simple as they come.My boyfriend ordered thre hickory burger and I ordered a grilled cheddar cheese. My boyfriends burger came within 5 minutes at most.  I waited and waited but no grilled cheese.  Finally AFTER my boyfriend finished his burger I was able to get the servers attention to ask if I could PLEASE eat something! and that was when he finally ordered my grilled cheese. My sanwich was OK. Good cheddar cheese but there isnt much you cando with a grilled cheese sandwich. We saved room for their famous apple pie. We ordered it straight up no ice cream etc. I have to say it was a disapointment. Very average! A place called the apple pan should have a very good apple something! But this was nothing special at all. And at $5.75 or $5.95 at is a bit  to costy. The crust was fine but it lacked flavor overall and was completely forgettable. i have to say i would not come back to the apple pan. it was not so much the so-so service as that kind of thing cn happen it was just that the food was not anything special. while my boyfriend did enjoy his hickory burger it was not somthing he would consider out of the ordinary. don think this place is worh fighting for counter space.
