Category: Pizza
Just went to Santullo's to meet a friend and catch up.  HUGE slices of NY style pizza.  I had the cheese, which I must admit was a little on the bland side, but nothing a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes couldn't cure.  The spinach salad was quite tasty with walnuts and roasted peppers.  I will definitely go back, because I do like being able to go to a place and just get a slice, fold it up and enjoy.. . Plus, I found the crust to be light and crispy, with a hint of chew.  Me likey.
