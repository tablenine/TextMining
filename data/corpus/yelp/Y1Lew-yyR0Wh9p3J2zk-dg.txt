You know what's sweet about this place? They have the best Medianoche sandwich this side of Havana (okay, I've never been, but I'm using the saying as a way of highlighting how good it is). They don't mail it in on anything I've tried so far. And the ice cream? It's ice cream! I know gelato and frozen yogurt are so now, but it's nice to see something that we've all grown up with (unless you grew up in Tuscany or Seoul, then it would be gelato and yogurt). Bring a friend, split a shake and an ice cream sandwich, then walk home. The further the better.
