Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The most amazing hot dogs my ass.  Ha, I had better hot dogs at the south street seaport in New York City.  Shit... I had better hot dogs at a typical hot dog stand in NYC.  Really, Pink's is totally overrated, way overrated.  I've also never seen a celebrity there, but then again, I've only been 2 times.  What I have seen is that freakin' long ass line!!!  Why?  Why?  Why?  I just don't get it!!!
