For lunch, we ordered salmon skin salad, 8 pc nigiri, chirashi, 18 pc tuna sushi, and tea.  Came out to about $50 after tip and tax.. . The fish was quite good, very fresh.  Everything seemed simple, but good quality.  The tea wasn't particularly good though.. . Free valet parking (plus tip).  It was pretty busy inside but the two of us were seated right away.
