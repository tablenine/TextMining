ELVIS IS IN DA HOUSE!. . OK. Thai Elvis. . . Still. . . A great place to hang out with friends, to eat great thai food and to dream you lived in the times of Elvis and his stints in Hawaii and Las Vegas. . . Yep. Try the Pad Thai and their Won Ton Soup is delish. They also have wild game on their "special menu" if you are adventurous. . Good TImes.
