Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've spent many hours in the infamous Pink's line... but it's worth it.. . Others may not think it's the 'best hot dog', and maybe that's true.  But geez, if you're in LA, you must visit this LA landmark!. . Side note: . Pink's at Knotts Berry farm sucks.  Really.. Pink's on the Vegas strip rocks!  Plus they serve beer!
