My problem with my whole evening was that I kept ordering the wrong thing, but fortunately the BF and his mom ordered the oh-so-right things.. . I loved the patio, it was being outside but not like being thrown onto the sidewalk.  It was homey and more like being in your (very stylish) grandmother's wrap around porch.. . Food - BF got the burger (with mushrooms) which was nothing short of amazing.  Perfect seasoning with the onions/onion jam, good proportion of bread to meat, mushrooms were fresh and not soggy.    Had the gorgonzola on the side, but we should have just dumped that on.. . BF's mom got the Kobe beef meatballs.  I have a pet peeve, and I've written of it before.    When I order meatballs as the focal point of a meal, I expect those puppies to be big and worthy of a spotlight.  These guys were champs.  Huge Kobe beef balls stuffed with pine nuts and raisins.  Sounds gross?  Oh no, you're mistaken.  They were almost creamy, they were so good.. . I got a special of steamed red snapper that was nothing to write home about, stick with the menu and you'll go home happy.
