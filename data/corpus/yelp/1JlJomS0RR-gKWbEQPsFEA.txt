Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Come for lunch hour (ends at 2pm) when you get ramen and a side for $7.50. For my first visit, we had JUST missed the lunch hour and ended up paying about the same for just a bowl. Still, for 3 sides, 3 ramens, 3 extra noodles, and 2 desserts, our bill was about $50. Not bad.. The broth is yumdiddlyumpcious! I don't think they use MSG either. I'm pretty sensitive to the stuff. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.. There's one closer to me in Gardena. They have different side menus at each of the locations, but the general menus are the same.. The cool part: you get to customize how much oil, etc. is in your broth and how cooked your noodles are. I prefer "normal" everything. My noodle recommendation: order firm noodles, but let them sit for a few minutes. You will get the PERFECT firm, slightly chewy noodle that one expects from authentic ramen houses. I can't wait for April when their cold noodles are available.. The only thing that tasted strange was their dessert. We split a green tea and red bean ice creams. Perfect sizes, but they didn't taste like either of their purported flavors. I still scarfed down the green tea.. Also, order the cheese side dishes. There is a fried fishcake and cheese dish that's great! I feel like I could have made the egg roll filled with cheese thing at home... I wasn't a fan.
