While I can't change my rating (based on my experiences), I have heard from people close to me that the quality and service have really fallen off.  It sucks for all the people that didn't get a chance to go to this place in its Heyday...but that's how the ball bounces.. . I've said it before, and I'll say it again....businesses, please!  When you get some fame, please don't let go of your quality and service.  It pisses people off.
