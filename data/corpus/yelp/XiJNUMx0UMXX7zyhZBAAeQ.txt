Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
4.5 stars.. . A friend earnestly recommended Bottega Louie so we ventured in after 10 p.m. for a late dinner Friday and had a great, straightforward meal.. . It's an incredibly bustling, if not raucous atmosphere despite the pristine, all-white decor. Â That, combined with the high-ceilings sort of gives this place a cafeteria-like feel, albeit a slick &amp; stylish one. . . We were seated promptly and had a round of cocktails. I really enjoyed my mango mojito -- great chunks of fresh fruit and well-muddled mint. . . We were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices. Our margherita pizza was at least 12 to 14-inches and $14. Great, crisp crust (we did ask for it to be well-done), solid, flavorful sauce. A lovely oval of silky burrata with roasted tomatoes was $8 -- a nice little dish. . . The chocolate souffle was not as rich in chocolate as I was craving but I did appreciate the elegant tableside serving of the vanilla bean glaze atop the dessert.. . We're looking forward to coming back and trying more offerings.
