Jesus, I forgot how good this place is.  The food, the service, the laid back, casual atmosphere...I love it all.  The prices are reasonable, the wine list is extensive, and the servers are knowledgeable and attentive without being over the top.  All in all I would highly recommend Rose Angelis.  The Gorgonzola Tortellini is outstanding but the truth is, everything I've ever tried has been fantastic.
