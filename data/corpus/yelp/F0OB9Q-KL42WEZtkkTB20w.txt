The steak was unreal. So yummy and not greasy or over seasoned. Just perfect. Matched with the house salad and a balsamic vinagrette that I asked for, the meal was healthy and I had plenty of food. I saved some steak for later too. . . I went with just one other person, but the place looked like a fun place to take a group of friends for drinks and dinner.. . Highly recommended! Try something new!
