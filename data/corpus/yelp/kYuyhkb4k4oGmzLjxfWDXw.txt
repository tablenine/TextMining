F' Yeah! This place is perfect for a light lunch or a gut buster. We ordered a "small" French salad and Mediterranean bread for a little snack and BAM! Ample amount of food for two hungry folks and would be light and healthy for a group of 4. . Great service and yummy food. Love their salad dressings! The poppy seed is my favorite, but mixing all three together is quite the heavenly combination...turning plain old poor man's lettuce into something indulgent! The bread is outta this world and the size of a car tire!. Oh and if you don't mind onion breath, this place isn't bad for a date! Its romantic in a cheesy kind of old school way. All depends on who you are with I guess!
