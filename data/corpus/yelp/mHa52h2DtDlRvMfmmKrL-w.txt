i thought that this place was OK. I didn't think that any of the entrees that we got had much flavor or tried to be authentic...the dishes reminded me of Chevy's type of Mexican food. I tried the beef quesadilla...I make better ones at home and I can't even cook that well. The burrito lacked flavor, cheesiness, and overall ingredients. The pollo salad was as plain as one can get but I will say that the grilled chicken was yummy. . . A few items kept this place from getting 1 or 2 stars: guac bowl and margarita pitcher. The guacamole was amazing and totally worth the price. It was fresh and is def made to order. The pitcher of booze was huge and between the four us we left buzzed. . . Service was slow and not very friendly. Prices are a bit high of a Mexican place. Although some reviews refer to establishment as an upscale Mexican restaurant I can't say there is anything upscale except the prices. . . This place is (in my opinion) only good for a hot summer day to enjoy a frozen margarita while munching on tortilla chips.
