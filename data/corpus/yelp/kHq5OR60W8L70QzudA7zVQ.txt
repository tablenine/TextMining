I was excited when I went here last Sunday for some ribs.  But was not so impressed.  The ribs were good but not so meaty.  I think the sauce was nice though.  Not too spicy and not too sweet.  I got the collard greens and sweet potato fries with it.  Not so impressed with those either.  The fries were tasty but seemed like they were a bit old.  The greens needed to be cooked a bit more to be good for ribs.  The service was great and the atmosphere was nice.  I sat outside to enjoy the sun.  (so glad that spring is here!)  . . I may go back again, but not too soon.  There are a lot of other places I would rather try instead.
