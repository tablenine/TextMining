I always order egg roll bun when I go to Vietnamese restaurants.  I have yet to find a place in LA that even compares to my favorite place in Denver.   The food was cheap and fast, but the food isn't all that great.  Gingergrass has better egg roll bun than this place.   I did have a bite of my friend's egg/crepe dish and it was really good. I would eat that if I come back here.. . Also, they only take cash.
