Ok.  I just saw a review on this place and am surprised they are still around... So of course I have to add my two or three cents. I Used to come here for dinner a lot when it first opened several years ago mostly because it's within walking distance of my then boyfriend's home.  We'd go there for dinner more than I'd like to admit.  First of all, the get-ups they make the servers wear is just not right.  That boat necked stripped sweater top is LAME.  The Geisha they have walking around chatting it up with the patrons is a cute idea, I guess.  The food is ok to good but it's way over priced as are most Jap-Asian-Fusion type restaurants.  We did order the crab legs once and they were exceptionally good.  We ordered it again on a visit after and it wasn't good.  Which was the mistake?  The good or the bad?  It's really loud and the layout of the restaurant is weird and the hostess' always ignore me.  Like, I am not even there.
