The pizza here is absolutely delicious. I always get their specialty pizzas because no matter what day of the week it is, its freaking delicious. Goat cheese, asiago, green pepper, roasted red pepper, roasted garlic, its all good. The prices are very reasonable too, especially considering the area. Sandwiches and soups are really yummy too.. . The reason I am knocking off two stars (Because really, the food deserves 5) is because of the employees (who deserve zero stars). They are rude and inconsiderate of their guests. Tonight, I went to eat with a couple friends, and my friend and another guest saw a mouse run across the floor. It was a tiny mouse, but a mouse nonetheless. We called to the employees, and they just sat there with a vacant look and went back to chitchatting with each other. We were like...okay....My friend said that if he hadn't already paid, he would have left. We saw the mouse run by again and called to the employees again. My friend asked if they were going to do anything about it. One male employee very rudely replied, saying "Well what do you want me to do about it?" Oh, I don't know, call an exterminator, try to catch it, act like you even pretend to care that there's a mouse in your restaurant for the sake of your customers....We could even hear them mocking us behind the counter. I have always gotten a rude attitude from the employees in the past, but this really tops it all. My friend even said that he thought one of the people behind the counter was the manager.
