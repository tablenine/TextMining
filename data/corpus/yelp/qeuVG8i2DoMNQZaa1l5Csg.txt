Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
What they do well, they do very well. When the Host, Erik, asked me if I was a regular. I stated, no it has been a while. Yet, it so much seemed exactly the same as it has always been. All female wait staff in a 1950s outfit, that you have to call by their last name. So, we had, Mrs. Coco. The menu had no diversity to it at all. One appetizer, really no other entree other then a few fishes and the side dishes are what they have always been. . . So, Lawry's never changes. Yes, this is a good thing. I would hope, though that in the future they had a few more veggie options as size. As I know that beef if going to put a steak through my heart but I hope that I can get a choice of a non cholesterol loaded green stalk somewhere around here. . . On some other notes. The beef here is still real good, the place is clean clean clean and the room is very confi. . . Yes, it reminds you of a 1950s retro movie set with all the trimming, but isn't this what you came here for?
