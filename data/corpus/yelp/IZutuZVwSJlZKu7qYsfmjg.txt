Good lord..this place screams EAT ME NOW!! Every platter is huge good enough for 2 people to share and the prices are sooo affordable !! Chicken stroganoff and filet mignon are both less than 13$! Quality of food is bursting with flavor. Wonderful atmosphere for friends.. Date.. Or late night food run.
