Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
I've been eyeing this place for months.  I'm a fan of Pho 777, but I've heard rave reviews about this place.  So I sauntered in last Friday night.  and Tank did not disappoint.. . Lightning fast &amp; friendly service even when busy!  We sat down right away, even though the place was busy, and a server came by immediately.  Our drinks were never empty, and there was also someone coming by to see if we needed/wanted anything.  The food was delicious!  I had a rice noodle dish with crabmeat and shrimp and it was delicious.  Like Pho 777, it has all the condiments, silverware and napkins right there at your table so you never have to ask and wait for them.  My boyfriend had the pho with beef and loved it.  We also ordered the spring roll appetizer and it was perfect.  Everything tastes fresh.   The menu is enormous so I am sure you can find something for your discriminating palate.  As another reviewer Jennifer L. pointed out, the menu also has some Chinese dishes as well.. . I'd have to say that this place has a slight edge on Pho 777 in that it seems a tad bit more cleaner and nicer inside, just a tad.  However, I think Pho 777 might have the edge on prices, although I would emphasize that Tank's prices are terrific, too.  It's BYOB, but don't worry - no corkage fee.  I think they accommodate large groups just fine, as we saw several large groups in there that night.  Note - it can get a little bit loud there so if it's an intimate quiet dinner you want, you better avoid the busy weekends.. . This is a terrific restaurant.  I'm still a big fan of Pho 777 but I am also a big fan of Tank.  Parking might be a pain, but you could luck out and get a space just outside the restaurant.
