5-stars because I didn't have to wait. I went EARLY on a Thursday, about 6:00 PM before catching a play and we stood for maybe 3 minutes. I thought maybe we'd have to get ice cream before dinner but it worked out great.. . Such a good value for $15, the meat is well marbled, and the sauces are addictive. I've had much more expensive shabu that wasn't nearly as good because it comes down to a) meat and b) sauces to discern a difference. Service is prompt and courteous but they want to get you the hell out. My boyfriend is a turbo eater so we got the bill way before I was even close to finishing. That said he is not a hot pot/shabu fan even he thought this was much better than he expected. . . I'd definitely return for an early dinner during the weekdays. I wish it were closer than the crappy shabu by my house :(.
