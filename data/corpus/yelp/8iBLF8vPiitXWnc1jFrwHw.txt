Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I really didn't want to love this place. I was really hoping it would just be mediocre, so I could say, "meh, it was okay", and not buy into the over-hyped build up I had heard prior to coming in. Sort of like the feeling of getting to look down your nose at a beautiful woman who has a terrible personality.. . Well, about 20 minutes, a stiff cocktail and a few bites of a nice meat selection later, I was softening up. Something inside of me began to quell the resistance to my disdain for all things over-hyped, and over-priced.. . Fogo de Chao is a sort of novelty to the dining experience. You don't order, wait for your food, hope you ordered the right thing, and then  anxiously take your first bite with  to see if you chose "wisely" or "poorly". . . They bring you selections of meat, piping hot, bursting with flavor. They do this over, and over, and over again until you can't take it anymore. Then they serve you coffee, maybe desert, and hell, if you want, more delicious meat! . . As a die hard carnivore, I love the concept, meat selection, fresh off the grill goodness that this place serves up. And if you are one of those people that enjoy eating what MY food eats (namely vegetables), then they have a salad bar with everything from you could desire, cheeses and breads too.. . Yes, it may be pricey (I didn't pay, so I wouldn't know, and truth be told, that may skew this raters review a touch), but from what I experienced tonight, I would have a hard time imagining me not recommending everyone try this place at least once.. . It's not the easiest place to get to in rush-hour traffic, and meat may not be your thing, but if you have an ounce of patience and a hankering for meat, you will not go wrong.
