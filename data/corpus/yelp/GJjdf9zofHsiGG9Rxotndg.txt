This space is gorgeous, they just did an amazing job with renovations and leaving old walls with a nice patina on them to remind you of where you are.  The food was excellent, the fried oysters were definitely a standout.  One issue - if you sit on the back wall of the restaurant, before Sunset, you will be BLINDED by the LIGHT, literally.  It pretty much ruined a nice dinner because I felt like I was in the Map room with Indiana Jones.  Food is excellent, just go after dark or bring shades.
