I don't give anything five stars without visiting several times with noted consistency but I have to say RA Sushi is on its way to being one of my faves in Atlanta.. . I went tonight and the food was amazing. Creative rolls, quality nagiri, and Japanese sushi chefs. Take that Ru Sans! Our group sampled the Viva Las Vegas Roll, which was my fave. It was beautifully presented with a sliced lotus on top. The Tootsy Maki roll was also good, their spin on a California roll. Also sampled a veggie roll with mango on top and the spicy tuna on crunchy rice balls.. . Appetizers were a strong point - the coconut shrimp tempura appetizer with the pineapple dipping sauce was delicious. Joel D. even liked it and well, he doesn't eat shrimp (until now). The pineapple cream cheese wontons were a fave among the group, with a bit of a spice and with another yummy dipping sauce.. . Katie W's salmon with apple glaze was delicious and I loved the wasabi mashed potatoes that came with Joel's chicken.. . We all ordered two drinks each and tried to vary it up - standouts were the Tokyo Tower, Blushing Geisha, Mango Mojito, and the Tsunami Punch.. . We finished it all up with the cinnamon fried ice cream desert - definitely good but you will want to split this with a few people because it's heavy, very sweet, but very yummy.. . The service at RA is on point, and the atmosphere is so gorgeous - they did a great job with the design of the restaurant without being too theme-like or cheesy. . . RA is something that Midtown definitely was missing. It's very reasonable pricing and the food exceeded all of our expectations. I love that it's in the 1010 building and I can see it getting very crowded, quickly once everyone catches on to how great it is.
