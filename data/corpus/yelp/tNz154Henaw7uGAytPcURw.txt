The view you get absolutely makes this restaurant! The boyfriend and I managed to get the best seat in the house and I found myself having a hard time making romantic googly-eyes -- too distracted by the gorgeous view of Hollywood. . . The boyfriend started off with a Jama-jito and we ordered the Darth Vader roll as an appetizer. The drink was delicious, and the Darth Vader was a little intimidating since it was completely black. Getting black tobiko in your teef is NOT sexy. The roll Â was good, but not "my mind is blown" status.. . Our entrees were the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Loch Duart Miso Salmon. The salmon was very flaky, moist, and tasted great with the sauce, but the asparagus was pretty bitter. The lemon mashed potatoes grew on me, but it was strange at first. The boyfriend said he enjoyed his Ahi Tuna (I avoided it because of a bad sushi experience that scarred me) and cleaned his plate. . . I hate to rub it into everybody's faces, but we had a Groupon deal so it was $40 off $80, and the final bill somehow came out to be $19.98. BAM! Of course we had to tip accordingly, but they deserved it. The food was good, ambiance was very romantic, but ultimately I find it to be a little expensive for what it was, but the view really makes up for it. . . TIP: If you are trying to win a girl over and you take her here, I'm 95% sure that you will get laid or at least get a little somethin' somethin'.
