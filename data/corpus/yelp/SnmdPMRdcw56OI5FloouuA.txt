Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I love Wiener's Circle! It is the place to go to get an authentic Chicago char dog. But I can't take it at night when the drunken frat boys take charge of the joint. Best to go during the afternoon and sit at an outside picnic table. . . To the staff, I don't know how you put up with all those hooligans who tip your bucket in the wee morning hours, but thanks for always making a great dog. You are a Chicago institution and my favorite dive-y treat!
