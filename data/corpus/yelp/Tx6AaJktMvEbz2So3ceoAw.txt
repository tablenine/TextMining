Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Come on L.A.... is this where we really want the world to think we get our best hot dogs from?. . This place has been one of the biggest gastronomic let downs of my life. There is nothing special in the taste department about these dogs. I  already gave them my 3 time rule (try everything 3x - just to make sure) and they failed. Mushroom dog, chili cheese dog, bacon dog, 3 dog night, and just plain onions-relish-mustard dog...all whatever. The fries too.. . They are really nice, but the line is way too long for what you get. I will ever only go again if somebody that's never been really really REALLY wants to try a famous Pink's hot dog. After they're done and look up at me heavily disappointed, I'll tell 'em what the real good stuff  is.... . the hot dogs wrapped in a slice of bacon you get from the people w/ carts after getting outta the bar/club/show at the end of the night. Now THAT'S an L.A. hot dog.
