Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
When I was in LA over the summer, my boyfriend's cousin and his cousin's roommate took us to Roscoe's, mentioning that it is a place referenced in a lot of movies and is known for its chicken and waffles.. . I thought: Chicken and waffles? That's a strange combination, if I've ever heard, but I'm all for trying out new things and being open-minded.. . I passed out on the car ride there (that 3 hour jet lag from the east coast was catching up with me!) and when I awoke and we walked in, the place was BUMPIN' (yes, I said "bumpin'"...and no, that's not an east coast thing, but rather, it's an "I chuckle like an old person trying to be cool when I hear that word and we can all use a good chuckle now and then" thing). I surmised that the presence of many patrons might just translate into this whole chicken and waffles thing being pretty good after all.. . YUP. Turns out it is. Buttery, greasy, perfect.. . Chicken and waffles. Whoever thought that one up is a freaking GENIUS.
