Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
My friend works here, so I decided to come in and bug him one night for shits and giggles. I was pleasantly surprised.. . I didn't know you could be so specific when it comes down to ramen, but apparently you can. You get to choose the texture of your noodles, how heavy you want the soup base, oil, Â and etc. Pretty cool.. . I ordered the regular Hakata ramen, with extra corn mmm. Yummy. They also have free hot tea, yayuhh. The atmosphere is really friendly, and everybody greets you as you enter and bids you farewell when you leave haha.. . You can also sit in the back, old school japanese style! You sit cross legged or whatever - only thing is you have to take off your shoes lol. Not awesome if you're wearing boots and uncute mismatching socks .____.
