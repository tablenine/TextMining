Since my last review, I've been to Gloria's about half a dozen times and seriously have converted about a dozen people into fervent Glorianators! . Also the funny thing is that I slammed them for their "crispy" pupusas last time, but since then, every time I've had them, they've been nice and fluffy with the most awesome chicharron for the pupusas revueltas. *drool* . . I need to give a shout out to the pupusa salsa and curtido (pickled cabbage). It's super authentic and tastes just like my Tia's! . . An extra shout out goes to their corn tamales. I've never really been a fan because they're too sweet for me. But the ones they make at Gloria's are really, really good! . . The staff is so sweet there too. They always accommodate my big ass parties even when we keep asking for "one more chair... i mean table"... I'm telling you, once one person hears we're getting together for dinner at Gloria's, they all decide to come and bring someone with them. Glorianators, I tell you!
