This is a great alternative to all of the large chain sandwich shops. The food is fresher, there is a great selection of entrees and more healthier options than say, Panera or something similar. I always order the quesadillas, which come with mashed potatoes. The are considered an appetizer but I can eat them as a meal. They make amazing desserts, such as chocolate clouds, which is low-fat chocolate mouse with cinnamon cookies. It is great. Another fantastic aspect is their wide array of diet beverages. I have diabetes and I am always looking out for places that sell more than diet coke. This place has a lot, fountain diet sprite as well as many other offerings in cans, namely fresca.. My only complaints are that the fresh dressings seem a bit heavy and the cashier never ever smiles.. Other than that I would recommend this place highly.. Oh, bear in mind, they only accept cash and personal check. No debit cards.
