I meant to write a review about this a long time ago so shame on me! If you are not too fond of garlic, then this is not the place to go. I, however is a major garlic fan. I just love the whole atmosphere of the place, from the service, to the aura and decor. Reminds me of a dungeoness type of setting with the dim lights and all. Came here with friends and started off with the garlic-cheese dip. Omg, so yummy. It was ooozing with bits of garlic and cheese. I ordered pork chops sauteed in garlic and was absolutely satisfied, and if my memory serves me right it came with garlic mashed potatoes and to this day still taste the awesome goodness in my salivating mouth! lol. We were debating on ordering the garlic ice cream but I was overuled because my friends thought they've had enough garlic for the night. Oh well, maybe next time and there WILL be a next time because I enjoyed my dining experience and not forgetting that I LOVE GARLIC!!!
