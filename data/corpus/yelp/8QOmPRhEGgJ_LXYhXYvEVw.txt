Restaurant: Joe&#39;s On Juniper
Category: Gay Bars
One of last gloriously sunny days of late Summer/early . Fall found me and Kevin L sitting on the patio at Joe's, catching up on convo, eating some fried calamari and enormous salads, all while enjoying the sunshine at a leisurely pace.. . While the food here is standard all-American pub fare, their menu houses more salads than you'd normally find at a bar, the Coca-Colas are served in gigantic cups and they feature ANCHOR wing sauce...the hot sauce that started it all in Buffalo, NY! This alone is worth some points in the legit department.. . Perhaps it was my sunglasses, or the inevitable charm of my lunch buddy, but the service we received was very friendly, and our waiter was quirky, cute and made himself right at home at our table a few times, which seemed to be the thing to do at a place like Joe's. They've got the formula for a good lunch down: patio, sunshine, southern hospitality, Anchor wing sauce, Coca-Cola.
