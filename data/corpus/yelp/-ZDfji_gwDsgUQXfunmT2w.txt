A group of us went there for drinks the other night, and low and behold, we stayed until closing.  Not sure if the fact that I "closed" it is a comment on me or the bar.... . . Let's start with the bartenders - on the ball and on top of their game.  The place was busy but I still got great service.  Holla!  The beer selection is great, they have tons of bottles of craft beers and 10+ on tap.  . . They have a sweet shuffleboard table in the back, sand and all.  Frustratingly fun.. . There were some comments on here regarding how many TVs there are and that it is a chain, or whatever.  I think it is a nice addition to the neighborhood, how many more slacker dens do you need in Wicker/ Bucktown?. . Didn't eat here, so cannot comment on the food.  The menu did look limited.
