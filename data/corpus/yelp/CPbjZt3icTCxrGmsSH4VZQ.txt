Much has been said about the stellar burger at this dining establishment.    A skeptic at heart, I preferred to submerge myself in a pool of haterade for a good while before checking this joint out. Need less to say I have now been converted into a complete fanatic. Each and every time I come to this place I am sent balls deep into flavor country. I strongly recommend getting a pint of Red Seal to accompany the succulent burger. The cheese plate starter was fantastic. Here's hoping the new location alleviates the overcrowding, I plan to make many trips to this den of deliciousness over the summer.
