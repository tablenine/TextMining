I just had a Chicken, apple, and spices link on a great roll with caramelized onions and spicy mustard. Damn good with a beer to wash it down. Fries and tons of dips to chose from. I felt like giving a high five after I was done. Me and my office mates are now willing to walk the 8 blocks to go back there.  Check it out.
