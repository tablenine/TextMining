Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
I would definitely state that Pho Dai Loi rivals Pho #1 for the coveted title of Best Pho in Atlanta. It is hard to make a choice, really. I've been here twice and definitely plan to come back. What sets this pho apart is the broth; it's incredibly flavorful and so aromatic that I can smell it arriving when the server is still halfway across the room. The prices are super cheap, the interior is clean with a very typical pho-restaurant atmosphere (sparsely decorated and a bit like a doctor's waiting room, but that's to be expected). The staff is fast and friendly, and fortunately most of the servers seem to speak enough English so that us round-eyes don't have to resort to the old "grin stupidly and point at the menu" routine.
