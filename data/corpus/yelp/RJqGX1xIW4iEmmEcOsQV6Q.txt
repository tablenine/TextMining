Restaurant: Flash Taco
Category: Mexican
I don't think i have any qualms about the food here, I think it's safe drunk food for all walks of life, unfortunately all walks of life eat here.  The service and wait is expected to be bad when there are loud out of towners, Lincoln parkers, hipsters, thug wannabes, yuppies and bums are all screaming their one taco order.  The food is alright, like the other reviewers said, if you are sober you better opt for the trillion other Mexican restaurants this city has to offer.  Their standard fare is pretty decent such as the steak or chicken taco, rice and beans etc.  however, I felt brave this particular night and ordered the lengua (tongue) taco.  Good god, maybe it was looking at the taste buds on the meat or knowing that I'm sort of french kissing/eating a cow tongue, it was horrible...one bite, almost heaved the whole nights worth of alcohol.  . . In conclusion, when drunk and around the corner, order the steak tacos otherwise go downstairs to underdog and get a red hot to satisfy those late night cravings.
