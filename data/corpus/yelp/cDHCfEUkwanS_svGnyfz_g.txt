I went with two other friends on a weeknight and we ordered a rice dish, Samosa Chat, coffee cake dessert (really small piece though), saffron dessert dish, and a chicken wrap of some sort. I can't remember the names, because it's all very non-Americanish, and you really have to read the description of the food if you are not familiar with Indian food. . . The waiter was very helpful and polite and the environment is nice as well. I like to leave an Indian restaurant without smelling like curry..and this is one of them!
