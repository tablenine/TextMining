Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I really enjoyed most of my experience at Hamburger Mary's. I will start by saying I have already been exposed to (and loved) Mary's Attic, as well as the overall feeling of Andersonville. . . The night began at another bar in Chicago that was less than good, and this was the eating joint between more activities. We arrived at midnight, yet still received food relatively quickly. The waitress was actually less polite than the bartender, and the food tasted great. We ate some fries and fried macaroni bites. I cannot wait to eat a full-blown meal here.
