Nicely done traditional Mexican fare.  It's no Bayless, but it's a decent find.  I hear their margaritas are really good.  For me, the win here is the tableside guacamole service.  Ultra-fresh guac made in a real mocajete to your precise specifications.  The only made-to-order guac I've found better is from a place called Ácenar in Austin, TX.. . So I really love this place for stopping in while you're in the neighborhood and having a guacamole.  That alone justifies Adobo Grill's apparent success, and that alone is what gets it 4 stars from me.
