Pricey but worth it.. . I went here for a friend's birthday dinner and we were seated right away even being a few minutes late.  We shared the sweet potato fries, kung pao chicken and duck.  It was a great meal.  The restaurant itself is kind of cheesy with the Asian decor being a little overdone but the food was great and the portions were just right.  . . Definitely will be back sometime to try out other dinner options.
