We went here after trekking out to Logan Square to try brunch at Lula, only to find it closed.  As one of my dining companions put it, it's a very good consolation prize.  The coffee is allegedly very good (I don't drink coffee, but my friends say so) and I can vouch that the food is really pretty good.  I had an omlet with goat cheese and lots of veggies that really hit the spot, but the highlight of all our meals was probably the creamy cheesy hashbrowns.  Prices were on the high side of reasonable.  Not a destination spot, but pretty good if you're in the neighborhood anyway.
