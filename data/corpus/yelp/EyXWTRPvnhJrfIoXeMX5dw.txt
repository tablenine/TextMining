This place is always bustling, but the service is attentive nonetheless.  Find parking in the lot isn't too bad if you plan well in advance.  The sashimi plate was quite satisfying-- I highly recommend the tuna here.  Acceptable prices overall, and the furnishings were comfortable even if the decor was a bit cheesy.  No real complaints from me, though I hear they changed up their hours after the business boom.  That's a pity, since their lunch special certainly hit the spot.
