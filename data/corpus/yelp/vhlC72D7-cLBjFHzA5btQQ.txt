I'm thrilled that I finally got the opportunity to go to my hometown Chicago's N9ne.  At the one in VEGAS I witnessed a STRUMPET pass out face-first into his French Onion Soup even before entrees were served.  I had the Roasted Parmesan and Pistachio Crusted Lamb Chops and most of my bros did the traditional meat monger mantra and got SURF AND TURF. It was the BEST MEAL I EVER HAD.. . My fiance took me to the Chicago N9ne for my birthday dinner and although I couldn't take a bathroom break and thrown $50 on black, the food was very good.  The Black Cod Miso is a MUST.  I paired it with an 8oz filet for surf and turf, but I wish I got 2 pieces of that sweet redeeming FISH.  My Vegetarian Vixen got the Zucchini and Tomato appetizer which you would think would be a cold appetizer but was hot and served like Eggplant Parmesan.  We also got an order of Garlic Steak Fries that could feed an army of FEEDBAGS.. . Try this hidden gem out - I've worked 2 blocks from here for 3 years and have never noticed it.  I would try things other than STEAK at this STEAKHOUSE though - mix it up.
