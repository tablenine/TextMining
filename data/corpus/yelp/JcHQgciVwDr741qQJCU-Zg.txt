I wish I went for the night events...because brunch was not that great.  too quiet/empty.  I like the whole structure and design of the castle though. very very mystical, just like Harry Potter.  I especially like the owl door and the secret password you have to say to get into the castle.  The brunch magic shows were kind of lame.  again i think it is ideal for kids.  haha sorry. i'm not 21 yet to tell you any exciting stories.  you still have to dress up for the castle--"smart casual."  I will update after I get in for the 21+ events.  TBA
