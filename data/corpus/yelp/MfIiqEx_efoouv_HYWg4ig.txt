Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Palms Thai is a decent Thai restaurant. I enjoy it so much more now that it's in it's new location. The parking was a nightmare at the old place. Now it's valet all day long, but at least you don't have to sit in a really busy parking lot before you get out of your car and sit down at the table. You drive right up and you are done.. . Back when I used to eat meat I tried to steer clear of this place. Now to be fair, I only really ever ate chicken at asian restaurants. The chicken here was really stringy and not very good at all. So whenever my girlfriend (who LOVES this place, but has only ever eaten here as a vegetarian) wanted to go here I would choose a separate place for myself. It was rather annoying.. . Now that I'm a vegetarian I am starting to warm up to Palms Thai. I always enjoyed the Thai Elvis singer. It might come off gimmicky to some, but for some reason I don't think I've ever felt this way. It's just kind of nice to walk in and see someone doing Elvis karaoke. And doing a pretty damn good job of it, I might add.. . Since becoming a veggie, I've tried a couple of dishes. I usually play it safe at Thai restaurants and what I order is probably pretty boring and bland to a lot of people. I quite enjoy the pineapple fried rice and the sweet and sour (with no meat, I just ask for extra cucumbers and pineapple) is another winner. All in all not bad. Not the best, but probably one of the better ones in the greater Thai Town vicinity.
