The food is delicious, fancy, and even though the servings are small, very filling.. . The service is superb.  To the point that when you get up from the table someone is there to fold your napkin and tidy up your area.  But at the same time, is that really needed?  You be the judge.. . I was a little unimpressed with the look of the interiors.  It was nice and pretty, but not as fancy/fabulous as I expected from a place that I consider to be a very fine dining place.  It was also a lot smaller than I imagined.. . I had the ricotta and egg ravioli.  It was everything I could have asked for and more.  I really really liked the flavor of the brown butter with it all.  So fun to split it in half and watch the egg yolk run everywhere, I don't know why but I love yolk!  I also had the basic salad for a starter, it was good too.. . My husband had the goat cheese and five lily ravioli.  I really liked the sweetness of it and the overall flavor.  He enjoyed it but is not a fan of mushrooms so I got to eat most of those, which also pleased me.. . For dessert I had the chocolate cake with bourbon gelato.  It's basically a molten chocolate cake, but better than any I've ever had.  The gelato was strong, much to strong for me if not paired with a large bite of cake.  I'm not a fan of bourbon though, so...  But it was perfect with the cake.  Good pairing of flavors.. . My husband had the apple pie tart with caramel gelato.  It was delicious, I almost wish we'd just gotten two of those, but then, where is the fun in that?. . I wish I'd read Anthony N.'s review before going here, we'd probably made a Sunday night res instead and sat at the bar for the $35 special.  I think we will definitely do that.
