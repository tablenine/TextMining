We went here for a birthday party for one of Shelli's friends, so we were excited to be there for him, but that's kinda where it ended for me.... . Having read the reviews on Steel here before we went, I was ready for a disappointment, so at least I prepped myself. Walking into the place, it seems like a typical trendy Midtown spot to me. Contemporary decor, "hip" people, etc... I made sure to dress accordingly. heh.. . Waiting at the bar, I had a Blackberry Mojito, one of their signature drinks, which really, wasn't that bad. I would suggest a larger straw to suck up the blackberry pulp, since it otherwise gets lodged in the standard straws that they use... Flavor was fine though.. . As for dinner, I ordered the suggested Korean Beef. Horrid. Talk about nothing on the plate, and overpriced... The beef was super dry, the kimchee was not so exciting, and the pancake that it sat on was blah.. . The thing that disappointed me the most was the server. Since it was a birthday, I decided to spring for a couple of bottles of champagne. I walked to the bar, and found our waiter. I asked for a couple of bottles to be brought out. 10 minutes later, here comes a bunch of waiters placing champagne flutes down in front of the guests... But wait! where's the champagne? He says it's gonna chill for 10 minutes more in the freezer before they bring it out. Way to ruin a surprise jacka$$! . . Steel, thanks for taking my money (I dropped at least $300 that night) and leaving me used and abused in Midtown.
