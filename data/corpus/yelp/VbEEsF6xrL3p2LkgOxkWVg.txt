Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Ah yes, Cheesecake Factory...I would come here more often except for my love affair with its sister restaurant Grand Lux.  (Sorry CF, I still love you...). . I remember my first time going to Cheesecake Factory and seeing Jerry Springer with all his crazy groupies...that was quite interesting...especially since, for a couple minutes I couldn't put my finger on why "that guy" looked so familiar (Please don't look at me in disbelief...I didn't watch the show).. . Anyways, I instantly fell in love with the avocado eggrolls...delicious!  And to this day, I always make sure to order it when I frequent CF.  Another default of mine would be their chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta (FYI, Grand Lux has this too but with rice instead).  For dessert, I love their chocolate tuxedo cheesecake...it is absolutely scrumptious.  . . People think that Grand Lux is a tourist trap but I don't know, Cheesecake scares me more in terms of that.  I think it has to do with the fact that it's in the Hancock building.
