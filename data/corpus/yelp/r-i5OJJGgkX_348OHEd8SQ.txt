amazing, inexpensive Cuban cuisine! This place is filled with Cubans and that means 2 things: the food is authentic and the women are beautiful.. . when you first walk in you may be confused which line to use but a door greeter will usually happily assist you. if it looks packed, don't fret; this is normal and you will have no trouble getting food quickly. insiders note: you can usually order cafe food from the much shorter line on bakery side too.. . if you are new to cuban food, order a sandwich but push yourself to also order a few unique pastries from the display. at less than a dollar each, you can't go wrong.
