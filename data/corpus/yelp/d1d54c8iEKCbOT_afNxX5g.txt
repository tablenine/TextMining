I am a HUGE sushi fan and was looking for a nice dinner spot for my b-day. A good friend of mine suggested BONDST and I am soooo glad she did! . This place was fantastic! First off, the atmosphere is buzzing yet if you are able to get a table upstairs there is a more intimate feel. . My friends and I ordered a vast array of rolls and I have to say they all where very fresh and delicious. The Toro Scallion was my fav. One of my friends ordered the Kamo Namban, which are noodles served with some incredible, tender duck. . The price is reasonable ($75 for my 3 rolls and 4 drinks) . I highly suggest BONDST for any special occasion or just a nice long dinner with great conversation.
