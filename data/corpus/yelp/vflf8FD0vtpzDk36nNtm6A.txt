Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
We had the most difficult time ordering from the menu because there were so many items. I finally decided on the grilled sea bass, which was such a small portion. It wasn't as fantastic as I thought it would be. I tried my friend's beef stroganoff which was extremely cheesy and rich.. Had some cheese balls that I am curious to find a recipe for to make myself. Overall, not too impressed with Bossa Nova.
