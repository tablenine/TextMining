Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
Wow, what a true "institution" Langer's is!  I don't usually enjoy pastrami, but I have to say this is the best I've had.  It's almost like smoked honey ham, rather than the corned beef it actually is.. . The service was also a nice surprise, usually the best you can hope for at these delis and greasy spoons is a disgruntled 50-something giving you the bare minimum.  However, our guy made us feel like nothing was too much to ask.  He did make a funny look when I ordered a chocolate shake with my #6 (pastrami and chopped liver), but in hindsight I don't blame him for reacting when I order like a pregnant woman..... . Yes, the neighborhood has a certain "south of the border" feel to it, but that only adds to the cred this place has.  You know it's a blast from the old-LA past, because it sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb in Pico Union.  And it's always worth making a trip to this side of LA, if just to remind you of what kind of life you *don't* have to live.  Just check out the mural in Langer's parking lot and you'll know what I mean.. . ------Update January 11th 2007--------. I had the #19 today, and it's awesome!!  No question what my choice will be from now on!!
