I can still taste them...mmm.... . I came here last week to meet up with a friend.  What an awesome restaurant.  While these weren't the best siu long bow I've ever had, they're certainly up there.  My only caveat was the skin could have used a little more bite.  Otherwise, the soupy insides were definitely flowing, and the directions on the chopstick sleeves on how properly consume the dumplings was a nice touch.. . We tried a few different kinds, crab, shrimp and pork shao mai, and steamed pork.  Double up on the pork, get a few others to try, and you're good to go.  We also had some of the fried rice and pan fried rice noodles.  Those were equally awesome.. . I think this is one of those restaurants that as a local, you'd probably grow tired of, but as an out of towner, you wish you had one back home.  Either way, you have to try it at least once.  Just get there a little early to avoid the crowds.
