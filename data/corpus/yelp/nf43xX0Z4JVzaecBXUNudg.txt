Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Coming from the Barnsdall Center for an art show, we figured we would stop at my girlfirend's favorite restaurant in the Los Feliz area... Alcove.  Not knowing what to expect, I pulled into this long driveway.  We valet, and walk into a packed restaurant @ 3pm.  Very good sign.. . While waiting in line, i noticed the specials menu which had eggs de parma (poached eggs, prosciutto, goat cheese, with a pesto sauce on focaccia bread) and claimed that as my order.  My girlfriend got one of her standards, Salmon salad.  We ordered the cheese platter and 2 carafes of bellinis to complement the brunch.. . Sitting at the outside patio was nice, surroundsed by old school fencing and bushes.  . . the cheese platter arrived, with multiple layers of deliciousness.  I don't remember what the cheeses were, but all were good.  the raisins still on the vine was a nice touch.  . . the eggs de parma was totally heaven on foccacia.  the goat cheese melted well with the proscuitto.  . . the salmon salad was good, and the bellinis were too smotth.. . Would recommend to anyone in the area.  But judging by how packed the restaurant was while we were there, even at odd hours, everyone does know.
