Category: Sushi Bars
Came here for dinner for my friend's bachelor party and we were all pretty happy with the result.  Yes, this place is phenomenally expensive (my contribution alone was over $90), but it's a great place for groups because the servers leave you alone unless they see that they're needed, the variety of drinks is impressive, the sushi ranges from decent to very good, and the ambiance is probably the best I've experienced at an L.A. restaurant.. . Do NOT take public transportation to this place unless you enjoy walking uphill for forever.  Also, be warned that it's very easy to turn in too early as you go uphill and end up in the parking lot of the Magic Castle.. . This is overall a great place to check out for a very special occasion or, if you like throwing money around like Donald Trump, a regular Saturday night.
