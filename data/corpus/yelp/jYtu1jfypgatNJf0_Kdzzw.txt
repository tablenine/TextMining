The first time we went to this place, for breakfast, it was solid if unspectacular.  The second and third times spelled disaster.  The food is spotty at best (stick with breakfast, though there are certainly better options than this) and the service sometimes non-existent.  . . The drinks (see: martinis) and salads were particluarly rueful.  Ick.  And it was smokier in here than most bingo parlors and casinos.  The atmosphere has potential, but never really lives up to it.  . . If you're in the neighborhood and are craving your breakfast/comfort food fix, walk a couple of doors down and try Feast instead.
