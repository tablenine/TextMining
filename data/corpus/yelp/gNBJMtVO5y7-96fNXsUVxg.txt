I've had the Peanut Butter and Creme de la Creme French toast which is AMAZING!  LOVED IT!  Peanut Butter French Toast was covered with Powdered sugar and dipped in peanut butter then fried!  I didn't need any maple sugar and its perfect for those who love peanut butter. The Creme de la Creme is the Cheesecake version of the french toast. The topping tastes like cheesecake and it made of creme cheese mixed with whipped cream. sweet but not overly and very filling. Be prepared to share this with 4 others at least.. . They have 3 variants of chili that they put in their chili my omelette. I opted for the vegetarian one which was ok, good but not Grrrreat. I'm sure the meat one is better but I am trying to not eat so much meat. . . Portions are big, service is great with a hot waitstaff and most importantly the food is good. They are also pet friendly and brought my doggie a water bowl.  The only downside is that there is always a wait but the plus side is that portions are so big it quenches that hunger pretty quickly. There is also parking around the back which makes it better than most places in LA.
