Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The boiling crab is a fun place to go with a group of friends who don't mind getting down and dirty with their eats. My friends and I had a fun time licking our fingers and enjoying the food. The staff was really friendly and came by to check on us multiple times while we were there. They're also ready to give recommendations for those of us first-timers. . . The reason for the three stars? Each of us spent about $20 and we left not feeling quite full. The boiling crab would be able to make a small killing just by selling a side of bread or something else to sop up the yummy sauce. Most of my friends liked the sauce, but it was a little too salty for my taste. . . The crab was delicious, but if you're a picky eater, or aren't used to working a little bit for your food, be prepared. The crabs are served to you whole and you'll need to pick and pull your way to the meat.
