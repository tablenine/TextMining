I've been craving burgers lately, and I think it's because I've been watching Diners, Drive-ins and Dives religiously (DDD was not filmed here as far as I know).  So I decided to take some people over to the Oinkster to see what all the fuss was about.. I ordered the Royale and nearly exploded after I ate it.  It's a cheeseburger with lettuce, onions and tomatoes.  And bacon.  And chili.  And pastrami.  I couldn't taste the Gruyere (not even sure how to pronounce that... I just did my best to repeat what the girl said when she listed off the choices for cheese) because there were so many other things in the burger.  But the pepper from the pastrami stood out.  Overall, it was messy and a bit overwhelming, but I thought it was good.  I managed to finish it but that's because I am a bit large.  Eat with caution if you normally eat less than 5,000 calories per meal.. The Belgian fries were okay.  Lacking in flavor on its own, it is greatly assisted by the garlic aioli sauce.  But the aioli comes in third in my mind to the ones at Father's Office and 8oz Burger Bar.  It just wasn't as strong or addicting and I didn't have the urge to drink it straight up.  But the texture of the fries was good: slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.. I didn't get the Ube shake because I'm not a fan of taro, but I did try a sip of my cousin's and thought it was decent.  She said it grew on her the more she drank it so take that for what it's worth.. About $12 for the combo which means it's more than In n Out but less than FO.  And based on everyone else's reactions w/ their burgers, I don't think these burgers exceeded either of those places.
