WHO EVER SAID SHABU SHABU IS BLAND??!!!. . Jenny S. raises hand* guilty as charged. BUT that was at another restaurant. a good friend of mine couldn't believe his ears when he heard me say that so he took me to his fav place SHABU SHABU HOUSE in little tokyo... . we had to leave West LA at 10 AM to eat LUNCH at 12!! its a really small restaurant. You start signing up on the list before it opens, which I LOVE because you can go shop for things while you wait instead of stand in line. . we didn't make it in on the first round of eaters since there is such limited seating but. when we got in MMMMMM.. . . THAT PONZU SAUCE is so delicious and their beef if you boil it just right melts in your mouth!! you have a choice of lean beef or regular and 10 slices or 15. . . they have good peanut sauce tooo for dippin meat or the veggies/tofu/noddles you get on the side.. try the sauce mixed w/ your rice (which they refill for free). . for "dessert" i ordered the ice coffee which you sweeten and milk to your preference. it was delicious. . this place is really good but don't let me over hype it for you.. perhaps i loved it because i had such a bad experience somewhere else and it didnt even COMPARE. . the waiters here do rush you a little because of the limited seating but they are so polite about it you dont' really get offended. . waking up on a saturday morning for this..pay $17 for the large 15 slice and iced coffee. is it worth it? ID DO IT AGAIN
