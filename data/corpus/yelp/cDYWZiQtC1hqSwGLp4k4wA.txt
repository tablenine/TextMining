Sometimes drunks call it "The Jamestic."  (Well at least in my case.) . When I was in my 20s (now 41) I used to love this place attitude and all.  I don't know if it was because: . A. I was starving and it was sometime between 3 and 6 AM. . B. I usually went with a pretty good buzz . C. I was usually with a bunch of friends . D. I was young and unruly. . E. All of the above. . . These days I'm no longer constantly in "party mode" so I think I'll stick to daytime visits and leave the surly/weirdness for the younger crowd to enjoy.  I'm with you Three. . . Note:  One of the strangest things that happened to me here was some guy on the sidewalk outside asking me (in all seriousness) what city he was in.
