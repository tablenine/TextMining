The desserts are excellent!!! But first let me warn you about how expensive everything is. I don't know why this is rated with one dollar sign, but it should be two. I ordered two sandwiches, a blue velvet cake, and a Milkie Way Malt for $38 total!!!!!!!!!!. . I definitely recommend this place for dessert or even to bring a date after a nice meal from somewhere else, but don't do dinner or lunch here, because their cheapest sandwich is $11.50 and it's small. Their Medianoche sandwich is close to $15 and you can get the same thing, if not better, at Porto's for $3.50. . . Again, don't come here to eat lunch or dinner, because you'll think about other ways you could have spent that money; I kept thinking that I could have gotten 8 In 'N' Out meals.. . Blue velvet cake will leave your tongue blue :)
