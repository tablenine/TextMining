Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
I've never had a good experience here - one time I dropped by to get a cappucino for my friend who worked at the Korean restaurant (now closed) a few doors down, and it was all foam, just a tiny bit of coffee on the bottom of the cup. I told my friend they should change their name to the Rip Me Off Cafe. . . Every time I've come here to eat, I've been totally ignored by the waitstaff; I've sat in here 20 minutes or more without anyone so much as acknowledging my presence. And the place only had a few customers anyways. Hm, I wonder why there weren't more?
