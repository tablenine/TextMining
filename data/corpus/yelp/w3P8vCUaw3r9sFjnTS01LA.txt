Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I was optimistic as this was a new, unique joint in my neighborhood.  The 'B' in the window was a turnoff, the staff was rude (bearded beach bum / sea captain guy was a smart a**), and while the tacos were edible, I found myself not able to finish my second one since the woman handling the money, was the same handling my food (barehanded).. . Also, it seemed like this was part restaurant / part mechanic shop.  I love fish tacos, so may pop back in to take a peek.  Not a great initial experience.
