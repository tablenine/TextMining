More like 4.5 stars (I'm afraid of giving a 5 for some reason).  This place is great - quiet, intimate, adorable.  I've always had friendly, accomodating, knowledgeable wait staff.  And the food?  Is great.   From the bread to the salad to pasta or meats, everything satisfies.  . . And, here's the kicker - it's not even that pricey.
