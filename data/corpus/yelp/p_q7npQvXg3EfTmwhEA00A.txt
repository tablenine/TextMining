To the three girls that were seated near our table of fourty on the roof top and then got up and asked to be reseated because the man of honor was humping our buddies head - Im sorry. . To the waiter that had to decifer drunkaneese from the masses - Im sorry. . To the lovely manager (?) who brought us out the fabulous geisha kiss shots - Im sorry....that I didn't order more cause they were fabulous, I am sorry the drunk man of honor lifted you up and grabbed your bootie. . To the expensive magnum of sake - Im sorry a fellow drunkie picked you up, tried to pour you into his mouth and missed...a lot...no one deserves alcohol abuse like that. . Im not sorry I ate here with 40 of my closest friends, I dont think the staff here really blinnked an eye to our raucous behavior, it is Hollywood and there are slovenly drunken coked out celebrities that can put us to shame.......um and the food was decent as well.....yummy mushroom tempura, tuna on crispy rice fried bananas...
