I'm really just basing this on one dish, so it might be a tad unfair.  I went here on Saturday for some chilaquiles (my fave dish), and I have news for you Loteria, what you call chilaquiles are not chilaquiles.  If you want to take some left over nachos, put sauce on top, and charge almost $10 for them, just say so!  Don't disappoint me by saying you serve chilaquiles.. . I'm giving them 3 stars because maybe they just had an off day.  Everyone else seems to like them.  For anyone looking to try chilaquiles, I recommend Alegria on Sunset instead.
