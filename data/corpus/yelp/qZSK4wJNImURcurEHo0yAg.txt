This place is more or less a ritzy bar. You can get herb roasted rabbit with a pint, and no one will look twice. They have an amazing selection of beer - I was thrilled to find they serve Old Rasputin here, a beer I thought I fabricated one tipsy evening many moons ago. It's a dark ale, strong with coffee overtones, definitely not for everyone. They also have hard cider! . . Their 'normal' (as in not sweet potato) fries are TINY. If you split a pencil in half it would be too thick. Ketchup is not a word these people understand, so don't bother asking. Instead, all fry types are served with a thick, creamy garlic sauce that sounds both puzzling and revolting, but works surprisingly well. I found myself wishing they gave me two containers of it. . . Also, their burgers? Amazing! They don't have normal buns, it's closer to a dinner roll, piled high with spinach and other greens, which almost makes you feel healthy. Almost. What ruins it is the half pound slab of high quality beef, with a healthy dose of a mysterious sauce I could Â never place but nonetheless enjoyed. After I left felt like a whale, but a very satisfied whale. I recommend not going on a Friday or Saturday night after 6 pm, it'll take a half hour to get into the place and you'll never find seating.
