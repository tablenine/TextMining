4.5 overall, i went there with 2 of my friend from out of town, we tried almost everything on the breakfast menu, everything was perfect. my friends both loved it. . the only thing was we had 3 people in our party so for some reason we waited more than 30 mins before we got seated even though we saw empty tables open and other couple that signed in after us went in before our party, but the food def made it up!
