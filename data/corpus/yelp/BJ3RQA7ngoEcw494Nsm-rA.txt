Restaurant: Fox Bros Bar-B-Q
Category: Barbeque
Look.  Fox Brothers has an amazing hype machine.  Congratulations.   Reality is the food is average.  I have had most everything on the menu and it is OK but the love for this place is confusing to me.   Some of it has to be East-sliders rallying to support the business in their 'hood, as they are know to do, but the only conclusion I can come to is that most people posting 5-star reviews must simply not eat BBQ that often.. . I thought about giving a two star but the deal breaker was the tacky beer signs that they posted all over the place.   Seriously guys can't you do better than the signs the beer-truck man hands you?
