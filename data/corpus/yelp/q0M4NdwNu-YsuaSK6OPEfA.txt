Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I thought I'd never make it up here (because that means battling insane traffic from the South Bay) and when I was sitting in said traffic on Highland to get to the Bowl a couple weeks ago (on a Monday night no less), I wearily turned my head to the left and saw the light...I mean...the sign for Pizzeria Mozza. My friend thought something was wrong with me when I propped up and started getting excited and then I explained to her that I've been wanting to try this place for a while (all due to what you folks have been writing here!). . In any event, as we were finally walking to our seats, I decided to call information to find out what time they closed. Sweet!...they didn't close until midnight...we could get there by then... and surely you won't need rezzies at that hour... and I can finally see what the hype is about! We split before the encore to beat traffic out of the Bowl and headed back to the joint.. . We were seated right away...yay! Since it was so late, we decided to just order the squash blossoms and one of their newest pizzas which is their meat lovers pizza (which I can't remember the name for the life of me right now and it's not on their online menu!) . . Squash Blossoms: . Very good...there is a lot of fried batter on there but it was light batter. The order wasn't huge...just enough to whet your appetite. . . Pizza: . Wonderful! I was hoping to not be too disappointed after watching the comings and goings while we waited for our food and we were certainly not disappointed. Very light. More than enough for one person and just damn flavorful w/o being too greasy. We both sat there in silence thoroughly enjoying it. . . Would I go back again? Absolutely! Although, I do realize that our experience isn't the norm...where we didn't have to wait and it was "easy"...but hey, I like to practice spontaneous degustation. ;)
