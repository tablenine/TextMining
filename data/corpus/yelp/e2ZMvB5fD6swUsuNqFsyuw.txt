Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Overhyped, but still tasty. I stick with the good ol crispy fried tacos. 4 of them will fill you up, theyre loaded with tasty fresh grated cheese. . . If you don't feel like waiting hit up Cinco de Mayo nextdoor. It's got a larger menu and overall better food.
