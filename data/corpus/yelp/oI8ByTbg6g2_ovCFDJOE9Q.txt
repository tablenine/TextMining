I'd heard good things and really wanted to love this place - and the atmosphere alone is worth a trip (we sat in the room with the fireplace). But the food, save for some amazing crab cakes, was just so-so. And for the price, so-so is so not good enough! Still, it's a pretty place to visit with a romantic vibe.
