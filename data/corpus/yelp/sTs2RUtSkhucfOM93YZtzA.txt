My wife and I went here after seeing a rival restuarant of Daikokya on Man vs Food. I came on to Yelp and saw that everyone loved Daikokuya so we decided to give it a try. We first went by here on a Friday night and saw the huge line outside and decided to take a pass and come another time. We ended up coming down on a Monday night and the line was still fairly long but we decided to tough it out. Waited for about 45 minutes. With the reviews and the long lines, we thought that it would definitely be worth it.. . Boy were we wrong! We ordered one tuna sashimi combo and one ramen soup. The service was really quick and friendly but unfortunately the food did not live up to the hype at all. The broth was tasteless, there was hardly any meat and I felt completely ripped off. I could have went to a local market and bought a 99 cent package of ramen and spiced it up a lot better than the bowl I got here. I'm not quite sure what all the hype is. My wife who eats everything couldn't even stomache the soup and left over 3/4 of it. . . Much prefer pho with the tastier broth and good amount of meat.. . Gave it a try but def first and last one.
