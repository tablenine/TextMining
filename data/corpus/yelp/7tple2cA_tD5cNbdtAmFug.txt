Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I finally made it to Bottega Louie which is located on 7th Ave. and Grand right smack in the middle of the Finance District and Gallery District of Downtown LA.  I've pass by this retaurant many times before after my workout at the Ketchum YMCA and heard about it from my mother.  She brought me a pizza from the place and it was quite sumptuous.  I love that it was thin slice and veggies were fresh and yummy.. . Fast forward to a couple of nights ago when I finally made it and it was just a delight.  I felt I was taken somewhere else, somewhere like NYC or some chic place in London.  The interior is all white with gold brass to contrast.  All of the servers were wearing nice crisp white shirts and black tie and apron.  I love it!  The place was packed and it was loud because of the high ceilings, you can hear glass clucking and conversations just echoing.. . We waited not too long and finally got our table.  The portobello fries were amazing! I can't think of the salad's name but it was with walnuts and a really light yet satisfying vinigrette which I enjoyed very much.  Their spinach and calamari were seasoned well too.  We had the Napoli as our pizza and yes, it was brilliant.  The only down side about the whole experience for  me was the dessert.  Maybe I picked the wrong one.  I tried the raspberry and chocolate tart.  The tart/chocolate base was extremely difficult to cut, like it was left in the refrigerator for awhile and the fruit was slightly mushy.. . Minus the dessert issue, I had a great experience and I intend to return and try something in their dessert menu.  I am very happy to find this new place and I am looking forward to sharing this with friends.  I also plan on checking out their mise en place section for the rush out the door type of meal.  I will keep you posted, until next time.
