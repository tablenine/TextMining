Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Chicken and waffles just like how my mama makes it! Oh wait, I'm asian. Nevermind.. . The combination sounds odd but wait til you sink your teeth into this "PERFECT" fried chicken and waffles that can make you forget your name! After hearing about this place on movies, t.v., even John West (the singer), I had to try it. I've been coming back since. . . I grew up without chicken and waffles on my list of comfort foods, boy was I missing out!
