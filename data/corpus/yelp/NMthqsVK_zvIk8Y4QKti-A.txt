Saturday morning, a full day of beach and biking ahead, eating muffins and hash browns while taking in the ocean view - yep, this is an easy 5 stars!. . Definitely a popular spot, we got here just after 8 and were the last to be seated immediately, the crowd gathered outside soon after that.  The service is designed around this, quick and attentive.  The guy with the coffee is particularly good at his job, plenty of refills!. . If I was to recommend one thing in particular, it's the blueberry muffins.  So light and flavorful, I'd come back just for those.  Don't miss 'em!
