Restaurant: Casa Vega
Category: Mexican
Casa Vega is at the top of my Mexican food adventures. First off, the Margarita's are strong, they have a little wind up toy bull that let walk across the bar, and you can always catch a porn star or Charlie Sheen frequenting this place. Plus they have good food to go along with the interesting valley atmosphere. If Casa Vega was on the other side of the hill I'd be there on a regular basis. P.S. Dinner time is a little bit hectic.
