Furaibo says it all:  Fried.. . There are more fried things with sauce than you can shake a chopstick at.  This place is crazy.  There are always so many people here.  Even when I drive by, there are always people waiting outside.. . This place reminds me of an izakaya in Japan.  It's loud, overflowing with draft beer and fried stuff all over the place.. . This is the place you come to party with your friends over some good beer food.  It's not flash or even super high quality stuff.  But it sure does go down mighty fine.. . Don't half step.  Try the wings...er....wangs.
