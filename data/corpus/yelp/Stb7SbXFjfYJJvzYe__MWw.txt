I don't see the hype! Bunch of people lined up for this less than mediocre semi- Mexican food? Even back in high school till now, I still don't get why people like too salty burritos with watery salsa. If that wasn't bad enough, let's not start on the Guacamole, milkshake at McDonald's is much thicker than that...
