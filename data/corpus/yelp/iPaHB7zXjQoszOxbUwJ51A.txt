Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Ok, this is the first time I have been to this Roscoe's and if you don't know it is there you will miss it. First, how could you not seat anyone waiting for other people to show up when noone is there? I don't get that. . . I like Roscoe's food, I mean I only go there when I know I will be eating chicken and waffles &amp; nothing else. Though the mac &amp; cheese I sampled was pretty damn good. . . The place is kinda scuzzy to put it lightly but it is not much different than eating in your moms old kitchen back in the day &amp; watching her make some chicken for the family eating some while she does. Though I know my mamas kitchen had less gnats, well actually no gnats flying around as much as this place did. . . Service was ok, I appreciated the fact that I got my beers fast. I will stick to the Pico location, it's what I know best. I need to try the Long Beach locale though.
