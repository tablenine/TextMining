Come on, Steakie. You are killing me.. . This place is not good at all. The food is secondary to the scene. I remember I got a glass of white wine once that was so hot that the waitress had to bring me an ice bath for it. And, the glass melted the bath very quickly!. . Lots of visual wows, but not a spot to go if you want quality grub.. . Just my humble opinion though. . . Better meals can be had elsewhere.
