Restaurant: Stats

So me and the girls headed out for the night, starting with dinner at none other than Stats. I had never been here, but had heard good things about it from my friends that I was with, so I thought I'd give it a go.. . It's a great idea for a restaurant, but I'm just not so sure I liked it all that much. I expected something more "sporty", like the ESPN Zone or Fox Sports, I mean I guess that's the look they were going for "different from your typical sports spot", but I personally wasn't quite feeling the atmosphere.. . However I will give them props on the food, for the pricing, and the portions, they were both convenient and sufficient. My friend had the ribs, and was surpised that the half rack alone with a side of mac and cheese was enough to suffice her hungry stomach. I had the BBQ pull pork sandwich and had pork overflowing from the bun, it was goodness for my southern style appetite that night.. . Another negative was the service. Our waiter was absolutely NON-existent. I don't know if it was because he figured we were some "cheap ass" college students (since we do look so young), or what, but he paid us no attention, didn't give us the time of day when we were trying to ask him questions about the menu, and order. I was not happy with that at all.. . And I must agree with Andre regarding the bathrooms they were definitely a super neat concept.. . I would have given the place two stars, due to the atmosphere and the service, but they got a +1 for the food. It was a fun night due to the crowd I was with, but definitely don't see myself coming here during football season to catch the game, it might be too "upscale" for my taste, I like to hear some hootin' and hollerin' and cheerin' for teams when I watch a game.......
