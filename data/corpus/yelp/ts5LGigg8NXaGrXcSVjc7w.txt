I don't really understand the hype about this place- For having a name that focuses on their lactose offerings, only 1/3 of the menu actually had to do with shakes/ice cream! And what they had wasn't that original... Sorry. . . If I'm going to deal with pain in the ass parking, a constant line, and $6 shakes, I expect something impressive.
