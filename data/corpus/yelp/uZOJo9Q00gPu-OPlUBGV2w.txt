Restaurant: Varasano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
One of the top pies in Atlanta. They have done a great job creating a wonderfully charred thin crust pizza very similar to those in New York. Service is usually very good and the pizzas outstanding.. . My favorite pies have been:. . Nana's with hot sopressata and mushrooms. Nana's. Nana's with sausage (with fennel). Caramelized onions with sausage (with fennel). Caramelized onions. and the Salumi!. . For dessert I love their italian doughnuts and the chocolate demise cake. They recently introduced gelato but I have not had an opportunity to try it yet.. . I continue to bring friends and family to Varasano's for an excellent pizza experience in a classy atmosphere. It is definitely one of the best in town.
