Category: Southern
My favorite place to pig out in the world! I always get the #3 and take some with me for the ride up the 5 home. I looove the smothered potatoes, the mac and cheese, and the corn bread. I like getting chicken sausage and eating it with the waffles too! My mouth is watering right now!. . I have always gone to this location as it is my favorite and iconic. Hell it was in a Tupac video and I always see a celeb (last time Chris Brown after the Rihanna mess), athlete (Kobe once), or whatever when I go. Now that the location is larger I have never really waited. I NEVER go on Sundays until around 4 and later. Nor do I really go late night Fri or Sat cause you know, fat girl gotta eat.
