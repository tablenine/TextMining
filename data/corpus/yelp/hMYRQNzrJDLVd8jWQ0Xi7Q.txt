The Hype was immense. It was featured on the Food Network, and Food Network recommendations have been severely disappointing before. Not only that, but it has amazing 600+ reviews on Yelp!. . When I first bit into #19, I think I heard angels singing. And bells.. . Pro-tip: must call ahead and do the curb-side service! Makes things a lot smoother.
