you know those establishments that serve food that just tastes better when you're drunk? this is one of those places.. . i've been going to clarke's for over six years now, and each time i go, i'm not disappointed, but i'm not blown away, either. more than anything, it really just reminds me of being in high school and thinking i was TCFS while i crunched on my nachos and downed my milkshake and my friends smoked cigarettes.. . i went there today for brunch and yeah..still the same, consistent a-ok food and service. go late at night when you're tipsy. the food will miraculously taste better and you won't care as much about it being overpriced when you're watching your friends act a fool.
