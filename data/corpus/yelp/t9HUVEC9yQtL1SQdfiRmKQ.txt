Dood, Sushi Gen has some bomb bay sushi! I would say better then Yoshida. Reading the reviews of this restaurant just makes me feel just a little bit more special. Why you may ask? Cause I didn't have to wait. Muhuhaha... Evil, I know... but it was great. My experence of this place was amazing. If your wondering how? I got people. Yes people... lol Who are my people? My "big boss" (he hates it when I call him that) lol We desided to come here before our Club Event. I've read the reviews before and was scared that we might have to wait long. When we got there and I asked the host how long was the wait? 30mins... I was sad unitl the manager came by. My boss went to high school with him. Which I didn't know and he didn't know he worked there. 10mins later we had our seats at the bar. Now that is service. I felt bad for the two old couples that were in front of us. =T sorry... I don't think they wanted to say something because they most likely thought we were gangsters. We just came from a funeral and we were in all black suits. We're big guys too... lol but I really felt bad. (Trust I'm not part of the Tri-ad or yacuza how ever you spell it. I'm a nice gentle person. ^_^V see...) The sushi made me feel so much better though. I'm cold when it comes to my tummys happiness though. lol . . I recommend just eatting the sushi, FORGET THE ROLLS! If your going for the gold, stick with the sushi, trust! The sushi Chefs are GREAT! My first time and forsure not my last.
