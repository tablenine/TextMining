I've been consistently delighted by this place Â for about ten or fifteen years now, however long they have been open. It feels like home but the menu and the decor stay fresh. The other night I awkwardly enough ended up there with my parents on Valentine's Day (hold your tongues... it was an accident, we honestly forgot what night it was)... of course they were fully booked but managed to find us a three-top in about 20 minutes (no small feat). Service was hectic because of the night but as friendly and helpful as always. The food confirmed why this place has been such a standby in my life. Everything was amazing... a little posh-ified for the "big night" but tasty nonetheless. Extra credit for not clogging the place with Mylar heart shaped balloons and red votives!
