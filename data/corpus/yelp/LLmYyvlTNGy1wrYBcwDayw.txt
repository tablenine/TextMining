Came here for a Saturday brunch and got the breakfast burritos, which was pretty good. They score points for being BYOB and for the really nice waitress who didn't judge me when I debated getting a 6 pack at 10:30 am. In the end I was just too lazy to get leave. . . Ate outside and despite being obviously busy we weren't rushed. Had really great service from a new waitress who told us she was new in town and asked where she should go in the neighborhood to meet people. To thank us for being nice she gave us a bag full of free pastries with our check, which was awesome. . . I've had a better breakfast burrito (it just seemed a bit healthy- god, I'm gross- and on that end, a little plain) but I'd come back to try some other things as well.
