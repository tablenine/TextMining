damn this place sure has gotten popular since the whole man vs. food thing aired... i've eaten at this ramen house for years now and it's still pretty freakin good... Â . but damn all the "man vs. food" stories... i must've heard the story at every table at least 2 times, i'm not counting but that's a lot of frackin times.... yes the #2 is fire in a bowl... and if you eat it, you're more man (woman) than me. i usually just get the impact (#3) salt or soy with chashu and garlic.. things not to get:. -spicy scallops (not spicy, not even sure it's scallops, but definately not worth it). -fried rice: you want fried rice, go elsewhere. . stick to the ramen and you'll be good to go!!
