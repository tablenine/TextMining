Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
If you don't like Lawry's, we're not friends. Granted it is a little pricey and isn't a weekly dining spot, but it's great for big family occasions.  My dad is a VIP member and accumulates points every time they dine there, so we often get dining credit on our next visit.  . . I usually get The Lawry Cut and sometimes look more forward to the salad that comes out with the spinning sauce than the actual cut, but let's not be silly here, that's probably been just once.  The baked potato is always a good addition and once you're there, why not get it loaded.  . . We've also been to the one in Las Vegas, but frequent the Beverly hills location at least twice a year.
