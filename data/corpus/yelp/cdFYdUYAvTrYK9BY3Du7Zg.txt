This place is a great value - very nice, but not break-the-bank nice. The food is a level above your typical high-end seafood restaurant. . . I took my mother out to dinner here when she was visiting from out of town, and she loved it. We chose the prixe fixe option on the menu, which for me meant a starter of lobster bisque (good, but not the best I've ever had), an entree of the crab cakes (delicious!) with a side of mashed potatos (fantastic!) and a creme brulee (very good) for dessert. While the food was, on the whole, very good, the wine pairings (we borrowed them from another special set menu) were fantastic. Service was as good as you could ask for, although the food did come out a tad quickly at first. On the whole, an excellent dining experience.
