I happen to like this restaurant a lot! this is like the Louie in New York ...the service is not the best but average our waiter forgot about us a couple times but he was very cute and friendly so it wasnt a big deal, i will definitely reccomend it is a cool place for big parties and if you still wanna keep on drinking its convenient because right accross the street is 7 Grand.
