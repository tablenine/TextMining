Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
After hearing endless hype about the Vortex, we decided to check it out one night with a bunch of friends.  It was crowded, but the $3.95 Stone Pale Ale's at the bar kept us entertained until we were seated.  As soon as we sat down, two huge bowls of sweet potato fries materialized in front of us.  The crinkle cut on the fries made their freshness dubious, but it didn't really matter.  They were crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and served with a sauce that complimented the fries like side pipes on a classic Corvette.  At my end of the table, there was much debate on the sauce composition.  We decided that it was a mayonnaise-based sauce with Worcester, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Cayenne and perhaps some Allspice.   Whatever it is, it is fabulous.  . For dinner, I went with the Bacon Cheeseburger topped with cheddar and sautéed mushrooms with a side of fries. The burgers were served in less than a beer's wait and looked like they were worth the hype.  My initial complaint was that the buns had been toasted in butter, which I can't stand, but is a staple in the South, so shame on me for not expecting that.  Other than that, the burgers were very good.  Thick and juicy, with a good meat to bun ratio and just the right amount of cheese, it had all the makings of a world-class burger.  The bacon was a bit on the chewy side, but it's still bacon so no big deal.  The fries were definitely a disappointment.  They had an aura about them that they were frozen rather than fresh cut, which spawned a table wide debate over the miracle that is 5Guys fries. Nevertheless, The Vortex was very good, although not quite up to the tremendous hype.
