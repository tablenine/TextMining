I had one of the best thin crust pizzas I've had in Chicago here. My friend and I ordered the spinach and mushroom pizza and it was delicious. FYI: the spinach is sauteed with basil, garlic and onions. The sauce is sweet and zesty and slightly chunky. The crust is thin and crisp.. . We started with the house salad. It is chopped up and I love the small pieces as it holds the dressing well. Too bad the red wine vinaigrette was overly sour. We ended with the hot brownie sundae which is rich and yummy and big enough for 4 people.. . Our waiter was very nice and helpful. I'd definitely go back until I find a better thin crust pizzeria.
