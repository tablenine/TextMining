Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I wasn't too impressed with the pizza when I ate in the restaurant. I drank a lot of beer and liquor next door at Grand Central for the Ohio State game and ate the leftovers while walking back to the hotel. Maybe it was the alcohol that made it taste better, was good deep dish pizza. I don't know how I feel about Chicago style pizza. It seems ass backwards with the cheese on bottom!
