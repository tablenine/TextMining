Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's may be the most overrated place in LA.  There's always a line; but that's only because the workers make hotdogs at a snail's pace.  I've been 3 times and my patience ran out 2 of those times.  I remember the very last attempt I made, I drove by and the line looked short - maybe only about 15 people there.  So I decided that I would stop by and try my luck. I stood in line for about 20 minutes and there were still 10 people in front of me.  The line had barely moved in 20 minutes!. . What the heck?  Maybe all of the different hot dogs are too complicated to remember and the employees have to learn the recipe before making each one.  I don't see how else it could take 3 people 20 minutes to make 5 hot dogs.  Anyway, I got frustrated and left.  . . The one time I made it to the front of the line, I ordered some sort of hotdog with pastrami.  It was good but it wasn't good enough to justify the 1 hour wait on a Tuesday night.  . . If you want a good hotdog, try a bacon wrapped hotdog on little carts that you can find all around town.
