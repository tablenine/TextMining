Restaurant: Mr. Pizza
Category: Pizza
It's always nice to try an authentically Korean restaurant that doesn't serve, well, authentic Korean. Mr Pizza Factory is at once very familiar and very strange, especially for non-Koreatowners. The menu offers a nice mix of traditional pasta and pizza as well as a few bizarre variatioins that you just have to try. The bulgogi and gold potato pineapple were both interesting and fun to eat. The service is very efficient and the lonely salad bar reminds you that you're still in a fairly typical cheap pizza joint (though it is not inexpensive).. . Fun for curious outsiders... not much to return for.
