Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
There was a time when I thought Morton's was the best steakhouse. But that was BM - Before Mastro's. The steaks are like buttah - just melts in your mouth! It's almost like eating Kobe beef, but cheaper!!. . We started off with the seafood tower and even though it was this that broke the bank, it was well worth it. Everything was fresh and delicious, especially the sweet succulent lobster (I'm a sucker for lobster). . . Next, I had the petite filet and the bf had the bone in rib-eye. We also got creamed spinach and lobster mash. THE LOBSTER MASH IS TO DIE FOR! The only other place I've had good lobster mash was at Asia de Cuba. . . We finished off our meal with yummy key lime pie. FAT ASS STATUS, seriously.. . SO in summary,. 1. Mastro's. 2. CUT. 3. Morton's. 4. Dal Rae. 5. Fleming's. 6. Ruth Chris
