Went there with a party of seven when my boyfriend's dad and business partner were in town and it was so wonderful! . I wish I would have gotten his name, but our server was one of the best I have ever had! And we kept him busy, not only with a lot of food but tons of drinks and lots of tequila flights that we needed his input on which one to choose each time.. I wasn't that hungry so filled up in the most wonderful and fresh guacamole made to Â your liking table side and a salad with mango, jicama and a pumpkin seed dressing that was delicious. Not sure what everyone else ordered - but almost everyone cleaned their plates.. The desserts looked spectacular and definitely was to try them next time.. do i recommend? 100%. great food, great atmosphere, great service. nice job adobo!
