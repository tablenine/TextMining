Restaurant: FLIP Burger Boutique
Category: Burgers
So I've been to Flip twice now and both times I was pretty blown away with my experience, but by different things each time.  I am a fan of Top Chef and was rooting hard for chef Richard Blais all through the season since he was our hometown boy repping the A.  I am a big burger fan and I was excited to hear about Blais opening up this burger boutique.  I finally made it over there with my Dad on our way back from the Masters and I was treated to some things that I don't usually like flipped in a way that had me hungry for more!  I generally am not a fan of mayonnaise or ketchup, but the homemade romesco ketchup and smoked mayo were outstanding, especially the mayo.  I was dipping my fries in it it was so good.  The fries were fresh cut and really good, as they should have been for $3 a la carte.  The first time I was there I went with the Tartare Burger and it was crazy good.  I love beef tartare and this thing was just perfect.  So perfect I even ate it with the little pickled onions and I hate onions normally.  The second time I went I had the Southern Burger (country fried burger - yep, you read that right -, pimiento cheese &amp; green tomato ketchup) which was also very good, but the Tartare Burger is still the standout for me so far.  We also tries the Krispy Kreme milkshake (made with liquid nitrogen for weirdness) and that thing was about what you would expect liquid doughnuts to taste like.  Overall, a great experience and my girlfriend proclaimed the Bacon Cheeseburger she got as the best burger she'd ever had so you gotta love when the food makes the lady happy, that's for sure.  The decor is really cool and the food matches the environment, both in taste and presentation.  Although everything is a la carte, the prices are reasonable as well.  I've got no complaints so far!
