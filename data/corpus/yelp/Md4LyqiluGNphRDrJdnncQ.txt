Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
I'll start off by saying I like Dunlays on the Square a hell of a lot better than the Clark location, even though it's considerably closer to my house. The waitresses seem to have sticks up their asses over there.. . If I'm doing breakfast, I always get a goat cheese and spinach omelette with an english muffin and those DELICIOUS hash browns! Seriously, what do they put in there?? They're creamy and awesome! I've brought friends/family here who think they're a little too fancy for breakfast potatoes, but all I want to do is order them as a main dish. Maybe next time... . . Other yummy items include their margherita pizza, burgers (used to be $4 on Wed, not sure if they still do that) and their blackened fish sandwich. The service is hit or miss, but there is one particular waitress with strawberry blonde(ish) hair who is always super friendly and attentive. When I Â said my fish was "too spicy" one day she happily brought me a new one and I don't think she even spit on it. . . The inside can be a bit dark and gloomy especially if you visit during the day, but if you're lucky enough to get a seat outside you can watch all the stupid hipsters and characters that walk by.
