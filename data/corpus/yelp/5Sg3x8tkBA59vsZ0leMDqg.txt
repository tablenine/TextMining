LA Times Review 7-1-2009: Irene only gives them 1.5 stars, however, the text of her article is very positive, and clearly she visited this place 3-4 times to give as much color as possible on different dishes. . . Irene is a harsh reviewer! I still cringe at her Fig (Santa Monica) Review at only 2.5 stars.. . Bottega Louie's is a wonderful spot and has a great ambiance. I maintain the 4 star rating, and appreciate the LA times "effort".
