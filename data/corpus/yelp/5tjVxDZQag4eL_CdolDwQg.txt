oh canter's you thought you could escape the reviewing clutches of the franmeister, didn't you? well no!. . i don't get you. i don't particularly think is an east coast slash cultural thing. are you trying to achieve the rudeness of a new yorker? cause you certainly do succed at it let me tell you. how about vying to tip the price per goodness ratio in your favor? you certainly achieve that as well.. . your food isn't good. it has no soul. your place is crappy looking. no ambiance whatsoever. your prices are too high and frankly, your pickles aren't all that good.. . so there, i said it. get over yourself. your only saving grace is that you're open late and my taste buds are numb as my defenses are down when i visit, so i am able to eat anything you serve and withstand the crappy service you provide.
