My mouth waters every time I think back to my meal at Sushi Gen about a week ago.   Everything was fresh and tasty!  Even though this place is pricey, you do get what you pay for.  We had maybe a dozen or so orders (I lost count after the 5th one though!), sake, and tea and the bill came out to be about $150 before tip.  The monkfish liver was esp memorable!  If you can, try to get a seat at the bar.  I like telling the sushi chef directly what I want.  I also like to leave some orders up to him.   As others mentioned, be prepared to wait!  When we left around 9pm on a weeknight, there were still tons of people outside waiting!  This place truly lives up to the hype.  I'll definitely be back.
