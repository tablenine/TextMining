Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
Fact: NY Chinese food is better than DC area Chinese food.  Even pizza in NYC somehow tastes better.  I don't know the scientific explanation for this.  It be what it be.. . But I must say, Great NY Noodle Town is... just okay.  It wouldn't rank as one of my favorite NY Chinatown picks.  I'm thinking that the somewhat high rating it has received from many Yelpers is a bit off.  Okay, no, it's way off.. . The food I've had here can fill your tummy and stave off the hunger monster.  I mean that it's edible enough.  But it's also a bit bland.  A couple of times, my wonton soup has been almost room temperature (lukewarm?).  The service is fairly fast, though.  And when you're out with a big group late at night, they accomodate people quickly.  Some of my NYC friends frequent this place and sometimes order off the menu, which is kinda cool.  And I'll go with them here again, because I don't have the heart to tell them that it's not that good.
