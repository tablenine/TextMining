Restaurant: Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries
Category: Burgers
"Regular or Little... What the hell does that mean?" That's what went through my head the first time I went to Five Guys.... . Luckily for me, I ordered the "Regular". That's 2x patties, and 2x the fun. I have since learned that the "Little" can be useful too though when you're not looking to stuff your face full of goodness. Heh.. . The idea that you get to customize your burger, without feeling guilty about holding others up (aka McDonalds, etc.) is a thing of beauty. It's not "fast" food, but it ain't slow either. It's that fine line that they operate under which makes it a welcome addition to those looking for red meat. With a slew of topping options, and tasty fries (done in peanut oil), this place is a hit.. . BTW, the only "bad" experience I had here was when my order was first lost, screwed up, screwed up again, and then finally done. They were extremely apologetic though and rewarded our patience with a gift card.
