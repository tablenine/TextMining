Restaurant: Nan Thai Fine Dining
Category: Thai
I guess the name of the restaurant says it all.  Nan is a pretty fancy pants type of Thai restaurant.  I went there for dinner with some co-workers.  We shared a fried calamari dish for an appetizer and my entree was duck.  I like eating Thai duck.  Duck simmered in curry with pineapple tomatoes, and basil.  That sounds real good.  I have to say this is a pretty cool place but its not my style.  Its too ritzy for me.  I don't feel right eating at Nam with my shorts and sandals.
