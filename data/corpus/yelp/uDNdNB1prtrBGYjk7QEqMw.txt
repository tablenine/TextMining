Mediocre, at best.  I have friends who love this place, so occasionally I have to go on some occasion (birthday, anniversary, breakup, etc.) for which I cannot make up an excuse to get out of it. It's just not my thing.. . I've always found the staff to be insanely unhelpful, the food overpriced and uninteresting, and I'm always highly suspicious of restaurants that serve "cross genre." You're a Cuban place or a Mexican place - pick one and stick to it.  Anyway, I've just never been impressed with anything in this place.  Also, it's loud in a bad way - shrieking Trixies getting hammered on Mojitos and flashing their engagement rings.  Not my crowd so much, I'll leave it to them gladly.. . Me, I'll head to Cafe Bolero or Panchos.  Much cheaper, muy  tastier, more comfortable, and both have far friendlier staffs that care about patrons having a pleasant experience.
