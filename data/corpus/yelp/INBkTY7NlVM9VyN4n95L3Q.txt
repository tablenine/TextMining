Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini

I really liked this restaurant. . I got one of the specials which was a Steak hahaha VERY GOOD. . . The Wine selection was good too and we ended up getting a bottle of white and a bottle of red wine. . . I also tried some of my friend's pasta and that was good too! I would have finished his plate too if I wasn't too full from my yummy steak. . . The ambiance is nice. Perfect place of a romantic dinner I think. . . The waiter was very attentive and happy to give us suggestions on wines and the food. . . I would definitely go there again for a friend's gathering or a date!. . Next time, I will probably want to try the mediterranean dishes instead of the italian ones.
