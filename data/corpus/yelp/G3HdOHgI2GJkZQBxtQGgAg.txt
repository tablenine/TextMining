Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Must visit! My husband and I were staying at a hotel downtown (going to show at LA Live that evening) and we were wandering around for some lunch. We used Yelp (of course) but the restaurant we were looking for didn't exist? But we stumbled on Bottega Louie and what a find! When you walk in, there's tempting and delicious desserts in their bakery and near the back is a little market that sells jams, breads, etc. Most of the Bottega is a sit down restaurant with very friend service. The whole space is white - white walls and very very high ceilings. It gives off an elegant feel and it's so spacious. Most of their menu is breakfast food (the best!) and I ordered their egg sandwich and my husband had breakfast plate. Delicious!! Their desserts are to yummy as well. The best part was all the pricing was very reasonable - a lot cheaper than what we're used to paying when we dine out. Next time we're in the downtown area, we will definitely be stopping back here.
