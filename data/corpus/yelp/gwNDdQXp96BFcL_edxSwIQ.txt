Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
The original Portos. I grew up going here. I cant complain about one thing. Their food and service is to amazing and prompt. Prices have always been reasonable as well. The lines here are shorter than those at the newer Burbank location. . . Reccommendation: Ropa Vieja sandwich with banana chips and the Potato Balls. . Stay away from: Iced coffees. Not tasty.
