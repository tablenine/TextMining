Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This review is based solely on service. I went to Tank to use my Groupon and basically was turned away because it was so crowded. The host was beyond rude to us, saying we "should have used it sooner" and said that we wouldn't get in until 11 p.m. (it was 7 when I arrived). Yes, the Groupon expired that day, but I called earlier to see if the bar was reserved and was told no, then I arrive and the bar has been reserved until 10 p.m. When I mentioned my call earlier, the host snapped "I said it's reserved" and then dramatically flipped through all the names he had and was rude to people on the phone.. . The interior is very cute and modern/sleek and I've heard good things about the food, but after that service, I don't know if I'll be rushing back, except to recommend better hosts.
