Restaurant: Noche
Category: Tapas Bars
As far as tapas bars go, they were pretty good.  The staff is very friendly and helpful about accomodating vegan requests.  The menu has good variety.  The mood inside is a little strange for me.  It's mellow but, too dark and their selection of music is... hmm. Also the entrance is a little confusing when you go the first time, as it is combined with other shops adjoining Noche.  Otherwise, it's some where I wouldn't mind going again say.. before/after a semi-casual event.
