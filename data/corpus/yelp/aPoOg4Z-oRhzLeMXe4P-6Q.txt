This place is amazing. My co-worker and I both had fresh oysters and rib-eye steaks. One of the best rib-eyes I've had to date. The food is not only what makes this place outstanding, the service is phenomenal. . . It was our server's first night on the floor and he was amazing. I went to the restroom and he waited until I returned to pour my glass of water. The plates were cleared promptly and drinks were refilled before the glasses hit the table. We shared 2 different deserts, a red wine reduced cherry stuffed ice scream and a chocolate sphere impregnated with salted caramel and pretzel crumbs. Both were under priced and ridiculously good. If I'm ever back in Atlanta I'm definitely making another trip to Canoe.
