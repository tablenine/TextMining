French dip sandwiches - beef, lamb, turkey, pork - I had the turkey and some navy bean/spinach soup. It was a savory meal that gave me energy for the rest of the day! Cool old school environment and you can get a glass of very nice wine if you'd like with your french dip. It's an LA institution - check it out next time you get a chance!
