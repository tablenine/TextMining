Edited 12/4/2009. I went back to Yamato's after many months and the quality of both the service and the food has dropped drastically! I'm afraid I will have to downgrade it from 4 to 2 stars. The happy hour is nice, but if it's not even worth going to, why bother? I guess I also went for lunch on 2/3/2009, and dinner this time.. . 2/3/2009. Fantastic deal, and in my experience the best sushi in Westwood. I've been there for dinner before, but today I found a lunch gem.. . I got the 3-item combo, and chose salmon teriyaki, 9pc sashimi, and 6pc sushi. It also came with miso soup, salad, and 3 small sides (edamame, cucumber, fruits). It was a veritable feast, and was only fifteen dollars!. . Of course you can choose from a list of 10 items or so, but I definitely recommend the sashimi at least, it was very refreshing.. . Also, I'd not noticed the giant Darth Maul that greets you at the front... very Japanese-fusion... I think?
