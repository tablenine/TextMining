Damn, 1000+ reviews?  That should say something right there.  I'm not going to say anything that others haven't said...but I'm still going to write a review because I love this place!. . So yeah, get a reservation, first off.  I hate planning for anything months ahead of time (displaced marriage phobia, maybe?), since I don't know if I'll be craving gourmet pizza on the third Saturday of next month.  Anyway, I try to call a week ahead and actually don't mind the 10 p.m. reservations - I love late dinners (although this place is so good that I won't hold it against anyone for taking the 5:00 p.m. slots!).. . The crispy goat cheese with lentils is weirdly addictive.  They don't drown the cheese with the lentils.  Believe me, lentils + cheese works!  I went with my vegetarian cousin and he got the fried squash blossoms, which I was initially wary of because I think of TGI Friday's when I hear the word "fried" and "blossoms."  They were quite tasty and not too oily.. . As for the pizza, I got the goat cheese/scallions/garlic/bacon deal because, as you've noticed, I love me some goat cheese.  And garlic.  And bacon.  Seriously, whoever thought of these combos must have spent a minute in my subconscious.. . The butterscotch budino is pretty amazing, too.  My butterscotch cousin suggested sharing and quickly decided against it after I gave him my "oh hell no!" face.  Pleezebelieve he got his own.. . Service at a place like this can be stereotypically LA but I was surprised - our waiter was very friendly and didn't give off pizza nazi vibes at all!
