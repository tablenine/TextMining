Best tacos and burritos I've ever had!. . I can't get enough of the tofu tacos/burritos. My red meat loving boyfriend gets the tofu every once in a while. He really loves the short rib burrito though.  Everything comes together so perfectly. . . Come on people, the lines aren't even bad. Bring a few friends or meet some friendly folks in line, bring chairs or a cooler, bring blankets or a fan... either way, time flies!. I can't complain about the prices either. This isn't any average truck you find at the DMV, this is gormet food. Only $5 for a HUGE burrito and  $2 for street size tacos. . . You can either check out their website or follow them on twitter for locations. Following them allows you to get up to date info.  Their blogs are fun to read too. Come out to a stop. You will leave filled up and wanting more!
