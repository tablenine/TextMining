Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
First things first--they charge for tap water.  The food isn't cheap, and they make good money.  Their food is really salty, so you'd think they would care for their customers and give their tap water for free.. . I have such mixed feelings for this place.  It is really good tasting (especially they're whole-shebang seasoning) and I love crab.  However, it is expensive.  And sometimes my lips swell and get tingly.  I'm not allergic to seafood, but sometimes (probably because of toxins in shellfish) I get a minor reaction at this restaurant.. . But the food tastes great.  I love drenching the corn in the sauce.  Yum
