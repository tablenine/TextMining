Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
An interesting place.. You stand in line to order, and once you do, then you find your seating at small round tables that have various pictures of the world or areas of the world carved into them... sandwiches are the regular specialty, but the breakfast isn't bad, either. . . At breakfast, had the Grey Dog special - French Toast (or pancakes or something else) w/ Bacon (they couldn't sub in ham, only sausage or chicken apple dumplings), and a side of ham (grilled sliced ham).. . The dish itself was unremarkable - eggs over easy to the side, crunchy small slices of bacon. But the fried onions were good - so long as they were hot. A bit pricey for breakfast, though, in my opinion. No big tables, so big groups can forget abou this place. Also not easy to maneuver in.
