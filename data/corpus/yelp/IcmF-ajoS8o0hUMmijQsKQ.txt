Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I've long heard of this restaurant, which is probably more known for the glitz and glamour than the food itself. So upon going for my first time I had low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. . . First off the space itself is gorgeous with all the mood lighting and Japanese influenced art everywhere the eye could see. It did feel a bit clubbish, but I think when you pick a place like Geisha House to go eat, you go well knowing the type of environment you're going to encounter. Having an overabundance of attractive women in dresses didn't hurt either, but hey it is Hollywood.. . The food was a mix of a Japanese fusion, which I'd have to say is quite overdone, but sharing the food family style and getting a taste of everything from the sushi to the lamb was quite decent. The rock shrimp tempura from Morimoto fame also wasn't bad, but different than I'm used to. Although I wouldn't recommend Geisha House to a foodie, I'd definitely tell anyone who wants to drink and eat in a decent and busy atmosphere to try this place out.
