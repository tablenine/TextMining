Mmh...mmh...mmh.. . Thank god for whoever it was that woke up one morning and decided to combine breakfast with their dinner from last night. Could food get any more delicious? I think not.. . Their waffles are awesome. I have had better Fried Chicken before, but their is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, crispy and delicious. I personally like to dip my Fried Chicken in the Louisiana Hot Sauce and I usually get the Herb's Special #2 and split it with whoever is with me. . . Continuing with their theme of combining things to great affect, their eclipse, a drink combining Orange Juice, Fruit Punch and Lemonade, is incredible.. . Did I mention that this place is probably the most reasonably priced popular restaurant you will ever go to? Well, it is. . . The best Fried Chicken you will have in the middle of the night, I guarentee it. . . Go, eat, fall in love, take a nap in your car, and drive home safely.
