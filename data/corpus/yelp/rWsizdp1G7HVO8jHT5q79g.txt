Restaurant: Lula&#39;s Sweet Apothecary
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Holy crap.  Fatty totally died and went to heaven.  Candy and ice cream and ice cream in my candy?!?  Shut up, smug omnivores with your Pinkberry and ice cream trucks.  Lula's is one giant point for team vegan.. . I've been in a few times and haven't had anything that wasn't delicious.  The staff is super awesome and nice and will give you samples of flavors.  Stuff wasn't marked for allergens and I'm an irresponsibile idiot who forgot to ask - luckily we were chatting and the truth came out before my ice cream went in my mouth.  They made me a new one - no charge - even though it was my fault.  How's that for customer service?. . I can't wait for the weather to get warm.  Lula's is gonna be a highlight of my summer.
