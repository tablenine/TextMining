Restaurant: Cakes &amp; Ale
Category: American (New)
This was our first and most likely our last experience at Cakes and Ale.  The menu seemed creative with it's hard to pronounce entrees and limited options.  Everything was presented super nice but the teeny tiny coke wasn't exactly the perfect fit for the hubbie.  The prices are a little steep but we knew that going in.  Luckily they had a veggie option for me.. . What one of ordered was quite gross so I let the waiter know and he felt bad, offered to buy us dessert, but we don't really eat much dessert. However he did give us some complimentary Phatty Cakes and they were awesome.. . So food not so good and too salty; prices too high for what they offer in my opinion; atmosphere is very nice, good for a first date; staff was nice and attentive so they get their own 5 stars.. . Perhaps this nights menu wasn't for us as it changes frequently.
