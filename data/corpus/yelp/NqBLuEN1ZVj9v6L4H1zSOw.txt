I'm flabbergasted by the complacent reviews of the food at this place.  While it is admittedly charming and nicely decorated and welcoming, as far as cafes go, the food is roundly horrible.  I've never witnessed such a gross disparity between what I'm imagining (as per the list of ingredients posted on the chalk board menu) and what I receive.  what I imagined, which is what you would imagine, too, because it was written: chicken parmesan panini, with grilled chicken, fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, and provolone cheese.  what I got: two pieces of stale focaccia, which attempted to conceal an orange **goo** flecked with barely visible specks of chicken, all topped off with day old slices of mealy tomato, no cheese.  In fact, at $8.95 for a slice of this, er, "panini," I sent this baby back.  I think I've sent back items at restaurants about twice in my life--once when I ordered a sunomono salad and it came with baby octopi instead of cucumber (probably someone else's dream dish, but not mine) and this time.  I just couldn't justify spending that amount of money on food that was so disdainfully, ungraciously prepared.  I chose a salad as a recompense, and it was fine, standard cafe fare--if a little wilted and slimy.  . . That said, their coffee and tea selections are wonderful, and when they have it, their lavender and chocolate chip shortbreads are nice accompaniments.  . . But beware the food!!!!
