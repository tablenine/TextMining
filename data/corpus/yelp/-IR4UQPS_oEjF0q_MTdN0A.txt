Reasonably priced fresh food with a ton of flavor! I came here for lunch and did not know what to expect. The menu is limited offering steak, chicken or ahi tuna as a sandwhich or hot plate. I had the ahi tuna as a sandwhich with the spinach salad with hazelnuts. It was yummy! It's a really cute quaint cafe that is great to sit down and people watch in.
