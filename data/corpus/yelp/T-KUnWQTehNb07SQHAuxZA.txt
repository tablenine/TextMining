Just home for our first visit to Oinkster, per the Guy Fieri recommendation. OMG! The Oinkster Pastrami . with Gruyere cheese, caramelized onion and red cabbage slaw was to DIE for - by far the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had - and I have done the NYC deli circuit, believe me! The pulled pork sandwich was a dry smoked sandwich - not my favorite preparation - wished I had some good BBQ sauce to slather over it! We went at 3pm on a Sunday and had about a 30 minute wait from first getting in line to the service. The staff were enthusiastic and helpful and proud of the product - as they should be!
