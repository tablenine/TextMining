ELVIS LIVES!! anyone that has been here will know what i am talking about. i love this place, however i hate the parking lot and the valet! i usually hate letting people drive my car unless i really trust them..other than that the foo is delicious. . . My usual order would consist of: . Thai beef salad . tum yum soup . Curry duck . . i have to say they have some really well made curry duck which is my favorite item there and it is a must have!
