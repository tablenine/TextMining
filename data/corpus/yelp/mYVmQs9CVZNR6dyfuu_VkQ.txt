Restaurant: Geisha House

I've eaten at Geisha House twice.  I was unimpressed the first time, but enjoyed the Shishito Peppers so much that I decided to give them a second chance.  My second visit was the clincher... no matter how good those peppers are, I'm not going back to Geisha House.. . The sushi is among the most flavorless sushi I've ever eaten anywhere.  There was so much rice in the rolls that you barely tasted the fish.  Even the Red Samurai roll ($16), which was highly recommended by our waitress, had almost no flavor aside from a hint of spice.  One dish that was particularly disappointing was the "Pacific Tuna with Crispy White Onions - Lonnie's Favorite ($14)"  The description sounded intriguing, however when it arrives you discover that you've got slices of tuna covered by greasy fried onions and fried noodles.  The tuna might have actually been good on its own, but the preparation kills it.. . We ordered 2 beers, and not really all that much food, but it came out to $85 for two people.  What a waste.  I wish I had eaten at Taka Sushi instead.  Oh well, I won't be making that mistake again.
