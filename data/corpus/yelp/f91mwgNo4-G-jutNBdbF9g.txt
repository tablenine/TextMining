The food and the ambiance are excellent here.  The desserts are clearly the best thing here, but I think the breakfast fare and the salads are also fulfilling.  It's a wonderful place to sit on linger on a lazy weekend as most of the seating is outside.  It can kind of be a scene, but not in the fake boob and velour kind of way, so I can get past that.  Parking is a biotch and the lines can be long, but don't let that deter you.
