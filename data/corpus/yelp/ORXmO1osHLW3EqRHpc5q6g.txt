I heart kogi.  I do not heart kogi lines.. . When there is little to no line, this is totally worth it.  when there's a long line, don't even bother.. . The spicy pork tacos are amazing and I skarf them down really fast.  Tacos are definitely better than the burritos.. . The sliders are great as well and I highly recommend my new favorite, the Black Jack Quesadilla.  It's a $7 quesadilla that totally fills you up.
