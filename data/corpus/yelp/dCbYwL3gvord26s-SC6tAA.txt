Great place. Creepy Star Wars doll right behind the front desk. Nevertheless, it's one of my favorite places to get sushi in Westwood. The food is good and service is usually very prompt. There's a lot of room in this place, and it's never taken more than 15 minutes or so for me and three other people to get seated on a busy night. . . I've only been to this place during happy hour, so I don't really know what the crowd is like before 5pm. This place does tend to get crowded around 7 or 8pm, so if you're planning to go around then you should make a reservation. Try some of the appetizers also -- especially the Rock and Roll Shrimp. If you tend to order a lot, one trick I learned to reduce the bill is order a bunch of appetizers and one or two rolls at the most. You're still full and it's much cheaper than ordering a bunch of rolls.
