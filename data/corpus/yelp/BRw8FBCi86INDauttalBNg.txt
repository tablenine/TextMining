This place is open late. Great tasting food. Great setting to bring a date to. Everything is mouthwatering-ly delicious! Last time I was there I got the the Pink Pescatore. Oh man was it delicious! I am a pasta nut and I couldn't decide what to get, but I truly made a great choice. The pasta was so good that even though I was stuffed, I wanted to eat more and finish the whole plate! . . The prices are fair and the portions are really good. This place is really worth it. Can bring a date or just go after a club, they're open late. Check out the menu...
