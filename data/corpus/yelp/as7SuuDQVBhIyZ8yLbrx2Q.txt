Restaurant: Wow Bao
Category: Chinese
I love Wow Bao!  I used to come here back when I worked around here, after they first opened.  Usualy I go to the ones in the loop, but the other day I was doing some shopping and got hungry. . .  Didn't want a bao but I was happy to see that here you can get nappa cabbage in your bowl instead of rice!  I got that with teriyaki chicken and it was super-delicious.  I just wish that the other locations offered this option as well.
