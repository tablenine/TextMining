Restaurant: P&#39;cheen
Category: American (New)
I've been a fan of this place for quite a while - it's really one of those "can do no wrong" establishments. What really sets P'Cheen apart is the personal touches - Kieran and Alex are constantly working the room, making sure everyone's happy, and fixing it when they aren't. I have had the occasional service flub, but every time I've been more than made whole.. . The only complaint I'll put out there is that there really isn't much here for folks who are dieting - I realize this is something of a nitpick, but we'd definitely be here more often if there was something my wife could order without feeling like she has to fast for the rest of the week to compensate.. . That said, the dishes are excellent and of consistent quality - I'm personally a huge fan of their Steak Frites and the Fish n' Chips, as well as the cheese plate, the homemade pickles, as well as their rotating beer specials - there's an unfiltered cider from France they occasionally stock, and if they do, don't let the opportunity pass!
