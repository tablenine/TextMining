Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
I went to Lola's induced by the fact that it had an extensive martini menu. There were many flavors that sounded delicious, but overall, the martinis were just ok.  I had both the apple and pear martini, and tasted my sister's Lola Martini.   Although I liked the fresh fruit, I found each martini a bit sugary and non-extraordinary.  . However, the food was delicious!  I had the parmesan crusted halibut which was fantastic.  I also tasted the ravioli, the grilled scallops, and short ribs and all were great.  A great ending was the cholocate bread pudding, yummy.
