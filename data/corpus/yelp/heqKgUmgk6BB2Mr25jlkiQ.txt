As good as it gets. I'm not a big pastrami type of guy but a friend and yelp community convinced me to give this place a shit. Upon walking in, it reminded me of an old school diner. Everything was old school about it including our super friendly and helpful waitress. She looks like she is in her late 60s but provided superb service that would make these young 20 something waiters/waitresses look like fools. . . Now the food, lets talk about the food shall we? Ordered 19. First bite makes your eyes open to all the yummyness this sandwich possesses. Bite number 2 and so on you are entered in a state of what they call, ecstasy. Although not a big fan of cole slaw, this thing compliments the meat so well along with the bread. Bite after bite it taste that much better. What are you waiting for? Get in the car and head to Langers and prepared to get your taste buds tantalized.
