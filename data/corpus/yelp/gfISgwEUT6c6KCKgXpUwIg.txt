Although I have not been to the brunch...I thought the place was great!. . I am not familiar with Logan Square at all. I just drove there and walked around to find a place to eat. When we initially sat down, I was a little shocked at the price. It's not too too expensive but everything is between $10 and $20. We thought about leaving, then changed our minds and ordered cheap.. . I was surprised at how good the food was. I had a tilapia sandwich with delicious mashed potatoes and my boyfriend ordered some pizza with goat cheese, artichokes, and onions. It was sooooooooo good! I mean really good. Our bill was about $20 and it was worth it. I would totally go back, especially with all the good reviews about brunch.
