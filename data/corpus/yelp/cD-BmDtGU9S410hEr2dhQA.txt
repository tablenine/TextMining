Restaurant: Wurstk√ºche
Category: Hot Dogs
I've been to Wurstkuche for several times.. Thursday and Friday nights are always packed. Last night My friends and I couldn't find seats so we decided to go to Zip fusion sushi which is across from Wurstkuche.( I will write review about Zip Fusion later). We went back later, and we were able to sit down and enjoy the sweet flores apple ale.It's so good!. . My favorites are. Hot dog: Classic Bratwurst or Rattlesnake&amp;Rabitt with jalapeno peppers. Fries: Blue cheese with walnut and bacon. Beer: Floris Apple Ale
