Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Penny's is one of those places that always delivers dependably okay food. Â I have probably tried more than half of the dishes on their menu in the few years that I've been coming here and most of them are reasonably priced and reasonably good. There are a few gems on the menu though. Their sea weed salad ($5.25) is super tasty, the Tom Kha Kai soup ($2.75) is rich and delicious, and the Red Curry ($6.40) is actually quite good (especially if you had some hot sauce). I'd stay away from the crab rangoon (there is just something off about them) and the noodle bowls (most of them are just sorta bleh). . . While there is definitely better Thai food in Chicago, I'm not sure if anyone does it FASTER. Seriously. Their take out is like lightening. They have it done in MINUTES. I live around the corner, so that works out really well for me. But, if you live farther away and want to avoid having to reheat your food, I would recommend waiting to place your order until your a few blocks away or have arrived at the restaurant. . . I would probably only give this place 2.5 stars, but since they have such fast take out I'm rounding up to 3.
