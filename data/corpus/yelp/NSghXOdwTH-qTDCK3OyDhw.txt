There was a time when I probably ate more meals here than in my own apartment.  I haven't gone there as much lately, which means I only eat there now about once a week.  . . Back when Fred Eric ran the joint, the place seemed a bit cooler.  Now it seems they're trying a bit too hard with their wacky T-shirts that say things like "Lesbians Eat Out" and "Rehab is for Quitters" on the back.  . . Favorite thing on the menu you ask?  I'll say the Chicken Pot Pie, which is massive and fattening and covered in some kind of green sauce.  For breakfast, I usually get the New Amsterdam with Cheese or the Dime Bag.   Great onion rings and if your heart is in good enough condition, you should try the Mac and Cheese.
