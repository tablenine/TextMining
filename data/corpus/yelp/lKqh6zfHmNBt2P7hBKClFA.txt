Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Yay, four starts for the Boiling Crab in Alhambra. I ordered shrimp in a bag and the taste was sooo good that I want to visit again so many times. Cajun fries was also superb. I ordered the mild one since I was not sure if I could take the spiciness of some of the sauces and other meals.. . This place is no-frill dining place. People should be ready to come and get dirty because most of the guests eat with their hands. The staff members were friendly and attentive.. . However, be prepared for the wait. I suggest to go there before the peak hours.
