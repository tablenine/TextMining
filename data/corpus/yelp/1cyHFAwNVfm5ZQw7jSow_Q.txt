We had been meaning to go all throughout summer for the ridiculous Ketel One special, but never made it. Turns out, they always have some silly-but-awesome kind of special and that I can totally dig. I think recession specials are currently on the table? . . So yeah there's all this great Mediterranean that is well described in all the other reviews. I'll focus on the desert. We split the Brownie-something-or-other, name I don't remember because all I remember was it being the equivalent of like a brownie Big Mac. Ice Cream in the center, Â swimming in a small sea of white chocolate sauce. Which can be fun if you're sharing with someone who doesn't like white chocolate. Like Big-Mac-Brownie-Jenga or something. . . By the way, speaking of splitting, I'm always a fan of places that split the food between separate plates for you. Good show, Zaya's.
