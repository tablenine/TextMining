Huge burgers with a basket of fries...who could pass it up? ! I loved this place, then had one bad burger experience...but have since returned with no issues.  I definitely recommend the plate o' rings to share with a friend.  The sangria is awesome (I can't rate the beer since I am not a beer gal!).  It is a dark hideaway for couples or groups inside and a large garden area to eat outside (when in season).  Just remember that is cash only, though they have an ATM inside in case you forget ;)  Also, keep in mind if you can't walk to the location in the neighborhood, that the meters in front charge by the quarter-hour.  It is not as risky with the payboxes these days though, you can charge two hours on your card and go inside with a clear mind to enjoy the evening.
