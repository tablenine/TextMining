I've gone here numerous times and everytime I leave very satisfied. However, despite the amazing food, the wait is what gets me the most. I once waited for over an hour with a party of 4 on a Saturday night. . . Holy Moly.. . We were hungry enough to go kill and eat some wild racoons in the alley. Thankfully, they called us just in time. But remember to be prepared for a wait.. . Anyways, staff is super friendly and the food is just awesome. If you live in Los Angeles, you should definitely try Daikokuya! ;)
