been eating here since i was a toddler and can honestly say they have the best french dipped sandwiches period. i've tried pretty much everything and as long as you order the right thing you'll be giving this place 5 stars too. i suggest that you always take a person with you so you can both order different sandwiches and then switch halves and see which sandwich you favor. my mom's favorite is the lamb and mine is the pork. since i'm big lamb eater it's great that i can can exchange have of my pork for half of her lamb. in recent years i started ordering swiss cheese on the pork, makes it even better. the beef is really good and probably the safest choice if it's your first time or you're a picky eater with a boring pallet; plus the beef is their signature sandwich. the turkey is actually really good too, which surprised me because i thought it was ludicrous ordering a turkey sandwich at philippe's. the ham is gross and unlike the other dipped sandwiches is cold meat on french dipped bread. making this way was odd. the tuna is the worst tuna i've ever had in my life and i don't really care for the side salads but if i had to pick one i would go with the potato. the chili is good if you don't mind greasy and get a pickle as their pickles compliment your meal well. one pickle is probably good for 3 or 4 people as they just slice one into spears for you. . . you can't beat their lemonade, iced tea, and coffee that's just a few cents a glass. . . breakfast is pretty standard and nothing to write home about but i'm glad to say i finally tried it after many years of wanting to try it. . . this place is a los angeles staple for a reason.
