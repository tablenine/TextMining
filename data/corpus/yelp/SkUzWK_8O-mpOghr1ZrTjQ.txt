Very long wait, very flavorful crab........i love eatting at this place, it is messy, however they give you a whole roll of paper towels. The snow crab leggs, craw-fish, french fries are my usual orders. . . The service was ok, could be better....maybe it's because they are trying to avoid our stinky breathes
