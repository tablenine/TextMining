Warm and inviting atmosphere. Pizzas are gourmet and delicious, if a little overpriced. Good specials during the week include half-priced bottles on Monday and buy one get one pizzas on Wednesday. For one couple, going for dinner, I would recommend splitting a salad and a pizza. . . Not a great place to watch a game, as the TVs are limited.
