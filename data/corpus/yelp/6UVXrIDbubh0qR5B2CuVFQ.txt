When you first walk in, you might be a little scared! The atmosphere is great. The food is amazing. I recommend a burger (their signature item) and the Tater-Tots and Queso as an appetizer.. . This is a great place to go with a group and just hangout. They have a great full bar with lots of beer choices. Also you could spend hour inside this place looking at all the trinkets they have on the walls.
