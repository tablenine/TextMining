I heard the wait for this place can take a while, but we were seated within 10 minutes on a Sunday, early evening.  The food reminded me of the Guppy House in Cerritos but not as good, although I did like their Taiwanese Sausage, which is somewhat sweet.  I ordered the pork chop noodle soup w/ vermicelli -- the pork chop tasted like the kind I've had at a lot of Chinese cafes.  Nothing special.  My friend had the won ton soup, which was also average.  We also got the fried flour pancakes, which were light and crisp.  The food is pretty inexpensive...about $6-7 per dish.
