Ok Seriously with all the awesome reviews i thought Yelp couldn't let me down... i was wrong, This place was garbage i cant beleive how over rated Daikokuya is. My GF and i both had the Daikokuya-Ramen and Gyoza now I've eaten at some good Ramen places in my day Shin Sen Gumi, MoMoFoku NY, Santouka Ramen, Ajisen Ramen any of these places Blows Daikokuya out of the water. Lets get to the hart of the problem the noodles were under cooked and almost Top-Ramen Esque there was only 3 small pieces of pork, the soup base was bland and under seasoned &amp; my hard boiled egg was liquid in the middle, oh yah the Gyoza was over fried on one side and doughy on the other. They have bad service a long wait and no air conditioning so on a 90 something day its not that fun being in a place where they cook right in front of you. I'm basicly giving Daikokuya 2 stars because it was food and I didn't vomit.
