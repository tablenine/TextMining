Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
Lives up to the hype and then some. When the place is full of people, the Richard Meier office cafeteria design somehow works. Except for the artwork. Really bad. The crowd can skew towards trashy, showy new money folks who drive Bentleys and live in McMansions complete with corinthian columns and flat roofs, but this is Beverly Hills, after all.. The hosts were pretty nice (you did, however, get the feeling they could turn on you). The service was impeccable but down-to-earth and friendly. Unfortunately, some other diners were not and were extremely rude to the servers. Our waiter in particular was quite abused and later thanked us for being nice. We didn't yell at him, so I guess that qualifies.. The steaks were fab. Side dishes, too. The desserts were less strong, but good. All in all, a terrific meal. I was with someone who isn't a steak lover and they said it was the best one they've ever had. . Mr. Puck wasn't there the night we were, nor were any big stars. But everyone's head whips around to check out who the new diners are. There are only two not-fantastic tables, right by the entrance, and both seat four. The rest of the seats are great. And when it's just two of you, that's not always the case. (For instance, Osteria Mozza).. I'd highly recommend Cut for a special occasion and if you love steak. Not always a Wolfgang Puck fan (what's with those canned soups? They suck), but he gets kudos for his latest restaurant.
