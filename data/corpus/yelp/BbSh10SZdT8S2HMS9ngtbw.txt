Category: Coffee & Tea
Logan Square has a new trademark, and I'm not speaking of the Eagle-dominated Marble Doric Column but the New Wave Coffeehouse.  You can find all the quirks and qualities of the neighborhood in one visit (even though you're bound to find yourself wanting to return): Hip ~ Vintage ~ Culturally Diverse ~ Urban ~ Artsy ~ Friendly ~ Colorful ~ Comfy.  NW seems to always be busy, especially on a weekend day.  Don't be turned away by the lines at the cash register, just hum Finding Nemo's tune "Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming" and the currents will move you along.  Although they have tons of tables, couches and antique desks, you'll still see the glances and pacing of newcomers searching out a seat.  . . There are plenty of new electrical outlets for all the laptop lovers.  Obviously they offer speedy Free Wi-Fi.  They sell several sandwich options that are said to be very tasty.  I have yet to sample one.  In addition, they have international treats like alfajores (a Latin American/Argentinean caramel cookie specialty), gazpacho, Chicago's very own Eli's pumpkin cheesecake and other "near the cash register, buy on a whim" sweets.  Be sure to check out the graffiti-filled men's bathrooms (not sure what the women's has to offer) that brings back Chicago's pre-spray paint 'prohibition' feel back to reality.. . The cyclists of Logan now have a new home that fits their styles--after all they should be proud to be a part of the historic turn-of-the-century celebrity Ignaz Schwinn's old hood (the Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co. bike manufacturer).  The legacy still carries on not only with the bike-friendly tree-lined boulevards, but a cafe that cyclists come to to be themselves and take a break from the strong gusts of the Windy City.  To support the cafe, take one of their free logo pins at the cash register to pin on your bag. :)
