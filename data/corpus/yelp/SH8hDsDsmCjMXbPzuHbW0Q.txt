I picked this trendy place to stop for dinner on my last trip to NYC. It's very near the Gowanus Canal and is in a cool nabe that's rebounding quite a bit since I was last in Brooklyn in 2008.. . Had a really great cocktail while I waited for my friend. It was a cooling gin drink. I have the sort of luck that I always happen to get a free drink or food; this time a bartender sitting at the bar (note: he worked somewhere else) bought drinks for the whole bar. Yeah, not good at scoring a job these days, but I do get free refreshments thrown my way.. . I had a delicious grilled striped bass wrapped in bacon. I only eat bacon if it's that thick-cut organically grown kind, because I can really only rationalize the calories that way. Well, it was wonderful. My friend had the fried chicken. We were both so happy that we forgot to ask for a taste of each other's meals. It's really the kind of food that you want to have for dinner every night of the week but are too tired to make at home after a long day's work. So yes, it's American food, it's nothing spectacular, but it's well-cooked and good. The wine and beer list were well-selected and short enough for someone starving with low-blood sugar (like me) to be able to read and quickly choose from.. . The service is really nice and the environment is very relaxing. I love the type of interior where you hardly notice it because the designer thought for weeks about which white paint was perfect for the natural light streaming through the front windows. The temperature was perfect, acoustics were good enough for conversation but you could definitely hear the tinny restaurant noises in the background. . . Nice touches. I applaud them for their attention to detail and comfort which make this restaurant a haven.
