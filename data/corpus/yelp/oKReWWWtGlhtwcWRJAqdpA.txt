If you love garlic, this is a prime choice.  I took a friend here and we enjoyed it.  I had steak and it was cooked as how I ordered it, medium rare (usually other place over cook it slightly for my taste).  The garlic taste is not overwhelming and is just right.  . . The garlic spread is just right and spreads very nicely on bread.  The one thing that was interesting was the garlic ice cream .  Initially it taste ok, but after a spoon or two, it doesn't taste as good.  I would recommending trying it once just to see, but I wouldn't try it again unless someone wanted to try it.. . Service was excellent as expected of the place.  Price range is more for a date like scenario or high business then for friends.
