Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
One of my favorite restaurants in all of Los Angeles.  I can recommend it both as a seafood and steak aficionado.  In all my experiences, the service has been professional and helpful.  Keep in mind, this is also one of the pricier locations, but they provide an absolute reason to splurge.
