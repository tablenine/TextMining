Have I mentioned that I like fries?  I'll say all kinds, cause I'm not particular about shape or size, but I do have strong opinions about texture and taste. . . Rare is known for its burgers, which could have been assumed by its name alone, but I think it should also be recognized for the fries.  We ordered a basket and not only did it include three types of fries (shoestring, sweet potato, and something else yummy), but it came with five dipping sauces.  I like my condiments too, so this is unbeatable - I was in heaven.. . Furthermore, the burgers were great.  My medium ended up being more rare, but was still delectable; in retrospect I shouldn't have been surprised.  They spice up your average burger with things like carmelized onion, pesto, bourbon, whiskey and fried eggs. The even have bison burgers and weekly burger specials.  Check it out.. . No happy hour - FYI.
