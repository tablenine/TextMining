Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I really wasn't that impressed with Gingergrass! I'm not crazy about the ambience; I went with a nonhipster friend who was probably dressed like a soccer mom, and I was probably rockin' the lazy jeans and t-shirt look, and we were definitely treated like our business wasn't all that desired.. . My main issue, though, was that there were all of these yummy specials and desserts listed, but a few they didn't offer anymore! Well, darn it, take it off of that giant blackboard listing them! I got my hopes waaaaaaay up only to be dashed.. . I still haven't found Vietnamese I love in L.A. Maybe someday I will round up my coolest friends and give Gingergrass another shot.
