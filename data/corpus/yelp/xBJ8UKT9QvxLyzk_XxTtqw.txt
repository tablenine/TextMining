Love the cheese rolls and just about everything else in the window. Their cakes are gorgeous and delicious.. . I hated the wait. Even if you pre-ordered, the wait to pick up is still long. Maybe they've changed the way they do things now. I heard they opened a bigger location in Burbank. Can't wait to check it out when I'm in So. Cal. again.
