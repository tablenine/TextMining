Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Okay. The word 'Sushi Gen' makes me salivate......so I don't think I need to type any further to describe this fine establishment.. . Introduced to this Little Tokyo sushi joint by a good friend who works and dines in Downtown LA, I am happy to call this my favorite place to eat sushi.. . Definately do try the Yellowtail and Red Snapper (sashimi, of course). The soft shell crab is to die for and the albacore sushi, as always, is fantastic. Arguably the best stuff in LA.. . Always crowded in the evenings - so arrive earlier than expected as wait times are long. But nonetheless, definately worth it.. . If you like sushi - this is a must.
