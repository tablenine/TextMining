Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Go for weekend brunch.  Sit outside.  Get the pancakes with mascarpone.  Order a side of house potatoes.  Get the bloody Mary.  Thank me silently for being so honest with you.. . Feast is a prime brunch location.  You may have to wait 10-15 minutes at peak hours, but it is by no means a cue of Bongo Room proportions.  Plus, there is a nice lounge/bar area where you can order a drink and chill out, meet other nice people from the hood.  . . Lunch and Dinner menus are also refreshing and delicious, with good sized portions.  The owner, Debbie Sharpe, is also the owner of Half&amp;Half and Goddess&amp;Grocer.  Um yeah, she knows what she's doing!  . . Feast is also good for drinks after work or at night.  Its laid-back atmosphere provides the perfect respite from beer pong at Cans.
