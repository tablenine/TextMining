Ok, the billion dollar (mini) pancakes are the best on the planet!  When I'm in LA I try to arrange a time to be here just for those...with butter and real maple syrup!. . Other than that, this is a fun place to have a much better than average meal with good service and cute waitresses wearing creative leggings.  The Wimpy burger is one of the best burgers I've had, and a good burger is amazingly hard to come by these days.  . . Highly recommended, but can be very busy at times.
