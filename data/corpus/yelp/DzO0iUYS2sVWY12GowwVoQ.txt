Why hello little crawfish... *TEAR SLURP YUM* *insert evil laugh*. . I was pretty excited to finally eat at The Boiling Crab after missing several opportunities to and I was satisfied.  We ordered a couple pounds of crawfish, ~3 lbs of dungeness crab, both with the whole she-bang seasoning and some fried calarmari.  The two hour wait definitely made the food taste a whole lot better, maybe that's the trick?  I doubt that, but here's my ranking on the stuff I've tried that comes in the plastic bags.. . -Crawfish, sooooo good.  Sure it may seem you're mostly getting shell, but soooo much flavor.. -Shrimp, not that memorable to me.. -Dungeness crab, none of the flavoring seemed to get to the meat.  I just started dipping all the meat into the goodness in my crawfish bag.. . Apparently, the oysters were a little funny.  I didn't dare try one, especially since I've never had oysters.  But the fried calarmari, fried shrimp basket were good compliments to the meal.  There were several moments where I had to wait for my second wind, but we finished everything!  Only downside is the smell stays on your fingers for about a day or two.  *Sniff sniff*  Now it's on the keyboard.
