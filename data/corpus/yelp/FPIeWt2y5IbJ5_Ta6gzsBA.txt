This is the carnivores heaven!!  I've been here a few times and will definitely be back.  When you get there they give you a coaster on your table with red on one side and green on the other.  If you have your coaster on green the meat will keep coming around.  They have over 15 different kinds of meats to try and the servers keep bringing around all these delicious tasty pieces to eat.  They also have a huge salad bar for those vegetarians out there or people that want a something healthy.
