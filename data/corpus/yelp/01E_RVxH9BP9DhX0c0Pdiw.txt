Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
Post marathon and still on my I can eat whatever I want kick so we decided for some Mexican after seeing some food on tv. Roomie came here before and so did another yelp friend (Congrats on the ROTD for this place Selle!) so I just had to try it.. . So I hobbled in after a nice man named Seguro opened the door for me. Sat at a table and he proceeded to explain to us why we were there. He was quite proud to be featured on DDD!. . Ordered the carne asada cemita and the carne enchilada cemita for the main event and got an order of chalupas and a taco arabe as well. The cemitas were good. I don't think they're DDD awesome, but they are different and tasty enough.. just not extraordinary. The generous portions of queso oaxaca was appreciated though.. I did like the taco arabes as the pork tasted a little smoky to me and very succulent. Chalupas were good as well. . . Overall, I do like the place and am happy to have tried something different like this. I'd definitely go again to take people that haven't gone, but don't think this will be a usual place for me.
