I came here on a Thursday night with a girlfriend of mine and it was crowded! I didn't know they were known for their chicken wings, so I didn't order that :( . . (another consequence of not yelping the place before I came....). . We ordered a BUNCH of food for the two of us, I think our waiter was a little shocked when we kept naming off what we wanted to eat....it barely fit on our little table.  (Our waiter, btw, was quite a looker.... some eye candy while you eat hehe). . Anyway what I remember ordering: . - Furaibo grilled chicken salad. - Tojiru. - Saba shioyaki. - yakitori. - enoki mushroom + scallop in butter wine sauce. . The servings were on the smaller side, but ya'll know I love that bc that just means we get to taste more even with just two people.  . . Furaibo chicken salad was decent, the salad dressing was ordinary, and the chicken was tender and pretty delicious....but not something SO spectacular that I'd HAVE to get again.. . The tojiru was SO delicious...it's basically a broth with meats and potatoes and carrots....kind of a miso based broth....and the meat was super tender and juicy.  Goes great with rice. . . Saba shioyaki was average. . Yakitori was average. . Enoki mushroom and scallops were really goood....great flavors. . . All that was pretty good for the two of us, and we left satisfied and happy.  Good/decent service, and good selection of food.  I'd come here again with some friends for good food and beer.  Convenient that it's close to where my friends live, and where I usually stay when I'm in LA....Westwood area. . . Come check this place out for izakaya-esque dishes.
