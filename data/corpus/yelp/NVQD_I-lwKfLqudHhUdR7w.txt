While I live within walking distance today was the first time I've ever sat down to eat here. My mistake! Well made sandwiches, diverse menu and of course fresh bread. The ingredients were great and every one within our party was more than pleased with their meal. Great spot for lunch outside if you're lucky enough to grab a spot. Plenty crowded on weekends so take out may be better choice for drivers. I'll definitely be back.
