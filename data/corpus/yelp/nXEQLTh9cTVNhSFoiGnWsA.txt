Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
First attempt to eat there: SUPER PACKED. Decided to go back another time.. . First time there: Sunday lunch.. . Place was decent.  You order at the bar and they give you a number to put on your table.  Interesting concept for $10+ burgers, but given they are a bar I guess that's ok.  They have bussers but no waiters.. . Office Burger - really good.  Very heavy.  Does the job.. . Skinny fries - good.  Garlic aioli for dipping sauce was decent.. . They don't have ketchup, which i feel the fries needed.  Elitist? I dunno.. . Would i go back? For lunch.  But not at night.  Too crowded to enjoy anything.  Not my thing to feel like I'm in a Japanese subway.
