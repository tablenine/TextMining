Went here after meeting some Yelper's at Simon's.  We had a vegetarian with us and not having been in Andersonville too terribly much without a specific reason, we were trying to figure out what to do.  We saw Hamburger Mary's (how could you miss it) and thought how fun!  So in we went knowing that a hamburger joint in Chicago had to have several veggie alternatives on the menu.  It wasn't too packed when we went and the service was excellent.  They already had the summertime Goose Islands when many places were still trying to use up their winter ales.  It was great, right down to the very end where you have to smile when you're check comes to you in a red sequined shoe.  Love it.
