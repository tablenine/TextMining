I hail from the OC and every time I am around LA, I end up wanting to go to Daikokuya.  I've had plenty of ramen, some in OC, some in Japan, but this place is as good as it gets in SoCal.  Some people complain there is no variety of ramen types, but that is how the best ramen joints are!!! They specialize in one type, kind of like how various regions of Japan have styles they stick to.  . . I usually get kotteri style, which makes it a lot more flavorful.  I had just the original flavor the first time I came here, but then after that I only got kotteri which makes the original seem bland! The egg they prepare here is actually better than any ramen places I've had, they even let you choose soft or hard boiled.  . . This place is easy to find, just look for the crowd of people and the yellow sign.  It does get crowded around lunch and dinner times, but thats a given for anything tasty.  Its a little small, I've only been here with at most 3-4 people.
