I definitely have a love / hate relationship with this place.  Generally the food, design, and vibe they have going on is great.  The one thing lacking is the service.. . The service I get during the day/brunch is totally different from the service I get at night. . . During my first trip here I sat outside and while the service was generally not fast, it wasn't bad service and it gave me time to scope out the place and menu.  The tea/beer/drink selection is great for me.  They definitely offer things that you won't find most places.  The food was very good, and although it took some time to come out, it gave my party time to conversate, etc.  During dinner I had a chance to talk to the chef about one of the specials.  He was a great guy as was the waitstaff all around.  All in all...a good night of dining....... . Now my brunch there last weekend was a totally different story.  Still charming up until ordering our food.  Two drinks took about 15 minutes to come out and the food, believe it or not, took 45 minutes to arrive.  At one point we contemplated leaving, but stayed based on past meals we had here.  We asked the waiter what was up and he said he couldn't help it since the kitchen was running slow.  To his credit he did offer us two free drinks which was nice but no excuse.  When the food did arrive finally, it was good enough to make me forget how long it took to come (or was it how much I was starving while waiting).. . All in all I still like the place (hence the 4 stars).  I know what to expect and still food is still great.  Next time I come for brunch (if ever) I know I'll be waiting on average a half an hour to eat.  Aside from the service and food, the clientele is hipster / chill and the place just has a nice feel.  I'll definitely go back, most likely only for dinner when I'm not in a rush.
