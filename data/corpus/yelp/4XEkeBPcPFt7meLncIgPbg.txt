Took the red line from NoHo to try this place I've heard so much about.  It was quite an adventure for the twins. Philippe's was very convenient and easy to get to.  Arrived around 4pm and there was already a line 3 deep, which equated to about a 10 minute wait. The staff definitely is not in a rush and were taking their old sweet time. I heard from others in line that was typical. A younger establishment could serve the same food in seconds as it was all pre-made food they just had to slap the meat on the bread (well cheese too in some cases). Women behind counter were not friendly but not rude either.   The place is definitely old showing it's age with sawdust on floor but seemed clean. The place is much bigger than i expected.  Ordered double dip beef with Swiss, double dip turkey with Jack, macaroni &amp; fruit salad, apple pie &amp; custard.  Picked all this so we'd get a good representation of menu.  The food was good and enjoyable but not amazing.  Wouldn't make long trip back just for this, but would eat again if around already.
