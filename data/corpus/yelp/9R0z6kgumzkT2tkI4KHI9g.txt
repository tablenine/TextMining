Restaurant: Five Seasons Brewing
Category: Pubs
I've been to 5 Seasons Brewery several times.  The food presentation is very nice but the taste of the food is "ok".  I found the waitstaff in Alpharetta to be extremely courteous and helpful but the bartenders in Sandy Springs are seriously rude.  One woman in particular would not take anyone's drink order and had a huge attitude - she has worked there for awhile, so I guess it is the service that the company strives for.
