Lots of choices for breakfast.  Fast friendly service.  Reasonable prices.  Open early.. . I've eaten the biscuits &amp; gravy, potato pancakes, butcher shop omelet.  All very tasty!  Love the fresh-squeezed strawberry orange juice.  A nice alternative th 11 City Diner where the owner is so off-putting &amp; Bongo Room where everything tastes like a dessert.
