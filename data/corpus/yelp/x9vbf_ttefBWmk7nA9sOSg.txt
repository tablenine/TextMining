Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Ugo to me is bad americanized italian diner food.. . There are two positive things about this place.. . GOOD PEOPLE WATCHING.  It's in the heart of culver city so it's fun to sit on a busy night as you dine and watch everyone go by, and for the ladies the bartender dudes look like rugged models.. . COFFEE. The espresso drinks here aren't bad in a pinch, sit outside it smells better.. . Negatives . . FOOD.  The food does not taste fresh, and the flavors are mediocre to bad.. . SMELL.  Both times i've been it's smelled like ammonia, sweat, and lard.  . . SERVICE.  The waitstaff has an overall "greater then thou" snobby attitude, they are un-attentive and look like they'd rather be anywhere but at work.. . Don't waste your money at Ugo, there are so many places in the area with better food.. . Oh one last thing, they have amazing looking cakes I haven't tried any of them yet i'll have to report back.  I have tried their gelato's, they were OK but not unique or special in any way.
