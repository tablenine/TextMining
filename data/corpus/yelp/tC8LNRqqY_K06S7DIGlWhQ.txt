Does Mozza need another review?  Of course not, but you're going to get my 2 cents anyway.. . Had a great date with the hubs here last weekend.  Beautiful from start to finish.. . Burrata with Bacon. Garlic and olive oil drenched bread (don't know if it's on the menu, but it's the same great stuff that is on Pizzeria Mozza's menu). Raviolo with Ricotta and Egg. Gnudi with Chantrells. Quail wrapped in Pancetta . Beef Tagliata. Torta della Nonna. ...and a bottle of Morellino di Scansano "I Perazzi," La Mozza. . I can't say there was a miss in the lot, but the pasta course stood out as the highlight of the evening.  Next time I think we'll have the pasta tasting menu to maximize the goodness.  And some Burrata, of course.. . The I Perazzi was a lovely Sangiovese, light and food-friendly.
