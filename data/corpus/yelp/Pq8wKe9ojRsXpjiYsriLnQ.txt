I went here for an anniversary and had a wonderful time.  The ambiance is very traditional masculine american steakhouse, but the play on food was spectacular.  If you can only afford to grab something small don't miss out on the desserts.  The cheescake lollipop tree is delicious and the hot donuts come out served in an adorable box with chocolate, vanilla, and grape jelly squeeze bottles for a do it yourself filling.  Visit Adam at the hotel bar while you wait for your table for a martini made perfect.
