Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
One of the worst dining experiences I've had in a very long time.  Two of my friends and I decided to do a casual dinner and we decided on Jerry's.  I had been there before and the service was great and the food was decent, but yesterday's experience was atrocious.  Our server could not answer any of our questions on the menu.  My friend has Celiac's disease (gluten allergy) and when asked to make a change on the salad, she was told that "The salads are pre-made off site, so I'll see what I can do".  Why is something, as simple as a salad, not made to order?  Just wondering.... . My sandwich was too salty, but that was not the server's fault, but she didn't even come and check to see how we were enjoying our meals.  Without even asking if we wanted dessert or were ready for the check, the server just dropped it off at the table.  Ok, that's fine, but the check came out looking like a 3rd grader had done the math, so we asked our server about it.  She could not answer anything besides for, "Yeah, our computers are all messed up.  If you want I can have someone explain it to you..." and when we asked about what some of the charges were she went on to say, "Yeah, we charged you an extra  $.25, so if you want I can take it off the bill for you,"... Yes, it was only a quarter and we didn't have the charge reversed, BUT we shouldn't have been charged for it in the first place, and it should have been caught before the check was dropped on our table.  . . Needless to say, I will not be going back to Jerry's.  I would much rather go to any other deli for a quick sandwich than have to deal with the horrendous service that I experienced last night,
