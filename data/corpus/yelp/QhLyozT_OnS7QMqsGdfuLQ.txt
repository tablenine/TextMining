My roommate and I had mutual, very intense cravings for sushi one night, so we drove down to little Tokyo in search of a new sushi find. I recalled that Sushi Gen was supposed to be a good place, so we wandered over to Honda Plaza and strolled into Sushi Gen. For a Tuesday, it was packed, and the only seats we could get without a wait were at the bar. We ordered piece after piece of nigiri and got an appetizer of softshell crab. Everything was extremely fresh. Standouts were the japanese snapper, dusted with yuzu and a light soysauce; the yellowtail belly, which was buttery and melted in my mouth; the salmon, and the halibut. The chef told us that a lot of the fish had been flown in from Japan, and I believed him.....each piece of sashimi or nigiri was unbelievably fresh. My roomie said she was still dreaming of the taste of the snapper hours later. Even the softshell crab was excellent for what it was, it was perfectly battered and fresh out of the deep fryer- hot and succulent. Only downsides...the service was a bit spotty at times...but I think this was due to the fact that there were few servers and the place was packed. Also, the bill came out to $73 for the two of us, which isn't bad for sushi that fresh, but I have had excellent experiences at Azami for a bit cheaper. Other than that, this place was great, and we will be back again!
