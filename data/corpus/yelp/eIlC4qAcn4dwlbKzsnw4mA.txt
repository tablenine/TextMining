Dear Versailles,. . I live very close to you, and out of my love for you, I try not to eat at your place too much out of the fear I might get sick of eating at your place.. . Do you know how hard it is for me? Everytime I have friends and or family in town, I take them to you. They are always impressed, and now whenever someones back in the area, they clamor for you! I have guests frequently as you can imagine so I have to limit myself!. . If I could have my way, I'd eat at your place everyday, but c'mon you know that's not realistic. You must be putting crack in your food or something. Your portions are huge (that means a lot coming from me, seriously), and your price is very affordable.. . Despite the long lines, the wait is never too long and though your service can be a bit shabby at times but when its on, its on! If everyone orders your famous chicken, the food comes very quickly sometimes I like to imagine that you have a few plates on standby just waiting for me to stroll in.. . When I beat the rush, I kinda like how all your waiters are kinda chilling on your corner waiting for customers to come in.. . I'll see you very soon,. . Ed
