Not much else i can say that hasn't already been said about this place.  I'm back in Los Angeles after 6 years and this place reminded me of how much i LOVE it here!!  The food is great, the portions are big and the price isn't that bad at all, besides it seems like the server staff are all actor/model types so that definitely works out well!  Went yesterday today and will prolly go back tomorrow.  The Too Hot to Handle burger is AWESOME if you love spice and the Kickin and Screamin breakfast tacos are delish!  If you're in Los Angeles PLEASE hit up the Griddle for some wicked good eats!
