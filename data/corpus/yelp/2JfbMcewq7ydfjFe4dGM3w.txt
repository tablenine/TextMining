I hate Daikokuya because they've ruined ramen for me forever.  I cannot go anywhere else for ramen b/c all I think is "what a poor substitute for Daikokuya."   I'm now a Daikokuya addict and whenever I have a craving for ramen I can only go there and have to drive the long ways and wait in that long line.  Or eat at some ungodly hour b/c I'm unwilling to wait.  Either way, it's totally worth it and hands down the best ramen I've ever had.
