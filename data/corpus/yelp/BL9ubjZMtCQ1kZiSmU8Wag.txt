Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
For all of you who thought Milk and Honey was all about coffee and tea (myself included), whoa, we were way wrong. Milk and Honey is not only a little coffee house, it also serves delicious, amazing food. . . I recently went for brunch with a friend - I had the breakfast sandwich, which had scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, bacon &amp; tomato and was served with homemade chips all for a measly $6.25. My friend had the huevos rancheros, which Milk and Honey serves casserole style, and it looked amazing. Actually, every dish that I saw come out of the kitchen looked amazing!. . Milk and Honey also serves a wide variety of sandwiches all for around $7 from 10AM-close (which is 4 or 5 PM depending on the day). Don't let the long line out the door for weekend brunch throw you off. It moves faster than you'd think. Just order when you get to the counter, and by the time the hostess has found a seat for you your food will hit the table fresh out of the kitchen. Just a one star loss for the tiny space, which is not a good combination with the brunch crowds on Division.
