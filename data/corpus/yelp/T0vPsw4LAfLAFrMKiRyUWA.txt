I'm pretty picky with my sushi and I've definitely had better.  For some reason this place was hyped up by a coworker who swears this is the best sushi in the west side.  The fish wasn't that fresh. They had a "special" on the amaebi (sweet shrimp), $15 for 2 pieces which was unimpressive.  My 2 favorites, salmon and yellowtail, were also not the best.  Don't think I'll be coming back here again.
