Restaurant: The Twisted Spoke
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I would have given them a four star review, but my burger came to me medium-well rather than medium-rare like I ordered it.  I hate when meat is over-cooked.  It was still good though.  I love their french fries.  I was there with 3 other people who loved their meals.  Apparently, bathing in their biscuits and gravy would be great, so said one of my brunch-mates.  The bloody mary comes with an elaborate garnish of meat, pepper, olive and onion.  It also comes with a tiny beer!  I love snacks with my drinks.  Always a plus.. . If it had been just a tad warmer today, I'd have asked for a rooftop table.  I've never eaten up there.  I will one day.  . . The service here is good.  Prices are right.  And you leave full.  And definitely with enough alcohol in you.  . . I was never a fan of the Twisted Spoke that was open in Wrigleyville for like five minutes.  I've always been true to the original Twisted Spoke.  I will continue to be true to it.
