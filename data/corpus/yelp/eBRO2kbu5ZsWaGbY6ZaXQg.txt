A group of us went here for a birthday dinner because one of the birthday girls is a garlic FREAK. But she ended up thinking it wasn't really awesome. We both liked it but it is not a place where I would CHOOSE to go again. . . The chicken and ribs were pretty good. But the free bread that you start off with was soooooo good. It was warm and fluffy. YUMMM. I think I like the bread more so than the actual food, which the entree was a bigger portion than I expected. the GARLIC ICE CREAM=YUMMY IN MY TUMMY. There is a hint of garlic but it was so refreshing after the meal. You should definitely try it if you go!. . Oh! If you tell them that it is your birthday, they bring out this RIDICULOUS garlic hat and make you wear it. Then someone comes with a camera and takes several pictures of you. These pictures are posted online so that you can order a t shirt or cup or whatever with that picture. They also bring out those long candles for you to blowout. You know the candles where in Beauty and the Beast, there is a candle character that is actually three candles in a candle holder. yea.. one of those things. I thought that was quite.. unique. . The waiters are EXTREMELY friendly. All smiles and they let you take as much time as you want. . . Anyways! Try this place~ it's not amazing but it wasn't a waste of my time. . If I absolutely had to go back, I would. But again, I wouldn't personally choose this place.. . The way the tables are set up is pretty unique too. Oh and speak of the bathroom.. There is this corner in the bathroom for lounging. It was wierd.. you should go and check it out.
