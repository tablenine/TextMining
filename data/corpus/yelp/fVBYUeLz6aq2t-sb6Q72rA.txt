Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I expected way too much from this place because everytime i drove by, there was always a long line.  But when we got there, we figured out why the line is always long.  The way they take orders and give you your food is so inefficient.  They have multiple windows, but they're all the same.. you go up and place your order, and they'll go cook/get your food, and you just stand there waiting til your food comes out and then you pay - rather than paying right away and going to a different window to pick up your food. There were multiple people who were standing there that told us they weren't in line.. . On to the food - not good at all really.  I didn't think mexican food could be bad, but it just wasn't good at all. I had two beef tacos and an enchilada.  The tacos were really plain, beef didnt have much flavor - had to use a lot of hot suace.  And the hot sauce wasn't even good either - not hot. The enchilada was too salty.. . You know a place isn't good when both my friend and i agreed that the best thing we got was the water (which they charged 25 cents for).  Seriously. . . The salsa for the chips weren't that bad, but still not spicy at all.  And it's cool that they give you free chips w/ each order.  . . At least now we know this place isn't good even though we see lots of people there all the time. Don't think i'd go back... ever.
