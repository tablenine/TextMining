Been here twice so far, and planning to go back for more.  Here's the 411:. . APPETIZERS:. 1.)  Bone Marrow Flan -- might sound a bit questionable, but REALLY tasty.  You must try this! . 2.)  Maple Glazed Pork Belly -- didn't really stand out. 3.)  Austrian Oxtail Bouillon -- very tasty.  kind of like matzo ball soup with clear beef broth.  . 4.)  Kobe Beef Sliders  -- mini burgers.  not very flavorful, and thus, not worth ordering.. . ENTREE &amp; SIDES:. 1.)  True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef -- rib eye steak:  yes, it's $160 for an 8 oz. steak, but it's the most tender and flavorful steak I've ever tasted!  Better than Ruth's Chris and better than Mastro's (both of which cannot compare to CUT's steak in terms of flavor!).  . 2.)  Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg:  gross and gooey.  DO NOT GET.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.. 3.)  Roasted sweet corn -- sweet, buttery, caramelized...  Need I say more?  DROOL.
