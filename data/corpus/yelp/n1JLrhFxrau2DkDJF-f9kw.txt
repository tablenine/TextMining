If i loved pizza this would be the perfect place. pizza lovers can find a million different types with all sorts of toppings. the best part is the doughy crust.. usually people hate crush, including me, but this is the crust that is soft and scrumptious. portions aren't terribly big but they are extremely rich. other entrees are standard very good, such as the salads and arancine. rip off valet parking, a little pricy, but i cant find Â a better place just for pizza. nearly impossible to get into, too.
