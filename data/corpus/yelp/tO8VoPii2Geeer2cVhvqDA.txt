Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
El Tepeyac Cafe is what Yelp was born for.  This is one of those hole in the wall spots that  most every East LA'er knows about and then slowly trickles down to everyone else who loves good filling food.  Since it looks like the "Hollenbeck" burrito is the topic of discussion by everyone I will talk about their breakfasts.  The Chorizo is amazing...the heuvos rancheros are mouth watering.  Especially if your hanging over from the night before.  If you show up on a Sunday you might have to negotiate your arrival on the Church's schedule.  It seems like they get a flood of patrons before and after each Mass.  But if you dont care about waiting in a 5-10 minute line then just GO....GO NOW!  My mom and dad used to tell me a story that Manny the owner opened up his restaurant next to the church to get God's blessing.  Although, I have my own beliefs now, I think he made the right decision.  But I think its the amazing food that brings the peeps...you be the judge.  . . I dont know if it should be mentioned on this website but there is a suprise on certain sundays when Manny is in a good mood.  I will let you find out....its especially nice if you havnt stopped partying from the night before...(you bad kids)
