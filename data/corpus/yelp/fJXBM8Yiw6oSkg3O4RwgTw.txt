Restaurant: Letizia&#39;s Natural Bakery
Category: Bakeries
More than for solid Italian bakery of large cut out cookies, biscotti and panini, and good coffee and espresso drinks, go here to get work done and to people watch. The three seating areas offer different possibilities: heavy foot and car traffic on the streetside cafe, the roar of the espresso machines inside, and total tranquility amidst tomato plants and fountains in the back.
