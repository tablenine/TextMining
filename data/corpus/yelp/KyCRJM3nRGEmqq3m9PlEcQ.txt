Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Delicious.  This is head and shoulders above the Mexican "institutions" you keep hearing about, most of which are famous for margaritas and huge, unrecognizable, cheese-blanket dishes.. Gloria's Carne Adobada is delicious.  And the Salvadorean pupusa plate is a winner.. . This is my favorite "big plate" Mexican/Salvadorean restaurant in Los Angeles.
