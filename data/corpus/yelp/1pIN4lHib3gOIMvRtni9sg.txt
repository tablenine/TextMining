Resto was a perfect beginning to a perfect morning.  Except  I pretended I was a rockstar the night before, and the fact that it was actually already mid afternoon.  We had reservations made since we had a mid sized party of 6.  We rushed to get there because I think they stop serving brunch at 3p.  Right when we got there, we were immediately seated and started perusing the menu.   . . My friends said that the chicken and waffles and hang over pasta were not to be missed.   Since I am/always-have-been an Eggs Benedict fiend, I naturally went with that.  I mean the description said eggs benedict on a lardon liege waffle.  How can you not get that??  Lardon-read: bacon.  And after my first bite, I definitely had no regrets, William Hung style, singing for my perfectly poached eggs and the lemony hollandaise.  The waffles were a pure perfection called bliss.  Crunchy, sweet, maple flavor.  . . I also tried the chicken and waffles, mainly to eat more of those lardon waffles.  The distinct flavor of bacon and that sweet maple glaze enveloped my taste buds.  I mean, could it possibly get any better than this?  The fried chicken batter definitely tasted home made with a slight kick at the end.     . . The belgian hangover pasta is a bowl of carbonara delight.  Thick creamy sauce and a picture perfect egg on top.  Melty melty gruyere,  ham, and a picture perfect egg on top.  I was glad my friend was more hung over than me and was too sick to finish her pasta.  I mean, I felt bad for her, but as soon as she said she couldn't eat it... the vulture in me grabbed her bowl and annihilated it immediately... I mean, all the while making sure she was ok... and... being nice... about her situation.... . In my book, Resto is a picture perfect destination on a breezy and lazy Sunday afternoon.
