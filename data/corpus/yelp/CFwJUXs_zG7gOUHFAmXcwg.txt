Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
There are things I like about Reza's and things I don't.  The number one thing I like is the ultra-delicious Fessenjan with Duck (Duck breast with a heavenly sweet/sour pomegranate-walnut sauce).  This is something I crave and is one of the only reasons I go to Reza's.  . . Now given the strength of the Fessenjan, you'd think there were other stellar offerings on the menu.  Not so, in my opinion.  Whenever I have opted to detour from my heart's delight, I have been underwhelmed.  Mind you, nothing was awful, but nothing was mind-blowing either.. . The service is usually pretty good and the kitchen operates with efficiency.  The place is usually busy and they handle this well.. . I think what I like least about Reza's is the space itself.  It is very large and cavernous with different levels.  For all its spaciousness, the tables are painfully close together which results in being too close to your fellow diners for complete comfort.  Also, the ceilings (at least on the first floor) are very high which results in a lot of noise.  If it's crowded, conversation is difficult.. . I'll go to Reza's if other people want to go, but very rarely venture there on my own volition unless I'm jones-ing for the pomegranate duck.
