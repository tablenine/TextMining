If you have an addiction to bon bons, stay away from Milk. for .25 cents each, you can get one of their homemade bon bons. and you can't just eat one. cute decor, reminds you of an old school diner. went yesterday in the afternoon and came back at night. afternoon i ordered a media noche sandwich (roasted pork, ham, pickles, manchego, garlic aioli). my friend got the prosciutto and asiago sandwich. not bad. but my sandwich was seriously melt-in-your-mouth good. i know it sounds like a basic cuban sandwich, which it is, but its a very well-made cuban sandwich. had their chocolate milk (ice blended), nothing to write home about. finished off with two bon bons (black/white, and toffee coffee). i couldve ate 12 but i didnt want to die of a heart attack. came back 5 hours late at 9:50 (made it right on time), had a root beer float and my gf had a vegetable panini. panini looked good (grilled vegetables, pomegranate molasses, goat cheese). root beer float is always a classic. finished with more bon bons. the cashier/waitress said there's a guy that come every night at eats a dozen bon bons. if you see him tell him he doesnt have long to live at the rate he's going.
