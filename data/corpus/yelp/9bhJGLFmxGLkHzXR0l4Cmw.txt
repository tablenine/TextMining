great ramen!.... especially if you like the fatty kind... their kotteri soup is is just the way its supposed to be: fatty, thick, and tasty... also they have a lot of Â green onions inside, which makes it even better!. Luckily I got in without any wait... but I hear you gotta wait hours to get in... I dunno if I wanna wait that long tho
