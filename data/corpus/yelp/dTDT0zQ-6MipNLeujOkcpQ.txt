Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
Buona Terra is a great place to go for very good Italian food. I normally go with the linguine w clams. You'll want to use the fresh baked bread at the table to soak up the great sauce. My first visit i ordered a pasta dish with goat cheese. I found it to be a bit too greasy/heavy for my liking. I was surprised to see Dick Durbin eating here with a large party one night. The service was good, and the decor nice.
