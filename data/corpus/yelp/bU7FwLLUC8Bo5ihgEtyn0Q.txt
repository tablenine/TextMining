YUMMY BACON BURRITO DOG!!!  I'm not so much the hot dog person, but this was not quite the regular hot dog experience.  Two hot dogs with chili, onions, 2 slices of cheese, and 3 bacon strips all wrapped in a flour tortilla...YESSS!  It was not as filling in terms of bread overload because it was wrapped in a tortilla instead of a bun and because it had 2 slices of cheese inside, it satisfied my gooey cheese craving.  I love cheese!
