I was so impressed by the ~1150 yelper reviewers of 4-star and 5-star reviews, so I scratch what I said about Los Angelan Yelpers in my previous review.. . So we decided to go on a Thursday night, and ended up still waiting for 40 minutes for a table. However, if you don't mind sitting at the bar, then the wait is a lot shorter.. . They do give you a lot of ramen, so if you do order appetizers, just remember that. The gyozas are amazing, and I would rate them at least 5-stars (see photo). They are so beautifully prepared, crispy with garnish. The ramen was amazing too. I'm not sure if it's the best ramen I've had, but I gave it 4-stars because I want to reserve saying I had the best for when I have ramen in Japan (seriously). Maybe Yelp will be there too by then.. . Let me explain my ramen attraction. It all started after I watched Ken Watanabe's Tempopo movie (all about ramen). In this classic, they explain the proper way to eat the pork and your ramen, etc. Now, Daikokuya's ramen didn't seem to be classic to me, however, the pork they used was (I think) pork belly, so fatty it melts in your mouth, yummy. The egg used is one that is boiled and pickled in soy sauce, which reminds me of the 100-year duck egg from Amy Tan's book (but chicken instead of duck). The broth was really thick. But what made the ramen outstanding was the consistency of the noodle. The texture was amazing, and retained it's hardness (e.g. equivalent to al dente with pasta noodles). Not sure if they were fresh or dried. I've tried a Japanese package noodle that gives that same texture (yes, I am that lucky to find such a package ramen -- made in Japan of course).. . They serve alcohol. I wasn't too privvy on the tea. It was slightly weak and tasted like rice/barley tea.
