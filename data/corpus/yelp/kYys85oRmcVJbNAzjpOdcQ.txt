Restaurant: Across the Street
Category: Mexican
Some friends and I discovered Across the Street from the staff at Highland Bakery. We were going to lunch at Highland but got there when they were closing down. We asked the staff where a good place to eat was and were told, "Across the street." This in itself is funny because Across the Street is literally across the street from Highland Bakery. Â . . At first glance at Across the Street's menu I was prepared for a disappointment. I love Mexican food and I really hate when restaurants try to get all nouveau with it. I'm good with just my meat, rice, and beans please. Keep it simple. However, this place does a great job with its organic and contemporary spin on Mexican food.. . I ordered a taco plate with a side of rice and beans and I was a little, well a lot, concerned at first about my order because I never had a pulled pork taco before. Yet, once the food hit my mouth I was pleasantly surprised. The food was hot from the kitchen and I could tell someone was cooking with love.. . The chips and the homemade salsa were also a win. I'm a spicy lover so I could appreciate that the salsa had a nice kick to it.. . The waitress was also very friendly and gave us plenty of time to mull over the menu.. . Again, this is another place where looks are deceiving. So throw caution to the win and go across the street next time you're near Highland Bakery. Corny pun intended.
