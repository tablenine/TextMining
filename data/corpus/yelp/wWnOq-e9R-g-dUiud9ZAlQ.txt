A few friends and I crowded into the tiny seating area to sample the delicious sausages and frites and beers at Wurstkuche last night. It was an amazing meal.  We passed around the kielbasa, bratwurst and austin blues sausages _ rather tame compared to the alligator sausage or other strange but intriguing meats _ and were really thrilled with the discovery. The bratwurst had a lovely snap and I particularly liked the sweet pepper topping. The frites were lovely, and I think the dipping sauces were just adventurous enough -- curry ketchup and blue cheese-walnut bacon are quite delicious.  Because the place is small, I felt a little eyeballed by people waiting for seats while we finished our beers, but it all seemed to magically work out in the end. I'm hoping the bar here is complete by February so I can have people go here for my birthday. Sausages!. . Oh, and vegetarians need not be wary, they have great veggie options.
