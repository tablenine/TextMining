came here for brunch and this place was packed! they give you mighty fine portions. i ordered the chicago charlie's scramble that comes with eggs, italian sausage, bacon, potatoes, mozzarella, peppers, and onions with a side of toast for $11.. . jesus, i saw people getting the pancakes and they were gigantic. heart attacks on a plate!
