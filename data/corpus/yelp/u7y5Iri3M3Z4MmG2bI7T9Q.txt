Cereal and milk, cereal and milk, milk and cereal, milk and cereal ... A is for Apple Jacks, C is for Cheerios ... Cereal and milk, cereal and milk.... . What a bummer that the song above is better than the desserts itself. After having dinner at Joom Bangkok Cafe, we came to Milk for some instant gratification. Gratification was achieved, but it was followed by an upset stomach. Perhaps eating dessert right after Thai food, or more specifically the Tom Yum Soup, was not a great idea after all.. . I shared the blue velvet cake, strawberry shortbread/shortcake, and grasshopper ice cream sandwich; listed based on goodness. . 1) First off, the blue velvet cake was good, but if I can make it myself, then I've experienced better. The frosting on there is so sweet, it'll have you making appointments with your dentist the next day. . 2) As for the strawberry shortbread/shortcake... the middle taste like a strawberry fruit bar that I get from ice cream trucks. The outside is dipped in white chocolate and has chucks of shortcake scattered around. Personally, I don't like to mix strawberry and white chocolate. The two just doesn't mix well like sweet &amp; sour. This dessert would be amazing if it had not been for the white chocolate and if it were utterly covered in the shortcake/shortbread.. 3) The grasshopper ice cream cake sounds creative and looks amazing, but WOW it is deceptive. It is merely mint chocolate chip ice cream stuffed between two low-quality sugar cookies that have been colored green and half-dipped in chocolate. . . I'll come here again when I pay Susina Bakery a visit, but I'll be sure to order other desserts or try out their lunch items.
