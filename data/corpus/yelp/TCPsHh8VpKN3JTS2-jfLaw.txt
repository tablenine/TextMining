Fox Sports screams "commercial".  Frankly, I hate commercial spots. Basically if you are in Atlanta this is typically one of the traditional first spots one might think of to watch a game.  It looks just like you think it'd look, typical entertainment style Sports bar.  . . While it reeks of being mundane, the place actually has pretty damn good food.  The wings are absolutely fantastic with the sauce being the highlight.. . You can also try the barbecue chicken nachos if you are looking to get full from one of their appetizers.  . . Their salads arent bad either, I think I have had the bbq chicken salad or the cobb salad or both.  Either way, I was impressed by the food considering this was just another "commercial" sports bar.;. . Not a bad place to people watch either:)
