an ESSENTIAL LA experience. very vintage, very unique, very worthwhile. my recommendation: park in their ample lot, bring cash &amp; some patience (be prepared to wait in line awhile). order a double-dipped beef french dip (no need to add cheese) slaw or potato salad on the side &amp; a glass of their famous lemonade. bring your tray upstairs to one of the little school rooms with an open window &amp; get ready to be wow'd. make sure to try their homemade hot mustard (it's in an unlabeled plastic squeeze bottle on the tables) but go easy on it at first-it is not subtle. if you love the mustard, you can buy a jar at the cashier up front for $3.75.
