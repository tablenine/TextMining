No reservations, but 'call ahead'!  I walked into the restaurant hoping they had reserved a table for 7 for me.  They did!  My name + 6 written on their yellow pad.  . . We order the spareribs, Singapore noodles without curry (I don't think I saw this on the menu), beef slices with green onions, house chow fun, stir fried greens, steamed dumplings, pan fried spicy squid and steamed Jasmine rice.  I think that was it.  All ordered items were good!  My favorite were the spareribs!  Out of everything we ordered, I would ask for the spareribs, squid and beef slices again.  I wasn't stoked on their chow fun, but I still ate it.  Their dumplings are huge!  I wouldn't mind ordering those again either.. . My overall experience at Canton Cooks was great!  I'd love to make it my once a season trip.  Anyone down for a group dinner, let me know!  I'll even let you pay the bill!
