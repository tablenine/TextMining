Love this place.  This place never disappoints, but come if you are really hungry since the portions are enormous (seriously, their nachos and pancakes resemble mountains that no average person can possibly eat in one sitting).  Although the wait is pretty long, it is worth it...why else would so many people be waiting.  IMy palette has had the honor of tasting their cobb omelete, the griddle waffle, and their burgers and all were delicious.  Their coffee is also the best in LA.  Make sure to park ifor free n their lot behind the RiteAid.
