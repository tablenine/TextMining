Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Sorry for being Debbie Downer but I have never liked this place.. . I lived down the street for a couple of years and gave Alcove several chances but it always disappointed me. . . I don't mind spending $20 on breakfast for myself but if I am doing that someone better be serving me, that means no standing in line to order. I feel like such an idiot carrying my cup of tea and my order number to a table outside.. . When the food arrives, I have had cold eggs, dirty plates and once on my paper napkin ring there was a booger, no joke.. . This place has a lot of industry folk, an attractive menu in theory, but it just falls short. . . It's not quaint, it's not gourmet and it's gross!
