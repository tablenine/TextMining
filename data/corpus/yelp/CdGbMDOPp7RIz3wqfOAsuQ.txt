It can get loud and rowdy here on Friday nights. It's definitely not your traditional-type of Japanese restaurant. It's definitely more Americanized. Prices are fairly reasonable. Food is ok... just ok for me. I was excited to see poke (marinated raw tuna) on the menu. The last time I had it was in Hawaii. Unfornately, it was too salty. I felt like I needed to eat a bowl of rice to go with one piece of tuna. Sushi rolls were decent. This place reminds me of Miyake in the Bay Area.
