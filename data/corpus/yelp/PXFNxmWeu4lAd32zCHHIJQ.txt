I really wish I could give this place 4 and a half stars.  We eat here reasonably often.  The food is generally awesome with lots of vegetarian and great fish options and frequently changing specials.  The ambience is wonderful.  It loses the last star for a couple of reasons though.  About every fifth time we've been, things have been just a little off...salad limp and sad (usually excellent), a waiter that doesn't have it quite together, or a bottle of wine that had cork break off into it.  Still, most of our experiences there are so wonderful that we are willing to go back again and again.. . Oh, the other thing that I always find a tad disappointing here is the desserts.  Other than the lemon sorbetto which is always satisfying, none of the other desserts quite do it for me.  Two times we've been given free bottles of dessert wine which were quite nice (we do go here a lot), so if you like dessert wines, this may be a good place.
