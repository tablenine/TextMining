this review is for the rococo room as a wedding venue only!. . firstly, this place is popular.  in fact, they already have some bookings until august 2008!  but it's no wonder why.... . 1. there is no cost for the actual rental, just a food and drink minimum you must meet ($5000 for a saturday is the most expensive.). 2. the space is really quite nice, complete with chivari chairs at no extra cost.  it has a rustic/romantic feel.  . 3. food is supposed to be very good as well.. 4. it's in central old town pasadena, right off colorado.. . the space itself would comfortably fit 150 people, and amplified music is allowed until midnightish.  for an evening event, you would have the room from 6 pm - midnight.. . the service we had was superior and extremely hospitable.  i would definitely use them if i could!
