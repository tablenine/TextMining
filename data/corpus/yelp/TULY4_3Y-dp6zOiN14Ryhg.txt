I actually have never heard about the Alcove until last week!  Came out to this cute hot spot during the middle of the day for some refreshing drinks.  We ordered the cream soda and Hawaiian Vacation smoothie (mangos, pineapples, &amp; choice of OJ or apple juice).  Initially, I'm not a big cream soda fan so the drink didn't tickle my pickle.  However, the smoothie was quite tasty!  Thick and fruity, you can taste hints of mango with every sip.  . . Alcove has several color small tables and chairs seated outdoors under this large tree.  It was really nice to be able to sit under the shade with a tasty drink and enjoy a nice conversation (or just people watch!)  I heard that the food at Alcove is quite tasty, but unfortunately, I was too full from lunch to desire anything...even the dessert!. . Until next time, Alcove!
