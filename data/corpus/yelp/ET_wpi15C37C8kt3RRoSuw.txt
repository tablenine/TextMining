Sweet potatoes fries are yummy, but they're nothing new.. . The service was pretty awful (in fairness, it was pretty busy).  We showed up and were told we'd be seated shortly, so we went to the bar to get a drink.  We tried to be as out-of-the-way as possible, but like I said, it was busy.. . A busboy hit my friend in the head/shoulders with his tray.  Didn't apologize, look back, or anything else.  Just THUMP and on his way.  This made us scrunch in a little more.  A server walked towards the computer (we were NOT in front of or within 5 ft of the computer station) and very physically bumped another friend.  She made a sarcastic comment and rolled her eyes.  RUDE.. . Our ACTUAL server was fine, she was a little late with the bill - but that's understandable in a Friday night dinner rush.  Assault with self or tray - not so excusable.. . I would go back...but definitely not when it's busy.  I value my body!
