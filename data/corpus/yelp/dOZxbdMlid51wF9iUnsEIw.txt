Two blocks from my house, I get takeout from Joya at least three times a week.  The price is cheap, the portions are huge, and the food is tasty.  All of the noodle dishes are great (the spicy noodle is my favorite) and the curries are good too.  The icing on the cake?  The people that run this place are some of the nicest i've met since eating out in the city (5+ years).  Thank you Joya!
