I have walked by this place a bunch of times, and thought it would be an expensive breakfast place for dinks.  It's not.  Many of the patrons are young families, but it is quite affordable and the quality of food is great.  Not like most breakfast places in the area, you order at the counter.  It's also first come, first serve for seating.   . . The orange brioche french toast was excellent.  The portion was huge!  It was really tasty and put me in a coma.  My male friend (as well as all the other men at the table) ordered the juevos rancheros. Yum!!  Like the French toast, the portion was quite large. Coupled with a cup of intelligentsia coffee, it was a fantastic way to start the day.
