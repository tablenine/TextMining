Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I just thought I'd add my 2-star rating because I agree with so many folks who grudgingly rate this place 3 stars when they meant 2. I was hoping that Casa Bianca would be good since my son lived near here while attending Oxy (and I eventually moved into the area). For background: I'm a former New Yorker (state and city) and have had lots of both mediocre and very good pizza. I have high expectations.. . CB's pizza is ok in kind of a funky local and not-striving way. I've been there a couple of times (take out and sit-down), and find it spectacularly mediocre. Did I miss the best pie? I doubt it, but I'll probably be back to check out, once again, why this place has lines in front of it. I'd love to like it, since it's so close, but my vote, so far, is thumbs down.
