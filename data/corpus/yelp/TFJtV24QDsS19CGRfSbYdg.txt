A place that serves Japanese style chicken wings. . . No. It's not covered in teriyaki sauce, you stupid racist. Instead the wings are dry rubbed with a spicy salts and seasonings and then broiled into nuggets of crispy awesome. . . With Japanese beers on tap and salty wings that are dirt cheap, you can see what potential exists for a vortex of drunken consumption. This is a true after hours place with an accessible taste that is unique but not exotic. I would eat these wings any day over any buffalo style hot wings. . . In addition there is a room in the back with tatami mats where you sit on the floor. I guess it's the touristy feature of the place but I couldn't stand it because I have bad circulation and my legs kept falling asleep. I was drunk, so when I stood up I thought it would be funny to try and run down the hall with numb legs. Not a good idea, I almost snapped my knee caps as my knees would lock up from falling limp. . . This is definitely one of my favorite places in West L.A. as I try to make it there at least once a week.
