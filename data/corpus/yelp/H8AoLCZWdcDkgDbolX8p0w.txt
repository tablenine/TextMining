Some of the best thin crust pizza I've had in Chicago or anywhere else! I've been here 3 or 4 times now over the past 7 months or so and it's consistently delicious!. I came here the first time with a friend who is regular and the owner came to our table and greeted us and was really nice. . My friend ordered the Margherita and I had the Pesto with red onions added. SOOO freakin good! The ingredients are all great quality and the oven they have makes the crust crispy and chewy all at once!. Tonight I came back with two friends, Patti K. and David R.  and they both enjoyed their entrees. The White pizza and a calzone respectively. I didnt try the calzone but the White pizza with the cheeses and herbs was good and not overly cheesey which I liked. My Pesto pizza was awesome as usual!.  I also had the house salad which had a pile of thinly sliced red onions on top. I think a lot of people would have been put off by that  I was excited and ate every last one! . Patti had the caesar salad which was great and the dressing was seriously good. I ended up finishing her salad at the end of our meal while we sat and talked. . The service can be a little kooky but definitely amusing and the owner is always on hand bringing your pizza or even just making sure your drinks are refilled!. Great place for great pizza! And this is from someone who normally does not eat or crave pizza...ever!
