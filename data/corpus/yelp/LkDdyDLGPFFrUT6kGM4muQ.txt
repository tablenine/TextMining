Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Its honestly one of my favorite place to eat around LAX/work.. . Great beer, clean modern decor, its not *a sit down restaurant*  - the food is brought to you though.. . All the food is AWESOME!   Nothing is dry, or taste like a off the shelf.    What I do miss @ veggie grill is real cheese.   Call me old fashioned, but i do heart myself some old school, cow injected cheese!
