Rooftop review.. . I'm skeptical about rooftop bars. They usually have two glaring drawbacks, expensive cocktails and douchebag clientele. Thankfully Rare Bar's rooftop had neither when I visited. The crowd seemed laid back and un-Jersey shore-ish and the drinks were fairly inexpensive and quite big. . . The space itself although not very big, didn't feel very crowded even though there were a lot of people up there, and we were easily able to find a place to sit and enjoy a perfect early summer night. Another problem I usually encounter at places like this is shoddy service, but our server was attentive and always at the ready to fetch me another drink. . . I'll definitely be back.. . And to the girl sitting in my sight line in the extremely ill fitting dress whose boob kept popping out, thanks!
