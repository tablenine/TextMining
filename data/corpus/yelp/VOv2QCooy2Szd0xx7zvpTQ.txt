Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
A friend tried to impress me with Philippe when I visited la la land.  I saw this place many times on food channel.  It was 2 pm in the afternoon.  The line was unbelievable long.  We had to fight for parking at the lot.  The meat is tasty.  But, I wouldn't drive all the way to downtown to get this so called french dip sandwich.  A guy recommended us to get double dip.  A big mistake.  Don't order double dip.  It's too soaky.  Apple pie is so sweet.  Make sure you get insulin shot before having their desert.
