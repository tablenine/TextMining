Category: American (Traditional)
Short and sweet..... AWESOME! (been hittin'-up the place for the past 10 years, and still the same ol', "johnnie's"...shout-out to the Velvet-Assassin in Z-wat!). Nothing better than getting a Johnnie's Pastrami late-night w/ an all ice cream vanilla shake, sitting outdoors next to the blazing fire-pit.. . It is an LA institution.... Do NOT waste your time going next-door to Titos Tacos (tell me their meat doesn't look like Dinty Moore Beef, or Alpo....). . Johnnie's rocks!!!!!!
