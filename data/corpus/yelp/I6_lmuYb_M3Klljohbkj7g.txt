I went on Friday night and there were plenty of people for people-watching, but the restaurant wasn't too crowded.  The food was excellent; I had the Pad Thai and my friend had a curry dish.  Both were excellent.  I would also recommend an order of sticky rice.  The coconut ice cream was good, but I don't think it was the authentic Thai coconut ice cream that is made with coconut milk.
