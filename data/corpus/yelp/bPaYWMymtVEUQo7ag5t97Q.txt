The food is decent here, but don't expect 5 star japanese food.  It's okay.  Most people come here to bask in the ambiance.  You'll be at the peak surrounded by an ocean of lights in a old japanese palace.  . . The sashimi dipped in strong wasabi/soy sauce coupled with a shot or two of saki hits the spot.
