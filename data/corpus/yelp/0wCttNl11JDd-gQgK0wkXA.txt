$49 Three course prix fixe. Fried Lobster, 12oz Boneless Ribeye and Chocolate Toffee Dessert. Russian River Pinot Noir Excellent. Business dinner. I love this place old school power restaurant. All the movers and shakers call this place home! Old school service of which I'm not a fan, very chaotic, servers missed a number of items, cues and overall clumsy. If your not a regular then you get a crappy table to boot. I'll be back business requires it and the food demands it!
