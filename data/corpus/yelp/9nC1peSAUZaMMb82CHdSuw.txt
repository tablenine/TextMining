Whenever I'm in LA, I have to make a stop at El Carmen.  A friend told me about it and I fell in love with the place!  Their margaritas are delicious!  The food is very tasty too!  It's an extremely popular and extremely small place, so prime time is uber busy - expect a wait.  If you can go at off peak hours it's a bit more enjoyable and a great place to chill, chat and have a drink.  You have to make sure to look up to check out the lucha libre wrestling masks on the ceiling. They have tequilas of every kind and the bartenders are usually pretty good at helping you pick one you'll like.
