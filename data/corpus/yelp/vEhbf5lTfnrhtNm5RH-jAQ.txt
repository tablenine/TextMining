My best friend and I came here for lunch this past summer. It was such a nice day so we asked to sit outside. Toast is a cute little cafe with all types of food. We ordered the Tuner Melt and the Steak Sandwich. Both tasted great, but nothing too special in comparison to most cafe foods. What we really came to Toast for was the cupcakes. Toast's dessert selection boasts a variety of items from cupcakes to puddings to cakes and cookies. We were both too full from our meal so we got a vanilla and red velvet cupcake to go. Yum! Toast is a great place for a quick lunch. Nice setting and cute crowd. Very LA-esque.
