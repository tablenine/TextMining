Inexpensive, un-pretentious, tasty.. . There are 3 indian restaurants that I frequent in Atlanta -- Uddipi, Zyka and MSB.  Why?  Between the three, I can get anything I want.  Zyka serves flavourful meat with aplomb.  The decor is cafeteria style -- bright earth tones with no frills.  Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery recall sidestreet dining -- which, for anyone who's ever travelled abroad and eaten abroad adventurously -- knows that, despite the health hazards -- it's the way to go.  . . Like every street side dining joint, you'll wonder at whether food is healthy -- and whether or not you lie to yourself, you'll know deep down that it isn't.  But it doesn't really matter, you tell yourself.  It's really tasty -- and it's just this once.  And then you eat enough for 3.. . If you're bent on gluttony, you can definitely order a lot here -- the base price of any given portion is inexpensive.  The portions of each is also inexpensive.  If you order a couple of these flavourful delights -- and supplement it with starch (rice, biryani, naan, piratha) you'll be full -- and won't have a hypertensive crisis.. . The spice levels here are moderate for an indian place -- so you don't need to fear it particularly.. . -- I suppose the best way to think of Zyka is as a fast food joint.  It's solid, South Asian fast food.. . So solid, that it gets a 5.. . If you absolutely must have real cutlery (use your hands!) and plates, I suggest calling ahead, picking it up, and use your favourite dinner sets.. . Yum...
