I went here for my anniversary a while back and really liked it.  I'm usually not a fan of pork belly but what I had here was amazing.  We had a few fish dishes that were fresh and wonderfully prepared, but what I remember most about this place is the service - so great.  I'll be back as soon as I can scrape together enough cash - it's not cheap.
