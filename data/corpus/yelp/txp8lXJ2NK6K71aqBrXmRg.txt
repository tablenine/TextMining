This was a really fun and different thing to do, but I don't think I ever need to do it again.  The magic was fun--not really better than magic that I've seen at other venues, but cool nonetheless.  Some favorite were Jon Armstrong in the close-up gallery and Kevin Johnson, the ventriloquist.  The close-up gallery was by far the highlight of the evening.. . Overall, though, the night was really expensive.  I took most of the suggestion on Yelp and ordered the prime rib for dinner.  It was very disappointing, especially for $30.  And the accompanying mashed potatos had clearly been flakes (comprised of what substance--plastic, dehydrated potato, we'll never know) earlier in the day.  I adore mashed potatos but didn't even touch these.  Started with the mixed green salad ($6?) and it was completely ordinary.  Between the requisite meal (around $50 with wine, tax, tip), the requisite valet parking ($8), the entrance fee ($25) and all the alcohol (there are bars everywhere--I'll estimate about $30 more for drinks), over $100 per person felt like a lot.. . Perhaps my expectations were too high because I'd been wanting to go for years, and don't get me wrong, I had a great time, but I just don't know that I can highly recommend the experience.
