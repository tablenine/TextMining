Category: Bars
Extremely pretentious unfriendly staff.  Me and my friends were served by the GM and she was a complete bitch to all of us.  She was prompt with her service but did not say one word to us and snatched beers off the table and threw the check at us as if she couldn't wait for us to get out of the bar, even though we spent over $100.  You could tell that we weren't "hipster" enough for her trendy L5P standards.  The bartender was the same way, she looked at me and my friends like we were pieces of shit as we ordered shots from her and tipped her 30%.  WTF!!!!  This is a business people, we are giving you our money, stop acting like you are doing us a favor by serving us!!!!. . WORST NACHOS IN ATLANTA!!!!  I picked up one chip and the entire plate of nachos was stuck to it because the cheese was burnt to all the stale chips.  I've cooked in a bar before and its not that hard to microwave some nachos.  I didn't dare complain though because the GM would have probably had a seizure.  . . DO NOT GO TO THIS UNFRIENDLY UNPROFESSIONAL ESTABLISHMENT.  THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER OPTIONS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE WHERE YOUR BUSINESS WILL ACTUALLY BE APPRECIATED!!!
