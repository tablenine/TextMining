We came here for lunch one afternoon, hungry from walking around downtown. We ordered a deep dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, canadian bacon and fresh tomatoes.. . I'm visiting from the Bay Area, and the deep dish pizza I know (and love) is Zacharys in Berkeley. Their pizza is fantastic! I scarfed down a couple of pieces of Giordano's, and it was fine. I guess I was waiting for that "a-ha" moment considering that Chicago is supposed to be the place for deep dish pizza. Good, but not an "a-ha" moment.
