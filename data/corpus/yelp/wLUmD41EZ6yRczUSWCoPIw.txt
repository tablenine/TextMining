This place is great!  Yes, it's a B-grade right now, but in my limited experience that just means that the food is just as good as a A-grade but you pay about 20% less.  The food honestly doesn't stand out here but that's not to take away from it being very good...just as good as any other Thai restaurant I've been to.  If you love good Thai food for a good price, this is the place.  I like the way it's open late at night and although the waiting staff is not overly eager to please, they definitely put in a solid performance.  I'm also a big fan of the way they have condiments on the table so you don't have to ask for them later.  Ok so the "valet" parking situation may not be ideal, but the value here is just too good to let that stand in your way...and  there's street parking available if you don't want to valet.  The only other complaint I have is that the lights could be a little bit dimmer and they could maybe play some music or something because while we were there late at night, it was VERY quiet...almost too quiet.  We hung around and conversed for quite some time after the meal was over though and the staff seemed perfectly fine with that.  I'd definitely come back!
