Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Their dumplings're probably the best, yes, juicy, delicious, warm, melting when you have your first bite, BUT:. . You are forced to share a table with others. It's awkward to see the couple arguing right on the same table. What am I supposed to do when they're fighting about how to feed that kid inbetween? Like, trying to enjoy my dumplings, not talking to my friend and just doing that eye talking thing?! Come on, I was the neglected child when I was little so no emotional attachment for me Baby. I'm here just for some NSA dumpling fun. I'm too dysfunctional to be close with someone. I can't handle it Honey. There's too much going on. I'm not ready for anything serious at this moment. It's not working out. It's not you, it's me. I just don't think we're right for each other, well, to sit on the same table. You know I care for you but I NEED SPACE!. . And what happens to the waitresses? It's like they're trying to expedite everything the second you step into it and cut the time you stay there to half so they can let more people in. I feel like I'm forced to hurry up to eat my cereal and catch the school bus at 6AM by a group of super nannies or something. I don't care how good their dumplings are. If I don't have enough time to eat them, they do nothing for me.
