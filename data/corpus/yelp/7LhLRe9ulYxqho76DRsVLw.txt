Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I was in the Downtown LA area with some friends today and someone suggested Phillippe The Original.  Parking is conveniently located right across the street and behind the building so its not that bad considering it being in the downtown area.  The restaurant has an nostalgic feel to it, from the outside and right when you first step foot in it (rightfully so since its been around since 1908).  It had many old school photos of trains and Ringling Brother's circus memorabilia. . . Phillipe is located right on the outskirts of downtown area, close to Chinatown and minutes away from Dodgers stadium.  I'm not sure how busy it gets but we got there right after the Dodgers game so it got packed pretty fast.  There were about 6-7 lines with people taking orders, but the lines moved fairly quick.  I ordered a beef french dip sandwich with jack cheese, a pickle and some homemade lemonade.  The woman took my order and prepared it right there so the service was very fast.  Overall the sandwich was good but it didn't have the "WOW" factor...oh yeah, the lemonade was great!! Tasted homemade!  Great atmosphere, they had a bunch of beer so perfect spot to hang out after a game!  Oh yeah, they open from 6am to 10pm and they also serve breakfast!. . What i spent:. Beef French Dip = $5.55. Jack cheese = $0.40. Lemonade = $0.75
