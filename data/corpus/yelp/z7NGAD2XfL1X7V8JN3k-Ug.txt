Delicous cheese breads...I couldn't stop eating them.  The salad bar was pretty good (variety of cheeses, cold cuts, artichoke hearts, make your own salad).  The service was excellent...very courtous and helpful.  When you flip your little round card to the green side, you immediately get swarmed with the 'meat men'.  They come so fast you'd think they get commission for every slice of meat they give out.  If you don't see the meat you want, just ask for it and they'll bring it.  The meats can be a little too salty if you get the crust.  For the most part, they give you the cuts you ask for (med. rare, med. etc.).  Don't come here expecting to get meat cooked exactly the way you want it everytime you ask for it...it's an all you can eat meat buffet, not a high-class steakhouse.  . . We came here for a birthday and they offered us a free dessert.  We chose the flan...came with a candle and 'Happy Birthday' written on the plate  Very good (dense and rich)...goes well with a cup of joe.. . Meal for 2 + 1 coffee = $120.  Reservations highly recommended...they seat you immediately.
