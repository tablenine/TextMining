Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
solid korean bbq place. not the cheapest nor the best in quality but pretty solid. lots of privacy since there are booths, which is ideal if you like privacy when stuffing your face with beef. some people mentioned that their banchan was good. i agree. their beef was aitte - not the best, def not the worst. however, their service was spectacular. they were nice and it's friendly for non-koreans, if you know what i mean. there was a mixed group of koreans vs. non-koreans when i went and groups of 4 or more were the average group size. this place is clean and def. a place you'd take someone who hasn't had kbbq and you want to impress them.
