Perfect place to take a girl on a first date or having lunch with a buddy.  I love the variety of their menu.. Please try the fried "yucca" for appetizer :D you'll love it!  The quality of their meat is outstanding, the portions are generous and the wait time is not bad at all.  Please do yourself a favor and try the bramah (i think is the name) it's a brazilian beer -- what a beer! . . If you like taking risks, try a special pizza for dessert!. . Great food, great people, reasonable price
