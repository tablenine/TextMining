Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's = Instant salivation.. . I love Porto's. They do nothing wrong in my book.. . Must Try's: El Cubano sandwich, potato balls, and the cheese rolls. . . The potato balls and the cheese rolls go for less than $1 each. How can it get any better?!. . Another great thing about this location is the speed in which they work. You decide what you want in line and by the time you get to the front, you know what you want, order, and move on. . . Just wish there was a location on the westside.
