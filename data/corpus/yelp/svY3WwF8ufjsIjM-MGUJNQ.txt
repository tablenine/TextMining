Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canter's is a great spot in L.A. for 24 hour Jewish deli grub. Their breakfasts (and according to a friend, most of their hot meals) are sorta "Meh." But their deli meats and matzo ball soup are fucking awesome. There's a deli and bakery out front. You can walk away with a box of cookies and some super dense rye for cheap.
