Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
Seeing that there are so many great noodle places around Sawtell and West LA, there is no reason to go to Chabuya.  I tried it on their opening week when they only had their famous ramen on the menu, and I was not impressed.. . I brought my grandma and mother who grew up in Japan and they were yawning at the food.. I figured I would give it another chance since it's been open for a few years now, and ate another type of noodle dish (pan fried) and let my friend order the ramen- I was once again disappointed.  . . I am all about the noodles for the ramen - slightly al dente and it should finish "cooking" while you are eating it.  I don't think their noodles taste homemade and it wasn't cooked properly (slightly overcooked).  The soup base too was fairly flavorful with pork, but still the overall seasoning was off.  I would say A on presentation and a D on food which equates to 2 stars in Yelp terms for me.. . I would say pass this noodle bar and move onto the other great places down the street.
