I ate my way through New York...and started out at Resto! What an awesome way to jump start a weekend of feasting my belly. Of all the weekends to come to NY, I chose the rainiest, windiest, and coldest weekends to come. Go figure. . . Came to Resto for lunch and was seated at the bar. This tiny restaurant was warm and cozy and the perfect shield from the cold mucky weather outside. Since I didn't have breakfast, I ordered their hamburger with the fried egg on top. What a creative and delicious concept! The egg was cooked perfectly allowing the yolk to melt onto my burger meat and soak into the perfectly toasted bread. Portions were not huge, but surprisingly very filling. . . Yes, I may have left my heart in San Francisco, but I heart NY.
