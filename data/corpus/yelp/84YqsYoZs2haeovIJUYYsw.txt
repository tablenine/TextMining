A lot of good stuff has been said about Lottafrutta, but I will put in my animal free 2 cents for the kiddies that care about that jazz.... . I haven't felt so rad since being around a few hundred kids yesterday (kid crud loves me) but Zack E. dragged me out with the promise of fresh fruit to boost my immune system.  Thanks man!!. . The owner, Myrna,  is FANTASTIC, I want to be friends with her right now!!  She walked through all the vegan yums she had and surprised me with the fact that her coconut whipped cream is vegan!  Slap that on a cup of fruit and it's pure heaven, I want to eat that every day, seriously.  . . I had the veggie sandwich, and instead of getting it with cheese she replaced it with homemade hummus.  The taste combination of insanely fresh cucumber, tomato, sprouts, avocado, and hummus on her delicious pressed bread is an instant addiction- and I will say no, no, no to that rehab.  . . The best part of the trip ( well, besides the wonderful company of Zack, James H., and Alain L. ) was the vegan ice cream Myrna made for us to try.  It was a type of berry (I will have to get back to you on what it was called) that was sweet, creamy, and pleasantly tart and almost tasted like there was a hint of tea somewhere in the background, it was lovely.  I'm not big on dessert, but the taste was so unique I would love to try it again sometime very soon.. . While settling up, James pointed out the frequent customer card... I now have one and I plan on using it again as soon as possible!!
