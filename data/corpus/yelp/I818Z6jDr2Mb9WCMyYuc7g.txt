alright, this is a tough one for me.  Ate here last week and enjoyed it so much that I decided to take my parents to it when they visited tonight.  They enjoy good food, and there was something about this place that just clicked with me last week.  I thought they would enjoy the authenticity, .....and food. Well,  we walked in and the place was hot, like a sauna, whatever, not a big deal.  SO, we decided to order some oysters (which I tried to order last week, but they forgot to bring them, but not to charge us for them) and they were quite frankly the sickest item I have ever ordered in a restaurant.  Milky, sweaty, absolute sick. I love oysters, and truly appreciate a good one.  Each of the 4 of us tried one, and we had to send them back.  I told her not to worry about bringing out more, I was grossed out.  We ordered the rest of our meal which was pretty good (carne asada, snapper, shrimp, mahi ...tiny mahi) and when the bill came we saw that they charged us for the oysters.  Was a little pissed, but said nothing.  At the same time, the server came up an said she was sorry about the oysters and would take them off.  I was content and watched her go up to the manager, and watched him argue with her.  She than came back and only took off half of the oysters..  Whatever, but the place just let $4 come between me ever going back there.  I am not cheap, the bill was over $100, but just to see that manager argue like we were trying to scam them for 4 oysters completely pissed me off.  Fire that guy and the place has a chance. DO NOT get oysters, and do not expect service that wants you to come back.  $4, and I am this fired up, maybe I am the one with problems here!
