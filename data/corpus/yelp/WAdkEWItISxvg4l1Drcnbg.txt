Restaurant: Atlanta Fish Market Restaurant
Category: Seafood
When I first ate at the Atlanta Fish Market (AFM) in 1995 it was quite the experience: very trendy, exciting, and new. Unfortunately, this restaurant has not kept up with the times and feels stuck in the late 90s. Our evening started on a bad note when the host took our name at 7:20 for our 7:30 reservation booked on OpenTable. I asked when we would be seated and he said "at 7:30." When it became 7:40 and all the folks who were in front of us were seated did I ask "why did it make sense for us to reserve when it seems like you are just taking folks in order." Magically a table opened up and we were seated.. . Unfortunately, we were seated at about the same time as four other tables with the same server, so we all got the same slooooowww service from the robotic server with no personality. It looked like Buckhead Life corporate trainers took any shred of personality he might have out of him he was on auto-pilot so much. The other waitstaff seemed to be the same way.. . We sat at the booth for 25 minutes (menus in front of us) for him to finally come back to say "have you had enough time to review the menu" and take our order. We ordered the "tri-color" chips and artichoke/spinach dip that came with chips that could have come from Publix. The salads were good, but the entrees lacking. We both had the twice-baked lobster and steak, and although we ordered medium-well they came back almost rare. As it took so long to get our food we just ate around the edges of the beef, afraid it would take another 15 minutes to get it right.. . Overall, this restaurant seems to be past it's prime and in serious need of revamping. We have gotten better food with better service and just as nice of an atmosphere at Ruby Tuesday.
