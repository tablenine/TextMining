We arrived at approximately Â 8pm on a Saturday night and were able to be seated right away. In fact, the place was only half full and it is a rather small restaurant. Immediately I felt a good vibe from this place, the atmosphere is relaxing both visually and aurally. . . The guava mojito was like a party in my mouth and I think that overall the frou-frou drink selection is pretty great. . We all enjoyed our meals, the price was reasonable, and the serving sizes were generous.. . The only reason I rate this a 4 instead of 5 is because the basil roll appetizer was bland.
