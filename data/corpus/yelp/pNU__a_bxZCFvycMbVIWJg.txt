Oh, how the heavens have parted (cue birds chirping). While I cannot judge this place on decor, staff and customer service, on thing stands apart....these cheese rolls are to die for. Brought here by the extended Cali family, they were more than a pasalubong (aka filipino gift), they were the epitome of what real bakeries are made of. Its my quest to find the best of THE BEST nationwide. . These simple croissant like Cuban pastries are flakey, airy and light AND (YES AND) have a filling like no other. I tried the ones with a cream cheese filling and the guava filling. The cream cheese was fabulous, not too sweet, not too light with almost a whipped cream texture. Wow!  The guava was good.  Fruity with a tad bit tartness. . . Which of you Chicago Yelpers are going to southern Cali?! Bring me back some pasalubong from this place!!!! Please?
