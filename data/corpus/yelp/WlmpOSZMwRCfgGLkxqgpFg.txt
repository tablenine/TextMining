Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
i love lawry's (pronounced LAO-rees), there's really nothing a guy wouldn't like about this place. The service is A+, the food is A++, and if i had the money i would head over to Lawry's any day. . . From the moment you enter Lawry's, you'd expect to be pampered from head to toe because a luxurious place like this will probably sever your wallet. From beginning to end, i absolutely loved my experience at Lawry's. At the waiting room, meatballs and chips accompany your wait for your table. At the dining table, the lawry cut and creamed corn sent me to heaven. And finally, the bill brought me back from heaven.. . This place is great, the only downside to it is the price. The food they serve is incredible and the service they provide exceeds all expectations. Overall, this place really delivers a great dinner.. . A+
