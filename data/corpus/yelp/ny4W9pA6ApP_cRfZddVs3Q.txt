Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I've lived in LA all my life and I had heard about the Apple Pan, but had never gone. My boss dragged me down there 4 years ago and I am thankful for that.. . Before we went, my boss would talk about how it was his favorite burger, but mostly he would talk about how things were unchanged, the etiquette for waiting for a seat, how these old waiters and cooks had been there forever, and how they had little cones that you put the soda in.. . I really don't care about any of that stuff. All I wanted to know was "Is the burger good?" It was, I would go to say that this is my favorite burger ever.. . The prices aren't cheap, I think my boyfriend and I spend about $40 including tax &amp; tip for 2 cheeseburgers, 1 order of fries, 2 cokes and 2 slices of pie, but it's so good, I think they could charge me just about anything and I would pay it.. . I absolutely love the hickory burger. The fries and apple pie are good but not spectacular.. . This place is cash only, but there's a Wells Fargo ATM across the street.. . You can avoid the wait by going at odd times or calling and ordering it to go. I've never had problems finding parking on the residential side street during the day before 6 PM. After 6, you're not allowed to park on most of the street without a permit so there are only a few spots and you may have to hunt.
