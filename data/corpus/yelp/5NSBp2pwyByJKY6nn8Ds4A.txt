Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Came with JT after we tried to go to the Grilled Cheese Invitational but the line was ridiculously long. After one glance, I knew he wouldn't want to stay and wait, but I just wanted for him to say so (it's better that way haha). So he took me to Pink's. For living in LA my entire life, I can't believe I'd never been here! The line wasn't even that long, but we still waited an hour and a half. How can it take so long to put some toppings on a hot dog? Worth it to go to a LA landmark, but not worth the wait. . . Eating it is messy due to the sheer amount of toppings, which is kind of fun. Sitting outside with four messy hot dogs (chili with onions, mullholland drive, planet hollywood, bacon chili cheese), fries and two glass bottles of Orange Crush (yay! glass bottles and I'd never tried OC before) made for a pretty fantastic Saturday afternoon though.
