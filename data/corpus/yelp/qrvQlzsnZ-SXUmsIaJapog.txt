I met visiting Italian-Filipino friends from London at Cobras Y Matadors, per the recommendation of an LA based friend.  I Yelp'ed the place immediately prior to meeting up with them, to set my expectation level.  What struck me from prior reviews, was the comment on the fake_red_bookshelf... and voila, it was indeed there!  I died laughing inside, it was indeed so fake! . . I agree with the prior Yelpers' feedback .. indeed very loud, indeed quite pretentious, ... the staff was quite uptight and stressed.  I did not get a fun vibe of waiters just wanting to have fun like other places.  They were there for one thing.. to get through the night, it's just another job. . . I enjoyed observing the crowd and vibe of people ...  . . The food was absolutely divine!  We overordered ... my favorites were the skirt steak, rib eye steak, muscles, octopus, I guess, I could say, I liked everything, albeit the fact that it was quite pricey. . . It's a nice introduction for a Northern California Silicon Valley geek to the ambience of our Southern California sister.   . . I'd not go as far as perceiving the people as fake, they simply are different from the San Francisco culture.  I suddenly felt a pang of nostalgia, missing my city by the bay.
