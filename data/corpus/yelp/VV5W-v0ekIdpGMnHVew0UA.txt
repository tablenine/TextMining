Intimate, delicious, well-decorated, and extremely friendly all accurately describe different elements of HB. Let me get one complaint off my chest: the music! Turn it down and suck out the clubbiness and we'll be perfecto!. . Nevertheless, the food was so great and prices so reasonable that the overly loud ambiance is certainly not enough to lose that star. I will admit though I haven't done the BYOB thing too much and it definitely fooled me into thinking the dinner was super cheap! Anyway, Cabsav and Carmenere paired well with all our foods.. . At a birthday dinner for my friend we tried the Artichoke and Date apps and Mussels, Beef Brisket (chef's special), Scallops, Trout, and Lamb Sausage entrees. The artichokes were fried, creamy, and delicious with the garlic aioli. The dates, heavenly, although my company told me Avec's are a league above. The gauntlet is thrown!. . While the mussels were mine I had a taste of everyone's mains, and each delighted my palate. After getting past about ten mussels, buried deep in my bowl I found the ambrosia broth of beer, butter, and whatever else goes in. Mussels soaked in this stuff were noticeably more decadent and while the first layer smelled and tasted SO good, those that were soaked were divine.. . Come dessert time we decided on one of each of the Pomegranate Bread Pudding and some Brownie-type dish (Churros?). I preferred the former but both were to die for. A bit of unexpected peanut butter flavor was in the brownies.. . Mayhaps my complaint on the sound is ignorant as HB is smack dab in Boystown. However loud and obnoxious a few of the tracks can get, all else is great.
