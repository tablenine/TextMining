Restaurant: Marietta Diner
Category: Diners
Wow!! After watching Guy Fieri rave about this place on Food Network, we decided to immediately drive to Marietta for Sunday dinner.  This place doesn't disappoint.  Although the parking lot was crowded, we got seated immediately upon entering the building.  Before our glasses of water arrived, they'd already set out spanakopita as a sampler (and it was good!).  We spent about 10 minutes trying to wrap our heads around the insanely huge menu, but then we all ended up going for different specials of the day.  My meatloaf platter was rock solid and my son's lobster ravioli was sublime.  My wife ordered tilapia, thinking she would be eating light, so she was a little disappointed when it came out swimming in a lemon-butter sauce.  I told her you go to a diner to eat big portions of goodness, not to eat healthy.. . Although we were stuffed by the time we finished the entrees, we'd been drooling over the cakes since we arrived, so we all got dessert to go.  The cakes alone are worth the drive to Marietta Diner!  Standing about 3 feet tall and weighing in at 100 pounds each (okay, maybe not quite this big, but close!), these cakes were the picture of decadence.  Must... try... cake.
