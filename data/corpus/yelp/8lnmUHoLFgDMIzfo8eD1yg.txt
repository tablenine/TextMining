i have been here twice now with decidedly mixed results.  the first time was pretty good, but by no means remarkable.  went with a group of 5 and the sandwiches where solid, the french toast was excellent, very good stone ground grits with smoked bacon and cheddar, and pretty good egg dishes (nothing great though).  all-in-all after my first visit it did seem like a mixed bag, but worth trying again because some of the items were notable.. . went again for easter brunch and it was way below par.  the only thing positive i can say about it was the coffee was pretty good.  i had poached eggs with their roasted potatoes and was really disappointed.  the potatoes were particularly disappointing.  clearly not made to order and half of my order was inedible from being overcooked/burned (why i'm guessing they were pre-made/reheated was that despite half of the order being overdone, they were still lukewarm to cold... i also had my favorite item from the first visit again (the grits with bacon and cheese) and it was like a completely different dish. where the first time the dish was nearly perfect, this time it was watery, overly sweet, and i could barely recognize any cheese.  it was so sweet and watery. in fact, that it tasted more like creamed corn than grits.. . anyway... i have heard mostly good things about this place so i can only imagine that i either got this place on a bad day (or the emperor has no clothes).  perhaps i will try again because of its reputation, but i can't wholeheartedly endorse this place from my experience.. . my suggestion... if you're going to go, stick to the french toast.
