For some reason I remembered my friend saying how great Crust was so I went here on a date a couple of weeks ago...I forgot the fact that he also said it was expensive...oops.  . . When we first sat down we were asked what kind of water we would like "Tap or Distilled?"...we just gave each other a dumbfounded look and said "Uh...tap?", and they promptly took away the fancy glass bottle of water on our table.  We had been wondering what the purpose of that was...I think it's funny that they take it away though since there's one on every table when you sit down.. . I got the Shroom pizza which was delish, but you could pretty much put mushrooms on anything and I'd love it.  Can't remember what my date got but he liked his a lot as well.. . We also each got a couple of beers.  Can't remember the name (yes, I have memory issues) but it's the one that they pour in the glass while holding the bottle upside down and keeping it slightly under the liquid so the perfect foam forms.  It was pretty cool and we each ordered another just so we could see the pour again.  I think we may have been a little TOO entranced by the whole thing, but hey, I'm easily amused.. . I think we got the same waitress as Nico M...haha....she WAS very friendly...and a great beer pourer.. . When the bill came it was like $60 which to me seemed like a lot and made me feel really guilty when he wouldn't let me pay any of it.  Overall, great food, good service, but a little pricey.
