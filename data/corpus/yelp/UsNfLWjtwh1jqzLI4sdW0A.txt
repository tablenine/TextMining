Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I would eat sushi for breakfast, lunch and dinner. After trying Toro I do not want to go anywhere else in Chicago to eat sushi. I go by myself, with friends, with dates, co-workers.....just LOVE IT! Mitch is so nice, every time I go there he gives me something different to try. Every single roll has different flavors and awesome tasting. The place is small and is always so busy. If you decide to go there around 5pm is a perfect time to get a table without waiting and even if you wait is going to be worth it. . . I understand some people complaint about the fact the place is so busy and allow only one bottle for every 2 person...but there is a reason for that: the place is small and has only few tables. If you hang out for a long time other people would not have a chance to eat there. And if Mitch expands he would not be the only one making sushi to supply the demand. Be nice if you want to eat good sushi!!. . Yelpers you should try! Highly recommend!!!! ;)
