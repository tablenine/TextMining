Definitely try it.  I liked all of the stuff.  And I listened to Yelpers here.  We had the Prosciutto e Mozzarella alla Ferri, Carpaccio, the Pollo Afumicatto, the Ravioli con Vittelo, and Angelotti Zuca (see . http://www.buona-terra.... ).  My favorite was the butternut squash ravioli.  Very simple brown butter sauce with fried sage leaves was the perfect complement.  Another example of less is more.  I think the chicken was good, but I kinda think the cream sauce on the other ravioli dish was so good I wish I had got the rigatoni with prosciutto, peas, and cream sauce.  Overall very good.
