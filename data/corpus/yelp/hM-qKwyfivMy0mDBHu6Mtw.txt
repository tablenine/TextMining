Restaurant: Bone Garden Cantina
Category: Mexican
Based solely on the feel of the decor and the charm of this place, it is nothing but exceptional. Since I didn't actually eat during my first visit to Bone Garden, I can't say anything about the food, but the service was top notch, and the drinks were well priced and the Sangria was very tasty. . . I would definitely go back here if for no other reason than to gaze upon all of the amazing day of the dead art that fills this place to the brim. It is kitschy, and so fantastical, that I couldn't get enough. Perhaps I'll get back over to the west side for dinner at some point in the near future, and I can check out the food of this marvelous establishment... if it's anything like the charm of the place, it is bound to be great!
