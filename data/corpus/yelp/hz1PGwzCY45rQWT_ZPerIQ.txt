I really wanted to like this place I swear. Â I've been bugging my husband about coming here for weeks now, so Today we finally made the trip. . Hubby got the Bayou Chicken, at first he suspected that the waitress who brought it just got off a smoking break or something cuz the chicken patty smelled and tasted like smoke(like really bad smoke/cigarette flavor), but another guy in our party got the same thing and said his patty smelled like smoke too. on top of the bad flavor, the chicken was also luke warm, made it taste like a soggy cigarette butt. yuck. . I got the chipotle bbq, actually pretty tasty, but again i did not like the temperature of the food. . The only good thing that I liked here was the sweetheart fries, but i can get that at the counter in the same plaza.
