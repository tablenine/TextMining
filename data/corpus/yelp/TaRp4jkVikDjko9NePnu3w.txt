Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
what a great place to eat! I went there after Lollapalooza with a friend and we were delighted by the whole experience: 50's style, movie-set decor, great and relaxing retro music, friendly service, personable like you entered someone's tavern, and the food was qualitatively tasty. Sure the theme is a diner, but I realized this is a City Diner, so it's quite a notch above what one would expect. I had the best baked mac n' cheese I' ve ever had. And as a French person I never guessed I would ever bother giving two thoughts about something like a mac &amp; cheese dish. Oh well, so be it. The whole dinner was excellent. They also have a deli and lots of original beverages. Anyway I'll have to go back cause there're much more for me to try and explore.
