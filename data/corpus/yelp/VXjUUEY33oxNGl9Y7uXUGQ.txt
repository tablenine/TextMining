My friend, who was visiting from Los Angeles, read about this in a magazine and insisted we check it out at 2 am last night. I"ve never seen anything like this...the waitress was out of control as she screamed obscenities at us. My buddy got into it, but I was a little weirded out and just wanted my hot dog. Â The hot dog was amazing- can't remember the last time i had something that good.
