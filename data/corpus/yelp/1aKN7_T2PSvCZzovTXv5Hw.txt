There is almost always a long line here, and for good reason - there's some pretty good ramen here. It's a very rich pork broth, excellent noodles, and an underrated tasty whole egg. The broth is made from kurobuta pork....can't beat that. Â They also have an appetizer with this work that is worth a try.. . Not everyone knows that there's actually a large size that you can order - if you're hungry, give it a go.. . The rice dishes are quite good as well, but its hard to stray away from the ramen.
