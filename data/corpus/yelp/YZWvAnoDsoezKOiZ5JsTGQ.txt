Our second visit to Highland Bakery was even better than our first, since we got to eat outside with our new puppy!  Service was great, and boyfriend enjoyed the peanut butter french toast every bit as much as he did the last time.  I ordered differently, opting for the cilantro corn pancakes.  They were HUGE, and really yummy--they could have used a bit more cilantro (I'm obsessed with that flavor), but the egg on top was perfectly cooked and the salsa was fabulously spicy.  The beans were cooked a little more this time, which I liked.  OJ tasted like fresh-squeezed.  My only complaint: for a place with outdoor seating that allows dogs, some of the staff members seemed very anti-pooch, almost like it was an annoyance to have the animals around.  I'm not someone who HAS to bring her dog everywhere, but I generally like dog-friendly places to act...well...dog-friendly!
