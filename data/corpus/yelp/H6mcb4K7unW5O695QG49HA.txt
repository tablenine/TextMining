My first review of Pho Cafe was five stars. Best Vietnamese food in LA.. My second review of Pho Cafe was one star. Slowest and least attentive service in LA.. Tonight I went back a third time. Food was still amazing. Service still really slow and inattentive. At least this time I wasn't with out-of-town guests I was trying to impress, so I suppose that leveling off with three stars seems fair.. Seriously, can't they just GO to a restaurant with good service, see what that looks like, and emulate it? Please?
