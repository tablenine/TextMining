Hands down some of the best sea scallops I have had in a long time!  Growing up eating oxtail I did not know what to expect with combination. But the mix of richness from the braised oxtail and the simplicity of a perfectly cooked scallop made an amazing dish.  I really could eat plates of this stuff!  Service was great and overall I had a very enjoyable dinner here.  I would highly recommend Spring for a nice dinner out.
