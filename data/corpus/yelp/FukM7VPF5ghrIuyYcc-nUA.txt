Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
#3 - 2 waffles with 1/2 chicken (dark meat please!). Best (and only) 1500+ calories that I will ever eat in one sitting. . . I dream about the juicy fried chicken and the soft light airy waffles. I drool as we get closer to it. I get faint as we walk in, sit down and order (though I could just be lightheaded from having starved myself for the day to make sure that I had room to eat every last bit). I embarrassingly grunt and moan in pleasure as I finish every last bite. Would anyone see if I licked the plate clean? Would anyone mind? I don't care. . . I keep telling myself I'll have something else on the menu, but I never seem to see anything past "Chicken and Waffles". Ah well. Roscoe's is one of the few reasons why I would contemplate moving down to SoCal.
