Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
It was late at night and my friend decided to take me to Roscoe's.  I have heard so many great things about this place and I had high expectations.  The place looks like a hole in the wall and apparently, this was the original Roscoe's.  They were pretty busy at 1am but we were seated quickly and the service was good.  I got the Herb's special which was a half a chicken with 2 waffles.  I've never had waffles with fried chicken but now I am a fan!  The waffles were really soft and thin and delicious.  I don't think you can really go wrong with fried chicken unless it's too dry but this place hit the spot.  The gravy and fries were also really good.  The prices aren't cheap and I ended up spending about $18 but it was worth the experience.  I would definitely check this place out again but for that price, I would rather get all you can eat korean bbq at one of the many places in LA.
