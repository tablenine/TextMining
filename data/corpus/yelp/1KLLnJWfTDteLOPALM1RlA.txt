Our answer to the New York deli . The place hasn't been redecorated since the 30's , the cash station in the corner is the only indication you are in the 21st century. BIG sandwiches , great corned beef, good pastrami, a large variety of sides from pickles to kraut and potato pancakes. They also have some stuff I'd never order there like egg salad and tuna sandwiches , they all looked fine but they are not made from cooked cow , so screw them. The Matzo soup was standard , the Turkey (the wife's leftovers of course) was good. If you come here , be hungry.
