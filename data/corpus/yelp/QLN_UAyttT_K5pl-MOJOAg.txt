i guess it's a trend to have cupcakes and hot dogs in every city alive... and here goes one for LA.... . 4.5. . fabulous hot dogs ... quite a variety. you have THEE choice of picking 2 toppings, whether it be caramelized onions/sauerkraut AND sweet/spicy peppers.... . . hot dogs range from $6 (for a classic like a bratwurst) to a gourmet ($6.50) which is something like a filipino marharlika to something quite exotic which is roughly $8 and i mean ExOTIC! they have buffalo beef, duck, rabbit, ceal, rabbit, alligator and rattlesnake... hahaha. GROSS but NEAT.... . . dont forget to get a side order of some bomb diggity BELGIAN fries.... and now for you drinkers, you're ON for some belgian/german drafts and more! cheers!
