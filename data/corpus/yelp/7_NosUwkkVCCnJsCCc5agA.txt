Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Problems with Kopi Cafe:. .  It fills me with more: . . ...Wanderlust than my schedule can handle; . ...Product lust than my wishlist or wallet can bear;. ...Tasty goodies than my metabolism can process;. ...Caffeinated beverages than is medically advised.. . The only thing it doesn't fill me with is.... . wi-fi. Free, delicious wi-fi.
