I've just changed to a 2.5 star rating... I called for delivery expecting a $10 minimum, but they told me it was $15. As much as I like food, that's just way too much for one person. Instead, they tell me to pick it up and I do. However, when I arrive they tell me that they also don't accept credit cards for under $15. That would've been useful information over the phone when they told me about delivery. Â They tell me to use the ATM which would've equaled an extra $5 with the ATM fees and my bank Fees. Very Frustrating.
