Liked this place much better last week than the first time I went several years ago.  Easy walk from the Arclight multiplex.  No reservations, but we (my wife &amp;I) ate @the bar comfortably w/out any wait whatsoever.  My king salmon was AMAZING.  Sushi-grade..Fabulous bar selection, right up there w/Grace's.  All drinks were deftly made.  The best gin (Aviation) martini I've ever had.  Nice, slightly older-skweing atmosphere.  Will definitely check The HC out again very soon.
