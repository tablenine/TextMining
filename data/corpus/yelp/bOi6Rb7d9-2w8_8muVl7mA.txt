It's been years since I have been to Langers!  Probably 25 years, at least.  Traveling to New York multiple times a year over the past several years my love for Pastrami was reinvigorated when a friend took me to, what he considers "Pastrami Mecca", Katz's deli.  I have to agree with him that Katz's is "Pastrami Mecca", but we must change the name to "Pastrami Mecca - East".. . About a month ago I started having follow up appointments with a physician near downtown LA not to far from Langers...so, being so close to Langer's every few weeks requires a stop for a pastrami sandwich!. . "Pastrami Mecca West" is Langer's.  No doubt about it!  It is absolutely the best pastrami sandwich in Los Angeles.  Just writing this review thinking about Langer's pastrami is setting off my mouth like Pavlov's dog!  The pastrami is hand carved perfection served on warm rye with crispy crust.  I like to top it with slaw and mustard...it is absolutely heavenly!
