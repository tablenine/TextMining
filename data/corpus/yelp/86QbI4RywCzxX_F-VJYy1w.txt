went there for dinner the other night and sat outside. first off, the service was wonderful. our server was great and very attentive. she took our drink orders quickly and answered all our questions.  the food, on the other hand, is not that good.  i ordered the fish tacos and they were not good at all..go to adobo grill down the street for much better fish tacos.  someone ordered mac and cheese and it was cold..i have had much better. 2 people at our party ordered burgers and they were satisfied. the atmosphere is great, food not so much! love the womens bathroom!
