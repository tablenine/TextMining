seems like i should have ordered a cupcake!. . instead i tried to be somewhat healthy and shared a taragon chicken salad + prosciutto mozz w/o roasted peppers sandwich with a friend.  the salad was quite good...the apples were a nice touch.  the 'wich tho needed some FRESH prosciutto.  it was super red and just looked like it was about to be expired.. . i think i'll go back when im 15 lbs. lighter and share a cupcake.
