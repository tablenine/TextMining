So we went there for dinner on a thurs night and i have to say they were fairly busy..and now I see why....... The decor was great, swanky, modern but still welcoming. I have to say the other patrons were more on the wannabe socialite side...but more entertaiment for me!. Okay so down to the serious side...Our server was very friendly, helpful, gave us recommendations since it was our first time there. Â I had the French 75 martini which was delicious, I NEVER order a girlie kind of drink but this was tasty, my bf had a dirty martini (he had a long week) and that was also good. . We had the octopus app, which was tender and at the same time the tentacles were perfectly charred....so good.. I had the skate wing which was cooked to perfection and was very light yet flavorful...my bf had the shortribs which I will have the next time I'm there, they were delicious!. The wine/drink list had a lot of options, had a vin santo with my pastry dessert..filled with figs, chocolate and pinenuts, I enjoyed that it was like a homemade dessert.. Now I have to go back and try the alledged delicious flatbreads with a French 75.
