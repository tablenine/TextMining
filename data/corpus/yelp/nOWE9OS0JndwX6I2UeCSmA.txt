I've been to Sola twice, once last summer and again last night. I really like this place. I've had consistently good food, great service - not overbearing. From start to finish - Â we walked in and they checked our coats, a few minutes after we sat down we were given a lovely oxen amuse bouche (delish and JUST the right thing to whet our appetites), the service from the waitstaff was fantastic, and a genuine thanks from the host as we left! . . I tend to judge places on how well the waitstaff is able to pair wines with what I'm thinking about ordering. Last nights pairing of the Meritage ($11/glass) w/ the Tuna was perfect! Thanks to Wendy for that great suggestion. It's a little more expensive side ($45-50/pp) but for the yumminess of the food, wine and really great service, it's totally worth it. I can't wait to try it out for brunch!
