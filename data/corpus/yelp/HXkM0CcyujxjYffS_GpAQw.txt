I always walk out of here with a smile on my face and a bounce in my step. . . Could be the strawberry/cream cheese roll, the potato balls, the cheese rolls, the sandwiches, and all the lovely pastries that are making its way through my digestive system *shrugs* One thing's for certain though, I'm in love.
