OK.  This place is just awesome.  There is no other word to describe it.  The pizza is great and the service is fantastic.  We were there one evening while it was snowing and had a table by the window.  With all the Christmas lights on and the wood paneling, I felt like I was in some ski lodge in Aspen rather than on Clark St.  All I needed was a roaring fireplace.  . . A glass of wine is a FULL glass, which was awesome.  You never get that very often anymore.  . . And to all the haters out there, you all are just sore because there is a "way" and a "system" about this place that you either didnt know about or chose to ignore, such as:. . The mushrooms are a cool feature- where else do you get a whole mushroom rammed inside a pizza?  If it is so upsetting to you, you CAN order it WITHOUT them!  Whoa, what a concept!  BTW, the way these pies are made is GENIUS and why noone has copied them by now is mind-boggling.  The crust is flawlessly baked and soft, and everything just falls into place perfectly once removed from the bowl.  Can you also say boo-yeah to a rockin meat sauce?  Its almost better than homemade!. . The interior rocks, it is Old School Chicago and probably hasnt been touched since it opened in '72.  Yes, it could be bigger, but whatever.  Just dont go at 7:30pm on a Saturday when it's at its craziest and you can get in and be served in no time.  There.  Problem solved.  . . Dont come in all prima-donna and peeved that they only take cash or its first-come-first-served basis.  Again, too bad.  If its that tragic you can order take out from Domino's.  . . Its these little idiosyncracies that make this place excellent and a real treat.  Pies can also be purchased frozen to go.
