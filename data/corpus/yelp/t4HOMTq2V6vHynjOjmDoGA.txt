My most recent trip may be my last, at least for dinner. . . First - the Atmosphere: Atrocious. I felt like I walked into an episode of the Real Housewives of Â New York. Sagging chins and errant fat rolls were everywhere I looked. Of particular note was the soccer mom wearing Tevas and the group of grandmas snapping pictures in front of the bar.. . Second - the Food: The arugula/fennel, and parmesan salad with citrus dressing, which used to burst with flavor, tasted more like a dry Dole Salad Pack. The rest of my meal was fine, but forgettable.. . Third - the Staff: Clearly NY's A-list actor/waiter population has moved on. Rohit poured our drinks, Beshir brought the bread, and Singh took our order. . . Another NY institution in decline.
