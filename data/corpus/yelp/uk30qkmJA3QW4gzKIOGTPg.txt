This is my "go-to" breakfast for dinner place in LA. I went here with my cousin for dinner. :) I've been here for dessert &amp; coffee before, but never for "dinner".. . Because I love cobb salads &amp; omelettes, what a perfect combo when they had the cobb omelette on the menu! It indeed tasted like a cobb salad but omelette style. Very good! It came with sweet potato fries. Also excellent! Their water counter is pretty cool because you can add lemon, lime or orange wedges to your cup. LOL!. . Their menu has a wide selection of sandwiches, salads, burgers, etc. Not to mention dessert, coffee. . . It's a great place to dine, people watch (in trendy Los Feliz) whilst grubbing on breakfast in their outdoor patio. I've only been here on a weekday/evening - I can only imagine how busy it gets on weekends.
