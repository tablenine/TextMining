I miss plates.. There's something about eating out of a paper lined metal bucket.... (don't think about the crud from everyone else's food in there, don't think about the crud from everyone else's food in there). The service was really friendly even for a madhouse of a Monday lunch hour. . I wouldn't go back as there were too many tables for a small space, the food was mediocre and there are so many more restaurants to try for the first time still waiting for me.
