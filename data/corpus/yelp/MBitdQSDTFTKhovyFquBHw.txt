This would be the first of two places I visited this weekend because Lula closed shop starting at 2:30 on Sunday. So it wasn't a first choice, is what I'm trying to say.. . The patio was really lovely because, although it was hot as hell in the sun, at 2:30 p.m. the patio was in the shade. We had brunch and, as noted by other reviewers, the potatoes were amazing. Like... I want to eat a meal composed solely of those potatoes. Like those potatoes could make me orgasm the first time we slept together, defying all odds. I am in love with those potatoes.. . Otherwise, I had the special, which was like this salmon cake benedict thing, which was pretty good. There were cute dogs on the patios, which I enjoyed. Our waitress was very, very nice and pretty attentive. So between her and my new boyfriend Mr. Potatoes, 4 stars.
