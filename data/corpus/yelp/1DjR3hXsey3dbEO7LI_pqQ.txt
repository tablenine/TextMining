Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
The meat is tasty but the quality isn't great.  Get ready for the loud, obnoxious techno bday song as it seems like they blast it every 5 minutes.  It's a fun place for bdays since it can accommodate large groups, but there are better AYCE Korean bbq joints out there.
