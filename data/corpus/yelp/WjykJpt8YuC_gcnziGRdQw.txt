Went here last night and absolutely loved the food.  We started with the tuna tartar -"the standard on which all tartar is judged" boasted our server - Well then.  The whitefish and beef brisket were both fantastic.  . I would have given this restaurant 5 stars but I had to remove one for the restaurant's attitude towards our groupon.  We purchased a $80 gift certificate for $40 and our server let us know this multiple times.  I get it, you want to be tipped on the full amount-don't need to treat us like hicks because you had other tables stiff you on a $8 tip.  Your restaurant was the one who sold 5,000 groupons, no need to make me feel like a cheap for using it.
