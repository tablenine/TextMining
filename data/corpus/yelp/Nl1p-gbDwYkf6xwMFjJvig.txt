Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
By far, the biggest burrito I have ever had in my life! Cheap price, good service, EXCELLENT food. Remember to give the fries a try. I shared a burrito with 2 others and we barely skimmed the half way line at the end of our meal. This is how good their burrito is- my sister who has been a vegetarian for well over 2 years was one of those 'others' who shared the BEEF burrito with me. MMHMM! That is ALL I need to say. Try it and you won't regret it. I promise you. BEWARE! Lines are long! So if your planning on a quick meal, avoid El Tepeyac. I suggest you give this place a try when you have friends(who can eat :P), time, and a mighty appetite.
