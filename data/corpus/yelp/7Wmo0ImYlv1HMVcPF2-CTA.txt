The sushi is good and very cheap. The service was excellent as we were attended to by our server, the sushi chef and the manager. The place was packed and there was a lot of energy in the crowd! We went on a Saturday night and it's definitely not the place to go for a quiet romantic dinner, but if you're looking for good cheap food and a great time it's definitely worth a shot.
