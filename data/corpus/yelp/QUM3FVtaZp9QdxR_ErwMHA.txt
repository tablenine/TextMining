Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Last Saturday, my friend suggested we grab a bite at Umami Burger before heading downtown for some beats and booze at the Doheny. He'd been to Umami twice already, and guaranteed I'd like it. When we arrived around 9pm, the small lot was full, so I added our name while he looked for street parking. The wait was twenty minutes, but that was OK since it gave us time to pick up a couple of tall Asahis at the Food Mart down the street. We found out later it'll be BYOB for some time; Umami won't be getting their beer and wine license for months.. . We each ordered an Umami Burger, and split a Hatch Burger. The Umami definitely lives up to the hype, a delicious blend of ingredients that really achieves that elusive fifth taste (aka "umami") that the owner strives for. The Hatch was perfectly spicy, topped with various chopped and roasted chiles. It's good but not at the level of the signature Umami. We weren't asked how we wanted the meat cooked, but the burgers came out medium rare, just the way I like 'em. The fries were more of an afterthought, nothing special. The homemade ketchup wasn't all that, either. My friend later told me the sweet potato chips were good. Naturally he didn't say anything *before* I got the fries; thanks, dude.. . I can't wait to go back and try the other burgers: the Truffle, the Triple Pork, or maybe the Seared Ahi special if it's available. We overheard several guests say "this is the best burger in L.A.," and at the moment it's hard to disagree. The much-needed patio should be open any day now, so those of you who've put off visiting because you don't want to wait, get on down there!
