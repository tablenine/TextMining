They are a small Japanese cafe in Lil Tokyo and have been there for YEARS.  They offer a variety of food so I am sure that you will find something there that you like.  They are open very late so a great place to go after a late night out and you want to get something to eat.  . . This is my favorite place for Ozoni (Mochi or Rice Cake) soup.  This is a traditional soup that they serve on New Years day in Japan.  They have it year round here, but you have to ask for it because it is not on the menu.
