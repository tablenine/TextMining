I was looking for a place to meet our DePaul Student Children for brunch, and we really LOVED it.  The food was EGGcellent as was the service and the staff.  Jill treated us royally.  We will definitely be back for the stuffed French Toast, the eggs benedict and the cozy atmosphere.  I am only sad we didn't find it sooner.
