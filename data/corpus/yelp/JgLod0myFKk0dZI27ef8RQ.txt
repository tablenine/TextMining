My favorite boy brought me here for my birthday, because he knew that I had been wanting to try the Gluten-Free menu.. Of course it was raining like cats and dogs when we arrived, but we were stubborn and chose not to wait in the Valet line of cars that was like 10 deep. We each detest unnecessary valet, but the Valet Gods got to us, as we were both looking like drowned rats as we entered the restaurant.. We were seated in a clam shell shaped booth, which had a view of the busy, yet somewhat cramped interior. I really liked the decor, I guess it was designed with a 1940's era theme in mind. I think I would have enjoyed living during that era...so, so glamorous.. I ordered the Oven Roasted Lemon Pepper Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and it was over the top delicious. The chicken was very tender and juicy. Like it's name, it had a great lemony and pepper flavor, minus the over salting that so many other places tend to do. I need to figure out how it was prepared, so I can enjoy it more often. . The boy had his usual Prime Rib with French Fries and he said it was very tasty. One of these days, I will talk him into trying something different.. It was a very lovely dinner, despite the fact that we were both quite damp from the rainstorm. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu, as well as the cocktails that others have mentioned.
