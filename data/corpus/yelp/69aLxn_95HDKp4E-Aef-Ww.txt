I have had some great experiences here and some bad ones as well.  Getting a table here on a weekend is horrendous and sometimes, not even worth the wait. (I could have sat down faster at Barney's Beanery down the street and be served and well fed before sitting down at the Yard House.)  On weekends, it is best to get there 1 hour earlier than you want to dine, especially if you have large groups.  I usually come with at least four people, so it gets frustrating waiting for 1.5 hours for a table.  . . Aside from overcrowding issues on weekends, the food is either good or really bad.  I find that the appetizers are better than the dinner entrees.  I enjoy eating the lettuce wraps with shiitake and portabella mushrooms, the Hawaiian poke stack, grilled Jamaican wings, and the lobster, crab, &amp; artichoke dip.  Happy hour is good because they offer 1/2 priced appetizers and drink specials.
