This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants. The atmosphere is warm and cosy and in the summer, you can sit outside. As others have mentioned, the spread that comes with the bread is delicious, it's hard not to eat too much to leave room for dinner. I'm definitely a new tastes, new experiences kinda girl, but I have to admit, every single time I go, I get the same thing because it's that good. The Pennine al'Arabiata Â is. pennine pasta tossed with fresh herbs, garlic and a touch of spicy tomato sauce and is definitely my favorite here.
