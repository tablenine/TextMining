I had the beef sandwich and I took a bite of my friend's ham sandwich - the beef one tasted better because it had more flavor.  We had their mac salad and the potato salad too - those were alright: nothing to write home about and their regular cheesecake was better than their blueberry cheesecake.  . . I recommend coming here during the day.  We went at night and they had ran out of half of their menu, like everyone says, this is one popular place.  At least we didn't have to wait in line.  =)
