Fun place to go for late night food especially on the weekends.  Watching drunk people stumble through the door and banter with the women behind the counter does have a certain appeal at that time of the night.  But a person can only take so much.  When it comes to the food, the dogs are decent but nothing special.  Don't head here during the day cause they didn't build a reputation on food
