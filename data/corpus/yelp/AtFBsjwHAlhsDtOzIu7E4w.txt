Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Booya! I love Father's Office and I especially love the one in the City of Culver (that's the hip way of saying Culver City, if you didn't already know.) . . The Culver location is just way better than the other location. It's bigger and there are no lines, which means you can actually sit down and enjoy your expensive ass burger. Instead of shoving it down your throat while a bunch of hungry vultures wait for your table. . . The food is clearly the bomb. I always split a burger with a friend and split the sweet potato fries. It cuts down on the cost and you are definitely still stuffed afterwards. . . I am not a beer drinker but when I go there I always have one. Just tell the bartender what flavors you like and they will hook you up with something nice.. . Don't be fooled by what other people say ... This is the best burger in LA.
