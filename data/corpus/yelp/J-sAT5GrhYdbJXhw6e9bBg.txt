Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
First things first, I LOVE GARLIC!. . I came in for a family members birthday and we all ordered and shared off each other so I got a good taste of a lot of the menu. The crab and clam dish was awesome, the free flowing bread with the oil to dip in was fantastic, and the ice cream was surprisingly yummy! Who would of thought of vanilla ice cream topped with a garlic sauce?? . . I love the decorations in the dining area, custom trim for the booths gave it a very eclectic feel.. . The front area sells many garlic knick knack's and amongst those knick knack's are condoms for sale, which I guess are there because after eating all this garlic you can't help but to get it on!. . The bartender was really nice and gave us pickled garlic which tasted soo good with my martini.. . Definitely worth going at least once to try out the garlic awesomeness of The Stinking Rose!
