Yes, Lauren S, that is a 5-star burger!  . . When the food at Vita was nothing to write home about, and it got too hot, even inside with the air conditioning, we headed down the street to H&amp;F.  . As we drove past on our way into the deck, I was quite taken by the decor of this semi-hidden gem - dark and clean with steel and black, and of course, all the meat hanging in the windows/walls.. . We headed straight for the bar area, since we were here for the famous burger.  We sipped some delicious cocktails as Lauren told us all about why this burger is so amazing and all the ritual of burger time.  While waiting Tulie enjoyed the pate - great texture and flavor, but ask for more toast points - and Katie had the deviled eggs, which looked delicious.  . . I was impressed by the pricing - this is all quality stuff that some in Atlanta would be willing to pay a premium for, but they don't have to.. . Finally, after several minutes of sitting anxiously with the ridiculously aromatic small of cooking meat wafting through the area, the burgers arrived.  Lauren was kind enough to share, because I was quite full, so I only had two bites, but those were two D@MN good bites!  The juicy flavor of burger and cheese and onions and home-made mustard was a 10-star combination! Especially that mustard.  Seriously, I almost walked out with the mustard cup in my purse - it's got great texture - not runny, but not really grainy - and amazingly fresh tartness. . . I can't wait to bring my husband here.  I know I'll get the burger, but the other food on the menu sounded delicious as well, so we might have to warm up with some small plates before burger time.  Then again, it's one good burger, so maybe we'll just watch the rest of the restaurant eat the other food and save our stomachs for the real thing.
