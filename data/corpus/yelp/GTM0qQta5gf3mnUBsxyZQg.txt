Atmosphere - A+. Service - B . The meat waiters check to see if your on green/red 85% of the time. I had to flag one down to get my meat.. Salad Bar - A- great variety and quality, but who likes cold asparagus?. Meat - B+ some meats seemed a bit too salty.... . for the price they charge, hot asparagus would be nice...and less salt please...more flavors.
