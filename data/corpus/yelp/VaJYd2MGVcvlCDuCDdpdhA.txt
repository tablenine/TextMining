How do you give 1/2 stars?  Right.  You don't.  So here's the deal:  it's a handsomely finished coffee shop but it's still a coffee shop which means taste trumps decor.  Not sure if it was just the day -- coffee was subtle, but not great (slightly sharp).  The vanilla syrup used for the flavored lattes (my friend ordered one) has a curiously good taste.  Stronger than I'm used to, but that's cool b/c the flavor was distinct.  If I was the sort to order vanilla lattes, this is a good place to do it.. . I'd like to give extra points for the barista remaking my friend's drink when she realized she wanted it iced (*after* the fact) but you can't add 1/2 stars and I'm not one for grade inflation, so there you go.. . Will I be back?  Sure.
