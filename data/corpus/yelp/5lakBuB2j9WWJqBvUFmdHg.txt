The food wasn't bad and it was actually quite good just a bit on the oily side but I feel like I was robbed at gun point and willingly threw my wallet with all it's cash at the thief. No matter how you put it this place is a rip off for charging such astronomical prices for Vietnamese fusion or what is truly just a rip off of different dishes from all the different Asian cultures disguised as fusion.
