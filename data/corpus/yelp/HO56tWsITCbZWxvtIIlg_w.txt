I have been to Taste quite a few times and it's great whether you're meeting a friend on the patio for apps and wine or if you're meeting work colleagues for a non-stuffy dinner.  . The appetizers are great.  I recommend the Macaroni and Cheese, the Tuna Tartare, and the French Fries.. For the meal, the risotto with shrimp is delicious.  This last time they had a seafood ravioli as the special--crab, shrimp and lobster ravioli covered in a pesto sauce.  It was amazing.. For dessert, I'm not sure what kind of ice cream they serve, the but the chocolate ice cream is dark chocolate and is extra creamy.  So good!
