With a groupon, this was a really fun experience that didnt hurt the wallet too bad.  View is beyond spectacular.  It is soo big and crowded that it almost has a high end theme park restaurant quality.  View are amazing, so you should wait for  a table with a view, and just be sure to let them know when you sign in.  Food I would get again:  Crispy rice w spicy tuna, crispy chicken were really yummy.  the Miso cod was okay.  on the fence re: The truffle tamachi was okay, a little odd flavor combo.  the strawberry donuts were yummy but not perfect.  all the other desserts were pretty big, and crowd pleasers.  We ordered a bunch of apps and two entrees for four and three desserts - pure gluttony but made for an awesome experience.  Crowd was kind of ridick.  All over the place - random touristy types, euro trash, cheesy hollywood and the average joe, but i would certainly come back, have some drinks with a few other people, and have some apps.  don't forget to take a stroll along the front south facing garden area.  lovely.
