I went here for the first time last night with a fellow Yelper.  Great, great food--solid burgers and spinach dip and salads.  Nice, dimly-lit atmosphere--my only complaint is how close the tables are to each other. If you get seated in the booths in the back, you are on top of the other tables and their meals.
