coobah is a great spot.  not a bargain, but still a good find!  i went with some gf's to relive our nicaragua vacation, and we were thrilled to see they have nicaraguan beer, toña!  yum!  their sangria was also good.  we shared some appetizers, which were plenty filling, split between 3 people.  the main courses are pretty pricey.  check it out!
