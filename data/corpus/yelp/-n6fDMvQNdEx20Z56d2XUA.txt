Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
coffee is really good. the food, not bad. but i think whether its a cafe, or a coffee boutique, a place to go to enjoy coffee should be a comfortable place where you can hang out and enjoy spending time in. this is not the place for that. never mind the decor, the booth like seats are way too low to eat off the tables and just the seating in general is uncomfortable. who ever designed the place only thought about the looks, not how it functions.
