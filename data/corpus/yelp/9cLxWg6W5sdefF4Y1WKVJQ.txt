There are a few things in life that will always stick in your head for always:   Your first kiss; your wedding day; the day your first child was born; the day you had your first Porto's cheese roll.. . Yes, that's right.  I said it.  The Porto's cheese roll. It is THAT good.  I don't know if it is the buttery sweet bread or the cream cheese, but every bite is like a blast of heaven in your mouth. . . You may question my review of this place because of a cheese roll.  However this is the mother of all cheese rolls.  If there are cheese rolls made in Heaven, they were made by Porto's.   . . If you ever stop by this place, please try their cheese rolls.  And Yelp about it after.  Period.  . . I only wish they had a Porto's Bakery in the San Francisco Bay Area.....
