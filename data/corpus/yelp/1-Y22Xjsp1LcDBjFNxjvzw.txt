Restaurant: Hub 51
Category: American (New)
I'm a fan of Hub 51 when it comes to lunch. I have yet to check this place out for dinner, or when it turns into a club/lounge.. . Two words: Turkey Meatloaf. Yes, it exists, and it's pretty much known among my circle of foodies that this is what you get for lunch. It's been awhile since I had it, but I think it came with sweet potato fries.. . I also adore the Sonoma Salad (Spinach, Grapefruit, Avocado, Walnuts, Sunflower Sprouts &amp; Seeds, Cranberries) . Compliments to the chef on a unique salad!. . I'm impressed with how Hub 51 gets away with offering American, Japanese (maki rolls), Mexican (huevos rancheros and tacos) food, without tripping over itself.. . The ambiance is large, dark and modern, with an awesome painting of a green-haired punk rocker chick along the north wall.
