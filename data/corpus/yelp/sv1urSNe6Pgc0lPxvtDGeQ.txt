We went to flip last saturday...I have been waiting to go since I heard of its opening.. . Initial impression is that is small.....not a lot of parking, not a lot of seating, and that it will make a really nice Johnny Rockets after this concept is done.. . The food was really good though.  I had the butcher cut (which had blue cheese and red wine jam) with yummy fries and a Krispy Creme shake.  Overall it was good and the prices werent bad at all.
