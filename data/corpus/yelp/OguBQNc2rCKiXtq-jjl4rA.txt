Whip me with your wet noodles Pho Cafe.  I didn't think I was going to find a good pho joint since my Boston days.  I was WRONG.. . The decor is very modern, think minimalist, and clean.  The crowd is definitely hipster (we are talking about Silver Lake here).  I like hipster, but if you don't, who cares -- the pho is bangin'.  The broth is clear with no fat and tons of flavor.  The broth is delicate with flavor.  The noodles melt in your mouth.  You get a whole lotta noodle in a gi-normous bowl for little $.. . Pho Perfection.
