Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
this place had the best korean service I have had in ktown~ It may have been cause I was with Koreans but they gave us such good service and were more than friendly to attend to anything we asked. Â The galbi tang is so delicious!! it falls right off the bone and the waitress asks you if u want her to cut it into bite size pieces just like momma used to do when you were 3~ I am not a huge eater, so it was good for me that its not all you can eat, and that makes the meat better quality and so much more delicious.
