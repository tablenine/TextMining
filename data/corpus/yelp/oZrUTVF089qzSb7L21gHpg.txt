Restaurant: Silver Cloud Bar &amp; Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
The Silver Cloud Basics (from a regular).... - Great outdoor seating (beneath trees covered in white lights).  . - Decent comfort food (recommendations include: tator-tots, grilled cheese/tomato soup, sloppy joes, tuna melt) - but bring your 'tums'!. - Service can be inconsistent.  Nothing that should drive you crazy as long as you keep in mind this is a sit back and relax place, not a fast-food joint. . - BUT all in all it still remains my perfect place to cure that unwavering hangover!  Bloody Marys never disappoint and amazingly enough, life just suddenly seems more manageable after one or two with friends on a Sunday afternoon...
