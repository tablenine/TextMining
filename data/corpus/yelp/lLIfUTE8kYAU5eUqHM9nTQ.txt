Yknow, I love super authentic the menu is in Spanish and you can get tongue here Mexican places, but I'm definitely all about your more typical "we aren't embarrassed to serve nachos and lunch combinations" places too.  Sure, it's not the most authentic Mexican food you'll ever find, but it's not gross Tex Mex trying to pass for Mexican either..        I had enchiladas verdes and they were quite good.  I didn't love the rice and beans that came with it (or the fact that they were super tiny portions), but I left satisfied.  Also, from what I saw of the lunch menu, it was a little more limited and more expensive than I was hoping for.  I think I'm just spoiled by Jalapenos in Savannah (yeah, you Sav people know what i mean!).       I def wanna go back and try a margarita sometime!
