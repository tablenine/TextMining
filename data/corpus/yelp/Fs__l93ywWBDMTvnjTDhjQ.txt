Went here today and shared a large plate of chicken nachos on top of a chicken mole soft taco and chicken taquitos. Fresh corn tortillas made on the spot and used for the chips, mole was just right and nacho portions are perfect for two or more. Svc can be a bit slow so be patient for the food, it's definitely worth it.
