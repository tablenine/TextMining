mmmmm MMM mm THIS PLACE CAN MAKE REALLY GOOD RAMEN...i feel bad for mr.ramen next door:( anyways...OTHER THAN THE OBVIOUS DAIKOKUYA RAMEN ..the sliced roast pork is sooooooo goood! eat it with the condiments that are on the table...dnt exactly know what they are....ones like ginger and the other one is some garlicy sauce. Â i also got some california rolls which was suprisingly good. it wasnt slathered in mayo like other cali rolls and it was stuffffed with the crab mixture thing...lesss rice and more crab! sit at the bar-table and you can see them make your yummmy meal
