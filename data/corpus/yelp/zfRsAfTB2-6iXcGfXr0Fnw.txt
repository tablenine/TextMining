Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Finally had the chance to try the food here.  We ordered one pound shrimp and a crab whole sha-bang seasoning, gumbo, fried oyster, to go.  The seasoning is good, shrimp is big and tasted fresh.  Others...well, the crab, maybe because it was boiled, I think the meat would tast better if is steamed.  Frying butter for the oyster, I guess beause it was to go, so it tasted tired.  Gumbo is pretty insteresting, not much of flavor.  Not sure if that is what gumbo is suppose to tast like but I like it with lemon.
