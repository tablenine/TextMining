YUM. This is the best ramen I have had outside of Japan. Delicious broth, great noodle consistency, and rich, fatty pork that melts in your mouth. Customers and servers were speaking Japanese. The only downside was the wait-time. The two of us waited an hour to be seated, and we arrived at 3 PM on a Saturday, which we thought would be an off-time. Apparently, it's ALWAYS ramen time. Next time, we'll go on a weekday.
