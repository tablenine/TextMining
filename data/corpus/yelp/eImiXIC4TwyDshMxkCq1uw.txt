First time i had portos was when I was over my friends house searching for some food.. I saw a little box and looked inside and their were some round potato balls  probably a couple days old...took a bite of this cold treat and fell in love... . i always thought it came cold so when i went to portos i kept looking for those potato balls near the refrigerated sweets but nowhere to be found.. so i ask the nice worker where i could find them and there they were....warmmmmm, softt,, and oh sooooo delicious.... porto's is a must if EVER around the area... nice workers (who can tip at times, which i think they deserve esp. if your ordering alot), greaaaat selection of sandwhiches, drinks and treats...  i sadly remember one time i ordered 1 dozen potato balls for my family but then i had a change of plans and ended up eating 8 of those 12..sad...but oh so great =) . i would recommend the fruit tart cake, famous amous CHEESE ROLLS mmm, potato balls, and media noche mmmm never a miss here...unless u dont like long lines and scarce parking at times
