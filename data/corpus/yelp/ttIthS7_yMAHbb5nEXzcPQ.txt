Great half price sushi deal on Friday and Saturday (call ahead to make sure they are still doing the deal). . We were definitely treated rudely by the Maitre De (thats De as in D***) They are on the way to Banned for Life List if the service level continues - until then I will keep coming back for half price sushi!
