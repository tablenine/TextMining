Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
Buona Terra is the kind of excellent, intimate Italian restuarant showcased in our favorite dream sequence of our lives.  Seriously.  Every meal I've had has been sublime, no matter the season or the time I go, the carpaccio, the asparagus, the veal, gnocci, the gelatos--oh my!   The decor is warm and relaxing. The open rooms give you the opportunity to ogle the next diners food without being obvious. . . In the summer, they make the most of the outdoor areas  they have and also open up in the front window so diners inside get a great breeze.  This place gets packed so i'd always call for reservations if you're too hungry to wait.  But even then, the hostess has always tried to get me and friends seated as quickly as possible. . . I love them like I love dream sequences.
