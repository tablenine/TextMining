Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Ice cream in January. Am I crazy or am I crazy?. . Only with good reason. Milk serves up HOME MADE ice cream, that is very true to flavor. When they say Lime sorbet or Banana Dulce de Leche -- they don't lie. Especially about the unexpected sour-face you make/wishing you had a shot of tequila because the Lime sorbet REALLY tastes like lime.. . In addition to being an ice cream parlour, Milk is also a cafe and bakery. It is nothing but overwhelming times and hell for the gastronomically indecisive. Before you visit, I advise that you know for certain what you are in the Â mood for. Once you're there, focus ONLY on what you've decided on and don't look back! I went for ice cream, but had many a wavering glance at the other items on display. . . I'll be back Milk -- you've enticed me enough!
