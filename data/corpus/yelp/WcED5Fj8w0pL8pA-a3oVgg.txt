Real Southern cooking!  I grew up on traditional Southern country cooking in north Georgia and have to say that Watershed's breakfast and Really Good Chocolate Cake are as good as it gets.  The grits are a coarse ground gift from above and the breakfast country ham is as tasty and tender as the portion is prolific. The gravy was first rate and this is a rarity for resturant fare. Well done, Mr. Peacock and Co.. A Satisfied Southerner
