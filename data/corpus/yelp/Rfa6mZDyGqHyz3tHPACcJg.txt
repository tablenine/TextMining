Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
This place is a GEM!  If you want authentic japanese ramen -- Daikokuya is it.  The deep pork broth (probably simmered for hours) and the nicely done al dente noodles are reasons enough to check it out!  This ain't your mom's attempt in making top ramen at home for you -- these people don't mess around.  The only drawback is the long wait......but it's definitely well worth it.  A sign of a great restaurant is how long the wait is.
