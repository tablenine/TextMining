Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
I have my college roommate to thank for taking me here because I must have passed this place a dozen times in the last year and never noticed it once. . . Tasty, filling, and cheap. I'd recommend the hainan chicken and it seems to be the poppin' dish to get too. I didn't pick up a whole lot of flavor in the chicken, but I still enjoyed how tender the meat was. The plain white rice it is served with gets a honorable mention too. I don't know how they cook it, but however they're doing it, they're doing it right. The hainan dish comes with three sauces: dark soy, a savory garlicky chili sauce (my college roommate's favorite--she even asked for extra), and my favorite: plain old ginger. . . IMO, I still prefer Green Zone's healthier and more flavorful hainan chicken, but Savoy's hainan is a close second. . . Savoy Kitchen is a little small and plain to look at but always filled with guests. The service is polite and friendly, and as much as they mean well, I can't help but feel rushed to finish my meal and leave so they can seat someone else.
