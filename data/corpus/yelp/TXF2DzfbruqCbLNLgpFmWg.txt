I don't understand what the hype is about this place! We decided to do a nice family dinner and came here on a Saturday evening. Before the place even opened, there were already 10+ people lined up at the door. When they finally opened their doors, there was a mini rush into the place, to my amusement. Anyway, we were promptly seated and within 5-10 minutes, the place was packed and more people were waiting outside.. . I don't remember specifically what we ordered since my mom did the ordering, but we tried most of the things on their menu. The tempura was good--just the right amount of batter so it wasn't too thick, it wasn't soggy, and the crisps were delicate and not oily. Sashimi was fresh fresh fresh but, sadly, not served in generous portions.. . The place was good but not OMGlet'slineupbeforeitopens amazing. I was not reeling or raving about the place when I left.
