Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
I'm in love with their potato balls. It's mashed potatoes mixed with beef and it's breaded and fried. So good that I could eat this for the rest of my life. I also really enjoyed their meat pie as well. I went there for the first time a few days ago and I totally fell in love with the food. I'm craving some of it right now! You won't be disappointed. One other thing though... I don't know who started this first entry, but I have no idea where they got this name from: Porto's Party Store and Cake Gallery?! hehe. I think the two buildings are separately called Porto's Bakery and Porto's Cafe, although they are connected inside!
