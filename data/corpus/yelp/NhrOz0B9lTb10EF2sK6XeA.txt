The first time I had their famous ramen noodle (btw the ONLY selection they have) around 11:30pm, it was yummy.  Ate their 3 weeks ago around 1pm and here was my order:. . Their one and only ramen with extra green onions &amp; bamboo - the only thing tasted hot was their soup.  Felt like I was having a COLD yakisoba w/soup. GYOZA  - nice thinly wrapped and pan-fried to perfection!!!. JAPANESE sausage (looks like mini hot dogs) - pretty yummy. . Sad to say this time experience wasn't as good as I first had it. I had better ramen than theirs and PHO sure not so eager to wait for 30mins+ to eat here anytime soon.
