Amazing!  I had heard a few stories about how big the pancakes were at the Griddle and all I could think about was the little hole-in-the-wall I used to eat at back home that had pancakes the size of serving plates!  So my anticipation finally led me to the Griddle where we got sat rather quickly considering the mass of people waiting outside.  Whether they were waiting for a table or just hired extras to make the place look busy from the street, the tactic had me very anxious!  . . As my friend and I walked in, the aroma of syrup and sausage and coffee overtook my senses and we were sat right in front of the kitchen at a long wrap around bar similar to a sushi restaurant!  I glanced at the menu and immediately my mouth started watering... pancakes filled with OREOS topped with whipped cream, Fluffy french toast and a plate that appeared to have a generous portion of scrambled eggs, meat, and hot sauce skimmed right past my nose!. . I promptly ordered a cup of coffee and  The Golden Ticket, a pancake plate served with 3 banana-walnut battered pancakes with cinnamon, whipped cream and struessel topping it. . .  When the meal came out, I couldn't believe the 3 gigantic pancakes were falling off the side of the plate!! My anxiousness finally was fulfilled when I took the 1st bite into this amazing delight!  Words cannot express how delicious this was.  I finished half of the plate, determined to save some for the next days' meals.   If only they had a challenge (like man vs. food) that i could stay and eat the entire plate, I would've finished it all in one sitting, but my ego was put aside for the sake of savoring it another day!. . I will definately be coming here more frequently now as well as all my family when they visit me on vacation.  If there happens to be a wait when you visit, it will be well worth it.  Good eatings!
