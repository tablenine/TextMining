Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Hear good things about this place from multiple sources. So I tried it with my cousin this past Christmas weekend. . . THE GOOD: . Very good smoked salmon omelet. Of course, the toast also had to be good. Atmosphere was sunny (brightly colored walls, GREAT modern tunes playing at reasonable decibel level. . . THE GREAT: . Excellent apple sausage with yummy char-grilled flavor. Prompt and friendly waitstaff. . . THE OK: . Why no potatoes/hash browns with the omelet? Omelet selections could have been more plentiful. The omelet was also not as fluffy as I like. Also, it was pretty chilly by the door where we were seated (entrance is literally on top of the first area of seats). . . THE VERDICT: . Very good neighborhood breakfast place near OZ park. Would I come back? Yes, for sure. . . PLATE ENVY REPORT: . Our neighbors on both sides of our table ordered some towering french toast concoction and I couldn't keep my eyes off of it. Looked ridiculously good despite the fact that it would require 10 sessions on the elliptical machine to wear off.
