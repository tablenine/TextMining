the blue velvet cake is really good. i like how there are blueberries in the cream cheese frosting. . . i also tried a mini of the red velvet cupcake. well, i guess the only subtle difference was the blueberries and blue food coloring. i think. i'm not so sure. . . i'll come back on a day that i can actually find parking. parking situation is pretty bad. no parking from this time to this time BUT two hour max from this time to this time; permit exempt. alright. Â i just don't want the jewish neighbors staring at me and wondering why i'm waiting in the car in front of their beautiful house as my boyfriend runs to grab and go with the cake.
