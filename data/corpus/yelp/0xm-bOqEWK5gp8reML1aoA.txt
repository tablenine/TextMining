The location is quite impressive--with a view of the entire city.  The restaurant itself is enormous.  I imagine they do quite a few big celebrations and wedding receptions here.. . As far as the food goes, it is about the quality you would expect from a restaurant like this.  It's not bad, but for the prices they charge, you can get better elsewhere.  I had the Black Cod, which was served with some kind of soy reduction and wasabi mashed potatoes.  It was all a little clumsy on the plate, and some of the flavors didn't really go together.. . The service was fine.  Probably won't be going back because there are too many Japanese places I haven't tried yet.
