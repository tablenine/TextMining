I was looking for a place to have brunch with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and another friend turned me on to this place, noting that although it wasn't one of those places requiring an hour's wait on a weekend morning, it was still good.. . My expectations were low, as I knew that this was a 24-hour diner, and I'd never had a decent meal at any of those. Â However, I was pleasantly surprised by my Bearded Mr. Frenchy (four pieces of fluffy French toast encrusted with cornflakes), the breezy ambiance, and the abundance of parking.
