Very overrated. They put mayonnaise on the Cuban sandwich, for crying out loud! Â You may as well put strychnine in the guacamole. They also don't have mariquitas (fried plantain chips) which is another strike against them. It's like not getting french fries with your burger. . . I won't go so far as to say that the food is bad, but it's just not that good. Other Cuban places in the LA basin do it better.
