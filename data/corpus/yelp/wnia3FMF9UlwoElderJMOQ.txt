Cut your finger nails before going, tied your hair (if you do have a long hair - men &amp; women), wear short sleeves, dark color shirt, and start digging in!!! It's like rumble in the bronx!. . Come before actual dinner time, around 5pm or slightly early to avoid the long wait. Those spicy lovers, always order Shebang flavor, it's awesome. The garlic smell is pretty strong, but who cares? I LUV garlic!. . all I can warn you is BE PREPARED for some great tasting food, messy table, and red faces after you're done eating. Always always order the crawfish, it's fun watching people having trouble opening them and found out only a tiny bit of meat inside :) - for first timers especially!!! The best thing in here is the Shrimp mixed with Cajun Fries... *drool*
