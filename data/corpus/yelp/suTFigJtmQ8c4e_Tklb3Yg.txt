Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I have been to Sawtelle so many times... I even lived in that area for a while... I LOVE sushi... yet, this was my first time going to Hide Sushi.. . I went during lunch time before going to the beach.  It was a hot day so we wanted something fresh.  We decide to go to Hide sushi for their lunch special!  We get there at 10:40 and there was already a line in front of the store (they open at 11am)  About 5 minutes after the restaurant opened, the restaurat was FULL.  It was 11am on a saturday morning at a sushi restaurant, and it's already FULL?  I was so amazed.. . I ordered a Chirashi Sushi~ my favorite!  Variety of sashimi over a bed of vinegar rice. mMmMmM can't get any better than eating Chirashi on a hot Saturday morning!  Fish was fresh, rice was cooked and cooled with vinegar in perfection... maybe a little too much rice for the amount of fish. I think it was about $11?  I don't remember exactly, but I remember thinking it was sooo cheap!. . I liked it!  4 stars!
