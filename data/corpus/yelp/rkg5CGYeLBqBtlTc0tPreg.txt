Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Taste is one of my most favorite restaurants in LA. I love the atmosphere and the food is amazing. Every time I go there I try something new, and I have never been disappointed. The Truffle Mac n' cheese is great- it has a bit of a spice to it but its Delicious. A great appetizer. This past weekend we went and I had the Salmon Salad which was a great size (i actually took half of it home as a left over.) The service is great, everyone is very friendly and helpful. I feel like the prices are very reasonable; we had a bottle of wine, 1 appetizer, 2 dinner dishes for less than $100. And they have Happy Hour! From 4-6 EVERYDAY! Score :)
