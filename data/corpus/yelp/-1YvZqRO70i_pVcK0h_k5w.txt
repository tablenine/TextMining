My date last night took me to the Fat Cat before catching a play at Profiles Theater a few blocks south.  The decor was nice but I agree with other reviewers that the music could be turned down a notch.  I like my bars loud, but this place seems to be striving for a more relaxed lounge feel.  I mean, if you're serving comfort food, the environment should be comfortable, too.. . The Braised Pork Belly Sammy has taken a lot of heat from other reviewers.  I ordered it and loved it.  It definitely does not bear any resemblance to a pork Cuban, but it didn't seem like that's what the chef was striving for.  The combination of chili vinegar, pork fat and spicy aoli did indeed leave the sandwich dripping with oil, but the effect was succulent rather than repulsive on my palate.  The hand cut french fries were top notch.. . My date ordered the Urban Turkey with brie and apple, which was also pretty tasty.. . The sidecar I ordered was way too sweet and severely lacking in citrus, so a big disappointment for one of my favorite cocktails.  But the draft beer list was impressive and the Mad Hatter IPA that I washed down my french fries with was welcome.. . I don't find myself in Uptown often, but I would definitely go back.
