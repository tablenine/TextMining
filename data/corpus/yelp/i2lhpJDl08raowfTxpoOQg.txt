I am a fan, I do love the food, but be warned, it is pricey. Especially because I'm used to a crapload of food for very little money that feeds me for multiple meals!!!. So I've had the meat lover's omelet, nearly gave me a heart attack it was so much meat!!! The crepes are super yummy, both the fruit and nutella (which tasted more like pure chocolate), as well as the peaches and cream. The steak benedict was also very meaty and hearty for breakfast. The brioche french toast was alright. Their iced coffee will alleviate any caffeine headaches! Haven't tried their lunch or dinner menu yet. But the way their breakfasts have been, I can imagine it is quite hearty and filling.
