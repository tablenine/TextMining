Restaurant: Deleece
Category: American (New)
I have been to Deleece three times.  Twice for dinner and once for brunch.  I have always had a great experience.  . . The decor and ambiance are cozy and warm and classy.  It's a nice elegant neighborhood restaurant for a date.  . . The staff is very helpful and knowledgable.  I am one of those irritating people with questions about menu items and they always give me an honest opinion.  Even if it's to say, eh, don't order that, order this... it's better.  . . I can't remember what I had for brunch, though I did sit outside as it was a beautiful summer day... I love any restaurant with outdoor seating in the summer!  As for dinner I have had the amazing caramelized chilean salmon (pan roasted with chinese sticky black rice, spinach, leeks and pear-ginger sauce).  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I could have devoured 10 of these things.  The best salmon I've had in a looong time.  The waitress assured me I'd love it and it's a menu favorite and I believe her.  The other dinner entre I had was a special I believe- lamb chops.  Also delicious!!  Dessert we shared an apple crisp- SOOO good.  My friends and I were fighting for the last bite!  And I'm really not a dessert person.  . . My only complaint is the wine prices.  A bottle I've often bought at Binny's for $15 is $34 here which seems like a bit of a markup.  I know wine is ALWAYS over priced at restaurants but knowing the typical price of that bottle really shocked me.  . . I love Deleece.  It's one of my neighborhood favories and prices (aside from wine) are totally fair.
