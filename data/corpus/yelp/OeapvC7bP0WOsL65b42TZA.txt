Nice restaurant in the Buckhead area. Great steaks, lobster, seafood, salmon and my favorite of theirs - the creamed spinach. I try to get creamed spinach from almost every restaurant I go to, sometimes off the menu, and theirs is in the top five I've ever eaten. Get their early to get better attention if you are not a regular. I give them the four star based mostly on their creamed spinach, delicious.
