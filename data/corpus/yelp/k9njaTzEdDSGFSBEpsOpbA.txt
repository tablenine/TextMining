Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Fathers Office. Nice place. Be prepared to be ID'd when you arrive. I noticed tho, that if the door checker asks if you have been there before and you say yes, they generally don't check your ID, if you look like you are over 21. [They ask, because if you have not, they let you know to seat yourself anywhere, and order at the bar.]. . So there is your first tip. Find seats [we sat outside under the heaters] and then go inside and order.. . Everything at Fathers Office comes the way they make it, so go prepared, I wasn't looking for anything fancy, so I let them give me their food, as they serve it, and i have No complaints. I got:. . Steak Frites. Fathers Burger. Side of Sweet Potato Fries. Brewery Beer [a rye-eseque beer. if i heard the girl right].. . Steak Frites - Delicious. Perfectly cooked, and the Frites, were ahmazing. A well done dish.. . Burger - There is only one, but whatever it was, damn was it good. Ordered mine Medium Rare, and it was so good. Had this sause which was delicious, some arugula and this cheese. Well done - all around with this. note. it comes with no sides. It is light, but filing, and mmmmm.. . Sweet potato fries - Crispy. Some great fries. Recommended. It comes with the aole [sp]. mayo sause. MMMmmm. I asked for more, and yum!. . Beer. - Dark, but good.. . It's a bit pricy, all that was about 50 dollars, but reasonable. It was a healthy amount of food, and all of it was very delicious.. . Worth a try, and the Helm's area was a bit modern complexy but with that old world charm, as the building are old, just modernized.. . Do it up, I say.
