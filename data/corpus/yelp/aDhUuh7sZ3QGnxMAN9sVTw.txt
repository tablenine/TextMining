Category: Mexican
As my rating indicates, this place is alright.  It is not good in any way that stands out.  It is a classier looking Mexican joint than many others in the city, but you pay for it.. . The food is good, but not good enough to warrant the prices accompanying.  And the drink prices are inexcusable.  I will say that the hosts and waitstaff are cute, but I don't think that should factor into my bill (the tip takes care of that).. . If you are in need of Mexican food, you can go elsewhere and save money.  If you need a Mexican joint with a lot of atmosphere, then this is your place.
