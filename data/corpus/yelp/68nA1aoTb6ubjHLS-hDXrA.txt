I'll admit that I probably started liking this place just because my dad loves it so much.  But I've gone many times without him, and I've really enjoyed myself and my experience even without his stories about this place, and he has a lot of them.. . First things first, I'm vegetarian, so the French dip doesn't do anything for me, literally.  The non-meat sandwiches are just OK, but this place is about much more than the food.  Ordering and deciding where to sit are really important to your experience.  If you do either incorrectly, you could ruin your whole lunch.. . Some tips:  Decide what you want before you stand in line.  Be nice to the person taking your order.  When you get your food, you have a big decision to make.  How communal do you want your lunch to be?  If you want the full-on communal experience, sit at one of the long tables near where you order.  If you want a communal experience that feels like something from a weird '40s movie, go upstairs to one of the little rooms.  If one is available, choose an empty one.  Someone might come in and sit down next to you.  He might not.  If you want a more-or-less private experience, check out the booths around the corner from where you order.. . Oh, and if there's not parking in the lot right next door, there's also a lot across the street.
