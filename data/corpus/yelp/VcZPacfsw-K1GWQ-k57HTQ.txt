Restaurant: Bone Garden Cantina
Category: Mexican
I love the location.  It's like people are afraid to take a few baby steps out of the lights and bustle of Midtown.  My favorite part is driving past Taqueria del Sol and seeing the line of people caterpillar-ing around the parking lot, and then rolling on into Bone Garden Cantina, where the waits are much more minimal, and the atmosphere is far nicer.  Quiet(er), relaxing, and comfortable.. . Staff is sharp, attentive, and friendly; just return the same respect.  The food is pretty good, and they certainly have a good grasp of what is spicy, and what is not.  The portions are also very good, so you don't feel like you're pigging out too badly when you're done eating.  And I will agree with those that say that the prices are on the fair-good side of the spectrum.  I've had several of their tacos, as well as their burritos, and none have disappointed.  Their guacamole is also tasty; I like it a little on the chunky side.
