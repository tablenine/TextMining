Highlights of the evening were:. -- Rabbit Tortellini (I've never had rabbit before, and was hesitant, but I figure, if I'm going to try it, I might as well try it at a GOOD place) - LOVED IT! Sorry bunny you are truly yummy!. . -- Sweet Onion Tart - omg there's something extra in there, but we couldn't put our finger on it - i'm guessing an organ of some kind, slightly gamey but oh so good.. . -- Flatiron steak - cooked perfectly with very extra fluff - which I love since a good steak really doesn't need anything more than a good grillin'. . -- Braised pork shoulder - I've had better, but if you're looking for something a little more flavorful than the flatiron steak - this is what I would recommend.. . -- Mixed mushroom side dish - I love mushrooms, so I may be biased but it was good.. . -- Strawberries and Creme dessert with Black pepper ice cream - unlikely combination, but it works! Chocolate souffle was good - but nothing special. . Not so great things:. -- Risotto with Asparagus - undercooked (we sent it back and our waitress was nice enough to remove it from our check). . -- Beef Cheek - it may be a flavor thing, but it was a little over marinated to me... . . -- Their bathroom. Not a pleasant experience at all - it wasn't cleaned, which is sad cause its such a nice place.. . The restaurant decor was great, it is a little noisy but for the most part a nice night out with friend's - wouldn't recommend a large group as it is quite noisy and shouting across the tables just isn't the way you want to spend your evening.
