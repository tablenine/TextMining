I'm going to second Amy H. on not being overwhelmed with Landmark.  That said, I may go back in the future to give it another try because trying to put on a good event with free food and booze is never easy.  That said, here are my AFAs:. . ATMOSPHERE: Pretty nice atmosphere, actually, with high vaulted ceilings, a large section above the main floor that seemed great for people watching.  The bar seemed like it was set up well and the backroom seemed like it might have good flow.  But, that being said, I don't think this place was really meant to have as many people there as were for the Yelp event last Thursday.. . FOOD: Based on the food they served, color me disappointed.  Al dente is a good thing.  Broken teeth are not.  If you are going to serve risotto, a word to the wise is that you should make sure it is cooked enough that it isn't basically just arborio rice ... . . ALCOHOL:  Well, I got drunk.  If that is a good sign, I guess Landmark has that going in its favor.  The mojitos seemed to be missing enough mint at some points or enough rum at others, but it still got me doing that stupid Bacardi mojito dance.  Come on, people, you know it ... :)  . . Overall, I'd guess that this place is probably trying to cater to too many interests.  That's just a guess, of course, but I'm not sure whether it is trying to be an upscale bar, a restaurant or what.  I'll give it another try (probably) at some other point, but when you are catering to 200+ junior reviewers/foodies and their guests, you better put your best foot forward.  Not terribly impressed Landmark.
