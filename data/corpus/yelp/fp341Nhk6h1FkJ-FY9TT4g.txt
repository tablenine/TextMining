Love this place - the guacamole is so amazing, as are the margaritas! I could go there just for those two things!  I've seen some reviews that say "big deal, so what if they have great guacamole" and that guacamole is not that hard to make.  Well then explain to me why its soooo much freaking better here than anywhere else?! I've had some seriously BLAH guacamole in some places! . . The food is also very good, I've had a few things on the menu and have never been disappointed - the tilapia is particularly good. . I would actually be tempted skip dinner and head for dessert - their chocolate tamal is so tasty. . Don't come here if your tastes run toward the taco/burrito dive.  Guess what folks- THAT'S NOT ALL THERE IS TO MEXICAN FOOD! :) Wouldn't you be insulted if people around the world thought "Heck, I'd like some American food" and were pissed when the "American" restuarant didn't serve up burgers, fries, and chicken strips? :)  Well apply that principal to Mexican food and there you go. . While there is certainly a time and place for that cheap stuff (yum- for the best see my review of Buenas Nachos in the burbs!), if that's all the Mexican food you like, you will be sorely disappointed here.  There is more to Mexican cuisine than what you can find at the taqueria, and this is a great place to try it out!
