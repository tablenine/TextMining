I love this place!!! Â Just be mindful the line is pretty long. I went there for lunch just before they opened. There was a line already! It's totally worth it, believe me. . My Japanese instructor took a bunch of the classmates there for lunch. Try their Chirashi. Very fresh and good portion of sashimi toppings. The egg topping melts in the mouth. For "I-don't-do-sushi" peeps, try beef teriyaki. The meat is very tender. The portion is okay but you can't beat the quality.
