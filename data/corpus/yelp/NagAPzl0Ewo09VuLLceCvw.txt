I haven't been to Cafe Sunflower in at least four years, but I still think about their sesame "chicken" with broccoli and brown rice. I took my meat-eating family here and my dad said they were the best steak fajitas he'd EVER had (not real steak, people...) and we all agreed that the chocolate cake was the best piece of cake we'd ever had. I miss you Cafe Sunflower!!!!!!
