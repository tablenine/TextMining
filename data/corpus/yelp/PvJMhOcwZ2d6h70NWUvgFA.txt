It was the best pizza I've ever had.  I LOVE the goat cheese one.  The mussel appetizer was also great.  Good service.  The waiter was very knowledgable of their menu and made good suggestions.  The only one thing I didn't like was how tables are so close together.  I could hear everything the people at the table to the right and to the left of us were talking about.  When I asked bf a question and he didn't know the answer, the people who sat on the left side answered my question.  That was nice, but.... I rather have a bit more privacy.
