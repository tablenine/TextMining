Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
orochon is really my sis favorite place. she always drives here twice a month for orochon ramen. so i let her order everything she likes.. . miso ramen no.3 - nice portion, soup and noodle r good. pork is so so. chicken teriyaki - chicken is tender and teriyaki sauce is tasty. . ambiance - o.k. sitting and looking outside fr. the 3rd floor is nice.. service - o.k.. parking - don't like it at all.. . still her fav. place, not mine
