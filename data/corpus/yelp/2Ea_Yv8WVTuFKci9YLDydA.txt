Those who get it, get it.  . Those who don't, just don't eat here!. . This is meant to be Italian street food, yes italian. . not chinatown street food, not halal cart street food . Italian traveling sandwiches like its summer and you are driving through the hills and you are hungry and you pull your fiat over on the side of the road to have a picnic in the sunflower field with your bottle of chianti somewhere in the distance a child is playing near a brook with his pet goat, good.. . Anywho...the bread is meant to be a crunchy dry baguette (semi squared off in shape) it tastes semi soda-ish much like day old bread but perfect in that way for the purpose it serves, to bring the delicious slow cooked spiced meat to your bocca without any saucy drippy perils of oil or grease or mayo..or what have you that other sandwiches bring.. . The meat is what you come here for.  Slow cooked for 24hrs with continual brushings of the special salt and spices that are so so so comforting and warm that your hangover almost seems a necessary step in why you needed to come here in the first place to eat this sandwich!. . It will run you close to 11.00 so I try to only eat here for my hearts sake and wallets sake once a month.  However if you and a pal want an afternoon nosh try splitting it and feeling half as guilty about all the fat.. . *Noteworthy* Some people I know do not like to eat the skin and let me tell you it is crunchy like chewing on a jolly rancher hard...you may want to pull that little bit out and enjoy easy chewing.  I do this when I am inhaling my sandwich and have no time for laborious chewing.. . yummm..... . located conveniently near thompkins square park so after the food coma hits just waddle over there and plop out on the grass.
