Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
The Hungry Cat is three for three with me.  This Friday, I had the clams with chorizo ... YUM.  The fries that come with the lobster roll are arguably the best fries in Los Angeles ... and you can get them as a separate side (an entire plate ... totally worth an extra hour of sweating at the gym).  My favorite part?  The bartender here means business - her drinks are strong and flavorful.  No attitude, no fluff.  I may be in the minority, but I don't mind the decor.  It's a small space, but it's clean, and there are cute photographs in the bathroom of (seemingly) hungry felines.  All in all, good stuff.
