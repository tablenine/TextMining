Restaurant: Belly Shack
Category: Latin American
We were all excited to try the Belly Shack after it opened across the street from the Western blue line stop, and finally decided to do so when hosting a friend from DC. I was happy that it was a BYOB so we were able to bring some of our favorite drinks along with us. The space is very cool, and while they have a sort of table service, you have to order from the menu at the register. . . Now, it seemed that they were trying for a sort of Asian-Latino fusion, but while daring and creative the place missed the mark from A-Z. I had the tofu jibarito with a side of greens and chorizo. The greens were amazing and the only thing everyone enjoyed. Others had the fish, and others had the coconut chicken. My jibarito was terrible. Traditionally this sandwich is served with garlic paste or garlic mayo, and there was none. The plantain bun was terrible, thick, and tasted nothing like the amazing jibaritos available all over Puerto Rican Chicago. The tofu, was not marinated long enough to take in the flavors, and so eating a block of firm tofu was the basic experience. The others didn't finish the food and left feeling let down. My other friends were almost universally disappointed with the meals they ordered. . . I give them a big E for effort (I liked the skate trucks as bathroom door handles), but a C for execution (staff were friendlybut the no table serivce/server thing is just dumb). The idea is a good one: Easy, comfortable ethnic fusion in an environment you can bring those friends from Iowa or the suburbs to rather than a barrio restaurant, but the place swung, and missed the ball. . . I almost never say I won't go back. but I doubt I would go back to this place. Too bad really.
