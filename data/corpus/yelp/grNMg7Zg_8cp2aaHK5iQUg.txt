Spicy Seafood Soup, oh what a delight.. . Red Curry with Beef, sizzling with spice and warmth on a creepy Halloween night.. . Chicken with cashews, my boyfriend had swine flu. (He wasn't contagious at the time, I wanted something that rhymed).. . Fried ice cream to top off the night.. . Our experience was magnificent, this was my second visit.  It reminds me of the hole in the wall Thai restaurants in Orange County, CA where I used to spend my summers in high school.  The service was quick, and the place was a packed full house.  The waiters/waitresses were very attentive regardless of the full house and they were even chatting it up with the customers.  The prices were reasonable and so were the spices but nothing can compare to Thai of Norcross!  It's a lovely place, do bring your loved ones here.
