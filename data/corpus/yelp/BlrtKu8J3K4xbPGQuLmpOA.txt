Restaurant: Bob San Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Since I now live even closer to Bob San figured I would give it a try. They have a good amount of outdoor seating and I can see that being great on a nice day. . . I first took a look at the drink menu because I do enjoy having a martini with my sushi especially if they have a ginger martini. All that was on Bob San's drink menu was beer, wine and sake. Really? No house drink or anything? So I went with a Kirin... Â Next was the menu, none of the rolls jumped out at me. They offered the standards with a few different ones but nothing you would see at Blu Coral or Blue Fin. My favorite I ordered was the House Crunch but that didn't make up for the lackluster rest. What was odd, was the size of some of the roles.. they we huge... I could barley fix them into my mouth.. . Over all I'm glad I was able to give Bob San a try but they are plenty of better places in the area.
