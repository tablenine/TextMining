Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
Bored with all of our dining choices we decided that you can't go wrong with dr. brown's soda and salted meat sandwiches on rye bread.  Eleven city diner made a great dining experience from our usual cuisines.  The place has an easy going retro vibe.  I ordered the mixed green salad and my companion ordered a pastrami Reuben.  We shared our entrees, it was a good mix.  Outdoor seated is limited so grab it if you can.
