Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I've been here 5 times. A consistent performer, if you sit at the resaurant on culver and not at the cafe facing Cardiff (the resaurant has a gelato bar in it). The resaurant has different food and a different kitchen and is always a solid pick for dinner. Great for 2-4, provided you don't mind sitting outside.
