The food here isn't that great. Or at least the fajita omlette wasn't.. . But what is great is the interior. The place is big, with an upstairs and a downstairs, pool tables all over. I absolutely love the interior design. It's hard to describe, just an eclectic mix of lots of stuff.. . Staff? 2 beautiful Asian bartenders on Tuesdays nights. Friendly door guy, he wished me a happy bday! Pregnant waitress was also cool.. . Lot of TVs big and small to satisfy your ADD moments.
