For my birthday, I wanted to be adventurous and try out a new brunch spot. Hooray for Yelp because I came across Blu Jam and it was a happy birthday brunch indeed.. . A little bit of wait but worth it. Cute little place, totally packed. I ordered the smoked salmon egg benedict with dill. Devoured! What a brilliant idea to use crossiant instead of the usual english muffin! It's more fattening but makes everything taste so much better. And then of course we ordered their famous Blu Jam french toast to share. It's honestly sinnful heaven. I would not order it for a meal..all you need is two bites and you're done. But it is a must-try!. . I can't wait to go back here and try their other brunches!
