Category: Bakeries
Stopped by this place for the first time last night. Â My roommate had been bugging me to go there with him and so we did with another friend. . . I don't know what it is but it looked as if the restaurant attracted more of an elderly crowd. Anyway. We were seated, given lots of breads and fresh crunchy pickles. I had been craving pastrami sandwiches ever since I moved here (and hadn't found a place in the last year and a half) so I was happy they had it on their menu. The pastrami (on onion bread) was good as well as the fries crispy. . . Our server was REALLY nice and I believe it was the owner who also checked in with us a couple times. I'll likely come to eat here again or get it to go.
