I have eaten lunch here twice and both times the food was fine, not amazing.  The real problem is the service.  I have had the same waiter both times and he is rude and never checks on the table.  One time the place was almost empty and I still couldnt get a glass of water.  He also gives the check about two minutes after being served.  Is this Denny's?  What if I decided I wanted another drink?  Poor service with tons of better places on the same block.
