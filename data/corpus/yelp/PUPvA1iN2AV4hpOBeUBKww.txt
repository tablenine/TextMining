It's kind of overwhelming, actually. So many choices! Do I want pancakes mixed with Kahlua and Bailey's Irish Cream or pumpkin pie filling? Maybe a more traditional pancake with some berries mixed in? Howzabout a nice slice of French toast coated with Nutter Butters? . . Seriously. . . And then you start feeling sick thinking about all that sugar coated carbs topped with fat, so you think maybe have something egg-related, a little healthier, right? Again, so many options, all utterly mouthwatering. But if you get the eggs, then you can't have the pancakes! It's a dilemma. . . So the waiter suggests you get your eggs with a side of one pancake. Brilliant! And since the portions are absolutely huge, you essentially end up with 2 separate ginormous breakfasts for each person. . . Seriously. You'll have enough leftovers to feed a baseball team, breakfast AND lunch. . . It all tastes really good, too, but it's really a lot. . . It was really crowded, so we got seated in this weird private backroom that was painted to look like it was old and grubby...and it kind of was rather shabby back there. Personally, I missed the people-watching and publicly social aspect of restaurant eating by being seated in the private area, but the people I was with enjoyed it for its privacy and quiet. To each their own, right?
