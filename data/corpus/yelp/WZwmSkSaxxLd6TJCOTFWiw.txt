Category: Southern
Ummmm....hmmm... just got back from Roscoe's after not eating here since I was a drunken college co-ed. Damn, it's even better than I remember! The fried chicken breast- succulent as promised. The waffles- sweet and salty goodness. The greens- bitter with buttah. . . Thas right, go on and get cho grub on.
