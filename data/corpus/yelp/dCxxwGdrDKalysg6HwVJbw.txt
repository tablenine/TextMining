It has over a thousand reviews, because it's amazing! I would say Porto's is world famous for it's pastries, but you do have to get their sandwiches and other food items a try. . . Lunchtime I order the Media Noche Preparada- It has ham, roasted pork, and croquettes the melty swiss cheese and mustard makes it oh so appetizing! I like how the sandwiches are served with a side of plantain chips. . . Other things I like here the Southwest Chicken Salad, Potato Balls, Guava-Cheese pastry, and Fruit-tart... mmm custard. . . The lines can look daunting but hand in there service is quick and efficient so you will get your food in no time! Like their website says: Porto's Express Line offers quick lunch-time service (open 11am-2pm) and its Under-4 Items Line keeps you on the run. (see my photo on where I order)
