Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Apple Pan is a very good burger place, but I don't think you'll have a life-changing experience like some of the reviews I've read. The burger is prepared very well, and meat is a good combination with all the ingredients. I think the key ingredient is their relish which brings a sweet taste to the burger. I don't think they add mayonnaise or mustard like other burger places. . . One major gripe is the price. It is rather pricey for the quantity of food. I could easily eat three burgers here, but I don't think I'll do that considering the burgers are about $6. You could argue quality, but Apple Pan just uses sirloin just like any other major burger place. Â I would only pay $6 for a burger if the burger steak was extraordinary. The best example would be the now defunct Hampton's restaurant, which had the best $6 burger you'll ever have, lol.. . My personal favorite burger restaurant is Molly's in Hollywood, which I feel has a burger that is better than Apple Pan's, and half the price as well.
