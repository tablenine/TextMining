Best. Thai food. Ever. This place is so good, I could eat here every day. The service is always a little spotty, but the food is so good, so cheap and there's so much of it, that it almost doesn't matter. I went here once with someone who lived in Thailand and said this is the closest to authentic Thai food you can get in the US. Never had a bad dish here.
