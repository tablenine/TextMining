Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
I really want to like this place. I do. I swear. . . In the numerous times that Tender Greens has "won" for ordering out lunch, I am so disappointed. . . Eating here is a zoo. Get in line, kids... the only saving grace is we almost always get take out, so we can sneak through the chaos to the back. . . What we get is usually mediocre, especially for the drama.. the orders are often messed up (I know, I know.. they f*&amp;% you in the drive thru!) and today was no exception. Â We asked for (and are charged for) extra bread for my boss.. assured it was in there.. "yes, I just put it in there myself".. yeah... where is this mythical bread I hear talk of? Not on my boss' plate, that's for sure.. . The lettuces are yummy... though I can also get good lettuce at my local produce outlet. . . The flat iron steak is tasteless and oftentimes tough. The grilled veggies were oily. ew. I am ok with a light coating of oil on grilled veggies.. but this was just too much. I tasted oil with a hint of vegetable goodness. The roasted tomato dressing was more oily then tomato-ey.. I threw most of my lunch away. The chicken was ok, but just a somewhat bland addition. . . Our vegetarian friend likes the vegan salad, though it is as hit-or-miss as everything can be.. she has had it twice this week and each time it tasted a bit different and was prepared differently. . . The mashed potatoes are creamy, we usually have a few orders of those coming in. . . The food is not worth the drama/price/inconsistencies that TG seems to deliver. . . If you DO decide you wanna go here, park in the garages, you get a couple hours free.
