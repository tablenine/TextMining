Medianoche from Papi's last night. Some Maduros (plantains) &amp; croquettas. I put the sandwich in my mouth &amp; started crying. Â Literally. Partially because pregnancy hormones are a bitch, but also because it was so damn delicious it reminded me of my abuela's sandwiches. . . The mojo pork is heaping, flavorful &amp; will make you weep. Even the medianoche was a monstrously large sandwich. Best 6 bucks I have ever spent.
