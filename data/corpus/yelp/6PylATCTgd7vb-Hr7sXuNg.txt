Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Who woulda thunk that sour cream would work on a hot dog? The relish, onion, and tomatoes made sense to me, but the sour cream topping on the Guadalajara Dog made me wary. But I decided to go for it anyway, and I enjoyed it!. . The negative reviews here on Yelp made me think I would be really disappointed, but I wasn't at all. Yes, it's not an out of the world hot dog, and yes it is expensive (esp compared to Costco or Ikea), but hey, it's good! The people behind the counter were very nice, and I enjoyed the food and the company :)
