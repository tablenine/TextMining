Truffle fries, people. If this is an option on the menu, do you really need to think about whether or not you will get them? These fries alone were responsible for 3 of the 4 stars given in this review. To hell with the sauces, all you need is truffle oil!. . I'm not a resident of fair Los Angeles, so I made the mistake of walking through a small tent city in downtown to get to Wurstkuche. I felt that my experience earned me a hot dog of high caliber, and I was not disappointed.. . HOWEVER, I always fall prey to the gourmet hot dog pitfall of ordering something with a far too high dog-and-toppings-to-bun ratio, and I think establishments should be more wary of this. People must be stopped from ordering a dog that will disintegrate mid-bite!. . Aside from that, service was pretty good (order-at-counter), beer and interesting soda selection was good...but pricey, although I suppose you Angelenos call this place a "good deal," and I quite enjoyed the patio and seating area.
