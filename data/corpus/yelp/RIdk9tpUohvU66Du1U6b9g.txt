I felt like I was in another era...that said my friend and I had a pleasant enough lunch at Canters for the first time.  She ordered the chicken tostada salad and I had the avocado melt. The portions were huge and so were the crunchy pickles. The waitresses were also friendly and I like that they have a large menu.  Can't say it's the best deli but it's homey and welcoming so I'll come back again.
