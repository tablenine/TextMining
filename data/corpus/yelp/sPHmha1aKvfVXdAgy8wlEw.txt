Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
not a place where you would want to wear your sunday best but they do give you a bib. i've never had crawfish before so i decided to rendezvous with a pal and head on over to the boiling crab.. . so i guess this place is pretty popular because we had to wait almost an hour for our table to be ready and apparently they don't take reservations. they do however take carry out orders. the menu is pretty simple and they charge $2.50 domestic and $3.00 imports. that alone is worth the wait. so on to the crawfish.... . "the whole sha-bang" seasoning is definately the way to go which is pretty much a mixture of all the different seasoning varieties. you also get a choice of spiciness, medium will leave you with a nice sheen on the tip of your nose. my party ordered the 2 pounder which comes with corn* and sausage*. it's actually 2 quarter pieces of corn and 2 bite sized pieces of sausage. nice marketing ploy. the corn and sausage were awesome in that sauce, had to order more. all in all, a fun place to eat and get down and dirty with friends and shellfish.
