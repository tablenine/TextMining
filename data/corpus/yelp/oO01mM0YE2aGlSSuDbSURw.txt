Just went there tonight and liked it a lot!  I had the duck and bacon sausage, and split a bratwurst with my wife.  She had the Austin Blues sausage, and my sister had the Filipino Markesa.  Overall, it's a great place for sausage, and the fries with the truffle oil were really delicious.  I'd give it 5 stars, but it doesn't compare to Hot Doug's in chicago.  I'd come back for sure since there are not too many sausage places in LA.
