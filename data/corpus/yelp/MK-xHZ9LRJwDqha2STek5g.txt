Restaurant: Bhojanic
Category: Indian
The food, which has previously been really great was just "meh". ( i had not been here in almost 2 years). It seemed really americanized (I think it has non indian owners). The food was too hot. I like spicy food, but this was spicy with no flavor, it was all heat. We had garlic naan and honestly, I've had better garlic naan out of the frozen food section of the grocery store. It was not good. . . The service was really bad. They were really busy, but we hardly ever saw our waitress and seemed to be waiting around A LOT. We had to wait a long time for anyone to come and get our order. Then we were without water. Then we had to wait for our check. Then we had to wait for them bring our card back.. . Overall, not a great experience. I'll be getting my indian fix somewhere else and avoiding bhojanic.
