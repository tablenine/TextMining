Laid back..down to earth setting. The line might be long, but it moves quick. Must try an exotic sausage...we tried the Alligator &amp; Pork, Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with jalapeno peppers, Filipino Pork, and Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeno peppers.  My favorite out of these four sausages was the Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with jalapeno peppers.  It was juicy with a kick from the jalapeno peppers.  This is a must try at least once in a lifetime joint.
