my girl friends and i went here for brunch on sunday - what a delight it was!  we got there just after 10am and were seated right away (no hour wait for us like down the street!). . our waitress was very nice - gave us our space and plenty of time to look over the menu.  she also made great suggestions!  i got the 2x2 with the house pancakes - huckleberry - yummm!  one of my friends got the panini and asked to have the meat cooked a bit more.  (come to find out Bin makes their own sausage!)  when the plate was brought back our waitress told us that that dish would be removed from the bill and sorry for the inconvenience - above and beyond the call of duty!  :). . the atmosphere was very nice as well.  you could talk to your friends and not have to yell over the music.  there was quite a variety of people there as well - us group of 5 women, several tables of families with babies and older children, and local neighborhoodie types.. . who new that a wine bar had such a great brunch, delish Bloody Mary's, and all at such an affordable price?  go check it out!!!
