I came here with my friend to try the famous burger and was not disappointed.  It was one of the best I've had in this city, and worth every penny.  The crunchy and savory, aioli was heavenly and perfectly complimented the sweetness of the meat.  The burger was rich and incredibly satisfying.. . But don't even get me started on the french fries.  I might not stop.  I've caught myself day dreaming about them since that day... they seriously melt in your mouth... I need a moment.  And a basket of them.  Stat.
