Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
i LOOOVEE this restaurant! i've been to this restaurant ever since i was young when it used to be down the street. i always used to go with my family and my mom would order a bunch of stuff like the spciy beef salad and som tum to eat with sticky rice. thinking about it is making me hungry. . . i didn't really care much for the elvis impersonator guy, but all the old thai people who eat there love him (including my mom). i think eveyrthing on the menu is great. i can't tell the difference between good and great thai food like my mom can, but the food here has never disappointed me. you can't go wrong at palms!
