Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
First off, I am a Thai fanatic.  Basil, in Charleston, SC, is on my top 5 list of all time. This being my first venture to a Thai spot in ATL, I was wary to say the least.  Seeing all the reviews sold us on giving it a shot, and we were very happy we did.. . The service was as prompt and courteous as you could ask for. We did arrive at the end of normal lunch hours, about 1:30, so I can't vouch for service while busy.  We started with the basil spring rolls which were served with a spicy plum sauce. They were fresh, if nothing else. I was disappointed with the spicy plum sauce.  They should try a Thai chili sauce instead.  The dissapointment was short lived though.  The coconut soup was great!  Some places go to heavy on the lemongrass, but the have it down pat. My fiancée had the pad see ew and I had the panang curry. Both were outstanding and left us plenty for dinner!  All in all, 25 bucks with tip included, and a meal leftover.  Great service, ambiance and food.  Only 15 minutes from home,  sure it will become a staple.
