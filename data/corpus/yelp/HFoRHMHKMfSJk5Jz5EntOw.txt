I went here for a work sponsored event on a Friday night.  . . The best way I can describe this is an upscale quasi-sports bar.  The place in not flooded with a million tvs, but there are enough if you want to watch something.  I found the crowd to be mainly 'loop dressy', which did not play too well with my CBGB t-shirt.. . Overall not a bad place, but probably a little too stuffy for me to hang out at that often.
