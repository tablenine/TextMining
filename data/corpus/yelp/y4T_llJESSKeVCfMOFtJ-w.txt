Restaurant: Over Easy Caf√©
Category: American (Traditional)
I drag the husband to brunch pretty regularly. He officially declared Over Easy his favorite so far. You can't go wrong with Sassy Eggs. I mean, if they served nothing BUT Sassy Eggs, they would still make a killing. So. Good.. . I had the pancake special. My eggs were cooked perfectly. The wait sucked in the cold, but they give you coffee and everyone is just too nice to get pissed off.
