The setting is nice and it's on Melrose avenue so good for people watching but my wife and I were really disappointed with the food. We had just gone to Square One Dining the day before and loved it and so almost went back there, but decided to try something different. The split pea soup was good but the other things were a bit disappointing. My wife got the veggiewich and although i didn't try it she thought it was just "A-ok."  I got the gourmet benedict with Norwegian smoked salmon and thought it was very mediocre.  Maybe we picked the wrong things, but supposedly those were some of the most popular items. I was really torn with the breakfast eggwich, maybe I should've tried that.. The staff were attentive,  timely,  and nice. We went midweek so it wasn't too busy.. We were going to order a few sandwiches to go for our visiting relatives but instead decided to pick up sandwiches to go from Joan's on Third instead.
