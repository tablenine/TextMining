MMMM Good, tomato sauce everywhere. This pizza pie has an outstanding, fresh tomato flavor that rocks. I think the sauce makes the pie. The place is nicely decorated, good level of noise and you can tag the walls with your gangsta moniker when you're done. I did upstairs in a hallway. Will visit next time I'm in the Windy City!
