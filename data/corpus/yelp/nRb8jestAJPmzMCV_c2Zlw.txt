GO HERE FOR THE WAGWU BEEF. AS EXPENSIVE AS IT IS, IT IS WORTH IT, and this is the place to go for the best. It melted in my mouth and was the best flavor i have tasted in my life!!!! THEY MASSAGE THE COWS AND GIVE THEM BEER I BELEIVE?!. ALSO, i think the risotto with truffles, or something with truffles was very good. . The salads are also not bad there, but WAGWU BEEF ALL THE WAY!. I went with my family and a family of my dad's friends with two little kids.. The place is dressy and elegant, but kids can also come here.
