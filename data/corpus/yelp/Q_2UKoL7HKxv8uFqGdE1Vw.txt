The best Cuban food I've found in California so far!. . Try the pork and platanos if it's your first time. The sangria is to die for too. I recently had the Ox Tail and could not believe how much I enjoyed it. The halibut is tasty and rich. . I like the simple ambiance. . . Everyone I have taken here have been really impressed. . Just be prepared to smell like garlic when you leave!
