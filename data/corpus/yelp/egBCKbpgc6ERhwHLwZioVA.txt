Restaurant: Ben Pao

When I go out for Asian food, I usually expect huge portions for reasonable prices.  This is not true for Ben Pao.  While everything is quite tasty, I felt as though this place was really lacking personality.  Service was mediocre, and the prices were too high for the portions you received.  I really did enjoy the decor and the drink menu.  I forgot what it was called, but it was something to the extent of a ginger ale slushee...super good!
