Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
This was the first place we walked into on our visit to this city. We didn't really know the area too well, and were just walking around knowing we were hungry. Then ran into this cute little place...not really by choice cause it started raining, so we just ran into here. But I'm so glad we did. There was no one there, but then again it was a really odd time to eat, around 4pm or something. But the waiter we had was so nice and welcoming. He gave us great suggestions of the area and nice conversation. It really gave me a great first impression of Chicagoans as being friendly and nice. But besides that, the food we ordered was so good. I don't really remember what I got exactly but I think it was a spinach/mushroom pasta something...whatever it was, it was yummy. My boyfriend got the meatballs, and those were huge balls! . . And it looked like there was a bar that was attached to the restaurant. Fun place. Good food. good service.
