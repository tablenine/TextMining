Two words: Not impressed! Never again will I eat at this "establishment" aka juke joint!. The first strike was dealing with the rude hostess who I later found out was a manager. Why would anyone put her in charge of anything dealing with people? Then as I tried to order, I was told that several items were out of stock. The server was unprofessional enough to let me know that the owner owes their distributor money so they're low on food. What? Where they do that at? Silly me still ate there, my omelet was gooey and all the ingredients were bunched together. The bacon in the omelet was soggy and the hash brown stayed in my stomach for the rest of the day. And the final straw: I went to wash my hands after the meal and there was no hot water! I am so distgusted. Tried to support a black-owned business but the verdict? Never again!
