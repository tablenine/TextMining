i really didn't want to like it. after a horrible experience at another Batali restaurant years ago in NYC, i vowed never to set foot in his establishments. but after all the rave reviews, i had to try this place.. . i admit, it was fantastic. the pizza was perfect and there were enough veggie options to try out a few and share among friends. reasonable prices too, though the meal can quickly get expensive with wine, appetizers, and dessert. but bottom line, i'd go back.
