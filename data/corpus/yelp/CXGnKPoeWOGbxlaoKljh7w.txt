I am not easily impressed by most sushi joints but this one gets four stars.  I've been to most sushi places in Chicago and Mirai is probably number 1 or 2 in freshest sushi I've had.  We went on a Saturaday night and sat at the sushi counter.  The sushi chefs were knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  We had the edamame to start (which can be warmer and wished it had more salt).  Also had the tempura appetizer which was good but abit oily and greasey.  The sushi rolls were fresh and the sushi rice that came with it was quality.  The restaurant is loud and packed!  Parking is hard to find around this neighborhood so we valet our car... long story short, the valet couldn't find our car and forgot where he parked it.. we waited for 30 minutes.   Would I come back?!  YES!  Would I valet?  No.
