Alon's you have made my job TOUGH. Once every 3 mths my job has a VIP come to Atlanta for a meeting. My boss tells me.... .  " Angela, this guy is a real danish snob - can you make sure you have some great danishes for the meeting"? . . So I drive from midtown to virgina highlands early  in the morning (not far I know) to Alon's! The danishes are a HIT...he loves Alon's, and now I am this VIP's new best friend. When he comes to town we drive to Alon's for danishes and coffee.  Like I needed the extra work!!!  THANKS ALON'S!!!
