Old school burger joint where you sit at the counter.  Seating is hard to find however as you need to just wait and sit when there's an opening.. . Burger was freshly made and hot, but it's just a decent burger.  Also offers home made pies that are decently sized. . . More of a blast from the past and a nice experience.
