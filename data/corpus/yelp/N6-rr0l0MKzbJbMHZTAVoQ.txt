Ramen for the masses, if you want to wait for an hour or so, and get into an environment that's really hot inside, then, this is your place.. . Was invited to come here in the summer with a group, have been here about three times, wanted to find out what the hype was about. . Long lines, ramen was OK, nothing special, and I actually didn't really think it was all that good.  But, that's my opinion.. I LOVE noodles, ramen being noodles... So far in Los Angeles, probably Shinsengumi Shoyu ramen I enjoy the most... I've had some good ramen here... . http://www.gnavi.co.jp.... . Esp. Hokkaido style Miso -- So good!. and some others, the sweet beef stock...  Oops... But, I digress.... . The score:. Pro's - Your friends know where this is, Nice Japanese nostagia for decor. . Con's - Tough to find parking, Long Waits, Bad ventilation inside, So-so Ramen
