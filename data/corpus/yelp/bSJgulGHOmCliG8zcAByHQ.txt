This is humane dining at its best.  I'm hooked on their pizza but I've been known to get the pepper steak sandwich too.  Their iced tea surprised the hell out of me because it's herbal and I hate herb tea.  Still I can drink Native Foods' iced tea by the gallons.  It's delicious.  Good thing they have a bottomless drink cup.  That's a great bargain.. . Beware of the fries.  They're addictive.  You won't be able to have just one.. . You won't believe there are no animals products passing through the door.  All in all, this is guilt-free eating on every level.  . . p.s.  The parking is horrendous.  Difficult at best.  Park across Wilshire and walk here.
