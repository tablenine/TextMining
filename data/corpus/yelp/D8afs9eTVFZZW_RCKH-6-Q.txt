Totally conflicted on this one.  Want to give it three stars for some reason, but I am going to leave it at four.  For now.. . The food is decent.   The sushi is not excellent.   The restaurant itself is nice, and I love coming here at night.  Especially because I can walk there.  In fact, that may be one of my favourite things about this place.  I can walk.  No need to take a cab or the tube.  . . The view is awesome.  They have a nice sake list.  It is expensive but not "oh shit" expensive.  Four stars.
