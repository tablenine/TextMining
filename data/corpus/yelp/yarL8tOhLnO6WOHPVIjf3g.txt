We lucked out and spotted this place as we drove by. Giant portions for cheap and everything was very good. Â BBQ chicken plate with white rice, black beans and plantains, Cuban sammich, steak sammich, fries, mango shake. . . I counted 12 waiters- the place was hopping and the service was excellent.
