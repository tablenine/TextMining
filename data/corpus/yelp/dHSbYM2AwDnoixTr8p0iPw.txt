Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
it was a shorter wait than the other famous ramen joint and we were hungry so we came here.... . the smell of the broth is more herbally at this ramen joint than others i've been to... . . lots of seating indoors and outdoors... . . finally sat down and ordered the shio ramen spicy level 5 with egg and pork. - the pork was the thing that stood out... super tender, super thick, 2 huge pieces thats what dictates my three stars here. - the ramen was the next thing that stood out as it was nicely al dente. - the egg could have been a lil more soft boiled. - the broth was great but nothing to scream over... wasn't as flavorful as it smells. . overall good but wouldn't seek it out if i were in la again...
