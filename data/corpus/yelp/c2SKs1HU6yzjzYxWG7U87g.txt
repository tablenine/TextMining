Aside from the faux-distressed-mehicano aesthetic to this place, I like it because their steak fajitas are off the hook. I'm a meat freak, and this place satisfies every time. Their guac is also tha bombiest! And it's rare that you find a bottomless glass of coke in the city. Sure the prices are ridiculous, and the decor is a bit disneylandish, but Â I'm convinced there is no better steak fajita in the world.
