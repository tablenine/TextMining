The sign above the door says it all - organic vegan cuisine. Owner Ann Gentry's Memphis meets Manhattan approach to gourmet vegetarian cuisine expands the frontiers of the animal-free plate. The friendly service, the art-lined walls, and the bright interior provide a relaxed environment to enjoy a lunch. . . My first time here, I enjoyed the Club sandwich (seitan, tempeh bacon, lettuce, tomato, vegenaise, sourdough bread) with a side of jalapeno cashew cheese. I look forward to trying the BBQ Tofu Chop (seasonal vegetables, barbeque tofu, shredded cashew cheese, romaine, ranch dressing) next time.
