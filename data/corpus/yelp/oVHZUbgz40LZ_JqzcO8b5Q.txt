Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
I lived on ramen during my Tokyo visit because it was so affordable and hard to replicate outside of Japan.  Needless to say, after having been utterly disappointed by the much-hyped Asahi Ramen on Sawtelle, I didn't have much hope for LA ramen.  But I had a hankering for some ramen and was in the downtown area so I decided to give Daikokuya a shot.  First, I scored free, easy parking right in front of the restaurant so I was already in a good mood.  Then, we walked in and we had JUST beat the rush (we arrived at 6).  We snagged a table and literally one minute later there was a bunch of people in the waiting area.  The ramen came out QUICK, as did the pork cutlet bowl.  I am a pork cutlet aficionado and I didn't know this one would have egg one top.  I usually like my cutlets with nothing on top so as to keep the panko crust nice and crispy.  The egg on top makes it soggy, which defeats the purpose of eating something fried.  Anyway, the ramen was delicious and the broth was yummers too.  And you know, you gotta eat ramen Japanese style - SLURP it.  It tastes better when you eat it that way.
