Restaurant: Big Star
Category: Mexican
I'm not going to lie - the food is good at Big Star.  But the staff is so mean, condescending and horrible that I just cannot ever see myself speding another dime in this place.  I've been here 3 times...the first two were fine... the staff was tolerable on those occasions.  But this past experience was so horrible that I will never ever ever go back.  . . Not only did they make us wait 3 hours for our table (even though we saw plenty of tables open up), but they also yelled at us everywhere we stood, harrassed us when we talked to people at other tables (how were we supposed to know our good friends would be there!) and tried to take our chairs and table anytime someone got up to smoke or go to the bathroom.  Even when I was sitting there with my margarita and all my roommates were smoking, they tried to kick me out of my table!! They're so rude and horrible - please avoid Big Star!  Patronizing this restaurant will only validate their awful, awful behavior!!
