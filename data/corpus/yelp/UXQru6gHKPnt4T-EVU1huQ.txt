Restaurant: 123 Burger Shot Beer
Category: Burgers
I found the sweet potato fries to be just okay but the waffle fries and the sliders style burgers were great for the price. Especially when you are washing it down with beer. The shots look like those really sweet candy shots- I personally didn't have any but my friend did and she didn't really complain. Good place to just chill with friends, but not the best place.
