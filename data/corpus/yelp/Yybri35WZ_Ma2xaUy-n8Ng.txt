Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
After a night of disaster (missed one of my dear friends wedding because of Jet Blue--that's another review to come), I had a hankering for ramen, SPICEY ramen (you know to dull down the disappointment from the night before).  I met up with some friends and decided to go to Orochon.  I ordered the #1 this time instead of Special #1 (didn't feel like sweating before boarding the plane).  It had just enough peppers to clear my sinus, but not make my stomach bubble :)  It was so good!!!!!  The ramen itself was cooked just right.  It wasn't too al dente or soggy.  I would have finished the entire bowl if I could have, but I can never finish an entire bowl of noodle (I know....it's a crime!).. . My friends ordered:. . Special #1-the one below Special #2-he enjoyed the spice.. . #3 with soy-the broth was so savory with a nice kick of spice!. . #4 with miso-mild but still a mouthful of flavor.. . #5, etc.  didn't try those since it was too far down the table lol.. . Gyoza-it was good and juicy.. . side of char siu-so tender!. . Plus: I love how they don't cook the egg all the way!. . Beer: Asahi-*ahhhh!* refreshing :). . service-they were so accommodating!  We got there at 12:10, but the entire party wasn't there yet.  An hour later I changed our seats to 5 because I thought we'd miss our flight.  He sat us down right away knowing that we had to head home.  Right when we sat down my friend calls and says she just parked, so I hurried and told him that we actually have 8.  He seemed a bit annoyed, but didn't say anything and sat us within the next 5 minutes for a party of 8 indoors (out of the heat).  They were totally awesome for being so patient with us!
