Folks, when a place has been opened for only a year and it has this many good reviews there's a good reason!!! For me, it's only the higher price that keeps me from giving them all 5 stars. I have absolutely no complaints about their food, service, ambiance, etc. They all excell. 1st: they have IMO some of the better TVP (textured vegitable protein) than most other veggie places - although not the best I've had, they serve this food quickly and always well-prepared and nicely presented. 2nd: the staff is uber friendly and always helpful. 3rd: I rarely talk about environment but I really like the vibe of the place, the apple green with orange decor really adds to the experience.
