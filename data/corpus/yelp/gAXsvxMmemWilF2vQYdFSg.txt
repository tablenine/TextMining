Oh. My. Gosh. . . First time I went here, I was meeting my bf in downtown after a long- ass day of work. Let me tell you, driving down the 10 to the 110 to the 101 (yes I got lost) during rush hour was a bitch, but when we finally got seated after waiting outside for forever, the ramen was completely worth it. . . Get their traditional ramen if it's your first time. The chicken and egg rice dish is also really good, something about it just reminds me of eating at home. The only thing that would make this place more perfect is if it wasn't located downtown. Oh well.
