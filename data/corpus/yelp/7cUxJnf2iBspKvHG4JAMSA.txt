I had the best crab legs of my life.  Literally.  Amazing.  The mood was good.  The prices were reasonable.  The ambiance was typical Hollywood.. . My only beef was that that they tried to make me put down a credit card deposit (reasonable) and sign a contract (unreasonable) for a party of 9 on a Wednesday night.
