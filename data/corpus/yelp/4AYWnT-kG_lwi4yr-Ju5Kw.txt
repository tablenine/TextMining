Restaurant: BondSt
Category: Japanese
My boyfriend took me here this past summer.. At first, it just seems like a small place on Bond Street (it's very close to Bond NO. 9 the perfume store). . . We both loved the presentation of Bond St. They had very friendly waiters and a good atmosphere. We had dinner around 6PM, so it was still quiet but soon enough, more people came in. . Since it was restaurant week when we went, I got the prefix, which samples some very unique foods. Sorry I don't remember what they were, but we do have pictures of our food! The boy also got the sake sampler, very cute!
