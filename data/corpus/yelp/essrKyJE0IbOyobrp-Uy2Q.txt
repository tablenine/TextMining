Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
Fantastic value for even better food. The fail-proof dishes are:. . - Seared albacore with crispy onion. - Tuna sashimi with jalapenos. - Spicy tuna on crispy rice. - Baked crab rolls (cut), with a side of creamy rock shrimp tempura. - Kobe beef burger. . Los Angeles is brimming with sub-par "trendy" "neo-Japanese" restaurants that charge way too much for ambience, and Izaka-ya is a refreshing exception. The food is better than Katsuya's and is so much cheaper. . . P.S. Make reservations a day or two ahead to avoid the 40-minute wait on any given night.. . P.P.S. If you sit at the bar, you may get to take beer shots with the sushi chefs. Lots of fun.
