Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
I started out thinking very highly of Butterfly.  It's really close, the mod decor is nice, and the service is generally quick, but subsequent trips have been less pleasing.. . I've tried a pretty large sampling of the menu.  The sushi is generally good, and cheap, but some of the specialty rolls get a little too delicate and complicated for me.  Stick with the eel or the spicy tuna.  The thai food seems to be the definition of OK.  Of all the Thai dishes i've had here, there hasn't been one that was terrible or one that was particularly good.  But, again, it's pretty cheap, aided by being BYOB, which is ALWAYS nice.. . I advise reservations on Fri-Sat anytime after 7 or so, because it does get busy and the place isn't very big at all.  I have had one bad experience with the service while there with a large party for a friend's bday.  There were about 10 of us, engaging in some general merrymaking, whooping it up if you will.  We had been there for 1.5-2 hours (basically finished with eating, but still drinking and having dessert) when we were semi-kindly asked by the staff to leave.  Now, i understand it was Friday, and we were a big party, but we had spent MUCH money in that place, so why not just let us kick the last little bit of wine and be on our merry way?
