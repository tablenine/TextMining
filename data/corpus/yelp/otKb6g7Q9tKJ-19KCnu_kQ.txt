Atmosphere is great...food is ok. My husband liked his roast chicken, and the fries were good, but my pulled pork was a little dry, and the mac 'n cheese was very disappointing and almost entirely uncheesy. . . I will probably give it another chance though--it's close to where I live, and the banana pudding was delicious!
