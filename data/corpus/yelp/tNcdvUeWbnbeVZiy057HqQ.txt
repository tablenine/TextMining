Definitely not for the picky eater, FAB caters to the more sophisticated palette. . . I visited FAB twice in one day, first for lunch with a co-worker where we were waited on by an authentic French waiter, I mean... "Garcon". We both ordered the lamb sandwich and it was delectably tender. . . I was back for dinner with another girlfriend and this time sealed the deal for my five star rating! Although not french, our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the seared salmon. The salmon was paired perfectly with a grapefruit sauce, saffron potatoes, and asparagus. My girlfriend ordered the duck confit which was wonderfully cooked. Surprisingly, they gave healthy portions. No little teasers, a full plate! We had a bottle of wine with dinner and then moved on to dessert. The creme brule was sooo fresh! This dish had obviously been prepared from scratch when we made our order. It was incredibly light but still rich. A glass of champagne with dessert completed the meal. . . While it is a bit pricey, the portions were full and the food was fantastic so it was worth every penny. . . There was one thing I didn't like... they had TVs over the bar that you could see from almost every seat in the restaurant. It was quite distracting to be in this charming restaurant with a goofy movie or sports playing in the background. If I wanted to watch TV, I'd have gone to the sports bar and ordered a burger and beer!
