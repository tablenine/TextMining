So, I contemplated on what to rate this restaurant for a few days and was really torn.  Based on just the food alone, I would give them 5 stars.  However, based on service, I'd probably give them 2.5 or 3 stars, so I settled with 4 stars.  I had the buffalo, pork, and beef sausage with the fries and my friend had the santa fe sausage.  We were huge fans.  The sausage is just so juicy and tender and delicious!  We got the blue cheese with walnut and bacon dipping sauce which was very bland and unimpressive, but the sundried tomato mayo was VERY good. . . Service sucked.  I didn't even really mind the line because you can order beer while waiting, but after we had ordered, we went to go sit.  Then a few minutes later, the cashier came running to us saying that they lost our ticket and needed our order again.  So, we told him.  THEN, we got our sausages and they forgot my sauerkraut, the one thing I was really looking forward to!!  THEN, they forgot our fries!  I had to go back there and ask for our fries.  The waitress didn't even seem phased and got us the fries, which makes me think that this happens all the time.  However, the atmosphere is super cool, very German cafeteria style.  . . I'd definitely go back...despite the service. ;)
