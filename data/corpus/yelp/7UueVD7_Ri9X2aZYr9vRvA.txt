Got my wedding cake here - great move! (Go me!) The BEST price I could find by far, tasted ... well, like wedding cake (in a good way) and it arrived very very pretty and on time and everything you'd expect. The girls that help with the cakes are very sweet. I'd give them five stars but it's maddening trying to get questions answered on the phone (on hold forever and a day) and then there are some language issues that are frustrating. They really want you to come in person to discuss stuff, vs. over the phone, which can be inconvenient if you don't live in the area. But overall, I am a very happy customer and would do it all over again in a heartbeat!
