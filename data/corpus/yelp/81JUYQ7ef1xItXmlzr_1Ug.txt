This place was awesome!  I went with 2 friends on a Wednesday and we got the last table at 7:45 and it was crowded until we left - always a good sign!  The service was a bit mish mashed as I think every waitress in the place waited on us as some point, but I didn't care because they were friendly and prompt.  I ordered the chicken enchilades with mole and holy mole, they were AWESOME!  So good, I was fully willing to eat all 3 despite the fact that I was full after 1.5.  I just didn't want to stop the YUM.  Chips and salsa were good, although I like a chunky salsa and they had the smooth kind, but both were very good.  I recommend if you are in this area.
