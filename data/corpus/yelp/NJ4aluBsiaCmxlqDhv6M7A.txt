Ok so this place might look nice or cheest depending on whos with you or how hungry you are. Nothing fancy no frills or paino player, but a small cozy local place to grab a small bite to eat. havent been there in a while but one of my close places to eat at when I resided there in the big CC. Hit or miss on food. (But in CW's review looks like her friend made a hit...)
