Anything less than 5 stars is just plain blasphemous! I love this place and everytime I am in the area, I have to stop by for their spicy polish pastrami dog and don't forget the chili cheese fries and onion rings. I like the chili...it's different from any other chili that I have ever eaten and the onion rings are so light and crunchy. I wish I could franchise this place and then eat it every single day. Bring on the heart attack!
