Stopped in here while on a geocache outing to take a load off.  After a flight of tequila (incredible!) we were ready to take on the world again...or perhaps just care a bit less if we couldn't find our treasures.  The bartender was great, the guac looked awesome and the plates of foods passing by smelled good enough to try and grab a taste.  Looked like a good place for further exploration.
