Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I don't get to eat here too often as I do many restaurants, but when I do, boy, is it a treat! I love the way how the juices of the steamed dumplings burst into my mouth, just like a fruit Gusher. (but better and hotter!) Â The fried rice and porkchop are pretty good here too - not greasy, but just flavorful.. . Try to catch the first serving if you don't want to wait forever and a day and get a ticket to mark what you want while you wait so the food comes quick while you're seated. Parking can be tedious here and I'm guessing that this place is the cause of traffic jams on the Baldwin / Duarte intersection. Nevertheless, this place is still awesome to me.
