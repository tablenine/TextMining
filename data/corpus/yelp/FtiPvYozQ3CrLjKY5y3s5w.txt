as much as it pains me to say this, FOGO did NOT live up to the hype and i was expecting so much more! Â i was SO disappointed after the meal! . . the highlights of the meal the CHEESE BALLS! the picanha, the filet mignon, and the beef ribs, OH AND LETS NOT FORGET that decadent dessert, papaya mixed w/ vanilla ice cream and black liqueur on top!! the alcohol complimented the papaya so well!!!. . other than that some of the meats were dry! especially the pork ribs! i just can't imagine why they would have dry or even tasteless meats at the price you pay! (it must be inconsistent because i loved the filet mignon but when my roomie went she said it was dry). . as for the sides they bring to your table, the mashed potatoes were so grainy like boxed mash!.. polenta was good.. bananas were ok.. salad bar had good selection.. tres leches cake was eHh i've had better. . their service is great though! if you don't want to wait for any of the meats to circle to your table, just tell any waiter and they will bring it straight to you!. . question resolved: what are those tongs for? to pull the meat from those swords adorned w/ meats!. . i mean i guess the meal wasn't BAD but for that price and after all i've heard, i just expected so much more and I was very let down like a deflated BALLOON!
