The people watching out on the patio CANNOT be beat [even though it was Pride so there were extra people to watch]. Come for the food -stay for the show.. . I thought the service was fantastic. The hostess was friendly, the waitress was friendly, the bus boys were friendly - hell, even the parking guy directed us to a place down the street where we might [and did] find street parking after we told him we were going to walk up to the Parade following brunch.. . The food was a bit so-so. My Crab Benedict had all the right textures going on, but the fishiness of the crab cake was a bit disappointing. My partner had a ham and cheese omelet that was a bit over done. Both came with rather lackluster fried potatoes. I also noticed a couple sitting near us had ordered the fritatta - it was also over done. The mimosa were prfectly proportioned with just enough OJ for coloring.. . Overall, I really thought it was a cute place and will definitely go back for further research next time I get to WeHo.. . Food   3. Service   5. Decor   4. Other    street parking on Pride Sunday!   5
