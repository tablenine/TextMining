Restaurant: SIP The Experience
Category: Coffee & Tea
Even with all the great reviews, I approached SIP with some skepticism.  I had taken a look at their website and it is often a bad sign that a place feels the need to say of itself, "We're hip."  SIP says it is and I suppose in a 'suburbia in the city' kind of way it is.  If you enjoy the look of IKEA, you'll feel extra comfy here.  . . Truthfully, though, the service was friendly and helpful.  The music was just the right level.  The wifi was fast and steady.  The food was above average for a place like this (nice to see actual dead animal on a menu at a coffee house).  My iced tea and my iced coffee were fine.  Hooking up with friends on the outside patio is a big plus here and if you take MARTA, this is perfect as it is just across from a station.. . Overall impression:  not hip, but that isn't a negative comment.  Hip isn't always meant to be flattering.  Comfortable, clean and welcoming are the things SIP definitely can lay claim as being.
