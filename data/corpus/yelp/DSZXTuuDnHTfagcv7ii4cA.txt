i am giving this place a low rating, but not the worst possible rating for the following reasons:  1. the burger i had was horrendous and i wanted to kill old women while eating it.  2. the fries were pretty fucking exceptional and my girlfriend said her mac n cheese was solid as well...so that counts for something.. . 1. the burger:  awful. i was filled with rage while eating it because it was so tasteless.  usually i follow my rule of thumb when consuming burgers in a big city...diner = bad, bar = good.  i should have trusted my instinct on this one.  i don't know what else to say other than the fact that i will not give this establishment my money ever again due to how shitty this burger was. i take my burger consumption very seriously and this sandwich was a low blow insult to my experiences.. . 2. the fries/my gf's mac n cheese.  the fries were fresh cut, cripy on the outside and mushy on the inside, exactly as fries should be. not overly greasy, but not dry either. i was pleased with my side option, so i feel Stella's deserves credit for that, at least.  the mac n cheese i did not personally taste, but my girlfriend knows her food, as do i.  i trust what she says and she said it was delightful.  therefore, i'm giving Stella props for that particular menu item as well.. . summary:  fuck Stella's.  it should be a crime against humanity to serve up a burger that detestable.  if you want a good burger in the city of Chicago, hit up FEED on California and Chicago.  that shit'll melt in your mouth and you can thank me later.
