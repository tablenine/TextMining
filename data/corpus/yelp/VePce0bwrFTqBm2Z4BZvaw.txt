Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Papa Cristos for the win. . . Most of the reviews on here already hit the highlights: awesome gyros, the mousakka is amazing, great bakery, cool environment but a bit expensive. . . Flat out, this place is a go-to as finding food this hearty and pure is a challenge in LA.
