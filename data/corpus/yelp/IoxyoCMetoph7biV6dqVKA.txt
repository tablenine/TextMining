The cajun fries are crunchy and spicy.  Crawfish is very flavorful...the sauce gets under the shell, flavoring the meat and head (there's not much meat so you may want to order a lot).  The shrimp is pretty fresh but isn't as flavored as the crawfish.  Corn and sausage are tasty sides.. . Their parking lot is very very small so most likely you'll have to find parking on the street.  If you want to battle the lunch/dinner crowds, be prepared to wait for a LONG time.
