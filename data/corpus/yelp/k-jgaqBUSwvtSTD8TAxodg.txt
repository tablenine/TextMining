A N9ne here in my backyard, how fabulous! I love the N9ne in Vegas, it remains one of my favorite meals and was excited to see that it had made it here.  We anxiously went here for a friend's birthday hoping to relive the magic that we experienced in Vegas. If Vegas pulled a rabbit out of the hat, then Chicago's version pulled a hamster.  The potato gnocchi that literally was so good in Vegas it forced us all to order our own tray of it here was actually subpar and nowhere near the taste sensation we had before.  The scallops were subpar, Ive had much better. The food wasn't terrible but for the prices it wasnt great.. .  I think our favorite part came during dessert where they have very unusual concoctions including this thing that includes cotton candy, a chocolate dipped pretzel, and some type of ice cream.....its delish!  Also the smores are so creative a little fire pit and it feels like you're back at camp oniwanna. A little comfort food in a sleek upscale restaurant, such a great little touch. The ambiance though is superb, it makes you feel upscale and the overall service is nothing short of five star. I just wish the food was cooked in Vegas and shipped here. If you have a chance visit the one in Vegas you won't be disappointed.
