This place made my taste buds scream "Ay ayayay aya ya!!!" Im not sure what that means, but in my book, its good. I sank my white pearlys deep into the food at Adobo and threw up my hands in major acceptance. Â Order the Chips w/ Guacamole and you basically hire your own personal human to crush and mix up the perfect dip. If you're willing to go on a date with me, I will order several margaritas, as they are top notch. This place is a little pricey, but well worth it. . If I had to describe this place in 18 words it would be, "A Romantic, intimate, well serviced restaraunt with authentic and sexy dishes that you will almost get arroused from". . Love always, Silky
