My friend had been raving about this place for months so I finally decided to give it a try last night. Good life decision on my part! First and foremost, any place that has free parking in LA is already a plus in my book. That set the tone for a wonderful evening. We sat on the patio and sipped delicious beer from their huge selection while waiting for the famed burgers to arrive. My oh my, the reviews were right, those burgers are absolutely amazing. I could go for another one right now. I went w/ the regular frites with that awesome aoili, but am disappointed that I didn't try the sweet potatoe fries after reading all the reviews. Next time ;) and let me assure you, there WILL be a next time.
