Hainan?  Or is it Hainam?  Whatever.  You get the point.  Anyway, I love this stuff.  The first time I went to Savoy everyone was raving about the Hainam chicken.  My excitment dropped when I saw what it actually looked like.  Bland, colorless, boring.  So I got the curry, which was pretty good!  Singaporean style, if I'm not mistaken.. . Fast forward a couple weeks and I find myself back at Savoy.  I am literally force-fed the Hainan chicken.  Lo and behold, I love it!  Believe it or not, the rice is my favorite part...it seems that they cook it with the chicken broth.  So buttery...so heavenly.  I'm on this (or, at least I like to think so) Bro-dude-get-buff-but-lose-some-weight diet, so they Hainam chicken, which is basically just white meat chicken and rice, is perfect.  Coupled with the unlimited iced tea (3/4 tea, 1/4 sugar water), this makes a perfect lunch.
