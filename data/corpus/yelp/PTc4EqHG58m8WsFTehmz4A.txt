Restaurant: Red Light
Category: Asian Fusion
Delicious food, no doubt.  Any place that offers a kind of (very tasty) fish I've never had before is sure to impress me.. . I am opposed to restaurant floor plans that aren't divided up or sectioned off in some way.  They're not very intimate, and are too loud.  Red Light isn't as bad as some of the other places on that Randolph restaurant corridor, but it is a bit "open" feeling.. . The open, out-in-plain-view kitchen thing is cool, but be warned: I feel like I went back to the office smelling like an amalgamation of Asian spices.
