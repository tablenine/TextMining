Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Yum yum yum! Simply the BEST restaurant for some tasty shelled shrimp! They have everything from crawfish to shrimp to different kinds of crab to fresh oyster to fried cajun chicken wings, to fried fish, cajun fried potates and gumbo. After trying various things, I've settled on ordering their shrimp in the whole shebang (mixture of cajun spices, garlic butter and lemon pepper and LOTS of garlic!), raging cajun and the lemon pepper. Their Medium can be pretty spicy, but oh so good! It's more like a get down and dirty place, as the food comes to your table in a plastic bag. They will give you a bib, as the juices from the shrimp and craw fish will get everywhere and can get messy as well as your hands smelling like the seafood and the garlic and seasoning, but it is well worth it. Friendly staff and efficient service. Prices are reasonable. Be prepared to wait--sometimes for a LONG time. . Note: I went for their shrimp this past week, and was a bit surprised to see that the usually jumbo shrimps were mixed with small to medium sized shrimp, and the seasoning was a bit bland. The waitress was also notifying the customers that they had frozen crawfish. A customer was also telling the server that they went to the Garden Grove location, to find that it was closed for remodeling. Wow! Is the recession hitting them, too?
