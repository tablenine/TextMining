Now, this place hails to a time before there were supermarkets. You can go here for your deli needs. The bread. And if you fancy a swig of the booze, it's here too.. . Where else can you go at any hour for a little lox on the bagel. Here!. . This place is, by far, one of my favorite places to go, but I hardly go there. Sad to say folks. Let this be my honorable mention.
