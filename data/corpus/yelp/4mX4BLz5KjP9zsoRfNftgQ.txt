Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
this restaurant has got to be one of the most amazing cases of herd mentality i have ever witnessed on any level...it really ought to be studied by sociologists. . . what you essentially have is a tiny run down store, serving unremarkable food, and for some reason the wait is never shorter than one hour to eat here. i decided to join the herd once and try it out, and could not believe i fell for it.. . things to consider:. . 1. it's a tiny place and really run-down (and not in a cool way, it's just plain ugly). 2. it has a B rating from the health department. 3. the wait is always always absurdly long. . when it comes to the food, anyone who thought their meal was delicious should give themselves a pat on the back, because shabu shabu is simply what you make it. if you mix your sauces right, and cook your meat just the way you like it, you will like your meal.. . i'm not sure what the restaurant itself contributes to the above equation because most restaurants essentially buy their raw products from the same food vendors. the meat here is not any different than the meat ordered by a restaurant next door, or a block away, or 2 miles away. it's not like this restaurant orders their meat from some specialty meat vendor...guess what folks, if they did, the prices wouldn't be as low as they are.. . so i commend those that cooked and seasoned their own meat so well as to justify giving this place a high rating, but realize that the restaurant itself did not contribute anything to your experience...if anything it detracted from it with its long wait time and sub-standard cleanliness (uh hello, B rating??). . but go ahead...feel free to join the herd. . mooooooooooooooo
