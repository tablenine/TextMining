A cool, multi-level environment with funky Asian decor ........... 1 star. . Decent sushi that's half-priced on Sundays ...... 2 stars. (but they get you by adding 18% gratuity .... minus 1 star). . Making fun of how hard the place tries to be something it's not and persuading one of the waiters to demonstrate origami on a table napkin ...... Priceless. . Seriously, take a look at the other reviews and you'll probably see why you should skip out on this place. Â It's probably best for a quick drink or two.
