The best pizza I have ever had anywhere in the world. No hyperbole.  Not the best place to go with a large party.  Go with one other, or just a few people and order anything.  The owner is nice and funny, walking around making sure everyone is enjoying themselves.  If you eat in the kitchen, where there is additional seating, it feels less like an establishment and more like you are the guest of a super great Italian family!  Also, if you like cheese, fresh chopped garlic, or fresh red chile on your pizza- Don't forget to ask for it!  You will get little bowls of each to spoon on yourself.
