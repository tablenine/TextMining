Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
For our unhealthy days, this is a great pick!  Their fried chicken is really good.  Casey likes the standard chicken and waffles, with white meat chicken.  He likes dipping both the chicken and waffles in the syrup.. . I like getting the combo with a chicken breast, collard greens, cornbread, and mac and cheese.  YUM, what a great combo!  I usually take the cornbread home since the rest is so filling.. . The people here are so nice and the food comes out super fast!. . A tad bit expensive, but worth it.  It's probably good that it's not too cheap, or we'd want to go here more (which is not a healthy decision).. . We miss Roscoe's!
