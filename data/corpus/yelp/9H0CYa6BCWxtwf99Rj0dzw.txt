Me and a few friends came here because one of us wanted to try their challenge #2. I had a level 4 or something myself. It was pretty mediocre, like I had expected this is more of a novelty kind of place than something you'd want to come to very often.. . Parking is also a complete bitch. It's a tiny jammed lot, with A narrow curved hard-to-navigate entrance with tiny corridors that require 4 point turns to go back the way you came. NOT lowered car friendly.. . Despite this, I will still come again, if someone else drives, to watch someone I know try the Special #2. Well done Orochon.
