Restaurant: The Water Grill
Category: Seafood
Had a birthday dinner with a group of 6.  One of the better Fine seafood restaurants in LA.  And no, McKormick &amp; Schmicks cannot be compared to it.  The food was actually a 4.  It was the complete service that pushed it up to 5 stars.  I think the old Aqua establishment in Vegas was the best i've had, but Water Grill is definitely top 3.  . . Oysters &amp; Raw Bar was phenomenal.  Fresh as can be.  Fish was cooked perfectly.  Prices are no joke.  Wine list is excellent.  Expect to pay heavy on good one.  But you wont regret it.. . Again, service was spot on.  They didnt miss a beat, and are always on top of everything.
