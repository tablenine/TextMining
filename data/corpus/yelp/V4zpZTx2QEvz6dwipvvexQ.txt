Had heart a LOT about this place.. Just decided to go try the place out when I happened to be in the neighborhood w/ my friend.. Didn't read any of the reviews beforehand.. . I had the 'Portobello sandwich &amp; my friend Â Omelette. . I was disappointed--to say the least.. . Should've read the reviews... =T
