Restaurant: Tin Lizzy&#39;s
Category: Mexican
Overpriced, oddly seasoned chips and mediocre salsa.  Cheese dip was decent.. . The fish taco was ok.  The fajita steak taco was ok.  On the small side.. . The pomegranat margarita was was good, but not effective, if ya know what I mean.. . The staff was very friendly, if not TOO attentive.  A friend of mine got a to-go order from them and they called her an hour later to see how she liked it.  While some folks may find that "good customer service!", I find it obtrusive and annoying.. . I live nearby and just don't see myself frequenting this place.  But if I do, and it's good, I'll give a fair review.  For now, it's just "Meh".
