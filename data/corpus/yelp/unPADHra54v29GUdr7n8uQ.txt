Okay I will just add to the 72 other reviews and claim my love for this place! . . I think my organs and veins have been replaced with black beans and rice and some plantains. My body craves this kinda food like it needs air and water. So nuff said I like this place alot!! . . Have no fret if you see a line outside cuz it will move super fast just like service once you have ordered your food. They must have alot of the food basically ready to go because seriously once you have been seated the food comes out lightning fast. . . This past Friday Nate and I went here and shared the pork plate with mojo sauce (I think its #1 on the menu) We also ordered a side of yucca with some more mojo sauce. The last time we came here I think we each ordered our own plates and we were totally stuffed along with the side of tostones (green plantains that taste like potato) excellent with some salt and black beans on them!! Also we were going to the Amanson afterward and my leftovers filled the car with garlicky smells for days! . . So in the fashion of Austin Powers I recommend sharing your mojo sauce with your loved one and making out with some oniony breath! Â . . Minus the one star for needing an interior update!!
