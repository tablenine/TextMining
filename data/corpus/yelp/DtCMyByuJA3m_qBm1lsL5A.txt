The chocolate coconut cupcake is as they recommend on Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." Now, I am not a fan of chocolate cupcakes, nor icing, but this was one exception I had to make. The cream cheese icing on top of the chocolate cupcake was surprisingly underwhelming and not as sweet as I expected. I will be back for more.. . Street parking was awfully hard to find during the daytime. I can see why. This was the busiest place on the street!
