Very good food. But too expensive for the amount they give which is very little. The ambience is great and the booths are definitely the place to be. But beware of the parking. It is holloywood so be prepared to either valet or walk a little. This restaurant does have something unique. If you're celebrating a birthday, instead of cake or ice cream for dessert they bring you a "chocolate cake" shot. I didn't taste it. I only smelled the glass afterwards. Very interesting. And to my dismay they only had chai tea. They don't serve coffee. Too bad because this very good dinner would have been perfectly finished a nice cup of good coffee.
