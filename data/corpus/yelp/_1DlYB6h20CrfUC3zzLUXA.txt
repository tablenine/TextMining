One of my favorite restaurants in LA.  Its focus is on the simpler side of things, but the food is fresh and fantastic.  I always leave satisfied with the service and the food at this place.  The location in Santa Barbara is just as good.  Menu varies throughout the year to keep up with the seasonal catch.
