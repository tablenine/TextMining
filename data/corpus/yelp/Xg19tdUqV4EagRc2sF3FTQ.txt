3.47 stars.. . There is just something about the pork in the U.S., or maybe it's the water, or maybe it's the non-Taiwanese assistant cooks, that makes this the most inferior DTF of the chain.  The soup dumplings / xiao long baos (XLBs) dry out too quickly in the U.S. to be enjoyed.. . BUT...it's better than none and still pretty good compared to other U.S. restaurants' XLBs.. . I like the XLBs and the chicken soup here.  DO NOT get the beef noodles, it's terrible.
