We (the family) have been going here since they opened at this location.. We enjoy breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner.. Good value for the money.. Our favorites include:. blackened catfish, louisiana chicken salad, hoppin' jack, hoppin' john, vegetable platter (choose 3 sides), black bean veggie burgers, the corn muffins, the greens, the mashed sweet potatoes, the Yankee coleslaw, the omelets, the eggs (you choose how they're prepared &amp; your sides), the cheese grits, the grilled chicken sandwich, etc.. In other words, this place is reliable===good food, good service, nice atmosphere.
