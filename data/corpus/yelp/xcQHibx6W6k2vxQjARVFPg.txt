Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
if u like charred, burnt steak then cut is your type of steakhouse. i ordered a bone in rib eye rare and it came out medium. they were really nice and accomodating about it (which is why they get 2 stars instead of 1) and gave me some appetizer to munch on while i waited. when i finally had my steak, i was horrified because all i could taste is burnt, charred, etc etc. the restaurant is nice and i like the atmosphere... but i wouldnt go back there.
