WOW!!!! THIS PLACE IS PERFECT.. . I am truly speechless. This is the first time where I find myself with absolutely no suggestions for improvements. Service was amazing. The guy who helped me was very friendly and patiently guided me through the wide variety of choices they have. I had to sample a few things since I am not from this area and not sure when I will get a chance to come here again.. . The meat pie was brilliant. The chicken potato ball was HEAVEN, better than Gregoire in Berkeley Gourmet Ghetto (Bay Area) where everyone raves about their potato balls. The cuban steak sandwich was unbelievable. It had tiny pieces of plantain chips and was so fresh and amazing. The tiramisu was spectacular as well. I had a large orange juice which was made in front of my eyes with nothing added to it.. . And...all that was only $15. What the???? Aah, I thought of one improvement area. Open one of these next to my house in the Bay Area.
