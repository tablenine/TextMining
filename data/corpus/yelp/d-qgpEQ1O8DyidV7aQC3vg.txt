First off, I would like to say that I appreciate this restaurant.   The reason I say that I appreciate it, is because everything on the menu looked amazingly healthy.  Sandwiches, grilled chicken, turkey chili, tomato basil soup, etc... all really healthy food.  Besides the healthyness, the food is served on plates (not something disposable) AND the take out is served in biodegradable containers.  Even the straws are made from corn-syrup. I give serious kudos to the owners. . . The goods:  The turkey chili was great...as was the potato salad!  The arugula salad with feta and pear slices was pretty good too.  Food aside, the service was great!  The two men behind the counter were very welcoming and were willing to let us try anything we like before we committed to a choice.  I thought this was a great because I was having a really hard time making up my mind.  . . The not-so-goods: i'm not sure of another way of keeping sandwiches fresh, but I am against refrigerating any type of bread.  I got the turkey bacon sandwich and the bread was hard as a rock.  I'm familiar with eating hard bread -- but this was HARD....like grind your teeth to break through the bread hard.  We had to dump mustard on the bread to aid in the chewing process. . . All in all -- this place was good.  It's about a buck more than what i'd be willing to pay...but i'll still go back.  Service, Quality and eco-friendliness really impressed me.  . . I would definitely suggest this after a good gym session on a weekend.  We ate there after the Peachtree Road Race and it hit the spot right on.
