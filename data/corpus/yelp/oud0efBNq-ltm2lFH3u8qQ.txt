Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Crowded, yes.  Somewhat annoying, yes.  The best burger in town? Yes.  The best beer in town? Yes. (Grimbergen Blonde-it's smooth, full of body, and has the subtlest hint of banana).  I like this location more than the West Side location because it's bigger, and the tables outside are very cool.  The feeling is very meat packing district in NYC...very urban.. . I can't think of anything more delicious than a Father's Office Burger and a Grimbergen Blonde.
