I cannot believe that I forgot to review this place! This is one of my favorite places in Chicago. I have been coming here since I was in high school. It has an inexpensive fairly healthy menu, and always great service. I love to meet friends for coffee here, and also usually bring people from out of town to Kopi for a relaxing, laid back meal or snack. It's a totally unique experience. Do the platform and pillows if you can. Try the chai shake. You will not regret it.
