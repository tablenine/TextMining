I can't wait to go back here! I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday. I had made a note in my Open Table reservation request that it was my birthday and they really made me feel special. I have been here before for drinks and definitely recommend all of them, but this night I drank wine and it was very good though not reasonably priced. After the tasty amuse bouche (sp?), I started off with an oyster. Very tasty and only $3. The BF and I split the octopus appetizer and the pork belly. I really liked the octopus appetizer and highly recommend it. The pork belly was also very good. Next we had the lemongrass soup, which is phenomenal! I had it once before at their Alchemy happy hour they did for a while and was torn whether or not to order it. When I didn't, the waiter was nice enough to bring us a smaller portion for each of us on the house. Definitely an extra star for that! For our entrees we ended up splitting the scallop with oxtail, which is their signature dish. My boyfriend isn't a huge seafood person so would have liked to see more oxtail, but the dish was very good. Lastly we had dessert. I had enough wine at this point not to remember what we had, but I'm pretty sure it was good. They also brought out a little chocolate truffle type thing that said "Happy Birthday" and a little cup of hot chocolate on the house. Everything was great! . . The thing I loved about this place was that they really make it a nice dining experience. They don't rush anything and make sure you are taken care of. Now I did go on a slow Tuesday night so perhaps this is different on a crowded night, but I am definitely going to test it out another time. I bought the Groupon so can't wait to go back!
