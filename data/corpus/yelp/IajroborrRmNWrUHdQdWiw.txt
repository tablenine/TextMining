First time I went, I loved the place so much I became a member. (About half the members are magicians, half are associate members -- that is, non-magicians who want to be a part of the club, have full access, etc.) Food isn't the best in the world, but has improved greatly since Yamashiro took over the kitchen. Yes, it's pricey. But with 7 different performers every night, and a new lineup every week, it's worth every penny. Like many of the members, I've been going at least once a week for several years now. A total blast every time I go, whether it's to watch shows, or just hang out by the bar.
