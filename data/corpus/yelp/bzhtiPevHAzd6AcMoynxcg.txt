Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
The guy who owns this place is super nice.  I always seem to get there right before closing and he always stays open late so I can get my tacos.  Sometimes he even throws in some freebies.  Plus the fish tacos are really good and so is the salsa.  Awesome cheap and yummy place.
