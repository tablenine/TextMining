My boyfriend and I love sushi, and I picked this spot for his birthday, and now I feel very bad that I did.. . They do take reservations, and we were seated on time. The seats were so close together and I had to try VERY hard the whole time not to listen to the drama of the woman next to me. It's also VERY loud. I couldn't hear anything. The volume is so loud in there that they don't need additional heavy music. . . Puting that aside, I focused on the big menu. The chopsticks are good--tiny eggrolls filled with mushrooms and cream cheese. I was unhappy when my avocado tempura arrived with fish eggs on it, but realized it was my mistake, since I didn't see that on the menu. I ordered three rolls between the two of us, and we barely finished any of them. Expensive and very bland. Too much rice, maybe? . . I found the service okay, though I think she could tell we didn't like our sushi (we asked for our leftovers to go...even though we won't be eating it).. . I looked around and couldn't understand why this place is obviously so popular and trendy... but that's just it.: it's trendy-- it's packed, loud and has an "eclectic" menu. But if you out to restaurants to have conversation and good food..... try another sushi spot.
