Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Man, this place used to rule. I hate few things more than people who say that, but here I am saying that. Know that I don't commit this terrible act lightly. A long, long, time ago when Division street still ran red with the blood of stumbled vagrants and proto-hipsters instead of green with the vomit of ugly haircuts and neo-hipsters, Smoke Daddy doled out simple, good, barbecue at decent prices. The portions were big enough to eat for two meals and there was beer. It was swell. . . Fast forward half a decade or so and the prices seem to have doubled (seriously, though, they seem higher even when adjusting for inflation, but maybe I'm crazy), the portions halved and the sides (the main dishes are still as good as I remember them ever being) have been neglected like a Darfur orphanage. Shame, that. See you at Fat Willy's where, despite what Ross R. said (I assume he was referring to Fat Willy's by Fat Willie's), the food is better by at least the distance of the line waiting to get a table there on a warm summer day. . . Crown Jewel: The pulled pork has not suffered through the years and the different sauces are fun to play with.. . Avoid: The fries, mac and cheese and cornbread. They now all officially suck. You know...according to me. Official enough for . http://yelp.com. .
