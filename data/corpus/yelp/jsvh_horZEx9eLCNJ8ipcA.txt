Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I ordered a Canter's Reuben with corned beef. It was gigantic, delicious, and beefy. I spread thousand island dressing all over it, making it even more scrumptious. The potato salad was sweet and just right. I wanted to get something from the bakery but didn't get a chance to. I will next time, though. A little bit pricey, but you get what you paid for. I highly highly recommend this place for good eats :D
