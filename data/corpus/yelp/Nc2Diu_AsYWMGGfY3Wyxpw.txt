I haven't been here in quite awhile since I gave it a couple chances with terrible results.  When I went it was pretty much a brunch only spot so that is what I am reviewing.  Apparently this place is able to generate some kind of hipness buzz to generate lines (Bongo Room style) and a very tightly crowded dining room.  But the food which is supposed to apparently have Latin influence is completely not worth it.  I don't know if they realize Latin food generally uses some spices/flavors because the food here is very bland including the blandest salsa I ever had.. . Finally on the last chance I gave it we were abandoned forever in a back room.  Never an attempt to check on us, get us another drink, etc.    I had to finally get a bus boy cause I was so thirsty and impatient for some condiments and he was great.  Needless to say I tipped directly to the bus boy discreetly, told him it was for him only, and never plan to go back.
