So I came here with a bunch of friends on a Sunday night. It was about closing time and the place was still pretty packed. My friend suggested the miso broth with a spicy level of 4, so that I could enjoy the flavors. It's a nice starter for someone who's going for the first time. But knowing me, I like spicy and I think I could go for a 6 next time.. Also, there's the # 2 which the guy next to us was eating which supposedly is the spicest. He had a couple slurps of the soup and looked like he was sick to his stomach and headed to the bathroom. Anyway, don't forget to order the extra pork cha shu along with your ramen which was nice and tender!!
