Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
the only thing i really want to talk about is the pates that i got to eat last night.  i had just stuffed myself with a bunch of tasty food at another restaurant, but i had to eat these.. . there was a foie gras pate with bananas and brioche and it rocked.  rich, creamy with a little sweet and salty.  . . a peppery pate with a firm texture.  mmm-mmm.. . and third one that was also creamy, flavorful and amazing.  . . i realize that this is a sparse review with few details (i had a lot to drink last night--hanging out with sommeliers is fun), but i still had to say something about how freakin' good these pates were.  it'd be criminal to not tell you all.  so go to pops.  get some good champagne and eat the pate.  you will enjoy it.
