Restaurant: Blu Jam Café
Category: American (New)
As a breakfast connoisseur, I'm confident in saying that Blu Jam cafe is one of the best for an LA brunch.. . I've been to Blu Jam twice thus far, for Sunday brunch and both times have been excellent.. . Although service is a tad slow, who can blame them considering how busy they are.  The menu has a lot of choices, the coffee is delicious, and it has a great crowd of diverse people.  It's small and cozy and the food is just great.  I would recommend the Eggwich or the Breakfast Quesadila - both are delicious.  Prices are reasonable as well.. . I imagine parking woudl be quite difficult after 11:00am on a weekend or during the week, but if you go Sunday before 10:00 you should be fine.. . Great date place, great to bring a few friends - all around great LA restaurant.. . Tip:  Dont' be afraid to try some of the more non-traditional dishes - this place won't disappoint.. .
