i have been wanting to go to blu jam for a while.  opportunity knocked.  i answered.. . i wanted to have something sweet and something salty.. we ordered the "lost bread" and the chicken curry sandwich. . . first, they came out with bread and an olive spread.  I LOVE THAT OLIVE SPREAD.  very flavorful and a bit spicy.  couldn't get enough of it.. . the lost bread is the french toast everyone raves about.  i must say that their french toast had the perfect amount of chewy-ness, bread consistency, and taste topped with fresh berries.  it was one of the best i've ever had. . . embarrassing enough, we were full by the time the chicken salad sandwich arrive!!  it came with a choice of fries, potato salad, fruit.  we got the potato salad - yum.  had to save the sandwich for later.  . . conveniently located on melrose...we were able to walk off our brunch by shopping on melrose during the lazy afternoon.  after all the shopping, i was hungry again for my "leftover" chicken curry sandwich.  it would have been better if it were on a softer bread...but i was famished, so i enjoyed every bite!  *blush*. . i'm sure that this place gets quite crowded on the weekends.. it's wonderful to be able to go to brunch on the weekdays.  . . brunch and shopping.  what else do you need in life?
