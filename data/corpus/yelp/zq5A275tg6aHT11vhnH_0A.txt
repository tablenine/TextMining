Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
Here's a place I never would have discovered on my own. Lucky for me, I work in an office full of foodies, and this was our lunch destination last week. The drive from Lakeview to Humboldt Park is worth it. It gave us time to work up some anticipation for the awesomeness that is Cemitas Puebla. Parking in the area is easy, and there's a lot behind the building. . . We were greeted by the owner, who cheerfully explained to us their specialties after learning we were newcomers. Number one is the Cemita, which is similar to a torta, served on sesame bread with their homemade hot sauce and your choice of meat for $6. The Atomica sandwich is $9 and has three kinds of meat. Number two are the taco arabes, rolled pork tacos served with homemade sauce. We opted to try both, as long as we were there, and our food was ready before our drinks even hit the table. And wow! I can't remember the last time I had a sandwich this life changing. I ate half, planning to save the other part for later, and ate my pork taco. Then I kept staring at the other half of the sandwich on my plate and ended up eating that, too. The ensuing food coma was more than worth it. Sure, it's far from where I live and work, but I'd be more than happy to drive over here again.
