Ambiance -. Sleek. Minimalistic. Not SUPER comfy, but the aesthetic is nice.. . Service -. Sleek. Minimalistic. Not SUPER excited about anything, but they'll write down your order and maybe check in once or twice and if you take too long to decide what you want, they'll look super annoyed and swish away.. . Sushi -. Awesome. Awesome Awesome Awesome.. My roommate had the Orange Crush roll (rock crab meat, asparagus, avocado, masago mayo, spicy sauce, sesame seeds wrapped outside with salmon, topped with wasabi tobiko and ikura) and it was awesome.. . And I had the Robosuta roll (lobster, fried banana, &amp; red tobiko wrapped inside-out with crispy rice, topped with diakon sprouts &amp;    spicy honey mayo ). Which was AMAZING. But also HUGE. So if you are okay with shoving a roll the size of your mouth into your mouth and chewing awkwardly for like, 5 minutes, then get it, 'cause it kicks ass.. . In conclusion, tasty foods, sleek interior, minimalistic service.. Three stars.
