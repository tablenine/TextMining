Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've lived in LA all my life and I've always known about Pink's and I knew people who had gone and all were mixed reviews. Most were negative. If you don't mind standing in line for a hot dog you could probably make at home then stop on by. My friend and I randomly decided to go since we had never been. We waited in like for about 45+ minutes to order. The hot dogs my friend and I ordered were the Mushroom Swiss Hot Dog and the Mayor Villaraigosa hot dog. It's neat that they do make their own jalapeno dog for the hot dogs. The whole time we were eating I thought that this was good but I could done this at home. I do understand that this is place a lot of tourist go to... It's a landmark so I understand why people go. Personally, I don't think I have to go back again. Oh yeah... Cash only... and there is no ATM on site.
