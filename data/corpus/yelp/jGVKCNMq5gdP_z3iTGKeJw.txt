I have been to Sepia twice and enjoyed it both times. The first time I went here with my friend and we had a great dinner for two - indulging in lots of appetizers, specials, bottles of wine and glasses of champagne. Needless to say, we had a big tab. But we had an amazing experience. The food was great. I remember that my friend ordered an Elk chop which was something I had not seen on the menu before. Normally I wouldn't order flat breads but they are really good here and I definitely suggest you try one.. . More recently I went with a group of 5 for my birthday. Again, we had a wonderful experience. The service was much better this second time and our waitress helped us all pick out wonderful things to eat. We had to order a flat bread again and it was amazing. This time we tried the fries (potatoes cooked in pork fat) too. We all got something different at the table and the reports of chicken, fish and pork chops were all positive. The grilled octopus was good and tasted how grilled octopus should - but was nothing spectacular. I had the cheese plate before my dessert and I had the waitress select three cheese for me. They were really unique and it was a fun course to add for my birthday dinner.
