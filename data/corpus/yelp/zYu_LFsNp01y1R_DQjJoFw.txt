Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I want to love Hamburger Mary's. I am psyched every time we go. But then I get there..... I went with my boyfriend and we were totally given the cold shoulder (can't help but wonder if it was because we are hetero) but went again with a group (had the same waitress) and it was a totally different experience.. . I ordered a burger and it was a sloppy mess (both times) falling out of the bun and dripping all over the place. Halfway home (both times) my stomach was growling and I felt like I was going to be sick. . . It's a fun place to go but the vibe is a little off and the food is too greasy and rich. Go once to check it out...
