Finally. After years and years, I got my Ghetto Burger :) . . Next time I think I'll order the Hood Burger, comes with chili and bacon IN ADDITION to the normal good stuff. . . Definitely come with a friend to split the fries with. Get it topped with chili and cheese. Hey, hey. When in Rome. . . I didn't experience any of the Soup Nazi stuff. Then again, I've got some common sense as to what people do and do not want to experience in a very small space. Then again, it wasn't that packed. No people waiting in the patio except for my lonesome self. Also, a man cooked my food. Who is that man? I watched him build up that meat patty with his bare hands. Minutes later I was eating stuffing my face. . . I can haz cheezeburger? Wait, not right now though. Three hours and counting. Still full. Still smiling.
