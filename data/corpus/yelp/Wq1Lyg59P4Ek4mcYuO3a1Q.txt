Restaurant: Casa Vega
Category: Mexican
What? This place was a cross between a strip club and a Vegas casino. . . The margaritas were surprisingly bad for a Mexican restaurant. The food was plentiful and nothing better than you would find at a Mexican chain restaurant. . . Overall, I was not impressed and would not really recommend this place.
