Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
While it's not the best place to visit for its cleanliness, the food is absolutely delicious.  I think it was a little on the pricey side for soul food, but there's just something unusually good about the combination of fried chicken smothered in gravy and waffles.  My friend had decided to go with a chicken-and-cheese omelet instead.  After trying her dish, I have to say that Roscoe's makes one hell of an omelet as well.  Despite the apparent simplicity of its menu, I'd still consider coming back again to eat.  I just can't turn away from the craziness (and deliciousness) of mixing fried chicken and waffles.
