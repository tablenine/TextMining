Cheap and tasty, everything you want and more in a hole in the wall. I gladly brave the parking lot of Asian Square to order out or dine-in here. . . Vietnamese sandwich - delicious. It's the bread, I think. That crusty, sliiiightly buttery bread. Mmmm... I always get the pork. Hate "the special" which is a combination; it just disgusts me, don't want to say why. . . Good pho. Good... good fried rice, even. . . Friendly staff and super fast service. . . Love the Viet iced coffee too :)
