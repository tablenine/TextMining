Let's make this clear: I am new to seafood.  Besides the occasional maki roll, I never touched the stuff until about a year and a half ago when I started experimenting.  I still am wary of a lot of it; I can do crab, lobster, salmon, and very mild fish.  That's abou it.  . . Spring has an incredibly seafood-heavy menu.  That's kind of its thing.  So, I decided to be brave and just try things.. . All the food was fantastic, except for the...i think red snapper? that my friend ordered, which we all decided smelled revolting and sent back.  . . The service was okay.  We all ordered an appetizer, a main, and a dessert, and asked the waitress to pair them with wines and she kind of looked at us like we were crazy.   Seriously, you work here, this is what you do, it isn't a ridiculous request.  Then she was kind of strange the whole night, and at the end sort of mumbled an apology and said she was having an off evening.  Huh?  Strange.. . The ambiance is very nice, kind of neutral colors and relaxed.  It actually made me a little sleepy.  . . I'd imagine this would be a great place for a date - wasn't the best pick for a bunch of friends looking to have a fun night.
