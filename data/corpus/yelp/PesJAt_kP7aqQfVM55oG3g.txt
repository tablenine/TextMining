OK so this is actually the 4th time i've gone in the seven years I have lived in Eagle Rock and so I give them and A for consistency! Their pizza is the WORST! I don't really understand what the hype is, SERIOUSLY! Â . . Each time, I have ordered a pizza, pasta and Salad. and each time it sucked. Each time I waited for a long time and each time I was thoroughly disappointed. . . In the immortal words of Public Enemy..."Don't believe the hype!!"
