Some great things and some average things, but everything is absurdly overpriced.  The old guys that work there are are pretty cool and super efficient though.  Be sure to go at an off hour and by yourself or with one other person, otherwise be prepared to wait awhile because there are only like 20 seats around a single counter.  Their "famous" apple pie and hickory burger are pretty unsatisfactory, too much bbq sauce smothered all over the place.  Definitely go for the steak burger and pretty much any other pie, I hear the banana is phenomenal, I had an amazing berry pie.  The fries are pretty decent.
