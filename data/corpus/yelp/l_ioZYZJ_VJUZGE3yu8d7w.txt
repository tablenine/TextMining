I seldomly give 5 stars unless they really deserves it. I finaaly made it to try their pastries! The sandwhiches were okay but the pastries were out of this world!!!  The cheese sticks, Guava and cream cheese pastries are sooooo goood! I bought a box of pastries and cakes ,when I pay I thought it was going to be about $20 bucks (there are no prices on the showcase) ... when they rung me up, it was only $10!! wow!  . definate items you must try if you go:. MOJITO. CHEESE ROLL. GUAVA PASTRY. GUAVA AND CREAM CHEESE PASTRY. MEAT PIES. . The only negative I have to say about this bakery is that the long is crazy long! The service should move faster!! ... but heck it was worth the wait!
