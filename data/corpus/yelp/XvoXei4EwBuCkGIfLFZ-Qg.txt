Some friends took me here for dinner last night. We got there right when the restaurant opened, but before all of our dishes reached the table a huge lined had formed outside. I liked the food here, but I don't know if I like them enough to wait in that long line. I normally don't like fish cake, but their fish cake with cheese was really good. A little sloppy because every time you bite into it, the cheese would leak out. The chicken wings were also really good. You can order them mild, medium, or really spicy. I guess this is one of the favorites at FuRaiBo because I notice almost every table had a dish of chicken wings. We also ordered a yakitori set. I can't say I'm a fan. I still like Torihei a lot more. The atmosphere here is very chill. The food comes out pretty quickly and they have a parking lot in the back. I would come back again.
