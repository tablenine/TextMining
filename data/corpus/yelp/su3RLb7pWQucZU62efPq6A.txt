My husband LOVED this place!!! . . He said this was one of the best Pastrami sandwich's he has had, next to Katz Deli in New York. . . I, on the other hand, am not really a fan of Jewish Deli's. I ordered the stuffed baked potato and it was good, not great. . . Parking was hard to find, but that is to be expected in LA. . . And service was less than friendly, again to be expected considering how popular this place is. . . I am sure we will be back here, only because my husband loved it so much. . . Please note: Do not ask to substitute your side orders, you will be painfully shut down and left with only cole slaw and potato salad to mask your humiliation.
