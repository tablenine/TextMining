LA Mill Coffee is like that beautiful girl you see, in the perfect clothes, with the perfect hair. At first, you can tell yourself she's a bitch, or she's easy or something and you don't want to know her... but then you realize you have mutual friends so you are forced to spend an afternoon hanging out with her... and when you walk away, you know that in addition to being beautiful, she is also one of the nicest, most genuine girls you've ever met. A fact which will always leave you seeking that one character flaw that will reaffirm your knowledge that no one is perfect. . . I like to order just a cup of coffee, nothing fancy. It's absolutely delicious.
