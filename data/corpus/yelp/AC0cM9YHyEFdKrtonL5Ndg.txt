We came here on Saturday for the Derby party...however, since the place had just opened they had some problems with their Liquor License, and they could not serve alcohol.  I was bummed, and wanted to go somewhere else, but my friends wanted to stay, so we did with the promise that we could go somewhere with booze after.  There were at least 30 employees wandering around and only 3 people at tables, we felt pretty bad for them.  Our server was really great and was joking around about not having their liquor license, and they did give us free pop.  Always a plus when you get things for free!  The inside is very new and trendy, we sat on the outside patio, it was really nice and the server gave us a tour of the rooftop deck.  It was awesome up there.  . . The food was wonderful, and with the exception of $16 for a dozen wings (Who pays over $1 for wings?!?!?!?), everything was pretty averagely priced.  We got the macaroni muffins to start, YUM!  I got the Billy Goat's curse salad, so good.  The dressing was excellent.  My friend got the Body Builder sandwich, but subbed fries for the salad.  She got a HUGE portion on fries which were some of the best fries I've had.   Another friend got the Chili Rubbed Chicken, a HUGE portion of chicken that came up with a chicken figurine with a piece of chalk to write notes on it.  Thought that was very cleaver.  The salads also came out on a tray with flowers.  I saw some of the other people's plates, and the presentations were all really creative. . . All in all, the food was great, the place is nice and clean and the staff was very friendly...but it could have just been because there were 7 diners and 30 staff members there.  I plan to be back again, very soon!
