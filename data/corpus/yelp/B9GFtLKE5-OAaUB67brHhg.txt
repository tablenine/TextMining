Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Have about 45 minutes before the play start, went over to Daikokuya, and WTF man? It was freakin hot in there, how could you eat at that temperature?. So head over to Orochon, was my first time so just put my toes in the water so to speak, got #4 and it was nothing, so i think #3 should be no problem either, then eventually #2 at 30 minutes. Finished #4 with everything in it at 15minutes.. I enjoy their ramen and the noodle is nice and chewy too which is a big plus. Service was good too, attentive but it took awhile for the ramen to be ready.. . Seen: A group of men arrived, looks like they just gotten off from work. They requested to sit outside so they can smoke. Mmm yach, it was Windy and one of the umbrella fell onto one of the men, the younger guy, he looked disheveled. The prospect of bodily injury is enough to quit smoking and move inside. Later on my way out the same dude was again walking towards the entrance door and once again the umbrella fell on him. He was kinda surprised but tried to just walk it off. "OK dude, try to walk it off with a huge garden umbrella stuck to your shoulder doesn't make any sense!"
