My good buddy from highschool and USC was in LA over the weekend visiting his sis.  I drove down to visit this ramen-ya since I heard it was the best.  My friend thinks I was visiting him.. . So my friend asks what I want to do this weekend.  I say, eat ramen.  He says, what else?  I say, don't worry I know of alot of new ramen places in LA to try.. . The noodles here are fantastic.  Nice and chewy delicious.  As good if not better than the noodles I had in Hawaii.  The broth was tonkotsu style, very refined taste... no distinct over-powering flavor, solid overall.  The table has ginger and garlic, which both make a nice touch to the broth.. . In a word, damn good bowl of ramen.  Hmmm, one word.... damn.. . The gyoza was homemade, but was rectangular like some crazy kid made it out of playdo.  It was nice but I was daydreaming about more ramen.  We had to leave, people waiting.. . Goodbye empty ramen bowl, it was nice to meet you.  And my friend, nice to see you again too.
