Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Do I like Canter's?  Not really.  But do I still go there from time to time?  Yes.  Why?  I dunno.  Please stop asking me stupid questions.. . I have a question for you:  What kind of a place serves a turkey &amp; stuffing plate and then puts SLICED ALMONDS in the stuffing?  That's just f**ked up, Canter's!  . . The food isn't great here, but if you stick with a simple deli sandwich it's not terrible.  But it's been there forever and it's open late so it's not a bad hangout if you're in the area with a group of friends who feel like just hanging out.  Don't take a date here.  There's nothing impressive about this joint.  . . If you want great deli food, visit Nate &amp; Al's in Beverly Hills -- the ONLY deli in town that gets everything right!!
