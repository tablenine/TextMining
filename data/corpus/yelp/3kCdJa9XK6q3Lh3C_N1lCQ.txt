Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Naughty, naughty!  Someone totally needs a spanking.  I actually had pizza twice in one week.  Ooooh but the pizza here is completely worth it!  It has a nice thin crunchy savory crust, not too flappy thin, totally greasy, delicious sauce, and just wrong in a Joey Buttafuco Long Island sort of way. (I'm not being mean, it's... you know that neighborhood Italiano comfy place!)  . . My way of sayin' it's not your elegant Mozza, and it certainly is not your cool - CPK &amp; Pitfire  (Oh stop.  You and I both know that chain garb like those two when necessary is what it is... and it's pretty good ;)  nor Manhattan style Vitos or LaMonicas on the Westside, which I love too.  Hey I'm an equal opportunity pizza lover.  . . Since I've always heard the line here is insane, we decided to get carry out.  (We had a long busy day in the sun, I think everyone was exhausted)  For 3 people, we got 2 mediums - I usually like a lot of veggies and pretty much everything on my pies but my friend insisted that 2 toppings are the limit (in his neurotic opinion, since he thought that more than 2 toppings would make the crust collapse). . . Uh okay... I sorta did my Akiko T eye roll and complied - we ended up with:. . (1) Jalapeno / Pepperoni Pizza. (1) Canadian Bacon, Pineapple Pizza. (1) Antipasto Salad - BTW, which we doctored up with some nice gourmet balsamic. . . Threw them on the grill to reheat and voila!  Pizza was perfecto, warmer, crunchier, savory... in a mama mia sorta way...  I heart this place!  Can't wait to come back and dine inside.
