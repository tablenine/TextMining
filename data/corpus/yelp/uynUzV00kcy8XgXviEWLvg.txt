You've heard it all before so I am gonna keep it short and sweet.  For my first time eating Korean, it was very tasty.  Try the bibimbap if you are new to korean.  The seafood pancake with oysters was delicious and huge but very greasy.  The servers were friendly.  In shopping center next to Korean Square.
