My first visit here was good.  My second visit, this past weekend, will probably be my last.. . Let me say that the atmosphere is pretty cool, if not cute.  Garlic themed pictures painted on the wall.  Very cute, cozy, and intimate tables.  Excellent service.  Friendly waiters.  But the food just isn't that great.. . The first time I came here, it was good.  I forget what exactly I ordered, but I do remember eating way too much garlic that my body was releasing it thru my pores and I stunk for like 3 days.  This time, I fought back the urge to indulge in too much garlic.  I ordered the Spicy Prawns pasta.  It was good, but a little too much spice that you just did not want to finish your food.  My boyfriend ordered the salmon ravioli.  Big mistake.  It was bland and not very good.  I shared my plate with him and he too, couldnt eat very much of it due to the spice.  We had a decent time.  The salad we ordered and the bread w/garlic olive oil and the garlic spread were great.  We just were not very happy with our entrees.. . If you do decide to go here, make reservations.  We had 6 PM reservations and the place was not full at all, and we were able to finish our meal and be out in an hour.  Also to note, they have valet parking ($3.50).
