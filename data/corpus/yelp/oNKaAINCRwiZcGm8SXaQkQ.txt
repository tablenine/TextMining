Ummm, yumm! This place has it all. The food, the atmosphere, and eye candy. I had the #7 with a side of ginger sauce and have gone back twice now. It's cheap, fast, and great. I will only bag on it in the veggies department. Usually you get more lime, and lots of basil and cilantro... at least at the previous places I've been. It would have 5 stars if it did, but I'll just bring my own and keep on scarfing up this delicious treat!
