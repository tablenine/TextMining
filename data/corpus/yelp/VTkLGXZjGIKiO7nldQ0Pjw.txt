I have to agree with those who say Langer's makes the best pastrami sandwich in LA. At around $15 for a sandwich it is not cheap but oh so worth it. We ordered a platter which comes with pastrami, cheese, coleslaw, chopped liver, baked beans and fries. You can build your own sandwich with the veggies and items on the platter and it is so good. Best chopped liver I've tasted too. The bread is toasted just right and the baked beans and fries aren't bad too. Langer's had a lot of hype to liver up to and it definitely did.
