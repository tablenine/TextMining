Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
There I was, out with friends, getting toasty, wanting greasy, oily, bad-for-you fare for less than 2 bucks (I spent all my money on booze and the Photo Hunt at the bar), so where do we go? Ah, ye' ole Wiener Circle. Elbowing past about 10 people with the same amount of bar-stench eminating off them, I make it to the tiny window where a skinny black girl, with a look of utter distain for her job, peered down at me like "yeah, and?" Feeling intimidated, I whisper up "Cheese fries please. Extra cheese...thank you" and hand over my money George Costanza style in the soup nazi line. She snaps my money away, puckers up her lips, and shouts "EXTRA CHEESE? Ummm, hmmm... like you can't miss a meal!" I actually turned to my friends and said "is that true?" Needless to say, I ate the shit outta those fries...then signed up for Bally's the next morning. But I'd send anyone there to enjoy a big helping of grease with a little side of humiliation. Best wiener in town.. . ps. was featured on Dave Attell's Â Insomniac. Hilarious..."this is kinda like the Ricki Lake show but with food"
