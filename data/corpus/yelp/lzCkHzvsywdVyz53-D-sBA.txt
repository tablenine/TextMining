Really? Is this really worth all the hype? I hope this is isn't the best ramen LA has to offer because if so, then the west coast is missing out. It's not bad, but really nothing special either.. . Pros: . Open late . Friendly service. Cute old timey Japanese diner decor. nicely cooked al-dente ramen. Good pork belly. . Cons:. Long wait. Soup flavor is mediocre at best. toppings are not impressive and sparse. kitchen is not as clean as most japanese owned establishments. Parking a total pain
