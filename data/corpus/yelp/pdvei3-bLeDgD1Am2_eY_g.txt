Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I hit Roscoe's up every time I'm in LA. The food is tasty, except once I order Chicken and fries. The server thought I was crazy, and once I ate the fries I see why. The fries taste like chicken grease, Yuck. I love the waffles, smothered potatoes and Lisa's Delight. I definitely do not eat Roscoe's if I have a long day ahead of me. The food is good and heavy.
