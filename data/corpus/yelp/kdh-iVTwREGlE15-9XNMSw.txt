Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I've been here about 3 or 4 times now. The food is always great, never fails. You usually just wait a while for a table cuz it's so crowded but people usually just stand around with a cup of beer with their friends and just wait till a table is open. You order your food and drinks at the bar and they give you a number to take back and for you to place on your table and they bring you the food. I went back last night and we got a table right away. Their food always comes out fast and the service is pretty good. I always get the Father's Office Burger, so delicious with frites and then get sweet potato fries on the side. Of course, I can't eat it by myself. Yesterday, three of my friends and I ordered those and we go pretty full but you can always share that between two girls if you're really hungry. It'll get you full.
