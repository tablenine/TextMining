Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
El Tepeyac is an east LA landmark as far as I'm concerned. . . For me, its a nostalgic place because my grandmother used to live on Evergreen and Brooklyn (a.k.a Ceasar Chavez) Often we would walk up the street to enjoy an authentic Mexican meal of epic proportions.. . Seriously visit this place and you'll understand why some mexican folks, INCLUDING ME, are so darn fat.  We have no concept of portion sizes.. . Last time I was there I ordered the chile verde and could barely make a dent in it.  I wrapped it up in a tortilla and made a huge burrito to take home.  . . I would also the recommend the flautas (taquitos) simply because it makes me feel like I'm 7 years old again.
