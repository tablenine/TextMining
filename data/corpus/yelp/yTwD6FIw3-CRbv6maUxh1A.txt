Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
i don't understand the hype!! That's all this place is, hype. The line is long, hype. The raves are ridiculous, hype. I was walking down the street and once I heard a man scream, "the only thing that is better than titos tacos, is titos tacos".... if maybe I didn't get so caught up in the hype this place wouldn't have been half as disgusting. I hate cash only and I hate pseudo-Mexican food. . . but the salsa is decent. I ordered so much food, and almost all of it is in the trash. . . If you are an avid mexican food lover.... stay away, and go to King Taco while you can.
