My vocabulary is pretty vulgar.  I was in the LA area this weekend with my family and being the big kid that I am, I always hang out with my nieces and nephews.  Even then, profanity slips out my dirty mouth.  But then my cousin introduced us out-of-towners to Porto's cheese rolls.  After one bite I started saying gay shit like "Yummy!" and "Potty!" and "Wiggle my Tooshie!" . . So I'm back in the Bay Area, and I'm shivering and sweating, and I feel like ants are crawling all over my skin because that shit got me addicted.  Thanks, cousin!. . Seriously, read all the other reviews.  This place gets 4.5 stars with 400+ reviews.
