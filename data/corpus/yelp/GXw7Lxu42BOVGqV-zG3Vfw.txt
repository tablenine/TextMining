Not sure about you, but I have been here countless times.  Bring your markers, because you can draw on the tables!  My co-workers and I have drawn the most abstract models you have ever seen.. . OK, now on to the digs.  The sausage is superb and the beers....step it up Wurstküche.  I can buy all of these outside of your establishment.  How about a few no-namers from Germany?  I love the fries and the overall vibe rules.   Curry ketchup is king.. . Go here. Trust me.
