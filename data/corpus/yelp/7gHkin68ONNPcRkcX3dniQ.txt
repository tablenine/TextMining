Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
It may look like an expensive, hoity toity Italian restaurant from the exterior, but Ugo is actually a surprisingly affordable place to dine (the pastas are about $10-12). My friend spoke high praises of this restaurant's lattes, pasta and salads and so I was excited to try it for the first time.. . I had the Linguine con Vongole (linguine with clams in pesto sauce) and my friend had the Vegetable Lasagna that comes with a side salad.  Both arrived in healthy portion sizes, which will leave you full but not uncomfortably full.  My dish was amazing! I'm not a regular fan of pesto, but yum! The pesto was very flavorful and was not heavily oily. I was grateful that they didn't skimp on the clams too.  My friend's vegetable lasagna was surprisingly tasty too--not too cheesey and I loved the sweet tomato sauce they used for the lasagna. I wish I had room for one of the delicious looking desserts they had on display or their gelato, but by the time I finished my dish I was full.  Maybe next time.
