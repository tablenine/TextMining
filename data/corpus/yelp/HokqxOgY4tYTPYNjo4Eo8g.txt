Great burgers! Love the atmosphere. Feels like you're sitting in a diner in 1950. They serve soda in little paper cones with metal holders. Ha! Â The banana cream pie is sooo good, stuffed with bananas and the crust is thin and flaky. And I love how the counter guys pour ketchup for you. . . The seating situation can be a little annoying... it's hard to come here with more than one other person unless it's a really off time. I suppose it's just part of the experience. I love eating here.
