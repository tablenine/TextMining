I was taken here for lunch a couple of days ago. I remember the sandwich being better a few years back. Which is not to say that the sandwich I ate wasn't very very good, because it was. It just wasn't as good as I remembered it being.. . Anyway, Bari is a great little deli, but keep in mind you're going to be taking this sandwich somewhere else to eat it. There's no seating, indoors or out, and there's no park within walking distance.
