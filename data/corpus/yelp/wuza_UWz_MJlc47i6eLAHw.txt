I didn't know I liked Argentian food until I ate here! . . Though it's location is questionable at night, the laid back vibe definitely help me loosen up a little and when the food came out, my stomach was definitely at ease. . . The bread was free of course, with olive oil and parsley. I ate a piece but didn't wanna spoil my appetite since my date and I each ordered an entree of our own.. . For appetizer, we got the Combo Appetizer (three empanada of your choice). We got one of each, and they were all good - even the cheese and onion. Our waiter was cool like that - and he said we can get all three rather than picking three of the same one. We just split the all and took a bite or two.. . My date ordered the A la Provenzal (grilled chicken) and I ordered the Entrana al Ajo (skirt steak - medium rare) and a side order of Mashed Potatoes Champignon (mashed potatoes topped with mushroom sauce). And of course we split the steak and chicken so that we would both get to try the two. As for our sides, we got salad and rice since we ordered the side dish of mashed potatoes. . . The everything came out hot and delicious! The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Steak was juicy. . . We sat inside, but next time we'll wait to be seated outside in the patio - it's much more nicer! . . I'm falling in love with this place!
