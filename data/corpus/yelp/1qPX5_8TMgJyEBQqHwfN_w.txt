can i just say ohmyeffinggee!!!. . my first time here was a couple years ago for a second (mercy) date.  our first date was pretty disastrous and i decided to give him a second chance... i AM nice after all!  :p well... actually, it was because he did bribe me by offering to take me to his secret sushi spot... hehe.  shhhhh... don't tell him i told you that!. . but let's just say, the zero turned into a hero after that experience.  everything was so melt-in-your-mouth-mmm-mmm-gooooood that each time i tried some new and exotic fish (that he was ordering in japanese i might add), he was becoming more and more attractive with each bite.  the sushi was so orgasmic i almost jumped the guy right at the sushi bar... he actually morphed from insecure and blubbering into suave and debonair... this place does wonders for the average romantically-challenged guy!. . don't bother sitting at a table... go right to the bar and just tell them to give you whatever specials they have.  don't bother ordering the usual fanfare you can get anywhere else (i.e. tuna, salmon, etc.)... ORDER THE SPECIALS!  i do recommend the yellowtail toro, however.  it is so buttery-melt-in-your-mouth smooth... it's like a choir of angels singing in your mouth!  and don't bother ordering anything from their menu.  you haven't had mothereffin sushi until you've eaten sushi at sushi-gen.  i'm serious!. . as for the hero, we dated for about half a year and parted ways after realizing we didn't have much in common except love for food but i am definitely grateful to him for introducing me to this gem.. . in any case, my love affair with sushi lives on...
