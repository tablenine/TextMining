I really like this place. The food is yummy and the service is good. The chips you get prior to your meal are always warm. It's not great for large groups. I went once with six people and it was ridiculously crowded and we had to wait around 50mins for a table while being pushed around by the bar. But once we were seated we really enjoyed the experience there. It's great for a dinner date for two. I recommend the Lobster Quesadillas!
