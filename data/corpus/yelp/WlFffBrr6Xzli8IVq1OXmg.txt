HAPPY HOUR 7-10 every weeknight and ALL DAY weekends featuring a pretty good deal on glasses of sangria, and $1 pita chips!  Oh and the food's pretty good.  I've tried the chicken doner wrap the traditional and street style way.  I think i prefer the street cart style cause of the hot sauce.  I always ask for extra hummus on my wrap and aioli to dip my seasoned fries in.  Very casual environment but I always catch myself digging the tunes they were playing (but that may be more of the sangria's influence~)
