I was a little hesitant to try this place after some of the negative reviews on service, but I couldn't have been more pleased.  We had reservations for 7 on a Friday, arrived a few minutes early, and were asked to wait.  No more than 10 minutes later, we were seated and apologized to for the wait (though that wasn't necessary, it was much appreciated!).. . The decor is very contemporary and energetic, with some techno music bumping in the background, but not so loud that I couldn't hear my friend.  . . Our waitress was fantastic - when we couldn't decide between two wines, she brought us both to taste.  And when we couldn't decide which entrees to pick, she described them in detail and made excellent suggestions.  The other servers were also extremely professional - it speaks volumes about the restaurant when servers know when to fill the water glasses and clear the plates.  . . We started with some amazing salmon and cucumber ceviche - I don't like cucumber, but I polished off my portion with no problem.  My friend's grouper was exactly as spicy as the waitress described, and my pork 'cubano' with plantains was perfectly balanced.  Despite getting full, we both ate every last bite, which was a testament to the quality of the meal.. . We each spent $40 with tip, which is pricier than my normal meal out, but it was worth every penny.  Worth the stop if you like South American food, great ambiance, and excellent service.
