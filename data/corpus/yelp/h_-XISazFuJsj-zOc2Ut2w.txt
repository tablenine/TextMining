Go somewhere else.  The only good thing about this place is the free cannoli you get on your way out.. . The atmosphere is cold, it has a cafeteria feel to it.  There is no music playing, the tables are small, uncovered, and the silverware is cheap.  . . Now for the pizza, their claim to fame... it was so boring and unsatisfying.  The white pizzas don't even have an ounce of garlic on them.  The crust was burned with black spots all over it, and the middle of each pizza was sick and soggy.  Each slice I took kind of oozed on my plate, I had to fold it up a couple of times to even get it to my mouth, and then each slice was over in 2 bites.  For $13-16 dollars a pizza!!?  Four of us got three pizzas and it was no where near enough to eat and be satisfied.. . What's the big deal about this place??  I won't go back, I don't recommend it.  Go somewhere else.
