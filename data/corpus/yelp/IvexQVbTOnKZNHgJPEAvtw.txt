Restaurant: Cleos Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Bars
There's something so homey about Cleo's.  Perhaps it's the awesome bartenders, Steve and Jay.  Maybe it's just the over all vibe of the place.  The food is not particularly good and they don't have a great selection of alcohol or amazing prices and yet, this is one of my favorite bars in the city.  If you have not been and live kinda close, you should go.
