Not the best sushi you've ever had and certainly not the worse.  This place caters to middle of the road ("I say I eat  sushi but I only eat spider rolls") kind of people.  Still, for a sushi connoisseur like myself, you can find some pretty exotic and damn tasty dishes.  Plus the music makes me happy.
