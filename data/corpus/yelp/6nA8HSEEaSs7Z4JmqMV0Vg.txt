"Meh" is a pretty good way to start this out. . . My boyfriend &amp; I both ordered burgers- his with a side of sweet potato fries &amp; mine, a side of fried pickles. He ordered his burger medium &amp; it came out cool, pink &amp; red. Mine was ordered medium rare &amp; came out... basically the same as his. Our waitress offered to throw his burger "back on the grill" for him. That would have been nice if he didn't order it with any of their "gourmet toppings". I mean really, you can't put a patty with guacamole &amp; a busted fried egg back on the grill.. .  His fries were "meh". Same for my pickles. . . Then we got our $45 bill. Pretty steep considering we only drank soda.. . I can see this place being just fine for a reliable patty like a veggie burger. But I also don't understand how a burger restaurant can get away without knowing how to cook beef.
