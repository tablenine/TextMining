Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
I loved Cobras &amp; Matadors! The tapas are delicious and the waitstaff are incredibly nice. BYOW with no corkage fee is definitely a highlight of the place, especially because there's a really cute little wine store next door that I think sort of has a partnership going with the restaurant. The wine store has a copy of the menu, so though I did not ask, I'm guessing you can ask the store owner his opinion on what wine might pair well with the tapas of your choice. I thought it was a nice touch.. . All in all, great ambience, good service, excellent food. I am a fan!
