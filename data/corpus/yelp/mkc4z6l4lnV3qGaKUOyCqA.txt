I was a bit surprised by the 20-30 min. wait during the week but it was crowded.  Owned by "lettuce entertain you" this place had an interesting mix of cuisines on the menu it was pretty much any type of food you could possible crave (but definitely a lot better than bar food) from sushi to enchiladas.  We started with the nachos - which was literally enough food for 4 people.  They were really good: guac, sour cream, jalapenos, cheese and a spicy/smoky chipotle sauce.  For dinner I had the crunchy tuna sushi it was delicious and I tried the salmon roll which was also nice.  The Caesar arugula salad with lemon dressing was fresh and tangy.  The atmosphere was fun, there was an awesome lamp made out of glass bottles - The bar had a nice drink list:  we tried the "hot hub tea" which was similar to a hot toddy!  The downstairs looked like a separate lounge and bar but I didn't have time to wind down there.
