Fred 62 is great if you are a douchey hipster looking for somewhere to impress your douchey hipster friends. Otherwise, it's just okay.. . Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of the place, and it's located handily enough for me to have been here a few times. Food is okay, but quite expensive. The service takes forever, and there are only one or two friendly members in the whole waitstaff. But, like I said, it's not bad; it's just okay, when it should be, well, better.. . Fred's definitely has it's clientele, though. I swear to god, I once heard some douchey hipsters have a douchey hipster conversation about how to raise $5,000 dollars so they could put a Baldwin (I don't remember which one, but I do remember that it was not one of the important Baldwins) in their movie. If that's your scene, more power to you. If not, congratulations! You're not a douchey hipster.. . Two stars because I am feeling nice right now.
