I came here for my one year anniversary with my girlfriend and we were not dissapointed at all! Our waiter was very helpful with the menu as we didn't really know what to order and he helpfully guided us through the menu. We had a little bit of everything on the menu and everything we ordered tasted fantastic. The only downside was that the bartender was quite rude when I asked for water at the bar. Overall I would love to go back again! Maybe we'll try the Pizzeria next door!
