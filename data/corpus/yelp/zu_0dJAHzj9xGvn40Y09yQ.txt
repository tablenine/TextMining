B.Y.O.B.!!. . That's pretty much all I really have to write to describe how awesome this place is...but I'll elaborate.. . I finally checked this place out with my lady friends.  We brought 4 bottles of good (and possibly good) wine for our dinner.  There were only three of us.  So needless to say we had a great time.  This place has no corkage fee and if you do forget your special booze contribution, there is a wine shop right next door.  I swear they think of everything.  FYI - If you are a white wine drinker they ice it for you.  . . The food was fantastic and the service was excellent.  The wait staff was very friendly and laid back.  . . My favorite dishes were the gazpacho and the bacon wrapped prawns(eek I think it was a prawn, or shrimp.  Something of that kind.  All I know is that it was Delicious.)  . . Long story short is that we had a great dinner.  Had about 8-10 tapas style dishes which included two dessert plates.  Enjoyed our own wine.  And paid about $37 each plus tax.  Can't beat that with a baseball bat.. . I highly recommend this place for intimate groups for friends who want to catch up and have a no nonsense relaxing meal.  . . PS.. If you are a Hills fan some guy from the show was there.  I don't watch it, but the other two girls freaked out.  There's something for everyone at this place.
