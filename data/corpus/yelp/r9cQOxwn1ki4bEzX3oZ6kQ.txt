Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
recently, after an incredible show by BAND OF HORSES at the avalon, i walked back to the hungry cat to  take advantage of their half price cocktails just before their expansion renovations.... . with respect to exploding coctails prices all across LA, the 11 dollar freshly squeezed juice and freshly muddled cocktails seem an absolute bargain... (i recently shockingly  paid for an 18 dollar cocktail at josie in santa monica). i'm normally a small batch bourbon on the rocks kind of guy, but when in rome... . . the drinks were good if a bit girly.. . i've had the pug burger, items from the raw bar and various other seafood dishes that have all been very tasty if a tad bit overpriced. the pug burger is an intimidating structure, resembling the size of a small child's head, whose patty is more spherical than flat, sputtering hazardous but extremely tasty juices all over the place.. . david lenz, chef/proprietor and husband to LA chef superstar suzanne goin has found a good niche, especially after his relatively less successful earlier attempt with opaline.... . its also conveniently located walking distance to all sorts of douchebag hangouts in hollywood and parking is a snap in the sunset+vine complex
