I'm surprised to see so many people hating on the best steak house west of the 15! . The steaks are to die for! Best quality and variety in a 100 mile radius. Seafood is great as well. . Lobster Bisque is great. . Service is awesome! But sometimes some of the staff walk a thin line between stuck up. And it can be a little noisy sometimes, but who cares when you have your mouth stuffed full and am in heaven. :-) . I wish I lived out there just to go!
