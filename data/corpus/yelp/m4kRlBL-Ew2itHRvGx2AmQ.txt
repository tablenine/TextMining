Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Whenever I vacation to a big city, I like to find one diner-style restaurant to satisfy my breakfast needs. In Chicago, my sister used to live in Lakeview and when my mother visited, she took her to Stella's. My mom insisted that I try it, and so I did. I really enjoyed my omelet, and if I remember correctly, it didn't break the bank.
