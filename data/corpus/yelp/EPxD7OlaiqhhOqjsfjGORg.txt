This place is a long time favorite when we have people coming into town. They have valet, it's next to a bunch of shopping, and the food and drinks satisfy a crowd.  Yep, it's busy and loud and they don't take reservations. But if you call ahead, your group will get in much faster then joe schmo who rolls in and wants to be treated like a rockstar.  Frozen margarita swirl is a must.  Their asada steak is excellent, even better sliced into fajitas.  I've been told their bacon-wrapped shrimp is to die for.  I've enjoyed their veggie fajitas several times.  I wouldn't go here on a date but I have gone to several birthday dinners here.
