Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
Crust is a cute restaurant that had lots of potential in my mind but was lacking in... something, flavor perhaps?  I went there on a Friday with reservations (I highly suggest getting reservations if you plan on going on a Friday night, it gets busy there).  The bar had some interesting and tasty drinks.  I had a Blackberry Mint Julep and a Bloody Mary.  The julep was too sweet for my taste, but the Bloody Mary was to die for.  They use horseradish infused vodka in the cocktail that took it to another level of amazingness.  They also have an excellent beer selection that kept the boys I was with pleased.  . . The food was meh.  I admit I did not have the pizza which is what the place is known for.  I had the veggie calzone and it was ok.  I felt it was overpriced for what I got.  I feel it was just lacking in flavor despite the fact that there was goat cheese in the dish.  Maybe it needed salt? Who the hell knows.  . . I probably wouldn't take out of town guests here, unless my second trip is a success.
