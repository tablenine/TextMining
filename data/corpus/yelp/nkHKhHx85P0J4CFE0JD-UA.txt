Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
It would be erroneous of anyone not to include LA among the great culinary cities in this country. Cuisines from all over the globe can be found here, and are manifested in a vast, untold number of establishments. However, at times the prospect of a seemingly infinite number of food options can be problematic. It's like being a late 20th century immigrant from some godforsaken shithole on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain, who becomes overwhelmed by the myriad of choices available at the supermarket. Sometimes, you just want a good ol fashioned, atherosclerosis inducing meal made from god-knows-what and sold by a recognizable brand.. . Normally, I wouldn't travel almost three thousand miles just to eat a damn hot dog, but they're at least exceptional dogs. Mostly I went here to placate ma dukes, who absolutely loves the place. What the fuck though; if a promised trip to Pink's is all I need to make a fifties, conservative hillbilly from VA want to go out to Cali, so be it. I will say that the lord of the rings dog is fairly amazing. Their onion rings are the truth, and the BBQ sauce is very rich. Â And oh shit son, they got strawberry soda!. . Although the spot is a bit played out as an LA icon and pretty banal compared to what you could be eating at some crazy ethnic hole in the wall somewhere, Pink's is a solid choice for food without any real decision-making. Go for a weekday lunch; otherwise prepare to endure asshole tourists who want to hover over you so they can identify every last celebrity on the wall of fame. Not to mention a painfully ridiculous line, of which the hot dogs (good as they may be ) serve no real alleviation.
