Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Yes, this will cost you more than your typical Chinese fare, but take 10 seconds and visualize the interior of your favorite local Chinese takeout place...probably not so appetizing.  Part of what you are paying for at Friendship is a clean, comfortable atmosphere with nice ambiance.  It's worth if if you're looking for a sit-down dinner and some good Chinese food.. . The portions here aren't huge as is typical of Chinese in Chicago.  But I think that's where the "fusion" part comes into this restaurant...rather than being piled high and oozing with sweet and sour, the food here is presented attractively like it would be at any other slightly "upscale" restaurant in the city.. . Everything we have tried here is good: the crab rangoon (especially if you like it creamy), the egg rolls (served with a very interesting spicy sauce), the potstickers (you can order them steamed or pan-seared), and the Grand Marnier Duck Peking (exceptionally tender)--my husband's favorite dish.  I'm pretty sure he dreams about it at night, and maybe during the day, too.  . . Friendship has had some good deals through Groupon, and is listed in . http://Restaurant.com. , where you can buy discounted gift certificates.  That's how we always do it, and we order a delicious multi-course Chinese Feast.  Oh--they recently added a beer list.  Plus!
