The food here was surprisingly good.  I got some veggie sandwich and fries (delish!).  Here are my only issues with the place:. . 1 - They kept the lights on for about 1/3 of the movie which was pretty annoying/distracting. . 2 - They didn't have all of the menu items available AND they only serve beer and wine (yet for some reason they gave us a cocktail menu)... get your freaking liquor license already!!. . 3 -  I think my server had a personal vendetta against me.  I asked for my sandwich to come without perppers and to have a side of mustard.  So what do I get?  Peppers and no mustard of course...  So I asked again after my food came "Can I have mustard?"  Still, no mustard.  So half hour later when she was bringing the checks "Uuumm, do you have mustard" "Oh I'm sorry"... I mean seriously, my food was almost gone by then... . . Other than that, it's a cute place... I think I just prefer the regular ol' movie theater experience though.
