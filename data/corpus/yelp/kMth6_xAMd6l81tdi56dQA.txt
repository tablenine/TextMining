Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Excellent, home-style Greek food. They get the same rating as the more upmarket Le Petit Greek for different reasons. While Papa Cristos is more like, "Big Greek family out on a picnic", it gets extra points for being such a value, and especially for the marketplace integrated into the restaurant.. . The market is phenomenal; A wall full of fresh spices, tempting breads, cookies and pastries, fresh meats and cheeses, as well as a huge selection of imported olive oils, vinegars, honey, pasta...and hookah pipes! . . They close early, so it's a better lunch location than dinner. A great value, overall.
