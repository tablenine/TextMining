Uch!  I wished I had loved it but I did not.  We started with Nancy's Chopped Salad, which we were told would be iceberg lettuce, chickpeas, etc.  Instead, it came with a bitter radicchio and it was largely ignored by myself and my dining partner.. . The squash blossom pizza with burrata cheese came next (it was highly recommended by our server). The food at Mozza looks fantastic but this flavor combination did nothing for us.  The crust was good (kind of like a cross between a light baguette and a croissant) but not remarkable.. . The service was fantastic, the atmosphere was fun, but the food left us unimpressed.  Oh LA-hype restaurants why do you do nothing but disappoint?
