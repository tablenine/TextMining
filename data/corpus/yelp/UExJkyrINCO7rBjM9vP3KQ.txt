I agree with others, probably one of the more spectacular views of L.A. and Hollywood, but go on a clear night.  But trust me folks, unless you have $200 burning a hole in your pocket avoid eating there and just go for a drink at the bar.. . The food is good but nothing to rave about and at those prices it should come with a private room and a hooker for an hour.  I did see one waiter that would have fulfilled my fantasy.  Go on a weeknight so you don't have to wait forever for your car later it's valet only. . . I had the filet mignon, which was unusual for me as I am not a meat eater.  I haven't had a steak in 20 years but this was good.. . Again the view is awesome and sex is guaranteed after you take a date here just be sure to rob an ATM first.
