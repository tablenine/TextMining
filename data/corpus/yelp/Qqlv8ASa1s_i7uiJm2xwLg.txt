Category: Vegan
Why! Why! Why is my closest location in fricken Westwood?! That pock-marked no-parking pedestrian-infested glory hole of a corner of a city. I endured the "charms" of Westwood for grad school and vowed to never come back (worst intersection in the city: Westwood &amp; Wilshire). But now, Westwood calls to me again, and for once, it isn't just for a stop at Diddy Riese.  Native Foods is ridiculously delicious vegan food - everything on their menu looks delicious, smells delicious, even SOUNDS delicious, and then is instantly devoured when it lands in front of you. Boyfriend had a sloppy sandwich, either the Chicken Run or the Bacon Cheeseburger with sweet potato fries, I had a little pizza and a cane sugar soda out of a bottle.  Very satisfying fare, not full of fireworks and pretension - just good eats.. . The best vegan food is the kind that makes you forget that substitutions had to be made . You simply eat it and enjoy it for what it was, and not what it's supposed to resemble or stand in for. After writing this I did a very old-lady-like thing indeed - I wrote to Chef Tanya and told her to open up more damn restaurants!
