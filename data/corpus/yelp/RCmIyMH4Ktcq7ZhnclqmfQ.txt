A great place to go...UNLESS YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR. Two nights ago, I went to the RiRa in Atlanta, and I requested from the hostess an outside patio table for 2. Even though there was an empty table visible both physically and on the "table map" she reviewed on the counter, she told me that I would have to wait 15-20 min, which I gladly did. She took my name down, and soon another gentleman (African American) arrived, also requesting an outside table for 2, so she put him on the list after me. Soon my friend, (also African-American) arrived and I continued to wait with him. Within a few minutes, an older Caucasian couple arrived without a reservation, and they were immediately seated by a server at the original empty outside table which I mentioned. I spoked with the hostess and the manager, and they said that it would not happen again and that we would be seated next. The manager made the server (who seated this couple) give a completely insincere and unheartfelt apology. In the meantime, another Caucasian couple arrived (again without a reservation), and they were seated outside immediately as a table opened up. I was ready to leave, but my friend convinced me to wait. Finally, we were seated an hour after my arrival. Several other people were seated in the outside area after us. As we ate the mediocre food, we noticed that the other African American gentleman and his friend were seated at 8PM, nearly 2 hours after he requested a table!!! I would ask that all people of color refrain from patronizing this establishment, and instead go to one of the other fine Irish Pubs in Atlanta, unless you prefer to be on a "separate but equal" table queue.
