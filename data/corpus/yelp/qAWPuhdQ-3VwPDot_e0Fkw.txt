Strong delicious french pressed coffee.. . Be there early, we were there at 7:45AM on Sunday, doors opened at 8:00. Every table was taken by 8:30.. . The waiters and waitresses are hot, it's distracting in a good way. I wonder if it is because they are struggling actors? (The Guild of Directors is next door, and the Guild of Cinematographers is one block down the street).. . We had the Blueberry Pancakes, it is okay- with a interesting blueberry yogurt on top. It is bigger than your face... about a 8" in diameter, and three layers high. My friend only ate 1/4 of it.. . I ordered the Strawberry Cream waffle, it was so yummy and dreamy. Perfectly warm, crispy, fluffy, and I think even made of wheat or something whole and brown. The sweet cream was just right, and the berries fresh. This was also about 8" in diameter.. . My other friend had the french toast, the BIGGEST toast I have ever seen, practically falling off the platter. Very tasty- I was pleasantly surprised.. . Bring a light jacket as their AC is blasting even at 8 in the morning.. . They have outdoor seating and posh people take their dogs to breakfast. The inside is all brick with simple pictures, high ceilings, and friendly staff.. . A great place to bring visitors from outta town.
