Category: Burgers
there are basically 4 things on the menu here:. . 1) burgers. 2) fries. 3) pies. 4) drinks. . they dont have much, but what they do have is pretty good. this diner harkens back to the days when haggard, chain smoking waitresses called everyone 'doll' and steak tartar was just called cow.. . im not a 50's greaser so im glad those days have passed.
