well, i wasn't blown away walking in the door, very lo key, which sometimes i get concerned w/ that non-chelance better not be how you fix my meals oor wash your hands. my experience wasn't that bad, the prices yes are a little high, brat and fries are just a little steep for the size of it all . . . beer prices are ok, but here's the thing, my lady got home and barfed up her meal immediately. is that the risk we take for eating rattle snake?  Hey I'm from the south, I eat alligator(didn't try it here because, well, I like to eat it where it's not in sausage) you shouldn't puke up a meal after eating it. No, she wasn't wasted on beers, she barel;y finished her dark wheat.  Our service wasn't too bad as far as speed, they were friendly enough, it's a shame though when you do hire people of the current bearded, grunge.2 look; it's not always appetizing; and hey I'm a dirt bag myself LOL!  if it's gonna be low down and dirty, then give me the low down and dirty prices, if you're being euro trendy/stylish then match it with quality.  As far as crowded and wait time, we went there on a sunday afternoon and were thankful they were there, no parking problems, but again, it was sunday.  Two stars for a sick lady, and thusly will probably never return.
