My wife and I walked in and Ludacris greeted us and thanked us for coming to his restaurant, which was pretty cool.  My wife didn't recognize Ludacris and wondered why the owner was greeting everybody, which made for funny convo during our dinner. . . The restaurant was cool, the bar looked awesome and I liked the decor and ambiance, but the food just wasn't up to snuff. . . The Kung Pao Lollipops were excellent . . The Tuna Tower was not that good, the consistency was off. . . The Mussels and Clams were drenched in way too much sauce, which made them a mess too eat.  . . The Mojito was very good.   . . I kind of expected with the asian fusion theme to have some more unique flavors, but I felt a lot of the tastes were pretty standard.. . Conclusion:  Ambiance and service was very good, but the food needs some work.
