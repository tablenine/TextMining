I may not be a burger afficianado, but hey I luv FO's burger. It's simple, big, and tasted great. I don't complain about the good food. One star deduction cause it's so crowded. The seats were packed, you're lucky if you get seats at all =), and boy, we GOT them right at the tiny corner!. . This place made tried drinking beer, yeah I know, it's a girlie raspberry beer, still it's a BEER!!! Luv it! Tried other beers too, there was one tasted like Green Tea, dunno what's the name.. . When the burger came with the sweet potato fries (sadly not on the shopping cart style), I just digged in, it's awesome. The greasier the better rite??? Felt the oil dripping from the bun, sweet goodness, simply put, I was really enjoying it.. . If you like crowd places and hip, where people just mingle and hopefully single, then come here, atmosphere was just great, good music selections too! Easy to find parking, for me the meal was free, so I would gladly come back here =)
