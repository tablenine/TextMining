Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Made a reservation for my group of  8 people on the 4th of July.  All of the roads into Decatur were closed off for the parade and fire works.  One person in the group was unable to make the reservation due to all of the roadblocks and parking issues.  Once we were seated at the restaurant, the manager stopped at our table and reprimanded us because the 8th person did not arrive.  All 7 of us were on time for the reservation.  He said that had he know we would be short by 1 person that he would have taken away one of the tables that was connected to seat our group.  The restaurant was only 2/3rds full when we arrived and half empty when we left!!  There is no way 7 people could have fit at 2 small tables. The manager's rudeness totally caught us off guard.  We were so in shock we were speechless.  One person in our group said "did we just get chewed out by the manager"???  We were so excited about our dinner since we had 2 other friends recommend the place.  Had we not already been seated and placed our drink orders, we would have walked out.  Our waiter was AWESOME (David?? I think was his name).  The food was great.  Each person in our group ordered different entrees.  I personally had the salmon with the pomegranate glaze and it was delicious.  Our group ordered the $18 bottles of Pinot Grigio and Savignon Blanc and thought they were a good value for the money.  Had we not received such rude treatment from the manager this would be a 5 star review.  Everything else was great about our dining experience.  In this time of economic distress, it amazes me that this manager actually went out of his way to speak to us in such a negative tone.  My group is affluent and spends a lot of money on dining.  This is not the way to earn repeat business.
