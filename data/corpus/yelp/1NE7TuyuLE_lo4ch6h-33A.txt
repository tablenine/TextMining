WOW!!! If you love seafood this is the place to go to. The portion sizes are HUGE and a great deal for the pocket. I recommend ordering the Paridilla!! Its a mix of carne asada, octopus, shrimp, chicken, corn, crab legs, broccoli, calamari, mussels, basically everything!!! The order for 2 actually serves about 3-4 people..GREAT food and atmosphere. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!!!
