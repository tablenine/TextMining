Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Read all the other reviews to hear how great Kitsch'n is for brunch, but I'm hear to spread the love of Kitsch'n for dinner!  Their dinner menu puts an upscale touch on downhome classics, with a fantastic chicken and fennel pot pie and the best fried chicken not made by my grandma that I've ever had.  Whereas swinging by on a Sunday at noon will have you dining with the majority of the Roscoe Village population, they're not nearly as busy for dinner and I've never had to wait to grab a table.  The servers are fun, the food is good, the Pabst is a dollar, I think it's great.
