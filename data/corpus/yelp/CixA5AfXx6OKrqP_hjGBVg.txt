OMG almost 500 reviews... anyway I came here for lunch with a friend. . . What we ordered:. . 01. Hainan chicken rice ($6.75) - of course, it's the specialty here. Rice steamed in chicken broth. Poached chicken served with ginger and chili sauce. (Dark meat is $2 extra). . . The chicken was moist and soft. The rice was fluffy and moist. Loved the chicken stock flavor rice. It's nice. Sometimes I prefer the rice to be slightly fried. . . 02. Curry Beef Stew ($6.75). Malaysian style curry cooked with a blend of herbs, spices, veggies, simmered in coconut milk and served with rice. . . This was quite tasty. The beef was fork tender and the stew thick and flavorful. . . Go at 11:30 to beat the rush and bring cash.
