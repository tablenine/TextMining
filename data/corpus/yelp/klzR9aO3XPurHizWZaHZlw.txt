Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I'll be honest - I wasn't too impressed with The Apple Pan.. . The burgers were only average, and while the staff was funny, after about five minutes you mostly feel like the place is run by a bunch of ramblin' old timers.. . But I do love a classic diner, and the fries and pie do make up for the lackluster burgers.. . However for the price, which came dangerously close to $20 a person, you can do much, much better elsewhere.
