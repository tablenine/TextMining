Phenomenal.  We went there last night to do a happy hour at the bar, and decided it would be easier to talk at a table (there were 4 of us).  We'd planned on ordering apps so we weren't sure how they'd feel about us taking up a 4-top.  They couldn't have been nicer, and our server was just as attentive to us as everyone else.  The apps (edamame, and queso kind of thing the name of which I don't remember) were great, and we were enjoying the atmosphere so much that we stayed for dinner.  Great choice.  Two of us had salmon, one had scallops, and I had the Chicken Negro Modelo and all our meals were great.  It was a great total experience.
