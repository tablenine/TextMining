Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
Simply DELICIOUS!!!  Yes, there are long lines and the interior looks like a barnyard square dance, but the food is worth it.  Love the mediterrean bread. Bring cash, they don't accept credit cards, and don't forget they charge for soda refills.  Also, read the back of the menu.  The restaurant is located near the site of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
