I was headed to Center Stage with a buddy for a show and stopped here before it started.  Any place with a big giant red beaver when you walk in the door is a good sign.  Sat at the bar and had a couple flights of beer (Flight School and Summer School).  The bartenders were very knowledgeable about beer and made some good recommendations.  . . Next trip to Midtown will include a stop off at TAP.
