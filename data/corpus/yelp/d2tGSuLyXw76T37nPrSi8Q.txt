Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Soooooo good!  This is the best chinese seafood I have had in a long time.  Even in my first trimester (i.e., morning sickness and food aversions), I cleaned my plate.  The seafood is very tasty and the flavors are not too heavy.  The decor of the restaurant is nice and clean too.  Highly recommended, and will return when I'm back in the area.
