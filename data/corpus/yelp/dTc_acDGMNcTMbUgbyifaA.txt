Yea they are slow to arrive and the lines are always long, but that is just because the food is so outrageously good. A seriously amazing combo of tastes and ingredients - if you are impatient you'll get mad. If not you'll enjoy yourself and be treated to a great meal. So, stop complaining I guess? Only in L.A. would this exist.
