Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
I've dined here twice before and the amuse bouche for both times were memorable. Once was a papaya salad sitting nicely on huge silver spoon and the other time was a miso soup concoction. Albeit, the portions are indeed small, but if you order food here like tapas, you will surely leave full. The unlimited bread servings help too. Green Zebra is actually a tiny restaurant but the architecture of the place (high ceilings and back to back booth tables doesn't give you a cramped feeling whatsoever. I had creamy grits and poached egg on my 1st and 2nd visit respectively and both had so much flavor in it...considering grits comes with zero flavoring. Easy parking on Chicago Ave. too!
