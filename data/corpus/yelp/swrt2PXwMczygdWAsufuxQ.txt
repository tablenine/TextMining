After walking through the absolutely charming little shops in the absolutely charming little town of Decatur, my friend and decided to try our luck with Watershed, sans reservations.  No go.  Two hour wait on a Tuesday!  Well, it WAS fried chicken night.... . Thankfully, there are alternatives here: you can sit at the bar (good luck finding a spot), or sit at the tiny tables and order from a limited menu.  We opted for the latter, and nestled ourselves comfortably.  I tried the Cool Heat, a very interesting cocktail with mint and jalapenos.  It was good, but left my lips burning after each sip, and possibly contributed to the slight nausea I had by the end of the meal.. . We ordered the butter bean hummus (FANTASTIC.  The best hummus I've had.  Smooth, bursting with flavor, served with the freshest, crispest veggies.  Yum), saute of wild mushrooms with cheese and ham on toast (too salty, and the feta cheese was way too strong and clashed tastes with the ham), and shrimp grits and plank (YUMMY.  I've always wanted to like grits, but never did until I had them here.  And the giant piece of buttered toast was a dream).. . We expected to be able to eat an entree or dessert, hopefully at the bar if a seat opened up, or at another restaurant, but were absolutely stuffed from those three appetizers.. . If we had been able to sit down and eat, this probably would have been a five, but the so-so mushroom/cheese/ham toast and my ill reaction from the drink bump this down a bit.  I'd love to try this spot for a full meal if I find myself in the area again!
