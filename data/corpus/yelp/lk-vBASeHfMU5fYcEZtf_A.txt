LOVE LOVE LOVE!. . Went here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed!. . The atmosphere is beautiful- modern/minimal furniture, high ceilings, tasteful celebrity photographs... The decor might be a little too sterile for my taste, but I appreciated the simple sophistication of the interior.. . We started off with the tuna tartare (yum!) and the bone marrow flan (eh)...  Sides were generous and yummy...  But Oh... My... God.  The Japanese Wagyu beef was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Like nothing I've ever tasted in my life and well worth the price (apparently these cows live their lives being fed sake and getting massages?!).. . Extensive wine list, although there is no sommelier.  And, they definitely make their mixed drinks with a heavy hand.. . On top of that, the wait staff was courteous and extremely nice.  . . All things considered, it was a wonderful dining experience.  I will definitely be back!  :)
