I love this place - probably because I'm a steak and martini girl; but also because I just love the old-fashioned decor and cheesy lounge act upstairs... not sure why I adore that whole combo, but I do!  The martinis are fab (and they give you the extra bit in the shaker), the steaks are tender, succulent and bursting with flavor, the sides are all delicious (and filled with butter, I'm sure) - highlights are creamed corn, creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin, lobster mashed potatoes, the seafood tower is extravagant and awesome (hundreds of dollars of seafood piled on a tower with steaming dry ice) - very impressive...  I'm usually too full to have dessert, but they make a mean espresso.  Great wine list (sometimes they carry Flowers Pinot Noir - yum).
