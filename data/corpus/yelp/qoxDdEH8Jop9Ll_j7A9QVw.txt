Category: Thai
This was the second time I've been to Palms Thai.  The menu seemed a lot bigger then I remember.  Whether or not it actually is, they have over 100 items (which I know because they number them).  I tried the Palms Thai Sausage which is some sort pickled pork sausage that is battered and deep fried.  I've never seen this on the menu anywhere before but it was one of those things that was like "where have you been all of my life?".  I also had the papaya salad with raw blue crab.  Pretty standard but good papaya salad with pieces of raw blue crab in the shell which ended up just being to frustrating to work to get at the little bit of meat in each piece.  The pieces of crab meat that I was able to free were sweet and delicious but without a shell cracking device of some sort it wasn't worth my frustration.  Last time I was here I think I had the basic Kee Mao or Rad Nar and Tom Yum soup which were also good but the deep fried sausage is where it's at!
