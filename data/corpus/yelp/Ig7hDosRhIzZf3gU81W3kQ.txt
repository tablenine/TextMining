I think this place is overrated. On my first visit here, we waited 20 minutes in line to order. Then, we waited another 15 before fighting with a group of unattractive single thirty-somethings for a table. We finally sat down, after a couple of my friends' food had arrived. Mine arrived five minutes later, and it's extremely rare that everyone receives their food in the same time frame. My second visit was less crowded, but this place is full of hipsters and wannabe-hipsters, truly the worst people imaginable. . . The sausages are really quite good. I enjoyed the Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit and the Mango Jalapeno in particular. My friends were quite disappointed in the Alligator, and I thought it was just alright. The buns aren't the greatest, but the fries are the real treat, especially with the chipotle aioli. It's also difficult to decide whether to order one sausage or two -- one isn't quite enough, and two can make it pricey. . . Overall, the atmosphere kinda sucks, and this place is often just a pain to go to. Still worth an occasional trip.
