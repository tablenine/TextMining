POTATO BALLS, GUAVA ROLLS, AND MEAT PIES!!!. . Portos is my heaven on earth .. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE, although it gets REALLY packed the wait time isn't bad AT ALL.. . If you live within the area... Visiting the area... Or just want to get out of the house for a bit... . GO TO PORTOS!!!. you won't regret it! :)
