Category: Hot Dogs
Fun atmosphere, great beer and great sausages.  The best thing this place has going for it is the "beer garden" atmosphere (albeit inside). The communal tables make for a friendly atmosphere, where you have little choice but to interact with others.  The food is excellent and the service, fast and friendly.  Beer selection is overwhelming.. Its a bit pricey if you are looking for a hot dog and beer, but here the beer is really good and the sausages outstanding.
