Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
We went for a late brunch, 1:30 ish, on a Saturday. The restaurant was very cute . Unfortunately it was all down hill from there. Our server took forever to come over and even acknowledge us... it was not super busy. Then we ordered bellinis which were fine, just tasted like mediocre champagne and fruit juice. Everything on the menu looked great so it was hard to decide what to get. My friend asked to try the hollandaise sauce- luckily because it was not good. Very lemony and tart. I ordered a southwestern type salad with no chicken b/c I don't eat it. My friend ordered the grilled cheese on wheat bread and a side of a fried egg??? yes kind of weird ;) They finally brought out our food and they gave me a salad with no avocado (which was supposed to be on it) and chicken. They brought her the sandwhich with the egg inside it which was not what she asked for which the waitress acknowledged. My salad looked terrible. Iceberg and romaine Â lettuce, a few beans, and a few corn kernels. The second time they brought the grilled cheese out it was on white bread. The manager was short with us during her very sorry attempt at an apology and she was unprofessional both in dress and demeanor. . I do not recommend Taste
