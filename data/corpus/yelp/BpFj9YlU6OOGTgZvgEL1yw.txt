I'm a total fan. I love bringing friends here on Saturday nights before heading off to clubs or whatnot. I mean, come on. Thai Elvis! :D. . Generally, when I'm craving Thai food, what I'm really craving is a Panang curry, and theirs is one of the best in town. My friends all report that the pad thai is excellent, the fried rices are lovely, and I can speak with some authority that the coconut soup (tom kha) is usually excellent too. I say usually because I did get a dud here once. But it was only once. It hasn't happened since. I think sometimes it depends on who's manning the pot.. . Parking is a pain and on weekends, there's a wait, but it's never very long, so don't let that deter you.
