wait 45 minutes for one burger? I don't think so.... come on... ridiculous.. and if it came out luke warm meat and fries? I don't think it just came out from the kitchen!!. SO DISAPPOINTED........ Nice knowledgeable bartender and bigger place than SM location.. DON'T GO when it's crowded, THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT..
