If your only concept of ramen is a cheap, dry brick of noodles you pour water over, this place will spoil you forever. This is by far the best ramen house in Los Angeles. The secret is the rich, meaty broth that hugs you like a warm down jacket. They slow-boil pork bones for over 24 hours to pull all the meaty goodness from the marrow. The result is unlike anything you've ever had before. I always start off with an appetizer of little sausages sauteed with onions and mustard-- Yum! Be prepared to wait for a seat, however. This place is too popular for its own good!
