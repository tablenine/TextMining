Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I'm a little conflicted on writing this review because the company I went with destroyed whatever sense of ambiance by constantly nagging.. . A few year's back, I went with an ex-boss (the same jacko who was prominently featured in my weird escapade reviews. Look up El Pollo Inka in Gardena and you'll get the picture) to this place thinking it's a steak place. What we didn't see was a "sandwich" on the sign.. . So to his dismay, he's not getting a steak, but rather a steak sandwich. The bit*hing and moaning was very unbearable. He pretty much destroyed the mood.. . We sat at the outdoor patio area where the fire pit is at. At night, you'll see the fire and think it's an outdoor BBQ. Inside is a very small, but comfy dining area. A jukebox is prominently displayed there. The service is not bad and the food taste great. I ordered a huge Pastrami sandwich and that hit the spot. Luckily they set the pickle on the side because I would rather eat by itself then put it in the sandwich.. . Overall, this is a cool place to grab a bite where the Southcentral LA's Johnnie's is a take out only place. Definitely worth the trip. Just leave the nagger at home.
