Another place with a great counter to sit at.  SIngle diners unite!. . Wait. . . then we wouldn't be single diners anymore. . .. . Anyway, I went this morning.  Had my usual, the Eggs Fredstone.  Their hollandaise is something special, lighter than most.  The hash browns are nice, not the really fine discs they used to have, but still tasty.  Let some poached egg yolk run onto your potatoes along with some hollandaise and it's a morning food coma waiting to happen.. . Service at the counter is always swift.  It's easy to get a seat, even on a Saturday morning.  The people watching is great.. . Try an iced mocha, they do it up right.
