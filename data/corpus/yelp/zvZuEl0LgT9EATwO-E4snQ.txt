This restaurant was such a great spot in Logan Square.  The food is awesome and the atmosphere is very inviting.  Sitting outside on a cool summer night makes you thankful you live in Chicago.  The staff was very friendly and the menu has something for everyone.  Make time this summer to head to this place and you won't regret it.
