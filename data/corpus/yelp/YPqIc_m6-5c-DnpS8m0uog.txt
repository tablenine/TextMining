Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
You gotta love these dogs. Their menu is seemingly endless, but you definitely get a choice of hot dogs. My favorite here is the spicy polish. Man is it spicy. I used to grab one of these and an order of hot wings from Fat Burgers. The combo was awesome. But the line at pink's is just crazy. I wouldn't want to wait more than 10 min. Â But if you compare pink's with top dog up in nocal, I gotta go with Top Dog over pink's.
