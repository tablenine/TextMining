I think this place is really overrated. I've tried their pasta and hainan chicken, but all very VERY disappointing. I came especially for the hainan chicken after all the raving, but seriously people, it's off. .  I really cant think of anything positive to write down for this place...Parking is horrible, and the restaurant itself is SMALL (only has 3-4 tables), and BAD SERVICE!!! . the waiters were Â very rude~ so definitely not recommending this place!!!
