Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I was very excited about going to Hamburger Mary's (upstairs bar) since it is just down the street from my BFF's house.  I was SO disappointed!  I guess my expectations where too high, based on all of the fun times had at the late HM's in San Francisco.  This one is lame.
