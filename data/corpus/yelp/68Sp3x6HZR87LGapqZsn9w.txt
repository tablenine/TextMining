This is based on a dinner experience I had last night.. . Starting with the good:  The atmosphere was fun...I liked the mix of cafe, restaurant, and live music.  I also like the fact that they aim to use fresh local ingredients.  The local craft beer selection was also very good.. . The Bad: The food was really not prepared well.  My husband ordered the crispy chicken and it was not seasoned at all.  The chicken was also overcooked, so it was just a pile of chewy flavorless meat.  Luckily the sides that came with the dish had some flavor.  I got the pork loin, and though it was well-seasoned, it had the same issue of being overcooked and tough.  I couldn't finish it.. . The Worst:  I don't know what exactly happened, but both of us fell really sick afterwards.  We both had horrible stomach pains and I got so bad that I threw up my whole dinner.. . Probably never going back again for dinner...maybe for coffee or beer+live music.
