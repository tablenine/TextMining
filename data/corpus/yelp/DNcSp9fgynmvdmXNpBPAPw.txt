this place rocks!. they get very busy most of the time!. the bouncers are very nice!. theres over 1000 items on their menu!  they have a lot of food its crazy!  but a lot of it is like....pancakes, blueberry pancakes, banana pancakes..or like... chili cheese fries, chili cheese fries with...yeah but its still great and still great selection.. . theres always somewhere to sit!  definitely a very cute fun dive bar.. . The crowd here is very diverse!  I love it!  most of the restaurant people go here after they get off work.  They have industry nights where beers are 3 dollars.. . be careful when you leave because the cops just scope out right there waiting to get you!  lots of bums there too!  but theyre all pretty nice and not too creepy.
