So, just a few days ago, I wrote a review about Taqueria del Sol, claiming they had the best tacos in the city.  Well, El Myr's smoked pork taco definitely gives'em a run for their money!  One taco is gonna be the size of your head, and it's only $5.75.  Sooo delicious, I will totally go back.  However, be warned of: the super long wait; the less-than-comfortable seating (backless barstools); the indifferent servers; and the typical smoky, noisy Little 5 bar atmosphere.
