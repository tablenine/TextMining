I'm gonna give it four stars... Â no three.. Yeah three... And now for some platonic dialectics.. I love Caipirinhas. Man do I. But do I love them 10 dollars a glass? . Maybe, but not that often. Well then perhaps we should stay on the happy hour menu side of the drink list.. And thus we ask: Do I love mojitos? Yes. Do i love them 4 dollars a glass? YOU BET your sweet arse I do. . Continuing on my colloquy: When about 15 of my co-workers dropped by and wanted some after work grub to wish a now former co-worker off, how did we feel about the tapas menu being GONE, not shortened but GONE? Well lets go with let down, abused, overwrought, yeah all those. Cause damn if I was not ready for some tapas after reading all the reviews here. But Lord NO they are remodeling the swankety lime green beige and white swirly walls. And hence no tapas happy hour menu? Remodel the kitchen and no tapas, but remodel the lights and walls, hence kitchen down? Not sure I get the connection.. Argh. Will I go back to check it out once things are back from being shadows on the cave wall? Yes I will.. Anyway the point Plato is making here is, get yourself a philosopher king, AND stay on the happy hour side or you'll be enjoying a 15 dollar blackberry mojito, not a 4 dollar platonic ideal of one. Got me?. And if you ask me why I am taking a decidedly Greek turn with this? I dunno it just happened that way. Roll with it. I'll review a Greek place in Spanish if it makes you happy.
