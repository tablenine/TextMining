Now, is rabbit a common meat in Latin American dishes? (edit: They most likely called it "hare" and not "rabbit" like I am doing.) I'd never had rabbit before tonight, and never would have thought of it from a latin inspired restaurant. I know you're probably wondering how I could eat a cute wittle bunny wabbit well, it's actually not hard when they're so delicious. I'm sorry to all my vegan/vegetarian friends but rest assured that if I tasted that good I would let the rabbits eat me. It's only fair. . . I've got to say that the whole dinner was quite delicious from the tangy ceviche and the rabbit/ham "platos equenos" (aka appetizers) to the wild samon with artichoke salsa entree I had. Although it was a little overpriced I think I would probably still go back, if not for the yummy bunny then for the rich chocolate cake topped with a bit of strawberries.
