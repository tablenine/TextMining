Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House

Some friends and I made the trek out here from LA this Sunday for some dumpling dim sum (which you can't really get in LA). I was drawn because of the "juicy" dumplings (AKA soup dumplings). Unfortunately, they were only good, not great, especially compared to the soup dumplings I used to eat in NYC. Oh well.. . Other dishes were excellent, though, like the shrimp shu mai, which had a darling presentation in addition to tasting delicious. Our group also really liked the Noodles in Spicy Sauce and the unlimited hot tea. The only real disappointment (besides the soup dumplings not living up to my NYC Chinatown experiences) were the pork buns, which were waaaay too chewy and not fluffy like they should be.. . We will, however, be back and try some other non-dumpling items off the menu. Also, we arrived around 11:10am on a Sunday morning and had NO wait for a party of four. Coupled with only very light Sunday morning traffic from LA, we just might make this trip more often!
