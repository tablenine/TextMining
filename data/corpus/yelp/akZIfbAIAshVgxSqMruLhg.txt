Category: Bakeries
This is the big boss of Jewish Deli's. The one and only place you will need to know of when you think to yourself Â "Hmm, I want a sandwich on rye, where should I go?" It's Canter's and it's Delicious. . . If you're thinking of a place to grab lunch or drunk off your ass at 2 in the morning, this is the place to go. They'll service your group that's out on the town with ease and a smile. . . They have these layered chocolate cakes with everything you're not suppose to eat or you'll break every diet you could possibly be on. You know the types. The ones with real eggs, tons of flower and sugar that just make it rise and be stacked to the sky. One slice of that and you're down for the count. Simply put, that as instant diabetes and worth every bite.. . When not tempted by the Fairfax special, you'll be tempted for a burger. No matter how you cut it, you can't beat Canter's. Their pastrami and corned beef are just amazingly good. . . If you're in the mood for food after temple, Canter's is your one stop to fill that hunger.
