Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I was recently at the chalet. And as I left I was feeling hungry this usually leads me to Tommy's across the street. But not tonight, tonight I remembered that people rave about this place and it was early enough that it was still open. I had the pepperoni, and mushroom pizza which is what I always order when I get pizza. I thought it was great. Great thin crust pizza that was ready in about 15 minutes no more Tommy's for me.
