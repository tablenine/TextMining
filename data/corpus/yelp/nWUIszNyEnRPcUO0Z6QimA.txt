Wait on the patio!. . If you've got a few hours to kill and have a hankering for some sass and 2 loaves of meat on something barely resembling a bun.. this is the place for you!  . . This place isn't without it's charm, just don't expect much in the way of "service" or any sense of urgency.  . . When you're in Miss Ann's house, you play by her rules.. or you don't eat!  . . Simple as that.. . Oh, and the burgers aren't bad either.
