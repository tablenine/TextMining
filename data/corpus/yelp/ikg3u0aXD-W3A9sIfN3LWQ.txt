Came here after a hiking trip at Griffith Observatory, of course we had ayce korean bbq first then headed over here for dessert! Our friend had tried the blue velvet cake here before, and insisted that we must try it. We probably arrived here around 8p and it seemed like the place to be for a wednesday night. We ordered one huge slice of the blue velvet cake, for the three of us, and we all literally thought we were in heaven after one bite. Thee best blue velvet cake ever! I've tried the one at MILK, but Alcove's definitely the winner! So after finishing the huge slice, we ended up ordering another one! I most certainly need to come back here and try their other desserts, but that would probably just be insane if i didn't also order a blue velvet slice! Their slices are pretty large and about $7-8 a slice, but it's worth it!
