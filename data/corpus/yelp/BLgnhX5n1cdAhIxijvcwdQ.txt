What more is there to say after 1000+ reviews??? Just adding my 2 cents after going here for the first time today. . . Ok so I'm not a french-dipped sandwich connoisseur or anything like that...just an average Jane out to try someplace in LA that had a bazillion great reviews and has been around forever. . . This place did not disappoint at all! We were happy for the private parking lot which made getting in easy...and at first I was taken aback by the crowds inside. But we got our order right away...you get your order before you leave the counter and it's made the moment you order it. The bread was so soft and so fresh...meat was thinly sliced and piled high...there was so much of it I was surprised considering the very reasonable price. You'll use lots of napkins cuz the sandwiches are messy...but oh so good. . . I will warn, as others have, about the mustard. It's their special recipe and it is HOT HOT HOT. So try a bit first before you go slathering it all over your sandwich. I put too much at first and got a BIG surprise with my first bite. It's delicious though...and I wish I had bought a jar to bring home.. . It's kind of cafeteria-style seating, very minimal but there's lots of room for everyone. . . We will definitely be back on our next trip to LA!
