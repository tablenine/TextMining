Restaurant: Oinkster
Category: Burgers
My dad &amp; I came here shortly after I moved to Eagle Rock. He had a cheeseburger, I had a veggie burger, &amp; we both got fries &amp; beer. While this was over two years ago, I have yet to eat a veggie burger that even compares to Oinkster's.. . I don't do meat so I can't vouch for the actual burgers or sandwiches chocked full of the stuff, but I could talk for hours about how delicious the veggie burgers are. Oinkster is something akin to your standard burger joint but with food that's above the bar. The fact that they serve beer is just an added bonus.. . I would have given them 4 stars but the food tends to be a little pricier than a regular burger joint but it's worth the extra buck or two if you've got it.
