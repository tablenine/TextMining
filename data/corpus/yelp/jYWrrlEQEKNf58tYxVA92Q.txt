Spitz will rock your pants off. Spitz will rocks your pants off, pin you down, tangle its fingers in your hair and tie you to the headboard . you'll lose yourself in her eyes, become utterly mesmerized in the curvature of her lips, the tender corners, the pouty smile, the glistening crimson. And she'll slap you, hard; playfully, but with a hint of aggression. a wordless foreshadowing of the pleasure and pain she's about to inflict. Of the night you and spitz are about to have. her perfume will entice you, moonbeams will trickle through your windows, time will slow, etc. etc.. . Spitz is everything i look for in a restaurant. $10! No crowds! A small yet universally delicious menu. Incredibly convenient, open from 11am-10pm, 7 days a week. It takes these people 10 minutes to put together a delicious lunch that hits the spot AND doesn't slow me down. The classic doner, extra vegetables, zesty feta, light chili sauce, focaccia if i'm hungry, lavash if i'm driving. Sweet potato fries! Fried pita strips! Gelato! You can't go wrong.. . I appreciate these guys, they're actively making the world a better place, from their black t-shirts to their bizarre high water jeans, i heart all of them. 2 parking spots (TWO), tiny seating area. i park at the chronically empty sizzlers next door. Fuck sizzlers.
