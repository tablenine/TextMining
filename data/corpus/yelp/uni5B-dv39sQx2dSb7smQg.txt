Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
This is one of my favorite restaurants!  I love their deli salads, sandwiches, and cupcakes.  I recommend the snickers and coconut ones.  Don't let the set up of the restaurant confuse you. You can order from any register, its very simple and DELICIOUS!!!! Reminds me of Europe, and the food is so clean, love it.
