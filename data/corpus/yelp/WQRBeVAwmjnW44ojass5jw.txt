I came in with a friend last week after reading about Baohaus in the NYT and checking out Eddie's blog.  Ordered the Uncle Jesse and the Bao Fries with some peanuts to go.  Took a little while to get served (my friend finished his bao in the meantime), but I have to say it was probably the best tofu I've ever had--perfectly done with great flavors.  So I didn't care.  And the fries were amazing too.  Not crazy about the peanuts, but glad I tried them.  Eddie was a gracious host, and gave up his table for us and my friend's upright bass.   Probably won't recommend anyone try to bring a giant instrument in here again, as there is really no space, but we didn't get vibed for it which was appreciated.  Highly recommended and I'll be back for sure...
