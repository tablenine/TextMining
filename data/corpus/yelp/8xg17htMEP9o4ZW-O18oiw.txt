I've had better, but I've had worse.. . When it comes to the Thai Iced Tea, I've definitely had better.  . . But the food was decent.  We ordered five or six different items, and all were good.  The seafood soup was what it was meant to be.  The coconut curry sauce was good, although a bit too watery.. . I'd go back, but only because there is an Asian Elvis who has a pretty good voice.  I'm not saying I felt like I was in the presence of the King, but it was a decent filler for a low-key Friday night.  . . I guess, my overall assessment was that I am just not blown away, and the entertainment is the only reason to visit.
