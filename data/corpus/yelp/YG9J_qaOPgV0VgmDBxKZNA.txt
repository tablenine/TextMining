The steak really is as good as everyone says, but my favorite part of the meal was the bone marrow flan. I've never had it before - served out of what looks like a pair of femurs, you wipe it on toasted brioche and it has a completely singular taste I can't get out of my memory. So good I feel like it's going to turn out to be Soilent Green.. . And Wolfgang came out at the end of the meal personally to ask us how it was. That guy's got a good accent.
