AMAZINGLY good!! Didn't know what to think when walking in, and hearing honky-tonk tunes, low lights, and a huge bar. Looking at the menu, one would think with a few options of tacos, it'll be hit or miss. After ordering everything from the top, to the bottom of the list, due to the few bucks a pop items, there was NOTHING bad about any of the items. All really tasty, all demanding another order or two.. Everything is made to order, even the chips.. Â Really glad this place exists.. Teh drinks are really good too.. Huge list of drinks you wouldn't expect....Going back ASAP!!
