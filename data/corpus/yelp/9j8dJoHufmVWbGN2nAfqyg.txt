Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I have been to Japan, and have eaten some of the best ramen in my life, but this is USA. My judgments shall be different. . . I usually get the shio ramen with cha-su number 5. I love it because the soup is my remedy verses chicken noodle. I love the cha-su because i LOVE the excess fat.. . One star was deducted due to its quality over the past years. I'm a loyal customer, but the taste has slightly changed. The shio ramen is a lot saltier then it was before.
