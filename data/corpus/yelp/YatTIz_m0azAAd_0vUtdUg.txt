Awesome! . . Stopped in for dinner last night with a few friends. We decided to order a bunch of tapas to get a taste of everything. Here is the run down of a few things we ordered that I had the pleasure of indulging in: . . Guacamole with tortilla and taro chips . boniato and plantain croquetas . lettuce wrapped shrimp and scallops with avocado and lime . marinated chicken skewers with grilled veggies . smoked chicken empanadas . grilled veggie empanadas . churros with dulce de leche . some sort of chocolate cake deliciousness . . Everything was really good! My favorite items were the lettuce wrapped shrimp and scallops and the smoked chicken empanadas. . . Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive and helpful when needed. The rest of the staff was just really nice and I think we received top notch service. . . As far as atmosphere, I expected this place to be more like Carnivale with the bright colors and energetic music. The colors were more reserved but the salsa, bachata and merengue music was just as energetic. . . Definitely a great date spot or just somewhere to go for a girls night out. They have a patio as well if you're into dining al fresco.
