Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
I usually dont like the Taiwanese sausages, but Sinbala's exceptionally good. My favorite dishes there are the sausage &amp; rice, the minced meat w/ vermicelli, and the oyster pancake. Alot of people go there for the shaved ice, but I dont really think its that great. The selection of fruits and jellies are pretty limited, and they pour a dark sweet sauce on top. Too sweet for my taste.. . The only complaints I have about the place are the long lines during dinner time on weekends, the decor, and u'll end up smelling like food when Â you leave.. . For a place where I get well fed for just $6, i'll overlook the decor/noise/wait. Overall 5 stars for the food and service.
