Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Admittedly, I don't venture to Logan Square too often - especially to eat brunch.  So, it was a nice treat to head west of Western that early on the weekend!  Glad I did 'cuz Dunlays has some fabu food options!  I was pretty much wanting everything on the menu, but settled on the Palmer Square omelette - goat cheese, asparagus, roasted red peppers, and artichokes ($8.50).  That was kinda a new combo for me, but I loved the way it tasted.  The feta wasn't overpowering and the actual portion size wasn't massive!  It also came with some toast and fruit, so it was a well-rounded meal.. . Service was perfect.  I've never seen such chipper waitresses that early.  Seriously.  The crowd looked, well, hungover, but that's expected at 11am.  Parking was impossible, but if you turn onto Milwaukee, there's tons of meters available.  Oh, and they have mimosas ($7).  Gotta try that out next time!
