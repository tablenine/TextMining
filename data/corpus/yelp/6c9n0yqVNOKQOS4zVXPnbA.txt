Oh no no no. . . I went here with a few friends for dinner, and the food was healthy but so incredibly bland and boring. . . Spaghetti and Meatballs--Absolutely zero flavor. I could not taste a thing, and only knew I was eating it because I could FEEL that I had food in my mouth. No exaggeration!. BLT--As a complete sandwich, decent. However, I took out a piece of the "bacon" to eat it alone, and I nearly choked on the liquid smoke flavoring. Like eating a bonfire mixed with a dog biscuit mixed with a wood chip. . Enchiladas--A bunch of mushiness drowned in bland sauce surrounded by bland beans and bland rice. Yawn. . Tacos--This confused me. No one part of the tacos had any distinct flavor, but as a whole, it was a decently tasty and healthy dish. I decided to try this restaurant because someone recommended this dish, and if I ever had to come back it is the only thing I'd get. . . I am vegetarian, have been most of my life and eat at tons of vegetarian and vegan places. Vegan is no excuse for no flavor. Spices are vegan, yet RFD seems to choose not to use them. If you like food that tastes good--or tastes like ANYTHING at all--this is probably not the right place for you. Or for me.
