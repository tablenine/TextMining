Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Definitely one of those places you'll want to take your new chick to, perhaps the third or the fifth date place because by now you've already taken her to the "impress place" and the "followup to impress place"; now it's time to see if she's the right kind of girl for you. . . Any girl who can take down one of those salty-ass pickles and grin from cheek to cheek, can't be half bad. And if she opens wide, and takes an indecent bite of that tasty, overstuffed Hot Pastrami, with the Swiss cheese melting and that special sauce dripping from her lips, then she might be the one. . . The crinkle fries are okay, a nice touch of old school but then again Johnnie's has been around for over fifty years. You didn't come here for the burgers, so stick to the pastrami and the other hot sandwiches, and if you have room you might as well try the chili and the hot dogs. And that girl that you brought in with you, if she's still hanging in there with you, bite for bite, then you have yourself a winner.
