Hate to be the one to say it but as legendary as this place is and as great as the atmosphere is, the burgers are just average. Of course if you like their homemade hickory sauce, you'll love the burgers here. They are good, but there are also better. The place is an L.A. icon (I've been here a lot over the years), so it's worth taking people to, just know you might not sit together as the seating is first come first served. Extra bonus: Great pies and soft drinks served in old fashioned paper cone cups in metal holders. For more info: . http://bestlaburgers.w.... /
