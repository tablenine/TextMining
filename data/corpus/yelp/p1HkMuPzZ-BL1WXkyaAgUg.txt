Growing up in Chicago, my family and I ate here probably 2x a month, but it felt like it was a weekly thing.  The epitome of what a sandwich should be: meat between bread.  More specifically, a mountain of corned beef between two slices of rye.  Fixins?  You want fixins?  The only thing acceptable to add to the sandwiches at Manny's is either some mustard or horseradish, beyond that, you're in the wrong place.  To complete your plate a pickle spear or two accompanied by a latke, and maybe a Doctor Brown's soda.  Heaven.  . They expanded the place a handful of years ago, and the neighborhood is changing (Whole Foods, Target, established businesses fading away), but the feel inside is just like it was 20+ years ago.
