Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
If you want to eat a very well aged prime beef... This is the place! Â I've been to Lawry's for couple of times, and never complaint about this restaurant. There's another restaurant similar to this in San Francisco (House of Prime Ribs) Which taste almost the same.. . The waitress always start us with their Spinning Salad, and tossed it with their house made dressing. Taste excellent.. The bread yum, but don't eat too much.... . The main course, usually I share it w/ my girl friend, because we order the Kings cut. Medium Rare -- Medium is the perfect temp for your meat. . Side of corn, asparagus are good, but the best sides of them all will be Cream of Spinach.. . At the end order their cream brulle, or the choco cake .... . Usually I spend around $ 100 with a nice bottle of wine.
