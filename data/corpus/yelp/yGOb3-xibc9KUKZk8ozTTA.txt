Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
Sticky Rice works on two levels.  For ultra-foodies, they've got a 'secret menu', or so I've heard.  They also have some authentic Northern Thai dishes on their 'normal' menu, and they're well-described and accessible to rookies.. . And for the 'normal' Thai food fan - probably 90% of Chicagoans (and judging by the demographics of the patrons, most of their customers), they are VERY, VERY good at the 'Thai Classics' - Pad Thai, Curries, etc.. . I'm not a Thai food snob, and having had some unfortunate experiences with 'authentic' Thai food in the past, I mostly stick to the 'Ameri-classics'.  And they're excellent at Sticky Rice.. . What more is there to say?  Friendly folks, excellent food, Authenticity (if you want it) - they've got it going on!. . My only complaint - their phone lines get overwhelmed for carry-out orders!  Y'all heard of call waiting?
