Restaurant: Wurstküche

No, it doesn't occur often. But, I had a gathering of creatures Mother Nature probably never intended.  However, last night it did:  first on our plates, then eventually in our bellies. . . Wurstküche (must. not. giggle) is a sausage restaurant (sorry, still giggling) located in Downtown Los Angeles' arts district which specializes in, well, sausages.. . Sure they've got their regular fare of bratwursts, kielbasas and Italian sausages. But, you can get those anywhere. We were here for what their menu calls "The Exotics". So, last night we ordered:. .     * Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers.     * Buffalo, Beef &amp; Pork with Chipotle Peppers.     * Alligator &amp; Pork, Smoked Andouille.     * Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers. . Sure they may indeed be exotic, but are they good? I can honestly say in terms of flavor and texture, the buffalo and the rattlesnake were actually superb, completely worthy of a return visit. On the other hand, the alligator was as dry and tough as the skin that used to envelope the creature and the duck just laid an egg.
