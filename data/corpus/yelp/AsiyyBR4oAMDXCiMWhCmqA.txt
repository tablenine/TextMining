Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
i know this place has been featured in many tv shows but i do not see/taste the appeal of this place.  the food is mediocre at best.  . . the only upside to the miso ramen was the large portion.  the meat is skimpy. the broth is really salty.  the noddles are typical yellow noddles. nothing stands out. in fact, i'm getting bored reading my own review.. . the cold noddles had a more interesting flavor- light and tangy- but it isn't something that i am going to crave and talk incessantly, almost annoyingly, about such as philippe's. . . also aggravating: parking. but that is all of downtown. just wanted to hate on parking in general.
