I've only been here once. I think the ideal time to go is really late at night when a game isn't going on and when you want to get away from the yuppies. I was able to find parking in no time at 1am on a Saturday night. Â . . My server was very nice to me on the night I went and I received attentive service. The food is not anything special but they do have unique choices and that I think is pretty cool. The portions are very good for the price. I had a good soup there, can't tell you what it was since it was a little over a month ago. . . I would definitely recommend this place just based on my one visit.
