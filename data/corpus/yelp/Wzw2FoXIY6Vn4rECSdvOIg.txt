I decided to step into this joint cause my Seattle friend wanted the teba-saki badly. I'm NOT joking when I said badly, because that's all he cared about when he ordered. According to him, they probably used "crack" as seasoning cause it was so addicting. Not for me, it looked like chicken wings fell into the salt bowl and forgot to be picked up by the cook for a long time. It's really salty!!!. . I'm not really a big fan of too much saltiness in everything, but after 3 years of haven't eaten Furaibo, it made me feel that it tasted better than before, because I would have given 2 stars if I wrote my review based on my last visit before this. . . We ordered:. Tebasaki (Fried Chicken) - $4.10 for 6pcs.. Yakitori special (8 skewers for the price of $14, instead of $3.80/2 skewers) - we got Gizzards, Liver, Chicken, and pork meat. . Soboro Don - Grounded Chicken with raw egg on Rice - forgot the price!. Fried Halibut - my highlight of the day after seeing the "neighbor" ate this, I ordered! - $11.50. Furaibo Fried Rice - $4.95. . We ended up spending $49.xx (without the tips yet). Service when I was here was not bad, especially since we sat on the bar keep looking at all the yakitori that came out, it's not a bad view at all. I can't believe how crowded this place got as the night time came. . . Parking could be a hassle if their private parking lot is full, but since I live closeby, it's not an issue for me. Overall verdict, I wouldn't come back here on my own, if I'm desperate for yakitori, I would rather eat at Terried Sake instead.
