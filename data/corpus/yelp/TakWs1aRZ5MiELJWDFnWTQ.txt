Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
Crust is a nicely appointed gourmet flatbread pizza joint with a full-service bar, a nice patio (in front and back), and delicious food.  I've never had bad service.  The place is clean.  The menu has lots of vegetarian options and lots of non-veg options.  You can substitute tofu or tempeh for meat on any of the flatbreads.  The salads are good.  The soup is good.  The food is fresh.  The drink menu is interesting.  The music is a tad loud, but I can't think of anything else remotely bad about Crust.  It's definitely on my circuit of restaurants to visit a few times a year.  A nice addition to the burgeoning hip Division &amp; Damen shopping/nightlife district.
