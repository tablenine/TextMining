As soon as you walk into this wonderful place you feel like you're in New York. Beautiful wood floors, high ceilings and wonderful food. The steamed mussels, octopus salad and Pancetta with Speck were amazing. We didn't order a main course but instead tried a few things off of the "smaller plates" menu. Oxtail Ragu was WONDERFUL! . If you're willing to spend a lot of money ($200 for the two of us) then I would splurge and go here. Cheers to Mario and his yummy restaurant.
