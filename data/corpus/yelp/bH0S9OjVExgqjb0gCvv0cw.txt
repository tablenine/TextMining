Wow.. . Ice Cream, dessert, cakes, pies, cupcakes, milkshakes, sandwiches, salads, specialty sodas, take-out, dine-in, patio seating, indoor seating.....what does this place NOT do?. . Really.  Wow.. . So...this place is crazy good.. . We got a cookies 'n cream ice cream bar.. the chocolate sundae. coffee ice cream. red velvet mini-cupcake. . All were really really good.. . It looks like it gets really busy and the indoor seating was cramped and people were always bumping into you.. The outdoor seating was nice, under umbrellas and the place site on the corner of Melrose so there is plenty to see.. . I really want to go again and try some more new stuff.. . Everything looked to be made fresh and on-site.. The place smelled good and looked like it was always in the middle of cooking/baking something to replace whatever had just run out.. . Awesome.  Hand dipped ice cream bars.. . Loved it.
