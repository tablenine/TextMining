With places like this, how are Japanese people not morbidly obese?. . I get the chopped pork bowl. . It's always better a few hours after the inch of pork fat congeals.. . The soup broth is good too. Pork belly has a very distinct flavor that makes their broth very full-bodied and rich.. . Overall, the food is good and it's fun to watch them make it.
