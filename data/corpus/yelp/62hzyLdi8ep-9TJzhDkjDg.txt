I love this place. I've only been there about 5 times, but EVERY time I've always been beyond happy with my order.. Also, I'd like to say that their hostess is a delight (to contrast what Samantha S. recently posted). I've never had any problems with anyone there, regardless of how cold it is.... unless you call a nice smile a problem!. Hah, but seriously, 5 stars. I'm a big fan.. The corn cakes made a man out of me.. Oh, and BYOB for mimosas? Ok. Deal.. . wait... what?
