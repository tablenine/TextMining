minus one star cuz the salad bar sucks!. and no, im not a vegetarian, nor did i plan my evening based on what their salad bar would do for me!. salad bar- proscuitto (yuM). wanna be smoked salmon (Yum). boiled or steamed asparagus minus salt or any seasoning -gross!. NO fruit! -um, why hold out on the fruit? fruit is a palette cleanser!. ok, now for the meat... it tastes just like the meat at Gaucho's Village in glendale , and it tastes just like the meat at the grove farmers market brazil stand!. nothin special!. the garlic steak was good!. the parmesean pork was salty!. (what do you expect when you substitute parm cheese for panko crumbs?). the chicken drumette GOod!. the weiner sausage thing- dry!. (the manager, however, suggested mustard). the level of attention that the staff here displayed during my visit was awesome and refreshing and i wish i was rich so i could have tipped more than i did cuz the meat skewer hispanic handlers were so attentive and actually gave a crap when my table asked for a particular cut of meat and it was not on hand... the server, however, is more like a "would you like any of our $90 a glass wines tonight?" the servers dont even bring water! the ambidextrous busboys/meat handler dudes do!. ( i know spanish, ok, so i understood our server barking out "cinco aguas para la mesa nueve!" to her subservient co-worker ). valet $4.50 I left a $10 and the dude opening our door didnt even mutter a half assed "thanks for the $5.50 tip". i probably wont come here again , as i live hours away thanks to traffic, and i could get the same meat (and a way better salad bar) and toss in a live Carnival type show at Gaucho's Village.. so if you're in the hood and you're prepared to polish off your AmEx balance at the end of the month, then, yeah, stop by Fogo, i suppose
