Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
We really enjoyed the burgers, but the condiments were even better. We ordered four (4) burgers and all the condiments like ketchup, aioli, relish, spicy mustard, and a side of pickles. The pickle plate came with okra, two (2) types of pickles, hearts of palm all really tasty. . . What I liked about my burger was the taste of the grilled sirloin, you tasted meat and it was cooked to perfection. What I didn't like about my burger was no lettuce,tomato,onions just green chili. I should of read the description of the hatch burger it was meat and green chili's. The g/f got the Umami burger and was happy as a little clam in a shell, the burger disappeared in under 10 minutes.We downed two burgers and we all had hand cut fries, thin fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. All very tasty and cooked to perfection.. . After finishing the burgers we moved on to the Cake Monkey desserts, pretty damn good. We had several cookies and individual cakes. Going to order more of those darn desserts through the mail soon.
