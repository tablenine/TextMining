I can only speak about Rodan in relation to breakfast/lunch.  They have the best Vietnamese coffee EVER.  It's a decadent place - stuffed challah french toast, dessert style pancakes - Mmmm pancakes.  They also have great steel cut oatmeal and fruit.  I don't try and fight the crowds on the weekends, but during the week it's definitely a hidden gem.
