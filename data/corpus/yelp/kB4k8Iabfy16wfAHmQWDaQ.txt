OK, ok, it's now trendy and packed with Hollywood wanna-be's. Big deal. It's still the best combination of cheap and good sushi in West LA. The the default meals for non-sushi eaters (ie teriaki beef/salmon/chicken) aren't awesome, but the raw fish is very good, VERY fresh, and portions are not small. . . So it's cash only, you have to fight through the crowd waiting by the door for a table to get yourself on the greaseboard list, and you should bring earplugs...if you want to eat good sushi but still have money left over for boba after, this is your place.
