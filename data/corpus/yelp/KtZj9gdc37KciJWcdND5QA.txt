Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
The first time I ate at Fraiche, I thought it was the best restaurant in L.A. The food was absolutely delicious. When I went back recently, the food was still pretty good, but the service was horrible. We had the snobbiest waiter. I asked about the pappardelle, with an American accent, and the waiter said, "Do you mean the Pa-ppar-delllli" in an exaggerated Italian accent. Was this really happening? Was he correcting my pronunciation? If I wanted to act pretentious I could read the whole menu in an over-the-top accent, but this is Culver City, and I'm going to say "pappardelle" in an unaffected way. Who talks like that? And it's really rude to correct a customer on his or her pronunciation. Needless to say, I'm not a fan of the restaurant anymore because who needs attitude? In Culver City.
