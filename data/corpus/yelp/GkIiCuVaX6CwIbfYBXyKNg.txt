Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
More like a 3.5 leaning towards a 4. Friend and I were down their to see a movie (Breakfast With Scot, pretty decent)  and just drove down Sunset looking for a place. We settle on Bossa Nova because you rarely get a chance to eat Brazilian food.  The atmosphere was nice but the seat placing was very cramped, not a place for a large crowd or when you want some privacy. The service wasn't bad, but everyone seemed rushed and no one smiled, even though there seemed to be more staff then customers. The food was good but overall it didn't feel Brazilian, is pizza and pasta brazilian? We got an appetizer that the waitress recommended (Chicken wrapped in bacon with baguette slices in a thick creme sauce), Mahi Mahi, Lamb Chop, and teramasue.
