I want to love this place but even liking it is difficult.  Innovative Asian inspired vegetarian? I am all about it, but they disappoint every time.. . Menu sounds tantalizing and overwhelms a vegetarian with order options  but that is all the fun to be had here.  Food simply falls flat. . . No atmosphere at all, so if you are in desperate need for a vegetarian Chinese in Midtown - get a take out and don't expect much.
