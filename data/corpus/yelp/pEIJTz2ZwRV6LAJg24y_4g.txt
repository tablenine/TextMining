Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Yep, this place is uber yummy.. . If you're hunkerin' for some good prime rib then this place is definitely for you.. . I came here back in 2007-2008 and had one of the best meals.. . The meat is made to your liking cooked in its own tender juices, mmm.. . There are restaurant staff workers walking around with large portable closed heating carts that keep various side dishes warm for you.  They will make the rounds and go to each table that hasn't been served yet and ask which side items you would like with your main cut of meat.  I had chosen the creamed corn and spinach and both were really good.. . We also had some merlot to go with our meal to cut through the thick meat and it all paired off very well.. . This establishment is located along one of the main streets in Beverly Hills and the parking is valet in their own lot.. . The entire place is pretty big and you want to make reservations ahead of time especially if you plan on dining here on a weekend night.. . The service is great, the food is really good and the entire experience is wonderful. :)
