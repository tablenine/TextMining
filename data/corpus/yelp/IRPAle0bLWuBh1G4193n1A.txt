Probably one of the best BYOB's we have ever experienced in the city, and definitely good value for the quality of food. . . My wife and I rated restaurants for a well-known group and consider ourselves foodies and winos. Needless to say, we cannot stress enough how pleased we have walked out every time we've been there. . . The almond-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon are a vice. The catfish fritters (if available) are also addictive. I have tried the pork and the whole fish specials (also when available) and they are always perfect.. . Music is great, atmosphere is warm and comfortable; you never feel rushed. Call ahead however, since everything is FRESH, I'd recommend making reservations. . . Finally, the flan is a 10.. . If you run out of wine, Kafka is a block away and they're open pretty late.. . Parking sucks on weekends but there's a lot 1/2 block away. It's $10.
