I've been fortunate to be invited multiple times to this "LA Institution" and I enjoy every time.  Most recently, we did Sunday Brunch that allows kids to go.  They had multiple shows going on and we were able to see all of them.  Brunch was above average and dinners have been good.  I had the prime rib and I was satisfied.  Brunch is a bit sparce on variety but the food was good.  The shows are always good even the practice shows where magicians try new tricks and routines.  If you ever get invited to go, take advantage of the opportunity.
