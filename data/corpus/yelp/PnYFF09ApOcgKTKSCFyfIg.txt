De Cero,. . To save my life I wanted to love you! All things Latin and classy turn me on, but it's not you it's me; I don't like you.. . On a first date, impression management is crucial and it seemed like you didn't put enough effort into dressing yourself up. You're kinda stark and minimalist. Moreover, you surround yourself with a loud, crowded crew and it was a turn-off. . . Inspite of the raucous image, you seemed to play hard to get. You must have seen Swingers. Everybody waits 15 minutes to check up on a drink refill or meal. But now, it seems like everyone in town waits 15 minutes, so 25 minutes is kinda money. You didn't wanna scare me off, and called on me after 30. The games people play. . . . . I'm a Chicken Mole girl, so I was so excited to get some, but you cheeky tease!!! I got a chicken breast on a plate of basmati rice, with a dainty circle of non-spicy "Mole." Acceptable, attractive, but like Natalie Wood in West Side Story, a dubbed cultural inaccuracy, Daddy-O.. . I only wrote you this letter so you won't ever wonder, we're just incompatible and I'm seeing others.. . Â¡Cuidados! Lo siento.
