Restaurant: Sotto Sotto Restaurant
Category: Italian
It was a night to celebrate so I decided to go to a restaurant that was known for great service and exceptional food. First stop was Mimosas at Fritti (same owner &amp; next door). After sipping for a while, the phone rang at the bar and bartender said our that our table was ready so we decided to make our way Â next door to Sotto Sotto .. Sotto Sotto was all I expected it to be and more. The Seafood Risotto was excellent in every way..and fresh. Seasoned just right, flavorful and memorable meal.. The place had a high style buzz about it but still remained romantic and not too loud like some restaurants. Professional, knowledgeable servers. Portions not very large (found myself eating too much bread..lol) so remember that if you are accustomed to large Maggioni's style italian. . By the way, the mimosas at Fritti are $4 on sundays!
