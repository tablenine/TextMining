Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I heart Stella's!  It's my favorite kitsch diner in the city.  Brunch, lunch, dinner, all good for me.  I've come here with out-of-town friends, family and sent others here.  Everyone has left full and happy.. . I love the atmosphere.  There's often a wait during the brunch rush, but the wait goes quick.  Service is fast, but they don't push you out.  The menu has lots of options.  I had the BEST french toast here, but it was a special, not a menu item.  Challah bread with strawberries and a vanilla cream sauce.  I wanted to lick the plate clean.  (I resisted)   The burgers are good too---love the cheddar and avocado one.  . . I will keep on coming back.
