Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
porto's is the best bakery, hands down. I refuse to get a birthday cake from anywhere else. I reccommend getting the triple chocolate mousse cake, or the cheese rolls. oh! and the sandwiches are awesome too. the only downer is that it's ALWAYS packed. you might want to arrive an hour early to get in line and order.
