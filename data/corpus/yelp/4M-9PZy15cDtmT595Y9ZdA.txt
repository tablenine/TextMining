Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I met a friend here for dinner...I think they have the weirdest ordering style.  So...you place an order (with one of the ladies..make sure you remember who took your order)...you don't pay for it yet - and they don't give you a number or anything....5-10 minutes later, you'll hear your order called - by what you ordered (by the person who took your order, so that is why it is important to remember who tool your order)...Once you get your order, then you pay for it...kind of weird.  The tacos are good (they are the crunchy kind)...they do not have much on their menu, it's cash only and their salsa is quite delicious!
