I wasn't sure if I walked into an asian restaurant or an LA club, the ambiance is not what you expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. We started with the always reliable crab rangoons which were delicious and also enjoyed some lettuce cups. The lettuce wasn't an actual cup like usual it was just a huge piece of lettuce which made eating it sloppy and awkward. . . For dinner I got the sesame chicken, which was succulent and delicious the sauce is absolutely amazing on it. My roommate enjoyed the bulgogi the waiter's recommendation, and loved it. The service was terrible, we finished our dinner and waited over a half hour to get our bill or even checked on. The music is blaring in this place and makes it have a weird vibe but not too loud where you can't talk. Overall Id like to give it another shot when the slow service doesn't taint my opinion.
