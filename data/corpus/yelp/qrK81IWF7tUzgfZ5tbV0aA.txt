Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
HUGE portions.  Not alot of seating.  The food is always good, eventhough they tend to get a little heavy-handed with the jalapenos.  I reccommend the machaca... and ordering "to go".  My office usually orders the Manuel Special - with Machaca - which easily serves 6 big guys.
