the only time i've ever been in bagel is for their namesake, a bagel. i was on the run, looking for an apartment at the time, so i just walked in the first place i saw and got the easiest thing on the menu. now, don't get me wrong, the everything bagel was good (and HUGE), but i thought the pound of chive cream cheese they handed over was a bit much. and after shelling out almost $7 for my lunch, i was convinced that overpriced bagels and a mug of cream cheese on the side wasn't for me.. . however, after reading some of the other reviews, i think it's probably worth another chance. sounds like they've got a killer matzo ball soup and challah bread. i'll have to give it another chance.
