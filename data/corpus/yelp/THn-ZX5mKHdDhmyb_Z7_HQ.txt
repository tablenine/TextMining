My boyfriend introduced me to Brazilian food (He's from Brazil). We went to Fogo for his birthday and I'm GLAD! It was DELICIOUS! Â Everything was tasty and fresh. The service was great and it wasn't totally upscale to the point where we had to get all dressed up. We were there for about 2 freaken hours yet no one looked at us negatively. hahaha!!! I will totally go back to Fogo! . . Oh yea...He loved the food too. I mean, shit.. he's FROM Brazil and even he loved the food. Trust me--my boyfriend is a total pig (just like me) but he's very picky with Brazilian food.. . As far as the price--his brother called in and paid for us (as a birthday present)...so I never had a chance to take a look at the bill. THANKS! =D haha.
