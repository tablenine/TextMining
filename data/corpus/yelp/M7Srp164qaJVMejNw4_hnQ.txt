Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
there is nothing better than leaving the club at 2am and finding a place to eat...and deciding that you are near this place...they close @ 3:30...mmmm...so of course we decide to come here for their pastrami....and by far...for me...the best i have ever had...the only thing that sucks is its a $10 sandwich...but when you're drunk and are already down $200 from drinking yourself into submission...you wouldnt mind another $10 sandwich...hahah.... . so i order the pastrami with a side of au jus...community onion rings...and a root beer float...these are the only times i mix dairy with alcohol...and if you had one from here...you would know why...my sandwich comes out in like 5 minutes...and its the beginning of the end.... . this place is always a pick for me...but am i always willing to make the hour drive from the OC to eat it...not all the time...but if im partying in LA...i would rather come here than pinks..... . definitely come here with an appetite to eat an elephant...and you just feel like you did...hahahah...if you like being glutnous...come here...oh and bring cash...because they are a CASH ONLY establishment...but i just recently found out that their is an ATM in the back of the building...i used to run across the street to the AMPM...
