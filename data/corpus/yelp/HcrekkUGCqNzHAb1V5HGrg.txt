Seriously overrated.. . How do they distinguish themselves from the over-saturated Chicagoland Vienna Beef hot dog market? No ketchup. That's right. Not even for fries. As someone who can get a Chicago-style dog and a dog with just ketchup in the same order with no remorse, I appreciate their steadfastness towards the local style. But come on, with the cooked-too-long, super-greasy fries, and utter lack of almost anything else on the menu, at least give me some freaking condiments. And the staff is pretty rude, to be honest. . . I get the ethos they're going for, but they come off as overly cocky about a substandard product. I won't be back. I'll take Parky's or Pete's any day over this place.
