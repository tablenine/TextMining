Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Roast chicken, peanut butter, cilantro, chipotle chutney.  . . does that sound nasty? if so, it sounds like you need to live a little.  culinarily speaking, of course.  . . thank you jerry's for putting together flavors that take the boring out of eating. . . and for serving beers that are worthy to be placed next to such sandwich masterpieces. . . my only beef with jerry's (and why it didn't get 5 stars) is that many of their sides are a little bland.  but that doesn't stop me from coming back. . . cheers!
