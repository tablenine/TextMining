Restaurant: La CrÃªperie
Category: French
Le Creperie is a great stop on the way to a movie at the Landmark Cinema. Have a couple of fabulous beers from Belgium, some French onion soup and enjoy the European cafe vibe or relax on the patio. I like the atmosphere here a lot but wish that the main event, THE CREPE, lived up to the ambiance of the restaurant. I've had the goat cheese and broccoli which was dry... So dry that dampened cardboard would have been easier to digest. I've also had a mediocre creamed spinach crepe. Maybe there is a sure bet here that I'm missing? Anyway I like this place enough though to continue to find that gem of a crepe.
