Please don't get this confused with my other 4-star reviews. By far and away Duck Walk is not a classy joint, it's not the kind of place you take a date, it's not the kind of place you take your mother, it's not even the kind of place you take your boyfriends' annoying mother. Got it?? OK. . . Duck walk is getting a 4-star solid honorable mention for it's delivery and take-out merits in the "Cheap Food that Doesn't Taste Like Dog and Comes Fast" category.. . Aside from the pizza delivery staple, when you're craving something different and want it brought to your door, Duck Walk does it right. Super cheap entrees (which are buy one get one free) - say you have the coupon although you don't really need it because they NEVER ask you for it. You can also get free Crab Rangoon if you forgo the aforementioned offer. It's an either or.... you're free to decide what suits you best. But you heard me right... FREE CRAB RANGOON! Crab Rangoon is already the worlds most perfect and delicious little treat and now you get it for simply being you!! Life is good. And so is Duck Walk.
