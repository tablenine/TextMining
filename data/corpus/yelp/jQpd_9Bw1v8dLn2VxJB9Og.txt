Once again, I am frightened that anyone thinks this place is anything other than a cool looking, old school LA type place. .    OK, all I had was the brisket sandwich, chips, and  pop (Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray- what else?) BUT BUT BUT.     NO SELF RESPECTING JEWISH DELI would ever put out a plate containing that flavorless, dry, sawdust sandwich on grocery store quality rye bread in front of any human being, charge them ANY money at all, and then think they would EVER EVER return to try the "best pastrami sandwich ever" as purported by my fellow yelpers.....      I simply and absolutely cannot, will not believe that ANYTHING they serve can be halfway decent AT ALL. Chalk it up to another case of these poor, poor, LA people who have NO IDEA of what a real brisket (or meat) sandwich could and should taste like. SO, SO SAD! I love California, but you all need to get out and about a little...there's a whole world of food out there just waiting for you- in New York, Chicago, London, Ann Arbor, Detroit, Travers CIty (Tapawingo), Dearborn, San Francisco can whup on Southern Cal cuisine with one arm tied behind their backs. You all have no idea...I miss ZIngerman's (which I used to swear was overrated!), Miki's, Shalimar (which I used to complain was overpriced!), Thai Bistro, Amer's even! Hell, Kosmo's Deli at Kerrytown, that new Japanese French place on Liberty, any hole in the wall or Burmese restaurant in San Francisco, various great cheap places in New York, any Indian food in London...Sigh.....
