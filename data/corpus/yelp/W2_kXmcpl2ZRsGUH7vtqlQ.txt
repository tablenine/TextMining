Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
I love this place, but also realize that it's not for everyone.   This is a simple Chicago dog stand - no seats just a counter in the back, long lines, simple menus (hot dog, double dog, extra fries, tamale and drink) and lastly NO ketchup.   Growing up with my hot dogs this way, I'm ok with it but have had a few friends look for ketchup and not find any.   The fresh cut fries are worth the trip.  The snap of the hot dog is great.    I totally get the one star reviews though and don't get offended since there are many reason 1) don't like the snappy hot dogs  2) Must have ketchup on their dogs  3) The nuclear green relish scares them  4) Want a salad on the hot dog (a la portillos)
