I took my mom to this place when she was in town.. It's big appeal is the fact that here is NO corkage fee for bringing your own wine. They do not serve alcohol here but there is a wine/beer store next door that they own that is decently priced, that i believe they own as well. . . You should make your reservations 4-5 days in advance if you want to eat at a reasonable time on a weekend day. . . Service is minimal yet good and responsive.. . Price is awesome considering the location and the quality of the food. Three of us ate for about 65 dollars and we were so full. They plates aren't very large but well priced.
