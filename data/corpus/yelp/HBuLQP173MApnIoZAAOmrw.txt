This place is soooooo good!!! I always say that, but that's cuz I love food, but this I give it a 5 star rating!! . . I went here with my boyfriend on one of our anniversaries one time and this place is just really nice, if you like the bouguoise type of places, cuz I sure do..lol. . My boyfriend ordered the rib-eye steak, and I ordered the filet mignon. We also ordered their lobster mash potatoes and their spinach dip. The rib-eye was extremely good, it was thick how it should be, so succulent that it melts in your mouth, and just the best rib-eye's that both me and my boyfriend have ever tried (my boyfriend thinks its better than Delmonico's in Vegas if any of you have been there). My filet mignon was good too, better than Ruth's Chris. I enjoyed my steak but not as much as my boyfriends rib-eye.. lol.. The lobster mash potatoes are a great hit, they give you a BIG bowl that makes you wonder "why did i order so much?" it was good though, it was good the next day as well, everyone at my house loved it! The spinach dip was okay, I still think that Lawrey's spinach dip is better. Other then that, this place gets a 5!!!
