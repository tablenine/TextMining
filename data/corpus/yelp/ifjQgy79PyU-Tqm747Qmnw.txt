Went a few weeks ago with a Group-on to try the Prix Fixe menu.  Was told that both of us would need to order Prix Fixe so we ended up with quite a lot of food, which allowed us to try a number of dishes.. . The Beijing Five Spiced pork ribs started out excellent but as the ribs got smaller they were more over-cooked.  For an entrée I tried the grilled Arctic Char which was a savory fish with an nice coconut curry sauce.  The eggplant was too tough and mushrooms were not my favorite.  The Crisp Orange Beef has a nice citrus flavor but was not as crispy as hoped.  The pickled lotus root was an interesting companion to the dish.
