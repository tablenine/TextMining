I love you i love you i love you i love you.  When I was down in SoCal, my friend (what an angel sent from the food gods!) took us here.  I ordered the strawberry shortcake with strawberry sorbet, which was in fact included!  $4.50 for this special creation.  The strawberry sorbet was amaaaaaaaaaazing as it melted in and around the corners of my mouth, trickling down my neck and onto my dress marking its territory.  I came back home to San Francisco the other day with stains on my dress and thought of Milk.  And just reading the rest of these Yelp reviews makes me depressed because I wish I could've tried everything on the menu. :( Sadness.  I hope they open one in San Francisco soon.
