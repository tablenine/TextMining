would have never known about this place if it wasn't for yelp.  loved it!  we (2 of us) ordered combo "d" and it was more than enough for us.  i was surprised at how clean it was inside - not that i expected it to be dirty, but i did expect it to be a little more gritty.  . . will definitely go again.  we don't normally spend this much on food and we chose this place over soot bull jeep because many of the reviewers mentioned that the staff do everything for you.  since we were new to this type of meal, we appreciated the help.
