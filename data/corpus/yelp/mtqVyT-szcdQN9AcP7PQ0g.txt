I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT ANY STARS!!!  But it doesn't give me that option so one star from me... Pink's is the NAAAAASTIEST thing you can ever have!  It is wayyy too overated! I took a bite of it only once and will NEVER EVER take another bite again!  I wanted to detox after I took that bite!  I don't understand how people put this nasty junk in their body~  Yuck!!!
