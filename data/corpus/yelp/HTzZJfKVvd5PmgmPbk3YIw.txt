I love the beef classic and the price cannot be beat.  Comes to about $10 with a drink, tax and tip for a large (trust me, it is large) bowl of noodles.  The chicken noodles was great as well.  The basis of all their Pho dishes is the same soft rice noodles in broth with different types of meat or dumplings.. . I have gotten really thirsty after drinking their broth (after eating the meat and noodles) and a Chinese friend of mine tells me it may be a sign of MSG being added ... not sure ... either way, I love Pho #1 :-). . BTW, they do not accept AmEx
