This place is SO delicious. We could tell that it was a hit by the long line for the restaurant. It's a bit cozy inside, but the service was fine and speedy.. . The air vents never work at Korean BBQ places, so keep your fancy clothes at home. They cook the kalbi for you instead of letting you grill it on your own, but it was still amazing. Chopchae was good, and so were the side dishes. For some reason we didn't get the lettuce leaves or sauce for the bulgolgi/rice, but maybe they just don't serve it that way...?. . I definitely like the food here better than San Soo Gab San, and it's a lot easier to get to. It's always a good idea to have someone Korean in your party (if possible :oP), but it probably doesn't matter that much at this restaurant. Good value for the amount of food you get. If only it were bigger.... . This place is BYOB (unlike San Soo Gab San) - we doublechecked with the waitress before whipping out our wine, but we also ordered some soju.. . Get here early if you don't want to be waiting in line outside.
