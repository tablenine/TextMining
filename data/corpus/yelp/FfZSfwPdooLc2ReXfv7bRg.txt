THE ORDER . Veg Pho . Pork Sandwich. . YIPPEEEE . You can order online &amp; pick up .          - super convenient .          - Everything was beautifully packaged . Lots of big pieces of tofu in my Pho :). &amp; they included shrimp chimps (without me having to ask) - yeah . . BOOOO . For my tastes the pork sandwich was too sweet .            - but my man really liked it . They did not give Cilantro for the Pho .           - &amp; that's a necessary ingredient if u ask me .           - also, they didn't include enough bean sprouts or green onions . . CONCLUSION . food above average . I will order again but only because of convenience otherwise i would go someplace else
