This place is a great low-key chill eatery with good burgers and these crazy delicious things called Cheese Balls!! You've definitely got to try the Cheese Balls - that is, if you are not adverse to an outrageous amount of calories packed into one bite! Our service was solid and the food arrive quickly. Plus, it's located in a great little area with lots of boutiques and you can sit outside, if you so choose, to people watch and sight the occasional celeb.
