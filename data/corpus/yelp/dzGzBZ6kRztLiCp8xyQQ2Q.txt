B's get degrees!. . When you see a restaurant that has a line of about 20 people 30 mins before opening and is showing off their B rating, you think to yourself.. This place must be damn good to still have a loyal following. So I figured I've eaten in worst places (aka sitting on the sidewalk in NYC), so we hopped into line. They opened up like 10 minutes late, which was kind of annoying since we were starving. . . As appetizers we ordered the sliced roast pork (yummy pork belly in my belly) and tuna sashimi (again, its hard for raw tuna to disappoint). As an entree we each ordered the Daikokuya Ramen. This is not any old Nissin Top Ramen from your cupboard, its savory noodle goodness! The broth and egg noodles are complimented with pork belly, green onions, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, sesame seeds and a boiled egg. The normal servings are quite large, especially since soup is sooo filling. You can request for a half size or even a large size. You can even have the soup Tsukemen style in which the noodles, broth and fixings are all separate from each other. That way you can use the broth as a dipping sauce.. . After my belly was full, I went and used the restroom. Word of advice, use the bathroom before you go. I think I know why they got a B. :(
