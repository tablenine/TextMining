Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The single best prime rib I have ever tasted! I always get the Lawrys cut medium rare with corn and for just $22 more you can add 2 lobster tails to share with your significant other.. . I recommend joining the Lawrys VIP program! They receive points for every $ that you spend and when you spend $250 they send you a $25 gift certificate. You can use multiple gift certs during any meal and they send you gifts (personalized Lawrys seasoned pepper) for your birthday and anniversary. Plus if you go dine on Mondays or during the 1st hour they are open on any night you get double the points!!! So if you spend $250 you will receive $50 in gift certs for your next visit!. . You must try the corn as everyone said and you HAVE TO end dinner with their hot fudge sundae!!!. . I go back about once every other month and for special occasions like birthdays or anniversarys and I do not plan on changing that.
