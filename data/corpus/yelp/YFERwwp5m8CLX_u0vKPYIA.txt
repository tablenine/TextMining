So far, I am a fan of this place. I only sat outside on a gorgeous afternoon so did not see the atmosphere at night. But I can only imagine that it would be a Lincoln Park bar in Wicker Park. That would get annoying. But, what is nice about this place is that it is huge! You walk in and it is just this big open place. PLUS, they have a table shuffleboard! How cool! I haven't seen one of those for awhile. They have a really good beer list but we didn't really eat so I can't speak for the food. (Well, I did try the tater tots and actually those weren't that good.) I did also like their bathroom. Yes, I always judge a place by their bathroom.
