Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
notoriously known as "that shabu place with the old man where you have to wait forever".  . . but they do have good shabu meat with interesting sauce.  the old man will walk around and mix up the sauce for you if he thinks you are doing it wrong.  he will also scold you before the meal if your name is called and your entire party isnt there, so dont even think about trying any tricks like that.. . the wait will be a lot happier for you if you go to the bar across the plaza and drink beer.  be sure to indicate on the list where you are though.. . follow the rules and you will have an, um, intersting experience.  not exactly the most relaxing restaurant i've ever been to, but christ do i love a good shabu meal...
