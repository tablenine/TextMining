What I got:. . The #19--Pastrami with swiss cheese, cole slaw, Russian dressing on rye: This sandwich is phenomenal! The cole slaw can be a little overpowering, but it is very good cole slaw, with a really nice creamy richness to it, but also a nice fresh vegetable taste. I had a side of it in addition to my sandwich, and I just gobbled it up. The sandwich itself is a little small for a pastrami sandwich--it's not overflowing with pastrami, like I'm used to. But the pastrami is so well cooked, moist, and flavorful that it's easy to overlook this. The Russian dressing (ketchup, mayo, and onions) also blends very well with the pastrami and gives the sandwich a unique flavor in comparison to the traditional pastrami with mustard. Can't really say much else other than that this sandwich is about as ideal as it gets for a pastrami sandwich. Only flaws: could use twice as much meat, and rye bread has a crispy crust that is at times annoying. 9.6/10. . Most other things on the menu are supposedly not quite as good according to most reviews, but the sandwiches everyone at my table got received rave reviews in general. My brother got a turkey triple decker sandwich there that he found incredible, and my friend got a patty melt that he greatly enjoyed, except for the excess of caramelized onions on the sandwich. . . All in all, then, this is the place for pastrami. I really can't say much about everything else, but the pastrami alone is worth the drive, the bad neighborhood, and the hassle of the wait. Best in the city!
