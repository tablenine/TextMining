Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's is a fancy/pricey place but I think it's worth it. I highly recommend reservations because it gets packed. They have fresh made potato chips and meatballs while you wait for your table. The prime rib is excellent and full of flavor as is the creamed corn, mashed potatoes and everything else. I like the yorkshire pudding with the au jus. It's bomb! The waitresses wear these old school uniforms.. crazy. The service is great and the restaurant itself is very nice
