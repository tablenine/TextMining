I love Leon's. From the special cocktails to the fries to the bocce ball court, it is awesome. The decor is very interesting, I'm not sure how to describe it; 50s soda joint meets modern loft? . . But lets talk about the food. The Pub Frites are amazing as an appetizer or as a side. I have now tried three sauces: masaman curry, bacon and terragon mayonaise, and smoked tomato mayonaise. The masaman curry was a little lacking but the two mayonaise sauces were to die for (which could probably happen if you keep eating them, but it would be such a sweet death).. . The peppadews stuffed with goat cheese were fantastilicious. I had never heard of peppadews before, but now I love them. These tasted like unfried jalapeno poppers. I am craving them now.. . We were a little hesitant to try the Bacon in a Glass with Peanut Butter, but I think I'll definitely get that next time.. . As far as the entrees, these were maybe my least favorite part of the meal, but they were still awesome. I had the halibut and the beau had the Pork Chop. The pork chop was delicious all the way down to the fingerling potatoes. My fish was pretty good, but I would not order it again (and it appears to not be on the menu anymore anyway). . . All in all it was a fabulous night out. I will definitely be returning.
