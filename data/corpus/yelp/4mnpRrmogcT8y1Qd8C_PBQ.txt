The wait might be a little tedious, but the food is worth it!. . The Gyoza, the "Kotteri" flavored Ramen, and the Shredded Pork Bowl are a must.  While you're waiting you might want to go talk a nice walk around little Tokyo, but make sure you make it back in time before they call your name and number.  Other than that The place is great.
