I love this place for the food. The sandwiches are great. I love the banana chips. I was there this afternoon and it was sheer madness again. They must be rolling in the buckets of money. I was able to get a seat outside to enjoy the awesome Glendale day. My food arrives and I ask about my ice white chocolate latte and the girls said it is coming. Cool! 10 minutes later and into my second page of the L.A. Times, where is my ice white chocolate latte? They come back and brought me a hot chocolate? Huh? No Ice? She comes back again with two drinks, but this time to tell me they are not for me. Finally after the sports section and sandwich 75% gone, slightly dying for caffeine, I get my coffee 15 minutes later. . . I will still come here, got to love the potato balls.
