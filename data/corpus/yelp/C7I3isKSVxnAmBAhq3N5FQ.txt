I can't believe I've never reviewed Roscoes. I don't go much anymore, on account of me living in SF and my mean case of Â "old lady stomach" which limits my fried chicken intake. . However, I did spend a lot of time here from '01-'04. Really delicious chicken, sweet and crispy waffles, sassy waitresses.... There is a reason Chris Tucker climbed into the Samuel L. Jackson's trunk...despite his better judgment.
