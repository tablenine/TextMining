LINE out the door all the time....  enough said??. . Well, this is one of Culver City's treasure troves of yummy places to eat and hang with your friends.  All ingredients are fresh and everything on the menu is 10 bucks!  The chicken is always flavored and juicy.  You'll never get dry chicken in your salad or sandwhich here, folks!!  Everything is organic but don't be fooled, there's plenty of fat in the salad and sandwiches (it's the spread that will kill you) so be careful you dieters out there.... . Service is fast and upbeat.  If you want a flavor packed way to eat a salad, come here.  Only down side, DON'T eat the bread they give you on the side...it's so greasy...made me ill.  But you'll be devouring everything else so no worries.... . This place is one of my regulars....never fails to please.
