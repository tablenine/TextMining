It's been a bit too long since I tried breakfast at Square One, and so sadly I don't remember exactly what I had.. I do remember the eggs being served in the cast iron pan, and I remember the eggs being overcooked to the point that they had turned that brownish green color.. I know J. Gold likes this one, but you could do much better for breakfast in LA. Just don't go to The Waffle.
