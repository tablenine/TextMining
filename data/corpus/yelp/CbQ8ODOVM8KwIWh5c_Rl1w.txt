Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Really?! What's with the hype? Seriously, it's like Kogi, people just all about the hype. As if waiting for an hour to get your food somehow makes it taste better. Sorry, but there are about 500 taco trucks around LA that have better tacos and burritos than this place. You can get a much better shredded beef burrito, with fries and a large drink at Baker's for less money than Tito's.
