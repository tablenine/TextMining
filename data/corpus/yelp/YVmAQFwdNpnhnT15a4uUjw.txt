Again like every other place in Cali that was hyped up.. I don't see what's so great about this place. But then again.. that might just be because I'm very not use to Japanese ramen.. yes.. i am korean and have only been used to korean ramen.. where basically everything is spicy. HEHE. But rice bowls are really good. I enjoyed it a lot. Maybe because I didn't enjoy the ramen.. - -;;. . but yea.. most people like japanese ramen.. but not me. :((. . there is always a long wait because it's known to be cheap and good. about 45 minutes to an hour maybe? but i think it goes by faster because people always leave before they are called. my friend and i put our names down and just looked around for a little bit.
