Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This is the ONLY place in LA that I know of that serves REAL TONKOTSU RAMEN in Hakata style the right way!. . With my ex-boyfriend's influence who was actually from Hakata (region where Tonkotsu ramen originates), I am very picky when it comes to Tonkotsu ramen..  While even most Japanese from other areas cannot tell what real Tonkotsu ramen is, I can tell when its the real deal.. . Shinsengumi has exactly the right qualifications that makes real Tonkotsu ramen. Straight thin noodles, simple toppings (unless you add), and offering nothing but the Tonkotsu broth. Also they cook the noodles in the hardness you want, and the broth adjusted to your taste! . Service is great as well. I love the energy they carry in this store.. . I do believe that this is the best Tonkotsu ramen you could get in LA so far, but its not the best ramen that I would drool over in my dreams. . If in the U.S., some stores in NY have great ramen. Thats why I gave it only 4 stars, but definitely my favorite and far the best ramen place in LA! . . Also, this is one of the few places that has the deep fried chicken bone cartilage. It's pretty authentic but one of my favorite dishes to have with cold beer!
