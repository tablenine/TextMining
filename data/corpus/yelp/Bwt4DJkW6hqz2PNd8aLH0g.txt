Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
I'm a huge fan of Ciudad and I highly recommend it to anyone who will listen. So, go. It's slightly less costly than its new counterpart, Rivera, but it has similar features (maybe slightly less posh, paying slightly less attention to detail) but it feels more authentic. I can say that because I frequently travel to Latin America and I feel Ciudad has achieved true balance with regard to what urban, wealthy-ish North Americans will consume, and what urban, wealthy-ish Latinos will consume. This is the place for a mixologist's rendition of Pisco Sour (not something you'd get in an everyday bar in Lima, but top shelf), or even a very good Rio version of a caipirinha. This is also where to take a carniverous friend for an Argentine steak on her birthday. Aesthetics are just perfect in my mind, and the service is quite ideal. Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger have done it again (and again).
