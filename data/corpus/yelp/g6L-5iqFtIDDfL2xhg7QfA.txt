Delicious food and great service!  We started off with the avocado and roasted carrot salad, fried okra and the pea arancine (which turned out to be fried risotto balls!)  I was skeptic of the salad, but the carrots with the avocado were a perfect match.  Also, the risotto balls were amazing!  Each one had a piece of gooey cheese in the middle!  For dinner we order the flounder and a lobster roll (which apparently is only on special Saturday nights.)  The flounder was incredibly tender and melted in my mouth.  The lobster was dressed in a light lemon mayo dressing and not the typical heavy mayo based dressing you find on a lobster roll.  We finished up with the lemon curd dessert which was light and tangy.  It's very rare that I enjoy everything I order at a restaurant, so I'll definitely be back!
