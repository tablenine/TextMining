Food was great, but the ambiance sucks.  It looks like they pulled everything right out of IKEA.  I hate IKEA.  But anyway, the food was pretty good.  I had the Cinnamon Roll French Toast.  To say that it was opulent would be a mild understatement.  It was mouth watering good.  I have traveled all over the place and this ranks up in my top 5 places for breakfast!.
