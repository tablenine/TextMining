Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Los Angeles.  I have been going to this place for the last 9 years.  It has gotten extremely popular in the last couple of years and now there is always a wait no matter what time you go!.. . What I love about this place is that they are always introducing new fun dishes.  I always order off the specials board.  Whoever asks for a menu is an idiot as true Katsu-ya lovers don't need menus.  . . I am pretty much a regular here and even though I have to wait like everyone else (unless I make a reservation). Once I am seated (the sushi bar being my fav. place) the service is always good and consistent.  Don't expect the service at this place to be that of a fancy restaurant, as its not.  It's more of a no-frills type of place with fast attentive service.  . . For those people who go to Katsu-ya and order a spicy tuna roll or a california roll....come on....you can't complain if that is what you are going to order.  Some of my favorites include:. . Some of my favorite dishes include:. . Spicy Tuna with Rock Shrimp Tempura. Crab Tuna Cone. Albacore with crispy onion. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno. Baked Crab hand roll. Toro, oToro, or Bluefin tuna Sashimi (expensive but worth every bite). Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna (Signature dish). Miso Cod (a cooked dish but till every bit as delish). . Anyhow..I could go on an on..but in the essence of writing time, I would totally recommend this place.  I do miss some of the oldie but goodie sushi chefs (the OG ones back in the days), I guess now they have moved on to bigger fish...like the Katsu-ya in Brentwood or Hollywood.. . nonetheless, the Katsu-ya in Studio City will remain a classic and by far the cheapest and best deal of all.
