Yeah- I have to laugh because I went here the week after I went to Chicago diner and when I ordered my Tomato juice she first asked me if it was ok that it was V-8.  Then it came in a pint glass and happily only cost $1.95.  It was as if someone read my review on Chicago Diner for proper tomato juice etiquette.  At any rate the food was very good.  It is not cheap but reasonably priced.  The portions are huge.  Totally recommend this place.  It is a great addition to the neighborhood.
