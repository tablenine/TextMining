Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
I went to The Bluebird for pre-New Year's drink(s) and had a great time.   When I first walked in, there were not a lot of people, which I preferred and there was a nice mix of people as the night went on.  I've been reading quite a bit about the less than stellar service in previous posts.  Perhaps that was experienced if you sat at a table, but sitting at the bar every order was met quickly, and in a courteous manner.  As I was on a cheese binge to serve as a base for any later night drinking, I shared mac and cheese and a cheese plate with my friends, which were both good and filling.  There was a nice selection of wine, and the beer list was extensive, which was appreciated.  I wish we hadn't left so early, I will be going back.
