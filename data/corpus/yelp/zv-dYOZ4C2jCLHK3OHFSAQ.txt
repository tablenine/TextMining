i heart this place. grapefruit juice is yummy. fresh baked treats. amazing omelette with goat cheese and asparagus. and i LOVE the quirky waitress...dont know her name but if you've had her, you know who i am talking about. not a fan of the baked eggs with the collards...it doesn't balance well. but whatever, that's just personal preference. mmmm tuna salad sandwich is yummy too!! pricer but you pay for quality so if you have a problem, go to denny's.
