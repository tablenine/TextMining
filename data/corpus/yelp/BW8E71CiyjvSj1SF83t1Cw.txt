Very nice brunch option when Bongo Room is overcrowded (which is always). Ok bar, with nice clubbish ambiance That's why this place gets 4 stars. That said, the the dinner menu, while simple and certainly not bad, leaves a lot to be desired. This is one of those places where I ask myself, rather than eating here, am I better off getting a nice piece of swordfish from Whole Foods, marinating it for a day and grilling it myself (with a nice glass fo Two buck Chuck, of course) . When it comes to this place, the answer is "yes." Two stars for dinner.
