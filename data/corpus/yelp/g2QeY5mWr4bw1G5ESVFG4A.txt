been here a few times in the past couple years and always left thinking it was good but nothing spectacular. i went again last night for what we thought would be a cheap sushi dinner outside. somehow still ended up spending $100 for two of us, even though we just got some sashimi, a few sushi rolls and a drink each (glass of wine for me, saki for him). sushi was ok although not super fresh and i've definitely had better in the city. Â on the plus side i do like how they have such a nice big outdoor space, although not sure i'll be back.
