one of my favorite sushi restaurants in la. went here for one of my girlfriend's birthday dinner. the ambiance inside was PERFECT for the way we were dressed up. everything was literally half off. we ordered bscr, pink, albacore tempura rolls with uni, salmon, albacore, toro sushi on the side. 2 large hot sake and sapporo as well. the bill only came out to be exactly $100 for ordering that much for 4 girls. really good service as well. this place is definitely the place for girls night outs or a nice date. i will come back here again!!!
