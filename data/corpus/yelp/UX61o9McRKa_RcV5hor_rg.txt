Three stars.  Why?  Over rated.  Yes, the food is delicious, the meats top quality.  They have 15 different cuts of fire-roasted meats, but... it's just too much.  You have to come here on an empty stomach.  Empty meaning, haven't eaten in days.  You'll be sadly disappointed if you just, "want a little something to eat," then end up with the "how much was this?" bill.  It's pricey.  Even the lunch price is way too much.  WARNING:  Don't fill up on the salad bar or on bread no matter how good it is.  It's a fool's bet.  $44.50 for dinner, $29.50 for lunch.  Would you pay that much for bread and a trip to the salad bar?  No way.  It's always fun to bring your vegetarian friends here and just sit back and watch the show.   I went here for my birthday, glad I came.  No need to be back.  Once you've done it, you've done it.
