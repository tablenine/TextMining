Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I went to Hamburger Mary's in search of a burger fix.  While I saw some negative reviews here, I have pretty much cast them aside.  The burgers are perfectly priced for what you get.  A half pound burger with upwards of four toppings priced at $10 including damn good fries, is a deal.  This isn't McDonalds, people!  I also love the burger meat choice: chicken breast, turkey burger, black bean burger, buffalo, or 100% angus beef. . . I tried a few beers and they were well priced and tasty as well.  The best was the dessert.  We had the Mary Tyler s'Mores- which are table side make your own smores for 2!  And it was only $7!  It included 2 full Hershey bars,  6 packages of individual graham crackers, and 5 marshmallows each!  Totally worth it!. . As kitchy as the menu is, it is also incredibly fun.  I am definitely going back to try more burgers and some of the adult milkshakes.  If you love mixed drinks, this is the place to go!
