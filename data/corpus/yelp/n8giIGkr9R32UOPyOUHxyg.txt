Restaurant: Bite Cafe
Category: American (New)
Bite was a pleasant surprise on a hot summer day. We walked in 2 a crowd that was very artsy and lay back which was a nice change of pace from the usual big crowds or lines.. . I ordered the Bite bistro which was amazing! My son's ordered the buttermilk pancakes and the chorizo omelet, which they weren't to crazy bout ( it was a frittata and they had never had one before), Â but they still enjoyed it, what was even more surprising was that the tab was so cheap. . . Bite has to be the cheapest brunch I have ever had in wickerpark/bucktown area. I will def. be coming back and the service was Excellent! I gave my waitress a 22% tip....she deserved it!!. . This place is def. a hidden gem!!
