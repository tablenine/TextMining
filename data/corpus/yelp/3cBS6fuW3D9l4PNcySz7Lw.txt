Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
Let's be honest, guys, Mexican food in New York is pretty awful. When I first lived here as an intern, I spent a summer scouring for decent cheese enchiladas, and it was painful. It was actually really impressive how restaurant after restaurant so spectacularly bungled a pretty straightforward dish.. . Rosa Mexicano is definitely overpriced, at least when it comes to some of the simpler dishes, but at least whatever you get is bound to be decent. The service is generally good and the decor is great. . . They've also been accommodating when I've had special requests (for just cheese in my enchiladas or for a different sauce - Â I've tried the red sauce, tomatillo and mole sauce, all of which were great). For desert, I really like the tres leches cake. Drink-wise, I've yet to try the margaritas that everyone seems to like, but I did like the sangria. Drinks are really pricey, though, so I pretty much always skip them.. . I've been to this location the most, but also to the location on 1st Ave and the newer location near Union Square. They were pretty similar in terms of food and service, although I definitely prefer this location.
