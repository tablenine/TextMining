Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
2 Stars. . O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D!  most famous hotdogs in the country? forreal? . After about 30+ minutes in line, I ordered a Jalapeno Dog w/ grilled onions, my girl ordered the stretch chili dog w/ cheese, and we also got onion rings, fries, and a side of ranch.  . The chili cheese dog was just ok....barely.  fries were good, onion rings were below average and really oily (i understand they're fried....just more oily than i've seen before), and the ranch was pretty good.  They weren't stingy w/ it eather (for $0.85 they better not be). . My Jalapeno Dog came out w/ chili, mustard, and grilled onions.  I was starving, so I left it alone, but after looking at my receipt, it said "millennium dog".  So either they messed up my order and put chili on my jalap. dog, or they really messed up and gave me a mill. dog without the cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  Either way the hotdog was dry as hell........now don't get buthurt about this part, but "jalapeno" is a spanish word, I speak spanish and English pretty well, the lady that took my order spoke spanish and decent English....how did this order get confused? I don't want to say she was "slow", but if the bun fits....... I'm glad I came here and got this experience over with.  To tell you the truth, the hotdogs vendors you see after the club on the sidewalk blow this place away.  Don't waste your time or money. . oh, on a positive note, they have a recycling bin outside and there is a lot of clean seating in the back.
