In a word- Overpriced.. . I did take-out and am glad I did.  I can't see eating in here.  There is no ambiance.  There is one tiny room when you walk in, with the cash register at the far end.  Very brightly lit.  There is a second room with one table for two and a counter around the wall with chairs.  It's way too dark in there.  . . I tried the Port &amp; Stilton burger.  Great meat, medium-rare.  There are no other garnishes on the burger save for the cheese &amp; onions.   It could have more cheese, IMO.  I wasn't crazy about the buns.. . The onion rings were okay.  Slightly oily, but not too heavy on the batter.  You get four large-sized rings for $2.50.  Deal?  Or no deal?. . Finally, desserts by Cake Monkey.  Yes, a red velvet take on a Ring Ding is a great concept.  And it tasted delicious.  But $4 for a two-bite cake?  . . Yes, it was good, but I don't know if it's worth another visit.. . One tip: get there right at 7:00 pm on weekdays and you should be able to find parking on La Brea.  That's when the rush hour lane closes and you can pull up almost in front of the place.
