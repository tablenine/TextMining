Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Usually a place designed like the Geisha house with red walls, spectacular lighting fixtures, textured walls and amazing bars make you worry the owners may have spent too much money on the interior design and marketing that the food would suffer budget cuts.  I was wrong.  Although pricey, everything on the menu did not disappoint.  We ordered a bunch of rolls to share, but they were so good it made you a little greedy.  Remember, sharing is caring!!!  For a girl's night out dinner before hitting the dance floor, it was almost perfect.
