Tacos and Mexican at it's noisy best.  We did tend to over order the first time here -- tried to eat the menu, in fact.  Did n't need to do that.. The detraction here is that my cocktail was like alka-seltzer on the rocks.  I siwtched to beer and was happy after that.. Try the patio if you can but getting an outdoor seat while the patio is open but finding an table will be about as likely as winning the lottery. I forecast this being the restuarnt of the summer.
