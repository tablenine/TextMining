YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!! 2 of my friends were always going on and on about this place that they decided that they would personally bring me in for a trial run. It was the best fu**ing pastrami I have ever had. I had #19. Everything about it was perfect. It smelled like heaven, the bread was soft and tasty, the pastrami was warm and layered high. Geezus kriste! It was a mouthgasm in the making!!! It's so perfectly filling, too! No skimping here!! . . Don't know why we ordered fries! They were really good but we struggled to finish them. Â Also, since we were sharing fries among 3 people, our waiter, Sal, (who, by the way, was *awesome*) brought us each a little ketchup container. Very cool. Talk about attention to detail and great service. . . Speaking of cool, the place is super cool. Booths everywhere and total laid back atmosphere. All the waiters/waitresses/staff are nice and friendly. Worried about parking? They have a parking lot that they validate for, which is crucial to the busy little area it's in. Definitely worth every cent!!!
