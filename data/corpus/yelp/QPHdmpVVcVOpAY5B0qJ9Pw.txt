Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
45 min for a hotdog. That's what happened when I was nostalgic and wanted to have pinks. 45 min of waiting in line and it was gone in less than 10. The hotdogs are average at best and had I not been so greedy, I would have come to my senses and realized that I could have used that 45 min for more useful things.I still don't understand what the big fuss is about.
