Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Yet another long, lost love of mine from the days when I lived around the corner in Hollywood. I went back for a visit, because frankly, I haven't found such epic Thai food in NELA. Sure, the Elvis is great, but I really love the food. I always start with the coconut soup. A little goes a long way. Its pretty decedent. The Pad Thai is topped with all the goodies that you'd expect ... they don't' skimp on anything. The seafood platter is fresh and cooked just right, and the staff uses walkies to communicate to the kitchen ... oh so hi-tech! Did I mention its a bargain? And you'll have lunch for the next day.. . As everyone has mentioned - there's tons of seating, however, it does get packed. My favorite night to go is Wednesdays: Thai Elvis is there, and the dinner crowd is eclectic!. . I wish there was more of a wine/beer selection... however, the Singh Ha Light goes rather well with the dishes. . . Take your tourist friends!
