I love me some steak! I am fortunate enough to say that I have dined at some fantastic steak houses but this one seemed average. Â The options were the Chop House, Smith's, Mortons, and Gibsons. Looks like I will have fly back and try the Chop House (I had great service at Mortons in New Orleans &amp; MIA, my mouth waters for a Smith's filet with gorganzola.). . Everyone was drooling over this place so we tried it. It wasn't bad food or service but nothing to stand out. Honestly, I forgot the name and it has been driving me crazy. Thanks yelp.lol
