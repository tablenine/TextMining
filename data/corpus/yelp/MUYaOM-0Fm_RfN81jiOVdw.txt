Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I used to live a few blocks away on Culver, and would pretty much go here several times a week on the way home from college, and then eventually it become on the way home from work. I had several different roomates at the time who were just as addicted.. . I can't remember a time when there wasn't at least two empty Tito's boxes stacked next to the trash can in the kitchen. The deal was that if you ordered 4 or more items, they'd give you a large cardboard box for them and fill it up with chips. The boxes were such that they didn't even fit in our trash bin - and being young guys, taking out the trash wasn't a high priority.. . Get the tacos obviously. The enchiladas and tamales are pretty tasty too. Be sure to ask for the small green hot salsa. You basically mix it into the larger red mild salsa container... sooo good!. . I still remember the time I tried to warm up a leftover Tito's taco in my toaster oven. BAD IDEA! These tacos are greasy! The taco oil set off a small fire which set off the fire alarm, and caused all the tenants in our building to evacuate their apts. I still haven't gotten a replacement toaster oven :(
