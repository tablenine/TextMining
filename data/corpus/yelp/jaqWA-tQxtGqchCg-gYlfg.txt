Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Admittedly I haven't eaten at a ton of other Korean BBQ restaurants in the city, but I went here the other night and it was fantastic.. . Super clean restaurant (kind of important) , friendly staff even if they couldn't tell me and my other white friend what we were eating.  All of the side dishes were great (they can kind of be an afterthought at some places), all of which were refilled every time we got more than halfway through one.. . Prices are totally reasonable - we chose a combo that was $39.95 for a bunch of meat (including the pork belly, which was awesome) AND a small bottle of soju.  Plenty of food for two hungry Jews.  Would go back in a second..
