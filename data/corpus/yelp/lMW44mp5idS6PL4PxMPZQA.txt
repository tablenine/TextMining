holy meat beatdown batman!  the steaks were delish, the service was pretty decent.  even the little sides (mashed potatoes, cheese bread, polenta, plantains) were kickass.  we ordered a special plate of beans and some rice -- wicked awesome.  washed it all down with a yummy 2004 napa cabernet sauvignon.  and creamy papaya dessert was indeed soothing after all that protein.  yeah it's expensive, but not ridiculous expensive, and it's ALL you can eat!
