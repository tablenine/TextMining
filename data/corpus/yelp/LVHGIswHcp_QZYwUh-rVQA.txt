Restaurant: Rosa&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
This was the first time I had NY-style pizza. . I was so nervous the first time I ordered. . What if they couldn't hear me through the chatter of the customers?. What if I got kicked out Soup Nazi style?. No worries. . So greasy and delicious. . Each bite was a mouthful of artery-clogging heaven. . Don't worry if the line is out the door or down the stairs, it goes pretty fast.. . FYI - The alley/street Rosa's is located on used to be really seedy. The woman who I thought might be Rosa told me there used to be hookers and drug user types all around. This was many years ago.
