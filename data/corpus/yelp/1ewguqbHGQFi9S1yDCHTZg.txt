Restaurant: Duck Walk

I have tried Duck Walk twice, just in case my first horrible experience was a fluke.  This place is awful!  The first time we had some of the worst service and my crab rangoon was FROZEN on the inside.  On our second visit, my husbands beef and broccoli was disgusting!  The beef was mealy and the veggies tasted almost rotten.  We left hungry and picked up a frozen pizza at Walgreen's.  I keep getting their menus in my mailbox and I immediately put them where their food belongs, in the trash.
