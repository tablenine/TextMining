This is going to be my 5th pizza review or something. . . No, unlike my friend here, I do not have a crush on any waitresses here but I will say, if it wasn't for the service, I'd have only given this place 3 stars. The pizza is ok...sorry, but it may be my elitist Bucktown self, I am a die hard Piece fan I guess. Not enough cheese on the pizza for me...and the sausage is good, I just wish there was more! There are no other appetizers....and I was starving...but the have $3 PBR's...which my cheap self enjoyed. The service is attentive and friendly, so kudos to them. :) I don't know if I'll be back since I don't make it out to the West-ish Loop area much....but it's worth a trip if a friend wants to go.
