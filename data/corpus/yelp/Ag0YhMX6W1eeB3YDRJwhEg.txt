Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
I came to Ciudad for several reasons a few weeks ago: 1. to take advantage of the dineLA dinner special 2. its close proximity to the Taper theater ( saw "Parade" which was amazing BTW) 3. and for the obvious deliciousness that Mary Sue and Susan always bring to the table. Ciudad did not disappoint! The ceviche, the fish special, the beet salad, and the watermelon salad were all hits. The paella was a little disappointing as were the desserts, but the overall service, ambiance, and solid entrees made it worthy of 4 stars. I might not be back for their full price menu, but before a show downtown, I might come in for happy hour and their free shuttle service to the theaters.
