I like breakfast. I like french toast. I like to eat at places early. I like places that don't have too many kids. I like Square One.. . We used to go here every weekend when it first opened, now its been invaded by the "Wiggels" age group.  I liked it better when it was a post AA hangout, it had a cooler vibe to it. . . Anyhow, the brioche french toast with the burbon pecan topping and vanilla enhanced whipped cream is divine (please put rasberrys back as an additional topping).  The oolong tea perfect. The bacon, mmmmmmm bacon, so thick you could write a commandment or two on it. Organic fruit and in nifty combinations!. . Now that they have the fly problem under control, they need to work on the indoor table arrangement, I feel the need to consult as a space planner cause they could squeeze in comfortable banquet seating across the walls and have more tables. Maybe add some acoustical sound dampening elements, it's noisy as hell and now with the kids...sheesh, Calgon take me away!!!!. . But, if you go early enough, like 9am, then it's great. Really....
