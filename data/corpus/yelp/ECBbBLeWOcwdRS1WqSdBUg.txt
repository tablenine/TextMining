When I heard that Johnny Depp liked this place, I wanted to check it out. I am from out of town and indeed I was impressed. I ordered the Chicago cut, fries, asparagus. Everything was very impressive and the waiter made me feel at home. The steak was cooked properly and I really couldn't have asked for anything else. I was even impressed when I went to the bathroom and they had Michael Jackson playing!
