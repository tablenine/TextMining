The best $7 I've spent on food in a long time.  I got the hen bowl and thought it was delicious.  I can see how it's not everyone's cup of tea but if you like spicy food and Korean food, you should enjoy it.  The garlic fries were also good.  The flavors are very intense which is why I like it.  Small setting.
