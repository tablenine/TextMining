Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Lou Malnati's (INSERT GREATER THAN SIGN HERE) Giordano's....don't even think about Uno's. . . I got the Deluxe Individual, which was PERFECTly sized for me and I am stuffed! (Although if you are a boy, I would suggest getting the Small) The sausage was the best part of the pizza. I couldn't believe how delicious the Italian sausage tasted and green peppers, mushrooms, and onions were so incredibly fresh! There were toppings a plenty..and just the perfect amount of cheese! It wasn't gooopy at all like other Chicago deep dish pizzas...it was perfection! I have died and gone to pizza heaven!!! This was completely amazing. . . PLUS....$6.85 for an individual pizza!! you can't beat that! :) . . Wash it down with a glass of Chicago's Goose Island beer, and you'll have the most delicious pizza experience in your entire life! :)
