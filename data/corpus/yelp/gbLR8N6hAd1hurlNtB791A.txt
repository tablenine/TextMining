I have been to Chicago a few times but this is the first time I have been to this restaurant.  I was told this place has wonderful cinnamon roles, the best ever.  . . Overall Opinion?  Decent food.  Cinnamon roles were alright - not bad - just alright.  I thought service was awkward, but in their defense they were quite busy.  The food was alright, again, not bad just alright.  . . I would give them another try - they certainly are popular.  This tells me that my "meh" was me (hence another visit) or there just aren't that many decent breakfast places in Chicago.
