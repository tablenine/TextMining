Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Quality of meat is very average.. . Service is not the best ONLY when you start asking for more side dishes or meat, the waitresses would look at you with a frustrated look as in "haven't you had enough already?". . Overall, the price is cheap.  Went for a bday dinner for 12 and we only spent about $25.. . Free valet service was a bonus.. . Lots of young people.  Also what is up with the techno music blaring?  Felt like I was at a Korean club or Tokyo Delvs without the crazy dancers.
