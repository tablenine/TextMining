Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I've gone here on many occasions and every time with great friends.. . The food is outstanding, although I've never had to ever order any food because my korean speaking friends have always taken care of it :).  No need to argue with those who are handling your food order, right.  For the most part, we've had the beef galbi and lots of soju (which may or may not have impaired judgment slightly).  The orders came with an assortment of your typical pickled side dishes, rice and kimchi.. . The service is alway prompt with the flick of a very handy button at your table.  Within seconds there will be someone there refilling your water glass or checking on you.. . Heed my warning...the place can become very smokey at times with all the cooking going on.  The ventilation here isn't the greatest, which really is my only negative.. . The parking is valet for a couple bucks and the cars are kept very close, so the service is prompt.
