Used to be the entire Maki menu was 1/2 price on the weekends.  Now they have a special 1/2 maki menu, and some of their best rolls are no longer included in the deal.. . I used to be able to try different rolls every time I visited TANK.  Now I stick to the same few affordable standards.. . On my most recent visit, my girlfriend and I were meeting two friends.  We arrived before them, and we were told to go sit at the bar until our friends arrived.  . . I understand hosts do this so that patrons don't tie up tables while they wait for delinquent friends.  But there were only a couple other people there.  It was obnoxious.. . I don't understand why anyone would go here when it's not 1/2 off.  The prices at KAZE are comparable but the experience is better in nearly every way.
