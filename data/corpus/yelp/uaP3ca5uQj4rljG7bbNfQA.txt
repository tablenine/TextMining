So-So. Best part was the Sangria. . . Must try: . Steamed Mussels . Empanadas. Calamari - even then... nothing spectacular . . Avoid: . Lamb sausages - 12.00 and you get 4 tiny pieces. I could eat all 4 and it wouldn't make a dent filling my semi-small stomach. . Shrimp Ceviche - Lentils were great, enough said. . . The rest of the dishes were just alright, not worth the 10-15 per dish. Â I left semi-full, and we ordered 10-12 dishes, and spent 200 dollars. . . Also, as it was NYE, we tried to access the bar and they charged everyone 10 dollars. And they told us it was a discounted price?? . . I don't think I'll be going back ...
