This is one of my favorite restaurants EVER!!! Where can you go to get the most juiciest, tenderest and oh-so-tasty food? I seriously can't get enough of this place. It's bad enough had a location far away from me in Hollywood then came to realize they had one closer to me in Studio City. Can you say regular? Yep thats me! :). . The skirt steaks and lemon chicken are fantastic! The mashed potatoes are amazing. Pasta is just as good. I like the Canelones stuffed with ricotta cheese! I love cheese!! Â They have a great selection of wines though I'm now a fan of their sangria. You must save room for dessert. They make this caramel, bananas crepe. This place truly is mouth watering.. . Now if you'll excuse me I need to wipe the drool off my mouth.
