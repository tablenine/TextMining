I always enjoy the food here (falafel, chicken kabobs, hummus), but the service is always lacking.  I took some friends here the other night and they were immediately impressed with the beauty of the exposed brick dining room, and the food was good as always.  We were all disappointed in getting one drink refill in the hour and a half we were there.
