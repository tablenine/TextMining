I guess I disagree with everyone else -- except for the excellent eggplant marinated in heaven, I thought everything was mediocre.  The space is pretty cool, with lots of large, warmly lit rooms that gives it the feel of some sort of middle eastern bazaar cum midtown restaurant.  It was really loud, although just short of annoying.  The staff that work there are actor/model types who are extremely friendly and helpful.  The kitchen is where it fell short for me and my friend.  We ordered hummus (better at Mamoun's), octopus (oily and bland -- and I loves me some octopus), crisply calamari (also bland), that heavenly eggplant, and some fairly good cheese rolls (how can you go wrong with deep fried cheese?).  We just stopped after that, because nothing seemed to have real flavor -- like a Lebanese version of the Olive Garden (minus the bottomless pasta bowl).  We couldn't even get a good buzz on because we didn't like the wine either.   On the plus side, we got out of there for $85 including tax, tip and wine -- not hard to do in NY, but also not really worth it.  I really liked the room and the waitstaff seemed just great, but I won't go back.
