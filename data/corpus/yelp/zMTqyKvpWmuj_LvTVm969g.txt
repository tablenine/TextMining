Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
i had some roast duck wonton noodle soup yesterday for lunch and good god i miss you NY Noodle Town. why do you have to be 3000 miles away. people think i'm weird when i talk about the amazing flavorful broth of Â your noodle soups in 3rd person, why, because no other noodle shop has it. i also miss your bbq overrice dishes and your creamy congees with crispy dough. while you may not be the best in all that you serve, you are one of the many reasons why NY is the best when it comes to chinese food in america.
