Better burgers, queerer service? I think not! My bj burger lived up to its name, quite delicious and a real mouthful. The kids were welcomed with open arms, and their own tiny version of our burgers rather than the gloppy plates of kid goo that most restaurants supply their wee patrons. The hubby was most impressed with the super powered hand dryer.. . I'm a huge fan of camp as well as tasty burgers, the drinks were fine but keep me from giving the place their 5th star.
