i think i went on an off day. again.. . the risotto, penne con pollo, and penne something (w sundried tomatoes) were all salty.. . mine, of course, being the saltiest.. . the waiter was unattentive. . . the food was too salty. we couldnt finish our dishes. but he didn't even ask what was wrong. didn't he notice that all our plates were more than half full and we stopped eating?  he came by to refill our water glasses. . . and then the busser just took away our plates.
