Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
It's pretty loud and bustling - the former retail space isn't ideal for a conversation-focused eatery, but it's such a sensory delight, that conversation will probably be focused on the restaurant's going-ons: their menu, waiters, chefs, other diners, the prepared-food section.   The pizza was thin-crusted and chewily delicious.  Friggin Best Butter for the complimentary french-bread I've ever had - sweet and fancy.  While awaiting a table, I and my group ogled at the tart-case and the tart-handler was so dear and offered us a free tart!  We chose the pear, which was fantastic - rich buttery crust, not too-cloyingly-sweet pear section.   They are selling a $40 bag of Jasmine pearl tea in the buy-nibblies section, which is ridiculous, but the dining menu is modestly-priced and the portions are large.  Not clownishly large, but big enough!   Delightful.  Very New Yorkey feeling.
