Category: Seafood
Came here on a Sunday around 5pm and the wait was not bad at all for two people. Our wait was probably around 5 minutes. We sat across a flat screen tv that was showing an Olympic exhibition basketball game. Of course, my hubby was happy about that. We ordered 2 lbs of shrimp, one bag with shabang sauce and the other drenched in garlic butter sauce. I must admit I liked the garlic butter sauce better. We also ordered some corn boiled in shabang sauce. Shabang consists of all their sauces combined. I believe its a mixture of Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Butter?!? I think I'm missing one more seasoning, but basically it was greasy and flavorful. We didn't bother with the crawfish because there is so little meat, but maybe next time we'll try some lobsters and crabs. . . I would give it 5 stars but it's not too healthy eating too much of this stuff, and do they really boil it in the plastic bag it comes in!?! If so, your seafood and corn might be chemically contaminated. =P
