Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
The little door is not cheap, but that's not why you came here with your date.  You came here to get a little and sure enough... you will.  The food is very good, but not spectacular, the wine prices are a little high, and the service is not up to the level of the menu or ambiance, but the setting is amazing.   This may be one of the most romantic restaurants in all of LA so you will put up with the other failings because it sets the mood
