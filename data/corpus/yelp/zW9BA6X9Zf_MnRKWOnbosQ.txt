Mark me down as a fan of gentrification!  The Main Street strip in Culver City turned into a mecca for hipsters while I wasn't looking and Fraiche felt like the area's crown jewel.. . I had dinner here with my girlfriend and two close friends a few Fridays ago and we had an awesome time.  Half of our party was late and the hostesses were very polite and accommodating of our blown reservation.  My friend (fellow Yelper, Robot Mikey L) and I chilled out at the bar while we waited for the others and really enjoyed the huge doors that opened up to the outdoor eating area.. . Once the second half of our party finally arrived, we were seated within ten minutes at a great table in the corner of the patio.  Our waiter quickly showed up and took great care of us for the rest of the night.. . And the food.  Ohmigod the food.  Delicious, savory, wonderful, amazing, mmmm...  . . My girlfriend and I shared the Speck &amp; Figs and Caprese Salad for our appetizers (wonderful) and I had the Steak Frites for my entree (melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious!).  Dessert was a Chocolate Strawberry Ganache Tart so good that I was practically begging for seconds.. . The thing that impressed me most was that each course was consistently great.  I usually expect at least one course at any restaurant to be a little bit off but every single bite at Fraiche was delicious.. . Yes, it's pricey.  But considering the outstanding quality of the food, decor, and staff, Fraiche felt like an excellent value overall.  Plus, we saw Yeardley Smith (voice of Lisa Simpson) at the restaurant that night.  I cannot wait to go back to Fraiche!. . P.S.  Parking at the garage around the corner is super cheap.  The first hour or two are free and then it's only a dollar/hour after that.
