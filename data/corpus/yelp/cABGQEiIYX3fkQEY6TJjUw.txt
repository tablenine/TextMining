Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Gets rated high because of the overall experience.  Lines are long, and as such, patrons get even more hungry by the time they get served.. . The sausages themselves are not anything to write about, though I must say that they are a bit unique in that the skin sort of has a "pop" to it that most other franks don't.  But I guess most people don't come here because their sausages are spectacular, but the concoctions they end up in are definitely special.. . This was my 4th trip to the joint, and we had a chili-cheese dog, a jalapeno dog, and a reuben dog.  For sides, we had their special chili-cheese fries - probably one of the best I've had for the price.. . Unlike joints like Top Dog which are found in Northern California, Pinks focuses on a variety of value-added toppings offered at what I consider to be very reasonable prices.  Hot dog's aren't supposed to be expensive, and Pink's piles on the goodies like guacamole, chili, cheese, jalapenos, bacon, pastrami, sauerkraut (list goes on) for less than $5.  . . As much as I love a good hot dog and Pink's, I could probably only eat it at most once or twice a year or my arteries will explode.
