It's all a hype. So overrated. . . I don't get it? The tacos weren't even that good. It was way too salty for my taste buds. . . I've had my first Kogi experience at Alibi in Venice where my Kogi tacos actually came out of a kitchen. Maybe the reason why the food wasn't that good was because I didn't have to chase the taco truck and wait in line starving for two hours. I was extremely disappointed after my first bite. I like my tacos Mexican.. . It was too good to be true.
