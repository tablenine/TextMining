Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Due to the popularity of Shabu Shabu House, I had to camp outside the restaurant to ensure that my party of five large would make the first lunch seating.  When the restaurant opened, we were rushed inside where our raw meat and veggies were already waiting for us.  We each had our own individual pot, so I did not have to worry about my Aunt "accidentally" taking my meat.  Service was very prompt, mainly because they wanted as much turnaround as possible.  I felt too rushed to enjoy my meal.  In fact, I was stripped of my noodles before I could finish them.  I would only recommend Shabu Shabu House if you are there to get your grub on quickly.
