Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Just writing this makes me crave a chili cheese dog with chili cheese fries and a chili cheese burger  and a root beer!. . Yes, the lines are long but think of the positive people, FREE PARKING.  In Hollywood.  For The WIN.. . The food is great, you aren't going to have an epiphany or anything but it's GOOD.  And it's cheap.  I can get all that for less that 12 bucks.  That's a steal.  And yes, the other major gripe, THE LINE.  While I have been here when the line is only a 15 minute wait, I have waited an hour.  And it was worth it.  Besides, if you are with good friends, it really isn't that long.. . I have had many great memories with my old work crew when we would be leaving the store and after deciding we were starving, head onto the 5 to the 101 to get some deliciousness.  I also love that they have delicious veggie dogs for my vegetarian friend, Ocho.  I also love that after all of us have frequented this place many nights, we even know one of the guys and he always makes our order exactly how we want it.. . I love Pink's!
