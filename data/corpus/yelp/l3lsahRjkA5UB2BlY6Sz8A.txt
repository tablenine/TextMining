Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
If you have a craving for lobster then Newport is the place to go.  They make the best lobster around and it is well worth the price that you pay for it.  Practically everyone goes there for the lobster, plus now they have the snow crab.  The restaurant is chinese/vietnamese style, family dinner style.  The decor of the restaurant is pretty good considering it is a chinese restaurant and the place is usually crowded on friday nights and weekends, I'm talking about wait time of at least 1hour.  They do not take reservations, so it would be wise to arrive early to get a table of get on the waitlist.  I have been there 3-4 times and will probably go there more often for the lobster.
