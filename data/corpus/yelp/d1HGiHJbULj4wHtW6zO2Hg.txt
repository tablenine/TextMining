Very, very good Middle Eastern food!. . I went here with friends last week, and each of us enjoyed everything.  The meats were tender and juicy, and the dill rice and other sides were great.  The apps from the falafel to hummus were fresh and tasty, and the pita was soft and perfect.. . The salad bar was alright, but coming with the dinner for free was excellent.  The only thing was that I ordered falafel as an app, and they had them at the salad bar too.  Kind of a waste!. . If you are looking for high quality Middle Eastern eats, give this a shot.  As a bonus, the night we went had 1/2 price bottles of wine.  Check for specials!
