The dishes are as authentic as it get, you need to know what to order, so try stick to the traditional Taiwanese street food (sausages, squid or pork meat noodle soup, fried chicken rolls, etc), and save some room for the chopped ice treats; quick and friendly service, the line often gets long during lunch/dinner time.
