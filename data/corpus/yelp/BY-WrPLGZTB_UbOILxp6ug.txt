Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
I always neglect to review Reza's, not sure why since it's earned 5 stars from me. . . I cant comment on the inside dining experience since Ive always had delivery when I worked about a few blocks away. I've always ordered the lamb chops and rice w/ pita bread. Let me say DELICIOUS!!! I look forward to sitting inside the restaurant one day...if I can find a date or a friend willing to try mediteranean food. lol.
