Here is the bottom line about Pink's. They have been doing it since forever and they have long lines still in 2006. Do you really need a review to find out if it's any good? When you bite into the dog, it snaps, like it's under pressure. I LOVE THAT! They are sloppy, dripping with greasy chili and that's why you go there. If I were strapped to an electric chair and had a last meal request, Pink's just might be on the list of contenders.. . About in 2004, I was in one of the infamous long lines waiting for my turn when this older kind of limping guy was pleading with everyone in line to let him in front. See, he didn't want to wait because he had a severe heart condition. I told the guy, if he wanted to do himself in, why not just jump off the roof instead of sucking down a chilidog. I got the line laughing and we all let the guy get in front. He wasted no time shoving it in his face and was gone before I even got my order in. Every time I go back, I think of that old guy and wonder if it's the great pleasure of a Pink's dog that is his own personal antidote to death. . . Go Pink's! More sauerkraut please!!
