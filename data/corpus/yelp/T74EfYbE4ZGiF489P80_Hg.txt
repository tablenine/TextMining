I'd like to say this place lived up to the hype, but I really never heard of it before my visit.  I know, I grew up in the area, but there's only so many food places to know of in LA!  Anyways, this place seemed very, very popular.  It was packed on a Friday during lunchtime, as my hosts forewarned.  Though the meals were large portioned and satisfying, it wasn't a memorable event.  A five star yelped place must be a place I yearn to return to.  I had the cuban sandwich, some papas rellenos, and some desserts.  The cuban sandwich was just satisfactory, but the papas and the desserts were fantastic.  Still, I would only stop by if I was in the area, so I have to give this place a solid 4.  If you live/work/frequent the neighborhood, be sure to try it out and form your own opinions!
