Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The Apple Pan is a great place to get truly simple, totally delicious food.  The interior looks like a cute 1950s diner, with a U-shaped counter that surrounds the grill (bonus: check out the seriously old fashioned cash registers!).  The menu only has a few items on it, but trust me, you couldn't really ask for more.  The hickory burger (with cheese) is to die for, and their homemade pie, while a little pricey, is so, so good.  No frills, nothing off the wall, just consistently great food and ridiculously fast service.  If you're not a red meat eater, try the tuna sandwich--takes ordinary tuna salad to a new level.. . Even though seating seems hectic, there are always seats opening up (I've even pulled off 7 people sitting in a row, so it's definitely possible!).  Order all your food at once (including pie), and don't be put off by the gruff service.  Parking is sort of a hassle, but if you're willing to walk there are usually spots a few blocks up or down Pico.
