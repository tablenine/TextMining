Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Decided to check this place out today for dinner since I got their 50 dollar groupon hehe.... . Well we got there at 5:45 and the valet parking didn't start till 6:30 so we parked the car in their parking lot ourselves..the hostess said it was okay but they still charge you 4.50 for parking the car yourself. -_- . . The place has a small outdoor and indoor seating area...about 10 small tables inside and 9-10 tables on the patio. The restaurant decor was simply classy mirrors on all the walls. Our waiter was a tall nice looking guy....but he wasn't all that friendly to us but it seem like he knew a lot of the customers that were there. . . For the appetizer we had ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp...it came with three types of sauce....Wasabi Aioli, Thai sweet and sour and Spicy Aioli--which I like the best. For entree, I ordered the Cumin Spiced Pork Chop served with White Truffle Oil and Mushroom Mac N Cheese and Sugar Snap Peas.....the pork chop was very thick, kinda of rough but flavorful. The white truffle oil and mushroom mac was my favorite...the truffle oil gives it a unique taste....the sugar snap peas are kinda bland and undercooked a little. My boyfriend ordered the Fennel Seed Crusted Seared Ahi Tuna with a Crispy Risotto Cake.....the ahi tuna was very soft and went well with the sweet and spicy sauce....and the risotto cake was okay. . . Overall the restaurant has a nice ambiance, the food was alright...the service was okay. I wasn't very impressed but I wasn't dissatisfied either.
