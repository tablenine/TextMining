I do not get why this place gets such good reviews. I highly recommend avoiding the Streeterville location b/c it is overpriced for just average Japanese food. It is Japanese food made for the American palate and it is a shame b/c Japanese cusine can be so much more and amazing. If you want crazy dragon rolls, sure...maybe it is for you. However, sorry to bust the bubble but Japanese people do not eat all those fancy rolls that we have...it is an American invention just like the Chinese fortune cookie (which is actually creation from a Japanese American in SF). And btw, the place is in a basement. If you are willing to pay $50/person for basement dragon rolls, bon appetit.
