This place is super cute.  It's tiny inside but very "cozy".  The guy &amp; girl that helped us were awesome and knew the menu really well.  We had the guajirito (SP?) which was a bread-less sandwich make with plantains as the bread instead, tofu, and some pepper.  It wasn't AS flavorful as I would have liked (probably because it was made with tofu that didn't seem marinated) but some hot sauce helped.  I will be back to enjoy the food and outdoor seating again! Looking forward to a milkshake the next time. :)
