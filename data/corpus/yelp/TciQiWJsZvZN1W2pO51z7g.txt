My boyfriend treated me for my birthday a year ago. We were super excited due to the great reviews on yelp.  . . We ordered everything that was suggested, such as the bone in ribeye and the mac and cheese.  . . The ribeye was dry and thick.  I hated it.  We could only eat .00002% of the steak due to the lack of taste.. . The lobster mac and cheese was okay, but i thought it was too oily.
