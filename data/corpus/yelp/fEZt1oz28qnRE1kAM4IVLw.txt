I must say, Sola wasn't as fantastic as I'd hoped. We went earlier this month for my birthday dinner, and while it was very good it wasn't the 5-star experience I had been expecting. Though the Dale sighting was fun, no matter how disappointed I was that my friends had no idea who he was. . . We were about 20 minutes late for our reservation, because the weather was miserable that night. But we were seated right away, much to my surprise. The atmosphere was nice, though I do think that they tried to cram a few too many tables in the space. We might as well have been at the same table as our neighbors, as we eyed each others' food and my table cautiously eavesdropped on their awkward date. . . Appetizers and desserts were excellent. Entrees were well done, but my male friends were a little concerned about their size (or lack thereof). By the time we had wrapped up dessert, we were cutting it close to the time that we were supposed to be elsewhere, so I asked the waiter to bring the check after we put in our dessert order. He didn't, so we asked again as we were finishing our desserts and it took at least another 15 minutes. We had let him know at the beginning of the meal that we had somewhere to be, so his lack of promptness was a little disappointing. But otherwise he was fun, knowledgeable and paid us just the right amount of attention.. . I've heard from others that the best time to eat at Sola is in March/April, so I'll definitely give it another try then!
