Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I think this place is a bit overrated. . . The helpings are plentiful, and it's real cute with what they do to the Caesar salads and all, but I've had better prime rib elsewhere.. . And since this place is supposed to be famous for their prime rib, that has to be a major point deduction, I'm sorry.. . I do have to give it props for at least looking the part, in terms of decor and all.
