Adding to the thousands of review.. . Feels like an old ramen joint in the streets of Japan.  They have very old signs, ads and other miscellaneous stuff as decorations.  How can you miss the old school TV by the entrance?! It's still working!!  :D. . Another tonkotsu broth ramen place!!  I like the noodles at Shinsengumi (Gardena) better but the runny egg and the fatty chashu here are hard to beat.  I usually order it with kotteri sauce (which is... MORE PORK FAT!!).. . Other thing I would order is the coarse kurobuta sausage... wonderful!
