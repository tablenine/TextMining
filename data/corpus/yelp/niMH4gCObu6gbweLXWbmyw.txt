Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
The new Pops is a big change from the old Pops.  I loved the neighborhood charm of the old Pops, and had gone to listen to jazz a few times - the atmosphere was classy and romantic.  Star Bar was a nice place to go with the girls and good food, but never a "go to" place.  The new Pops.  This is the place to be.  It lost its charm atmosphere, but is now hipper/trendy atmosphere and great place to go for happy hour, dinner, or post-dinner drinks.  However, the jazz bar downstairs lost all of its elegant atmosphere in the move unfortunately.  But, hey , it is a business and they probably get a lot more traffic now that they are downtown.. . As a vegetarian, I was very disappointed with their food options.  Although classy, despite their 3 pages of food, there is not one vegetarian option!  I absolutely love cheese, so a flight of cheese is a good option, but why can't they have one or two appetizers that are vegetarian? . . So, the lack of food options for vegetarian will restrict my visits to a happy hour or post-dinner local vs. staying for a few hours for dinner and drinks.
