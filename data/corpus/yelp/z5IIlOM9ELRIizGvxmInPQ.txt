Delicious.  The Kogi sliders were an unexpected treat.  (only two to an order though). The beef tacos were quite tasty.  . . Only drawback is the line.  I experienced the truck at The Brig on a Saturday afternoon.  It was still over an hour wait.  There aren't too many times when I am willing to wait that long for food as I get hungry, but when I am, Kogi goes on the list.
