Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Well, I've never eaten a fish taco in Ensenada - but it seems they've earned the title accordingly, and definitely have my vote.. . Cheap fish tacos that are quickly made, and 100% delicious.. . Great salsa bar that is fresh, spicy, and full of selection.. . Buy a beer at the corner mart, come here, and have the best seven dollar meal of your life (including beer)...
