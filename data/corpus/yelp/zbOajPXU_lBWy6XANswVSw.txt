Fred 62 used to be one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat.  Their Thai Salad is incredible and I've never had a better plate of french fries.  The staff is "usually" friendly but the place is often too crowded and it's near impossible to get a table during peak hours. It's better than Meh but not a YAY.
