I never really thought I would find salad to be soo good. I'm really not a salad guy at all, but their free range chicken with the baby spinach salad is insanely good. They also have the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten in my life (I don't normally care for mashed potatoes either) I used to go here every other day or so when I worked in Culver City - one word of warning, if you are going during the lunch hour order ahead and get it as takeout.
