This is still my favorite casual breakfast place even though I saw something there unneededly nasty today! The bus boy empties ashtrays into the water glasses ! WHY!!?? I couldn't believe it!!!!!!! I know glasses get washed but stilllllll... I was dissapointed to see a soggy mound of cigarette butts and garbage in the glasses people drink out off.
