Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Anything with this many reviews on yelp is obviously a LA classic, so as a visiting Elite, it made it a "must-see" for me!. . Well-described in the 1600+ posts before me.  Cute names for a lot of their dogs like Three Dog Night, the Martha Stewart, etc... Tons of varieties including the classic chili dog as well as more massive 10" gods, jalepeno dogs, and funky toppings like guacamole.. . Prices are inexpensive (starts at $3.30 per hot dog) and great place to stop by for lunch or snack.  It was fun and hubby and I came a bit before the lunch rush so we waited only about 15 mins.. . A-OK for me simply because it's classic and it's been around 70 years.  I honestly wouldn't wait 2 hours but then again, I'm not really a hot dog person.  (These taste pretty similar to other hot dogs I've eaten, just with funkier toppings - we had the turkey and jalapeno dogs and onion rings).
