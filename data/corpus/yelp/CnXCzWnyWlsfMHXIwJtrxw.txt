I really don't think that 3 $$$ describes the pricing acurately!  This is the just about the most that I've ever spent on a meal.  7 people (3 couples + 1 child) bill was over $1,000 for dinner!  Well, sure we may have gotten alittle carried away for a special occassion... but still, that's alot of snaps to throw down for one meal!  The food was good, but alittle disappointing.  Ambiance is nice and what you would expect from a place like this.  The property is spectacular with the well manicured Japanese gardens and a great view of the LA from the Hollywood Hill.  Service was excellent with a very attentive wait staff.  . . I don't mind spending the money warranted by a great meal... this was not one of them.  I probably won't be returning, even if it's on someone else's dime.  Some of the other reviews suggest Yamashiro for a date place, I would have to agree.  However, I would suggest taking your date to Pink's for dinner and then take the climb up the hill for dessert at Yamashiro!  Try the Souffle or the Creme Brule Trio.
