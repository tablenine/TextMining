The soba noodles are 5 stars, but the dumplings were disappointing. This place has a great neighborhood feel and the noodle bowls come in hearty delicious portions. My party ordered all types of noodles, and we all claimed ours was the best. . The soba noodles come with scallops, mushrooms, fish cake balls ( which are awesome). It was perfect for a snowy Chicago night. . The squash and bacon dumplings are served with a citrus sauce that tasted like Pledge. Â I love squash and I love bacon, but this combination was revolting. . Despite that one dish, the food was great.
