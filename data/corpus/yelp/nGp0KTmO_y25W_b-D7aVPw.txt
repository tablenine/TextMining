SO THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BYZANTINE LATINO QUARTER..... . I've driven by for years, but have never really explored.  Papa Cristo's was great although drink that tap water at your own risk.  For all you carb-haters, you can get 1/2 pound of mouth-watering gyro meat for about $6.  The only thing I didn't care for was the spanakopita...the spinach tasted like it was previously frozen.  Otherwise, I'll definitely be back.
