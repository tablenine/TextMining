Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
The service here is so great, and the atmosphere is outstanding.. . The food was good, not the best Italian in the city, but very good if you want a nice meal in the Loop. . . Once I had lasagna here, about 5 years ago. I broke out in hives about an hour later and had to have an antihistamine injection in the hospital emergency room. I don't blame Italian village - it was probably some wheat in the pasta that I was allergic to. This has only happened once in my life, and I would love to know what caused it. Interested to hear if anyone else has experienced this. But I still love Italian village as a Loop dinner eatery.
