Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
My family "popped" into town from Texas.  Since they were coming in from the Millennium Park train station, I found this tiny Giordano's on Yelp!  Who knew that this tiny location even existed?  . . The hostess was super accommodating to our group that grew in size and was then 20 minutes late.  Our pizzas took awhile but that is deep dish for ya.  I wish that they would have come around to ask us about dessert a bit earlier: I always make my nieces and nephew get some delish cheesecake while they are in town.  When they brought it out, I had to ask for the check immediately so that they wouldn't miss their train.. . I would definitely come back!
