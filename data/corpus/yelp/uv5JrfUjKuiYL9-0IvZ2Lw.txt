Let me first begin by saying that I'd give 'em 3 and a half stars, but since I don't hv that option, I've given them 4 stars. I liked the concept of custom built burgers. . . I've always wanted to eat here and the recent groupon actually pushed me into actually trying the place. Since I'm a vegetarian, I chose the veggie patty and it was the best veggie burger I've tasted. The 50-50 choice between fries and onion strings was innovative. . . The minus points however is because the table that we were seated at was messy with food all over the floor and definitely made me lose my appetite!!
