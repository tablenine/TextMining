Well, I went here about three or four weeks ago. It's easy to miss when you're walking along Division St. I went with two friends, and on the walk to get there I had some crazy guy trying to get my attention...so I was a bit frazzled when we finally got to Mirai.. . I had heard good things about the quality of the sushi here. We started with some green tea for beverages. I wasn't impressed with it: it came in a packet and was fairly bland, but I'm not an avid tea drinker.. . Our server was very nice: not the fake nice, and not rude. I'm always weird about fine dining, it makes me feel awkward and out of place, like I'm trashy or something. It's swanky, but not too fancy. It was a little small.. . We just got the basic maki rolls: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, california rolls. Â I must say, the taste was great! It was flavorful and very fresh, probably the best sushi I've tasted yet. My only complaint is that it's pricy and the pieces are pretty small.
