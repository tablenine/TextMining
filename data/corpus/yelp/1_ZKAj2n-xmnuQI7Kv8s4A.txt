this place was surprisingly excellent. it's location is in the most unusual place but i think thats what makes it even better. the communal seating reminds me of san francisco for some reason. . . i ordered the short rib &amp; scallion rice. it was delicious. the rice wasn't normal asian rice you see but it was made what seemed like basmati rice. it was very very good. my bf ordered the special udon noodle dish and the broth was very good. i couldn't pinpoint what it was but a great combination of spice. . . i would recommend this place as a causal date with a significant other or just friend. also beware that a seating of more than 2 might be a long wait.
