The wait staff gets to wear the most comfortable outfits ever. Eggplant colored tunic and pants. Speaking of pants, on my most recent visit, I'm glad I didn't wear any. I had on a dress. A beautifully non waistline restricting dress. . . We did the tasting menu, which is a taste of 10 different menu items, and as it turned out, quite a nice way to discover the menu. Some things much tastier than others but overall, it got two thumbs up from this yelper. . . We were there on a Monday evening, and it was surprisingly empty. A few other tables were filled. Service was very friendly - the only thing I could say was that the meal could have been paced a bit better. The apps were brought out quickly but with quite a big delay in between some of the entree tastes. Some favorites included a radish/cucumber/onion ring salad with Chinese mustard, the desserts, and kumquat chicken.. . The interior well fits the theme of Asian inspired food that they're going for - though with their 'Southeast Asian street food' theme that they are going for, its been upscaled by quite a bit. Not sure if you've ever eaten street food in Asia or not, but it's not. even. close. If they were going for authentic, they'd have a crowd bumping into you, smells that your nostrils work hard to learn and everything would be about 99% of the price you'll pay here. . . All in all, a delightful night out. If you think Â you might enjoy something in the Asian fusion/'inspired by' category in an upscale ambiance, head here. But if the F-word (fusion) sends you into convulsions, you'd best keep heading North to Buford Highway.
