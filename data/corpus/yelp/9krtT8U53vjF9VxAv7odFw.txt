Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Came here with my siblings for lunch on a Sunday afternoon! I knew that it opened at 11:30am, so we purposely got there 10 minutes after they opened. There was good parking and we were only 3rd on the waiting list! Score! I noticed that drivers were dropping off their passengers to write their name on the list while they were finding parking. I can see why parking is a pain.. . Anyway, I first discovered this place in high school (the one in Gardena) by a friend who loves ramen. I loved that you can choose how strong you want your soup base, how soft you want your noodles, and how much oil and fat you want to add. For 50 cents, you add additional toppings (ie: corn, pork, extra green onion, egg, etc.) I can barely finish a bowl of large ramen.. . Loved the service and the fact they speak japanese! My brother was thrilled with this place and he just came back from visiting Japan!. . Cons: Might have to wait in line for awhile as the place is small and packed. Also, parking might be a problem. I'd recommend not coming during peak hours.
