A little too popular. The place is always packed and noisy. If you like crowds, this is where you start. Granted that recent remodeling has eased the pain -thank you Portos- but if you can avoid peak hours, you will have a much better experience since the food is great. Pastries are generally in the European style so they are far superior to most bakeries in the area which tend to favor sugar frosting, fake custard and waxy chocolate. I had a delicious shredded pork Cuban sandwich,  heavy but balanced , a Feta cheese sandwich with fresh Feta in a freshly baked baguette , potato balls and  some pastries. Everything was excellent. The service was expeditious.
