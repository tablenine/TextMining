Skip: Pan toast.  I wasn't a fan of the texture and it was rather tasteless and bland.  More cinnamon or some sort of spice would have helped!. . Must: The Southern Corn Pudding Special.  One bite and I was hooked!  The hash was delicious, as was the corn pudding.  Add eggs over and easy and it was very yummy!. . Lust: Red velvet cake.  It was moist and not too sweet.  However, it's definitely not something I could eat in one sitting though, at $6 it's a pretty big portion!. . This place is better for 2-4 people.  It's quite small and cozy.
