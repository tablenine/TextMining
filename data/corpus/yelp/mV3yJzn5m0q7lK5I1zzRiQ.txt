One of the select few gems of Buckhead.  Get past the ridiculously girls-college-dorm-room decor and enjoy some good soup.  Check the menu on their site before you head over so you know what you're getting into.  The chicken tortilla is probably my favorite but I've only been a couple times.  A good place to hit up on the weekend after you wake up late and find yourself in the mood for brunch.
