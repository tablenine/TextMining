Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Well, I have found my new favorite burger place in Chicago. Their food is awesome, the burgers are huge, and the service is amazingly great every time we go.  . . The first time I went it was earlier on a weekday and it was relatively empty (which changes quite a bit later in the evening).  If you want to avoid crowds I would suggest going earlier rather than later. . . Although everything we've had from there has been excellent I must recommend the Big Kahuna burger (the one with the pineapple). It is such a good burger. The Proud Mary is also really great, although I am pretty sure it could feed about three people. All the side dishes are so good it's a toss up, but Mary's Handbag is a great starter if you're with a group of people. If it's just two of you I would suggest skipping the appetizers, they aren't necessary (unless you want a lot of left overs). . . Also, they do take out now. I am not sure if they did before or not, but I just ordered it about a week ago. You just tell the person at the door that that's what you want to do and then you can place your order at the bar and relax there until it's ready.  . . I can't stress enough how nice everyone that works there is. It's also nice that it is extremely gay oriented, and the times I have been there it has been a nice mix of people (gay men and gay women).  . . The prices are also really good considering the amount of food you get. Definitely worth checking out!
