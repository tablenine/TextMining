Just happened upon this place Saturday afternoon and I already want to go back.  The place is city-quaint, the staff charming and the food delectable.. . There were a few things on the menu that sounded amazing and I couldn't decide b/t breakfast and lunch...so, we ordered the beniegts to start...fried dough w/powdered sugar...what's not to liked!  I asked our waiter for inspiration...since one of my choices was a "special", he advised I should go with it.  Great advice...it was phenomenal...stuffed portobello sandwich w/truffled frites...YUM!!!  It was prepared a la burger on a pretzel roll...the mushroom, the stuffing, the roll...all good.  My bf got the apple and cheese  (forgot type) omelet...which came w/the infamous biscuit and strawberry butter.  He liked his meal, as well.. . HB is a great spot and has a great vibe...it could just as well be in NYC as Chicago.
