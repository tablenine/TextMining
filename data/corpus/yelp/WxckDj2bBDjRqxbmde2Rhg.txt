Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
I have been to Cafe Santorini on a couple of occasions already and was in the area again today so I stopped off. I have only come here for lunch and never for dinner so I have not runned into any issues about seating or service. For the area they are in, I believe their prices are reasonable and their portions are more then adaquate. . . I have tried several of their menu items but always find myself going back to the BBQ pizza. It has to be one of the best I have tried. I ususally start off with the humus, it is excellent here. If in the area, I would recommend it!
