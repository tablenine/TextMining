Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
A trip to Brick Store is always a good time for me.  First of all, the inside feels like you are in a giant old wooden ship!  The beer selection, duh, is fab and I've always gotten efficient service.  I love their tempeh wrap.  My other fave is the baked brie with apples...  Jeez, I'm salivating on my keyboard as I type this.
