One word: OVERRATED.  . . Totally not worth the wait!  Yes it is the "LA thing to do" but spend your time doing something else.  We did it because we fell into the tourist trap.  . . I ordered the Chili dog and when I asked if I can get my onions grilled, the lady gave me a wink and said, "I'll do it for ya." So I thought that's nice.. makes up a little bit for that long ass wait."  But what happens when I went to pay?  I got charged 30 cents for grilled onions!!  I don't mind the 30 cents if she had been upfront about it.  But she made it seem like she was doing me a favor..... . The chili dog was OK, but not the greatest of course.  Definitely not worth the 1 hr wait.  Go some other place.
