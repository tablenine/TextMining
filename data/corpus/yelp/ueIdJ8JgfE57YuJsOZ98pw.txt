Simply put: They make the best Hainan chicken in the neighborhood. I mostly order for takeout to avoid the wait but on occasion, I had time to sit down for lunch in their tranquil outdoor patio.. . My order? Sweetened iced tea, salad and escargot for appetizers (though they were a tad bit salty which took away from the essence) and of course, their ultra-juicy and tender Hainan chicken with minced ginger sauce made to perfection and a generous portion of rice cooked in rich chicken broth to create the wonderful flavor. . . All I gotta say is they know their stuff to a tee. They make it the way it's meant to be made.
