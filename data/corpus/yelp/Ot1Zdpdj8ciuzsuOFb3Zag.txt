I am not a fan of Philippe's.. . After hearing years of hype, i was so excited to finally try it out.  The place is retro adorable and the ladies behind the counter all reminded me of Lucy Ricardo.  The pickled beets and eggs were good, but this is supposed to be a place you come for sandwiches.  And let's just say, I wouldnt come back here for their french dips.. . We tried the beef and the pork.  Couldn't really taste the difference between the two.  That's not a good thing.  Also, the jus is not provided on the side.  Rather, the ladies behind the counter dip it for you, so by the time you find your table to sit and start eating, the bread is a soggy sloppy mess.  My friend ate two sandwiches and said he was so unsatisfied.  I completely sympathize with him.  The beef stew tasted like Dinty Moore from the high school cafeteria.. . I think I actually prefer Cole's french dip sandwiches which have more meat and jus on the side so you can dip into the jus-y goodness just before it gets shoved into your mouth.
