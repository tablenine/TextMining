I've had the ramen in Japan which is out of this world, but in terms of what I've found in LA, this is the best.. . The place is open late so it's good for when you're drunk. The line is usually long and you put your name on a list -- they're going to call you by number, not name, so pay attention. Anyway, one time I was here I had a blacked out friend ditch me with the bill to pay. BS. It's right next to Far Bar and Â some other spots in the Art District, hence our drunkenness. . . The service is always good, the ramen is delicious, and the pork melts in your mouth. Other than the slanted booths that can cause vertigo, this place is an LA must try.
