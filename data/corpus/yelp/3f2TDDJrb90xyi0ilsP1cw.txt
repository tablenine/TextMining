Restaurant: Shout
Category: Bars
Mediterranean restaurant by day and lounge with tons of bars by night; Shout is a cool place to go to socialize.  As the owners put it, Shout is all about "Food, Fun &amp; Flirting".  Located on the corner of 14th and Peachtree at the base of Colony Square, this place gets packed on Friday and Saturday evenings. They even have a DJ spinning. With awesome drinks and appetizers, who needs to go to a club?     . . Shout offers very eclectic and contemporary with seating arrangements that are out of this world.  The rooftop lounge almost makes you feel like you're on Miami without the water.  You have to go to Shout or at least visit the web site for the full effect.  For more information visit . http://www.heretoserve....  and if your dining for dinner, make a reservation.
