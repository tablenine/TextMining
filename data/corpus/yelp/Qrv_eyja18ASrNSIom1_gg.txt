Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Delicious burgers!  I loved how the burgers come wrapped in paper, perfectly tucked in so you don't get any sauce on your hands.  I think one of the key ingredients to the deliciousness of the burgers here is the super fresh, super crisp, whole lettuce leaves they pile on top.  MMM.  The fries are really good, too.  The only thing I didn't like was the seating... it's so inefficient and confusing for a first timer.  But i guess it's something you just have to deal with when you go to a quirky old timey place like Apple Pan.  I was thinking about getting some pie, but ouch!  $5 for a slice?  I'll take the burger instead.
