This place had a nice menu, the food is good, but prices are expensive, and the atmosphere is "typical trendy Hollywood". Definitely good for people watching or bringing your out of state friends for dinner. But probably wouldn't go back. If you like a swanky place, this place would prob be more enjoyable for you but I am a low key person that doesn't need all the excess "bling" and doesn't have to get all dolled up for a bite to eat. . . I had the Japanese eggplant dish (nicely prepared with a very good sauce), the veggie roll (also very nice, fresh, and they used lots veggies - not just cucumbers and rice). My husband had yellow tail and salmon - which he liked but expensive (paying for the atmosphere), the others at the table had a salmon dish and shrimp. Everyone enjoyed their food but it's nothing extra ordinary.  Dinner for 4 (no drinks), 1 vegetarian without tip $130. . . After dinner, we went upstairs for a cocktail. They have a very appetizing drink menu with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and juices.  If drinks are your thing, this is a good place for a cocktail. But I like beer and they only offer 2 kinds - Kirin and Sapporo. I have to take a star away for lack of variety. You don't need a huge variety, but can't you at least carry Hitachino Nest White Ale? So many other restaurants and bars offer this wonderful beer.
