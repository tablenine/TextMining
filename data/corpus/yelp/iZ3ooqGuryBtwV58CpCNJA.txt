For me, it's not even about the meat. Don't get me wrong, I love a good piece of meat, but every time I come here, I end up stuffing myself silly with practically everything else but the meat. . . That's how good their salad bar is. Sun-dried tomatoes, olives, cheeses, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, asparagus, and more. Plus the endless sides of creamy polenta, cheese puffs, and mashed potatoes. Sooo good, soo good!
