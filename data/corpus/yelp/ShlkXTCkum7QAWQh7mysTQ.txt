The place is a sh** hole! Seriously, do they even sweep the floor- let alone mop it? The Tables, windows, even the ketchup and mustard bottles were dirty. As a matter of fact I had to grab another mustard bottle from another table because it was clogged. Plus our waitress had no smile, no personality and spoke two sentences to us, "What can I get ya?" and "Have a good night." I wanted to leave but my husband was too embarrassed. . With that said, the burgers were pretty good. I've had better and due to the cleanliness and moldy smell- we will not be returning.
