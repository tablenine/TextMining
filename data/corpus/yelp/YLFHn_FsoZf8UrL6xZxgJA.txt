WOW.. My friend is a chef here so he took all my friends there on my birthday.. It is not easy to get a table here but well worth the wait. It has thee most darling French decor inside, with a hopping bar area and tons of people grubbing.. . We ate like KINGS! The fries were good, pizza was scrumptious, mussels had a very light but flavorful sauce, French onion soup was to die for, all beef dishes were so tender and tasteful. The fish my friend had was awesome and the duck was good too!. . Needless to say it didnt end there, the Chef came out and brought a huge plate of various cheeses, nuts &amp; honey to try! It was out of control. Â We then finished up with about 3 chocolate dishes and a creme puff dessert that melted in your mouth.. . Regardless of the fact that i nearly got stuck in the doorway from my fatness- we ate like rock stars and the food was awesome!
