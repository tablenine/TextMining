Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
i could never remember the name of this place so i call it the juicy pork dumpling house. anyway, everyone always knows what im talking about but mostly it's because they're the ones who i went with. . . anyway, like everyone says, the line is horrendous but once you're in, YOU'RE IN. I always order like a million dumplings, take joy and care with the suckation of each and every dumpling (i love the instructions on the chopstick sleeve) and take some home with me (if there are ever any leftovers). . . i always thought dumplings were boring leftovers smashed into a rice paper. after going to DTF i realize... it's more than that. They smash a lot of juice in it, too. . . now i can honestly say that i love juicy dumplings...or whatever addictive substance they put in there that makes me want to trek all the way to arcadia to wait in an hour + line for these small juicy bursts of savory goodness in my mouth.. . *edit*. . 03/16/08. omg. they have a nicer, more contemporary and poshy "new part" to the restaurant. it's behind the "old" one and like, omg so awesome. just go. less wait.
