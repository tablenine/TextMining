The staff in here makes me laugh, though usually not in the good way.  Today the register clerk let his friend cut in front of me to order.  I wasn't in a hurry, so I just shook my head in bemusement, but what really tickled me was the guy's scarf.  Dude, it was 87 degrees today; leave the scarf in your closet.  Another time the girl making my sandwich hurled curses at me for attempting to confirm that she was making it without mayo as requested.  When I turned to the other clerk with my mouth agape, he apologized and said that it was her last day.  I wonder if that was true.. . I like their sandwiches--oven-baked on Italian bread.  The salads are uninspired but at least they use quality ingredients.  The balsamic vinaigrette dressing is crap.  The pizza is slightly thinner than true New York style but it's very good.  It's oh-so-floppy and structurally unsound, so fold it in half and get to work.  Please note that the $4 variety, mentioned by other reviewers, is the "Slice of the Day" which uses fancier ingredients such as grilled chicken, goat cheese, and roasted red peppers.  Plain old cheese, pepperoni, or sausage is $3.25.  I wish that I lived in the neighborhood so that I could try Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's specials.. . Beer on draft is a nice, unusual touch for a joint like this.  Only $4 today for  Trumer Pils.
