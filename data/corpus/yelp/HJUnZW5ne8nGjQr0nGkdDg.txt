I hate to say this, but I gave al cove 3 times a try and today I decided it is just not for me! I was looking forward to a great Turkey Sandwich! What I got was a dry sandwich and salty cold fries :( while the long wait added to my appetite, but my taste buds where just too many times disappointed here :( last time the Turkey burger and before that Roast beef sandwich!
