Restaurant: Bocado
Category: American (New)
I have been a loyal fan of Flip Restaurant since it opened its doors before I tasted the burger at Bocado.  I can truly say that I have never consumed a burger as juicy, hearty and well-seasoned. I ate my burger with a side of herb fries, which were aromatic, perfectly seasoned and delicious. But the burger isn't the only thing to rave about at Bocado. I have visited this establishment on several occasions and tasted many items on the menu. The Oyster Stew is also my favorite. It consists of a perfect marriage of flavors and the bacon gives the dish a delightfully smoky flavor that takes the dish to the next level. When I finished this dish, I was a little upset because I wanted more!. I visited this establishment again and had to try The Mexican sandwich, a definite palate pleaser that provides a great balance of flavors. You receive a spicy surprise with this gourmet sandwich as well. I returned again and tried the flank steak, which is extremely tender and juicy. I am also a big fan of the tomato bisque soup and all of the salads because Bocado has its own garden that grows fresh produce right behind the restaurant. It doesn't get much better than that! I can truly say that I have not ordered one thing from this establishment that I didn't like.  . In addition to the menu, what makes this restaurant an absolute draw for me is that the awesome chef and his staff are very friendly, approachable and attentive to customers' needs.  So there you have it: great food, fresh produce and a friendly staff -- that is Bocado! Whenever I have friends who visit from out of town, I would take them to Atlantic Station in the past. Now, we head straight to Bocado!. I would HIGHLY recommend this establishment to anyone.
