I have only ever been here for lunch during the workday. It is less than a block from my office, but I hear they are only open at night now which is sad. Everything I have ever eaten here is basically the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. Especially the fish tacos and there is a pasta dish with scallops that is completely amazing. It is easy to screw up scallops so this impresses me. I have never had sushi here, but I have heard good things.
