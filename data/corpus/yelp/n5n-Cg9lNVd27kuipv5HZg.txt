Category: Tex-Mex
I had dinner at Agave for the first time for my husband's birthday.  It has gotten stellar reviews, so we were really excited to finally go, especially since we live 5 minutes away.   First off, I have to admit that the interior is not as great as I was expecting.  Now saying this, I'm not really sure what I was expecting exactly being that it is a Tex-Mex spot, but nevertheless, it was less than what I expected.  It has your typical "cantina"-esque interior.  Anyway, we started out with the chips &amp; salsa with an order of guac (of course) and it was great.  Since we were being piggies that night, we also ordered the calamari as an additional appetizer.  It was fantastic.  For dinner, I had the "famous" cayenne fried chicken.  It was delicious.  I forgot what the chicken came with.  Mash potatoes maybe, and also corn on the cob.  It complemented the chicken well.  All in all, I give Agave the thumbs up--I just would like anyone else reading this to not get totally blinded by all the awesome reviews and expect more than what it really is.  It is a Tex-Mex CANTINA. haha  I have to admit, I think Holy Taco is better.
