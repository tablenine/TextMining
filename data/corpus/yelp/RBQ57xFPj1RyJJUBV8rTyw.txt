There really isn't anything I can say bad about this place. After reading the reviews I made sure to be there just before 3pm when they opened on Friday, there was already a line forming. They seated us immediately and we put in our order . . Half a dozen Raw Oysters . 1 lb of king crab legs @ 15.99/lb . 1 lb of shrimp @ $8.99/lb . 1 lobster (which average weights at 2-3 lbs each!!) . Cajun Fries and something to wash it down. . . This place does not disappoint. The staff is great and really takes care of you and checks on you often. They put our bibs on since our hands were already covered in spicy goodness. . . The medium spice is good with a bit of a kick I love spicy food and it hit the spot. But it is not over powering. The garlic butter sauce is just amazing. I really wish they bottled and sold it because no joke there is a TON of garlic in it. . . The lobsters are HUGE!!! . . Everything is steamed to perfection. . . This place is the place to go when you want to get down and dirty and enjoy some seafood. You got wax paper laid out in front of you and a roll of paper towels. . . Whats great about this place is everyone is chowing down with bibs on no need to be embarrassed or be afraid its major seafood grub!! The service is fast you order it and they bring it to you just as fast and sooo piping hot . . I really could not find one reason to NOT give this place 5 stars!!
