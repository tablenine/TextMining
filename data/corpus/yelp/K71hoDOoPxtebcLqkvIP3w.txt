Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I cannot complain one bit about this place.. . The service was excellent.. . The giant Elvis statue I sat next too was Yao Ming height, haha.. . The food, well... the food was DELICIOUS.. . The Deep Fried Trout with Mango Sauce was absolutely wonderful.  The mango sauce made it every worthwhile, especially with the hint of spice and cilantro, WOW.  Our party also had the BBQ Pork, Shrimp Pad Thai, Fried Tofu, Beef Jerky, and Duck Curry, all of which I have no complaints.. . Definitely a Thai Restaurant worth making the trip for all the way from Walnut.  Good for big parties (live-band in the evening time) or just a simple night out.
