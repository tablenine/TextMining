Excellent... All around excellent from the food to the best margaritas in town hands down (and I have tried A LOT of them :)) This is New Mexican food not Mexican so for those of you that don't know... They are two different places. One is part of the United States and the other is a whole other country... Not the same. The service here is impeccable and friendly. The decor is about as close as you can get to authentic in Atlanta as possible... I think in almost all of my time in New Mexico I never saw a booth... lol
