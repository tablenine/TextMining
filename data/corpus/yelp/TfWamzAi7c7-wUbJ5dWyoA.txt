I really enjoyed my dinner experience, from drinks at the bar (well made), to the service and food, everything was great. The mozzarella bar has a lot of yummy choices and I would like to go back to try more!  . . I had the Burricotti with radicchio, spiced walnuts, honey &amp; fried rosemary  -- which was excellent!!  I loved the Tagliatelle pasta w/oxtail ragu, and I highly recommend a side order of Roasted Potatoes with rosemary... it is MARVELOUS!! They sound deceptively simple, but they really are something special-- light and crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside.  I don't know how they cook them, but I have never had potatoes that perfect before. Trust me on this one.. . I loved our waiter, he was knowledgable and friendly. Only point of disappointment was that the food was not as good as Batali's restaurant in NY, but definitely top notch for LA.
