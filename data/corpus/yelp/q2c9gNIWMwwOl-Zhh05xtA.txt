Awesome food.  Seriously...it's THAT good.  . . We've eaten here three times now and have left stuffed and happy each time.  I've had one of the best Chile Rellenos  here that is only rivaled by a little place in Baja Norte that shall remain nameless.  The staff/owner are among the friendliest folks you'll ever meet too.  . . The only downside is they can't serve a traditional tequila margarita due to the lack of a liquor license.  However, a pitcher a sangria kind of makes you forget all about that now, doesn't it?. . Chile Relleno.  Get one.
