Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's has good hot dogs, but the line for a hot dog is just too long of a wait. Â . . Last time I was at Pink's I waited half an hour for a chilli dog, and was hassled by a hobo. The food was good, but all of that hassle for food stand food, is it worth it?. . If you pass by Pink's and there's no line, take advantage, get a hot dog.
