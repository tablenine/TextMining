Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
There used to be a long wait for brunch at Flo, but lately I've been seated right away. I'm not sure if this means Flo is getting less popular, but I don't see why that would be the case because it's one of the better brunch spots in Chicago.. . I haven't tried their regular lunch or dinner yet, but I'm sure it's very good as well.
