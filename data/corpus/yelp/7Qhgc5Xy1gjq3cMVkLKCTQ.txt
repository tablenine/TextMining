It really isn't necessary for me to review this little gem because so many people have already done so. But oh well. I love Papa's.. and lamb. I love lamb.. . I have their gyros every time I go (give or take a salad..and appetizer..and dessert. heh.) because they're travel friendly - Papa's isn't really the place you'd go for a lovely and romantic sit-down meal, I usually just pick something up on the way home, or quickly snarf it down on the way to somewhere. . . The food here is authentic and delicious... it reminds me of Greeeece. Granted, the only other memory I have of a gyro is from the one I stumbled upon in some creepy little hut in Mykonos.. Or at least I think that was a gyro....? Nevertheless, Papa Cristo's has great food, great people, and great prices - their portions of meat are huge. Scary huge, but good huge. . . PLUS, Thursday nights, you can pay like 20 bucks a person for wine tasting and lots and lots of food (a bunch of appetizers, entrees, dessert, and drinks all included). BUT, I think they're closed Mondays. . . The market part is pretty cool, too. Look around and I'm sure you'll find something nice to take home with you.. . Opa!
