ok so after all this hype about kogi, i finally had to try it. we went to abbot kinney &amp; palm friday night, parking sucks, waited about 30 minutes, ordered a short rib burrito, a short rib taco and a spicy beef taco. they gave me two chicken tacos instead -___-'' . . wrong orders and long wait aside, the food is good but it is not so amazing that i would wait an hour for it or follow the truck religiously. i've heard that sometimes as many as 200 people are waiting in line. sorry kogi, i don't love you that much. the food is different in a good way and major props for coming up with such a combination. kogi is intriguing and worth going to to satisfy the curiousity. i'd come back to try the other stuff on their menu. this place is a 20 min wait good.
