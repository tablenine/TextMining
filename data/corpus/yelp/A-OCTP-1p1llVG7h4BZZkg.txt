This place is adorable. I want to come back and eat more lovely ice cream. I got the Cake Batter Soft Serve and it was the easily the best vegan ice cream that I ever had. I kept talking about it afterward. I WANT THIS STUFF IN THE FREEZER SECTION OF MY GROCER! :D I'll be back for sure.. . This place is tiny by the way. WAY smaller than I had imagined (basically a stand), but that doesn't matter because the ice cream is amazing.
