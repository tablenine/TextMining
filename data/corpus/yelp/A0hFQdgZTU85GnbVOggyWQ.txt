Hmm, Korean style pizza....riiiggghhht. That was pretty much my dubious reaction to this place before I actually tried it. And now, I have learned never to doubt my friends again. The pizza was downright delicious, and unlike anything I've had before. Toppings themselves were not too far left field, (although I saw a few on the menu that looked really odd), but what really makes this stand out is the crust. Get the ones with sweet potato puree stuffed in the crust. It defies description, sounds kinda ridiculous, but is really phenomenal. Feel a craving coming on already.
