Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I've become a fan of Andersonville.  There are a lot of good eateries up here.  Andersonville is different with folks of various persuasions, but also vibrant and upbeat, and everyone minds their own business.  Hamburger Mary's pretty much typifies what I mean I think.  You get the bill in a red slipper, and it looks like Dorothy's from Wizard of Oz, but it's probably Mary's.  The 1/2 lb burgers are decent, and have an interesting variety of toppings.  We had guacamole and bacon, as well as the slayer - with red wine sauce and garlic.  It's not a Kumas Corner, but you don't have the crazy wait either.  You can have the burgers on brioche or whole wheat grain.  We also had a mac n cheese which was decent.  Beer selection is good with some local brews (reasonable at $4.75 for 16 oz, or $6 for 20 oz), and various bottled offerings including Three Floyds and Two Brothers.  This was a fun dinner.  I'm pretty sure we're coming back because I also want to try one of their interesting alcoholic milkshakes, which I was too full to do this time.
