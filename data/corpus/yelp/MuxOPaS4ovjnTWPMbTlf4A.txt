Category: Sushi Bars
Hmmmmm.....more like Harry and the Henderson's.  I think they hit the food on the way to a hunting trip and decided to serve it to urban yuppies, et al.  Despite the pleasant demeanor of all the staff and the great location, this place is like watching one of those 'Unexplained Mysteries' shows....you are intrigued for the set up and then disappointed by the end.  . . I had the Basil Tofu and my friend braved the sushi.  My dish was bland for a traditionally spicy Thai dish and my friend's rolls were described as "okay..."  the ambiance was aight; they have elevated booths and a bar in a fairly tight space in the forefront of the restaurant and there was a larger dining space in the rear that seemed to also be used for private parties.  . . Perhaps I have judged too quickly and caught them on a bad day.....and maybe Bigfoot really exists?  Nah!  Don't go here.
