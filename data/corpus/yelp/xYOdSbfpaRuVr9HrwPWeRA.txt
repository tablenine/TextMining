MEH!. Not up to the hype, yes, it's open 24/7, no, it is not the place Jesus would go to eat.. The food is inconsistent, waiters get your order wrong half the time (not complicated either, mainly you ask for a side of potato salad and get not potato salad, then they argue you did order the other thing rather then get you what you order.) . The cheesecake is nasty and dry, everything is over priced, and when you do get a good meal it's overshadowed by all the other lame ones.. Go once, then move on.
