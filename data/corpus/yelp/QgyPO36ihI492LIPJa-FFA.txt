Italian food in Atlanta...finally, a decent representation!  I was afraid after a couple misses around the city that I shouldn't get my hopes too high but Sotto Sotto is good!  . . Cold multigrain bread but great high-end olive oil to dip it in.  I liked how they had several risotto entrees to choose from- I had the delicious wild mushroom risotto- perfectly cooked and seasoned (good thing b/c there is no salt &amp; pepper on the table).  I finished the entire giant entree and licked the plate.  My friend had a free form lasagna bolognese that she said (and looked) pretty good.  Varied &amp; lengthy wine list to choose from. Tried their highly regarded chocolate soup...tasty as you would think melted chocolate would be but would have been better with some biscotti or cake cubes to dip in it.. . Our server was semi-new so he missed a few things...small plates for our bread, asking for our entree order right after we sat down.  But he was friendly, helpful (recommended our eventual order), and didn't mess anything up about the meal experience itself.. . Relaxed &amp; cozy but still semi-upscale atmosphere- distressed walls, white paper on tables but with cloth napkins and someone to grate your parmesean for you...nice but not trying too hard :)
