Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I introduced many people to Roscoe's when I was living in LA during my years in college.  All the skeptics that question this unbelievable combo of chicken and waffles were hooked on it after the first time they tried it.. . This location in Pasadena where the grass is greena was the one I frequented the most.  No A-list celebs rolling through this joint.  But at the same time this location is more spacious than the others.   . . I've tried everything on the menu.  My favorites are the smothered potatoes and of course the waffles.  This ain't no leggo my eggo ish.  I prefer the chix w/ smothered gravy and onions. The fried chicken is hit or miss due to them overfrying it and sometimes the white meat is a little dry.  Be sure you wash down your meal with a tall icy glass of Eclipse (Lemonade, OJ &amp; Fruit Punch). . . I know that the next time I'm in the LA area, I have to swoop by here!  I wish they did mail order, but that probably wouldn't be a good idea.  Haha!
