I'm not going to write much, because everyone's review sounds about right...and I don't want to sound repetitive. . . Mojito =Yum . Sangria = Gooood . P. Ceviche = Looove . Spinach Empanadas = Good . Chille Relleno = Interesting (Sweet, not a fan of goat cheese) . Tortilla soup = Awesooome (wished they added corn) . Mahi Mahi = Tasty (not too fishy) . Chicken Ciudad = Mouth watering . . Service was excellent. I like how our server was wearing a nose ring and her sleeves tatted up. Super hawt (not in a lesbian way). It just shows that the restaurant is a casual fine dining place. Anyone can come in and enjoy the food, not worry about their appearance. Granted, you should look presentable for dining. . Enjoy!
