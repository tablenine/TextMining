Category: Southern
FYI: I don't like waffles, french toast, pancakes, and eggs! Sorry breakfast meal.. . EXCEPT, for their waffles and eggs (which have onions; I don't like onions, however I loved them anyway). Oh-Em-Gee! I really do love their waffles, I have no idea why I do, they seem cinnamon-ish to me. Call me crazy. Their gravy is, eh. But their waffles...so good to me.
