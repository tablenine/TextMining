What a disappointment! One of my bestest friends was in town with her husband, and we ordered takeout from pingpong because they were into staying inside after a long couple days out in the city. But I wanted them to enjoy what they had to eat, and I thought from the kind of minimalist look of the takeout menu the food would be more about quality than quantity.. In the end, it was about neither, it was just crappy. They ordered the summer rolls, the chicken lettuce cups, and then some kind of lo mein. I got the seaweed salad and some tofu/vegetable soup. Â . The summer rolls smelled fishy, I mean really fishy...not just normal shrimp smell. I almost stopped her from eating them but she decided to take the risk, and there were no adverse consequences that I know of. And the sauce they serve with them was clearly the stuff you can get in a jar from the grocery store. The lettuce cups..basically the filling is whole round peanuts with with sauce on them. Glad they went through the trouble to shell the peanuts. I don't know if there was any chicken in there at all. They said the lo mein was good...but maybe they were being polite.. Or even if the lo mein was good, is that enough to make up for an over-dressed seaweed salad in addition to the items described above? The tofu soup I really can't complain about it being bland, that is the nature of the soup, but I've definitely had more interesting versions. Possibly their dine-in is better, but I have no desire to try it.
