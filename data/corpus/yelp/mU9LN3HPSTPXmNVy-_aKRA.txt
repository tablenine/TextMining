OK, ladies and gentlemen.  Sushi Gen is all around excellent!  I mean both the food and the ambiance.  I've been enjoying this eatery over the years and the quality is alway consistent.   Please try everything but the spicy tuna hand roll and uni (sea urchin), my favorite, is a must!!. Sit at the sushi bar ONLY because the sushi chefs is alway fun to be around, trust me on that.  . Great crowd, festive ambiance, fresh fish with the most entertaining sushi chef; I could not ask for anything more... five star; )
