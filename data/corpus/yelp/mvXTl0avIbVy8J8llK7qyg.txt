I don't enjoy giving bad reviews. That's not why I'm on Yelp. I prefer to share great spots with people but I must tell you, I got food poisoning twice in a ROW from Bossa Nova. It was a shimp plate with side plantains. . So...Eat at your own risk. If you don't get violently ill Bossa Nova is pretty damn delicious....
