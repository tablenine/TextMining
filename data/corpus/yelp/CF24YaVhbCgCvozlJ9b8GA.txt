I prefer the big sister Bin 36, but this is a great and much needed spot in Wicker. Great retail selection, but I'd rather sit at the bar than at a table here. Â Also went here for brunch and it was a surprisingly heavy/greasy. . . If it wasn't always so packed, i'd be here more. great Sunday-Wednesday tho.
