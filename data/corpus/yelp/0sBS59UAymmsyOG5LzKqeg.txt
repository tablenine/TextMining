love the different menus &amp; it's good!. unfortunately, it's kinda in a weird location, the lines are long, &amp; the seating is kinda... ghetto? (cuz people were dropping their chili/onions on the ground, and no one cleaning up &amp; pigeons were coming to eat them...i guess it's called bad sanitation)
