I have nothing but good things to say about Porto's.  I live in Northern California but my Dad lives in Burbank, about 1 block walking distance from Porto's.  Once my Dad took me and my girlfriend here we could not stop going back.  It's now a tradition to go here every time we visit.. . They have the best breakfast and lunch and their pastries are to die for.  I don't get to eat Cuban food that much so this is always a real treat.  The lines are always long but that is a good sign for any business;however, they move really fast.  Staff is always polite and the prices are reasonable.
