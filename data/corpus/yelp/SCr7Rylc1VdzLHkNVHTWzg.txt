Don't fall for the $7 bento box scam! It seems like a deal until you discover that the sushi rolls taste like they came from Ninjiya's refrigerator and were left out until room temperature, and that the tempura tastes like deep fried paper. The salad was ok, but the miso soup was salt city! So I'm guessing ramen is the way to go here. Paul mentioned that it wasn't as good as Santouka, but better than 10-cent Top Ramen (what the hell is oriental flavor anyway?). There was no wait when we showed up during lunch at around 12:15pm, but it got crowded quickly--so stuffy and gross! Um... so yeah, enjoy your visit to Daikokuya!
