I guess Saturday brunch is just really unpopular.  I showed up expecting to wait for seating but the place is more than half empty.  I have to admit, nothing makes me happier than fried chicken at 12:30pm.  The chicken was pretty delicious, crispy and flavorful and the mac was tasty but the solidified cheese crust was not at all visually appealing.  The sausage gravy was too oily and runny, the eggs looked pretty unappetizing, the bacon was probably sitting around for a bit too long.  I hate sweets, so I skipped the waffle bar, the muffins and danishes.  Overall, I probably wouldn't go back for all you can eat brunch again.  I can't really justify paying $17 for brunch for what I ate.  I wish they had lox like some other review mentioned....I think that got my hopes up.
