Restaurant: RuSan&#39;s
Category: Japanese
I had been to another RuSan's location and was less than impressed.  However, I decided to keep an open mind and try it again.  Boy was that a mistake.  The sushi is overpriced.  The quality is just OK and sometimes less than OK.  The service was awful every time I visited.  Orders lost, credit cards lost, food brought late... you get the idea.  If you want a place to go do sake bombs and yell a lot, I guess RuSan's is an alternative to a bar.  If you want to eat Japanese food - in any size group - there are dozens of better alternatives in Atlanta.
