I only had drinks here but I was impressed by their vast selection of flavored vodkas.  I also like the decor and found the service to be fast, friendly and efficient.  I didn't like having to go downstairs to use the restrooms.  But, they were nice restrooms once we got there.  It's also a pretty good deal if you go here before a game at Philips Arena because you can park in their deck, which had a $5 flat fee, and then get your ticket validated for a $5 credit which makes parking free.  It's a short hop to Philips and just far enough away to avoid much of the post-game traffic.  I would DEFINITELY go here again just for the parking!  As far as sports bars go, I like and I would return.
