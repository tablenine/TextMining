I came and got a quick Porchetta sandwich before I ran over to meet friends at a bar. I gotta say it was a pretty damn fine sandwich; juicy flavorful pork and crispy crunchy skin all thrown into good hearty bread. It would've been nice with some greens on it, I think broccoli rabe or something with a little bitterness would've gone a long way, also maybe a splash of acid like some balsamic or lemon juice to cut the fat. . . It was a bit expensive for just a sandwich, but there must be a lot of skill and effort to get the pork that perfect. I recommend it if you're in the area or are just curious about the hype.
