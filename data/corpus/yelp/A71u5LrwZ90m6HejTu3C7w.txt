Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Tried the fish tacos for the first time today. The fish tacos are $1.50 each (tax inc.), and considering the amount of fish they give you in the small tacos, they are a bargain. The (la) crema and salsas are do-it-yourself, which is actually better for reheating later, if you take them to go as I said for reheating. My only complaint at all is that the cabbage is shredded so thin, that they are not crunchy. Recommended!
