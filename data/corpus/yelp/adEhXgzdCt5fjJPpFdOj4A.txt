Jesus, every last one of you is insane.  . . I consider myself the king of diners.  As my friend once explained to these girls we were trying to seal the deal with, diners are like porn to me.  This one though is like bad midget porn on a VHS tape that needs serious trackin adjustment. . . The food is shit, the service is shit, the prices are shit.  I have NEVER had a good experience here.   And I've given Canter's about five chances to prove me wrong over the years.  Well, no more.  Ashonda, Canter's!  You shmuck's.  If you want some good late night dining nearby, go to Swingers near Fairfax and Beverly.
