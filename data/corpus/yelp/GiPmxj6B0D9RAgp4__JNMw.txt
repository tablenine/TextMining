I give it to this Erik Oberholtzer guy, this place has got to be a [quickly expanding at soon-to-be-5 locations] wallet. Â Where else but SoCal (and maybe NYC) will people pay $15 for lettuce, veggies, and perhaps a buck in other toppings? . . It's not that it's not "good", freshly prepared foods are always good, a homemade vinaigrette is always "good"; but when I've been there on weekends, I get this weird feeling that I'm surrounded by a drove of people who never go to a farmer's market, or look at the price of gas they put in their SUVs. But we all like Culver City better this way right?
