I really love their food, especially tiger shrimp salad, lamb burger and the desserts " Strawberry Shortcake"!! yum yum!!. I would say their cake and food have certain qualities.. It's always my best lunch + dessert choice w/ friends.. There is lovely outside seating.. It is ideal for  brunch sitting at patio in the afternoon and enjoy delicious food with wine.
