Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
chicken sausage, damn it was good. i had never been to a known breakfast place before until this one. i guess it was pretty well-known in the atl area. the breakfast selection of eggs, sausage, grits and, of course, the biscuit was very tasted. my first experience with chicken sausage (i tried tofu, meatless, veggies) was flavorful and worth getting an extra side of it. the grit was creamy and delightful. biscuit was so-so, i would have prefered toast. service on the other hand was off. it was a busy place with the waitress only taking orders while the food runners did everything else. unfortunately, the orders were wrong, but being hungry for breakfast we forgo the pancakes. the wait wasn't bad since we arrived at 9:30 with no waiting. if they had one in ct i would go once every two months for something like that. otherwise i'm a sucker for tourist-y places.
