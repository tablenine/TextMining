Restaurant: Umami Burger

If I could share one lesson from my 10 years in the service industry it would be: . at your next staff meeting, have everyone on your staff sit around in total silence (no phones or anything) for 5 minutes. . Just sit there and wait. . Wait as the clock ticks away second by second. . It starts to get silly. . After 3 minutes you can't believe it's not over, and then by 5 minutes it feel like a year.. . Well, this is how your customer feels until he/she is approached with water/menu et al. . I don't mind the concept of Umami or it's rules (you cant add, just subtract) but it took 10 minutes for anyone to approach our table. Thats inexcusable! Just a friggin menu and water took 15 minutes. Mind you the place was near empty. . . Service, once approached, was polite but inattentive. Â . . Food (that which actually came out) was average at best, half our order never showed. . . Drinks were... drinks.. . The veg burger is a friggin mushroom and the burger itself... you can get better at any surrounding spot (stout, kitchen 24, magnolia, 25 degrees has one of the best in town...) . Umami's was totally average at best. . . Bleh... hipsters as far as patrons go... . . in the end a very average burger spot in a city filled with great ones.
