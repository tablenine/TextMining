Restaurant: Green Sprout
Category: Vegetarian
I just registered for Yelp just so I could add to the chorus.... . Green Sprout is UNSTOPPABLE!. . I began frequenting this restaurant as a college student in Atlanta, a newly-minted vegetarian nearly resigned to subsist on indian and mexican food for the rest of his time. This place gave me not only a new outlook on vegetarian food, but also hope for the future when it comes to enjoying food. . . And not only does Green Sprout offer hope for my palette, IMO it represents a kernel of hope for all of humanity. That's right, ALL of humanity. Strong words, I know, but if we can create delicious, high-protein meat substitutes that represent their dead animal counterparts in both taste &amp; texture, what need do we have for actual meat? I digress.... . Obviously there are several other places in Atlanta (Soul Veg, Harmony, etc), and NY/LA/SF/CHI have evolved far past the A when it comes to this market, but this place has a special, tasty place in my heart. . . Everything is awesome, but my personal favs are the Mongolian Beef and the Scallops (Seafood Platter). Their chicken drumstix app is also solid. The only things I can't rave about are the pork dishes and bubble tea. . . Also, don't forget:. . 1. Closed Wednesdays . 2. Tell them if you're vegan, but they're so nice they often ask . 3. They deliver, and take out is pretty fast and they give you tea while you wait
