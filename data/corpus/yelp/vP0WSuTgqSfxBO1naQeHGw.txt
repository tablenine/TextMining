Crustacean's IMO is overrated.. . The food was good yeah, but definitely not worth it.  The ambiance was pretty nice, but the food isnt anything mindblowing.  I had the lobster tail with "famous" garlic noodles.  I loveee garlic, but these noodles just seem oily and ordinary.  The food was good, but you can go to other places for less while maintaining the same quality of ambiance.
