Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Trendy. But that's what you'll get in this area of town.  I went to this restaurant with my fiance and (soon-to-be) sister in law.  We were visiting Los Angeles for the first time and wanted to 'live it up' and go somewhere cool for dinner.. . Taste definitely delivered -- the food was delicious and we had a great time.  We sat outside in the outdoor awning (in February) and it was great.. . Would I go back here again?  Not sure.  The food sure was good but we did pay a good amount for it.  I may try to find a more 'hidden' gem in LA next time.
