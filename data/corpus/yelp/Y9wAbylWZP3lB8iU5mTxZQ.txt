light skinned black girl as the host the night of july 4th, 2007. best part about the entire experience. :) that said, everything i had tasted salty. while i don't mind coughing up some money for a world class meal, mastro's definitely fell way short of my expectations. when the bill came out, i felt awful to the people i came with, since Mastro's was my choice. for what it's worth, that was the only time i've tried the place out. i do have plans to return though... everyone else who swears by this place strongly urges i try again, saying it's probably just an isolated incident. we'll see
