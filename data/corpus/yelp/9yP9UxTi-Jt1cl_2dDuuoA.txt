Restaurant: Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
Yes! . . Yesterday was the beginning of my winter love affair! The instant I walked through the door, there was no evidence of that elusive fishy smell, like most sushi chains in the city. The restaurant was clean, and very soothing to the eye. The hostess, and servers were really funny, and nice. Everything a guy could ever want in a relationship. . . The food, was AMAZING. By far, my favorite was the Spicy Tuna Cracker; dual layers of seaweed coated in panco-crumbs, wrapped around sticky rice, and pan fried until crispy, then a heavy dollop of sushi-grade tuna with a spicy sauce on top. Total heaven! Of course, my friend ordered us $70.00 worth of other rolls that were little delights rolled perfectly to fit in my mouth, and belly! . . The sushi rolls were a bit pricey, but totally worth its value. Unlike the other sushi restaurants in town, infamous for its loud chants of "saki-bombs" Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar is definitely my favorite!
