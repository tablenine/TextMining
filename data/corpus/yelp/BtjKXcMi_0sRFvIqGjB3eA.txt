I was really impressed.  This review is based on the upstairs, which is swankier than the first floor.. . It's nicely laid out - it would be a great place for a private party, actually, and has an outdoor deck for warmer days.. . I had their whole bass, which was quite good.  Nicely seasoned, cooked perfectly with crispy skin but still moist and flavorful meat.  My dining companion had one of their skirt steak preparations, and it was very tender and flavorful, really nice.  It was the really thin style of preparation like is done in more authentic sorts of places, compared to the thicker ones you get in tex-mex or American restaurants that serve skirt steaks.. . Service was very good, attentive and friendly and very accomodating.. . I'll be going back even though it's pretty far out of the way for me.
