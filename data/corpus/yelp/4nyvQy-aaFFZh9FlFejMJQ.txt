Category: Italian
Not sure of the 'New York' feel -- maybe 'Vegas' idea of New York Feel' but either way the food was pretty good -- I didn't come to LA to eat Italian but no one wanted to go the east LA for tacos, so, alas.. . I think I would Â go here a lot if I lived here -- in NY, it seems like it would just blend in with all the others...
