Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Really? You want to go to Tito's? Can't we find a Taco Bell around here? The first time I went, will also be the last. These tacos remind me of the ones they used to give us in the school cafeteria, only not as good. Â I will never understand the hype, or why people find it ok to stand in line for such a long time to eat this stuff. The staff was mean. The patrons were mean.I don't like it when people are mean. I will blacken an eye. C'mon people, just because a place has been around for years, does not mean it is any good. Don't be such suckers! Say no to the Tito's! Stand up for yer tastebuds! I gave this place one star because the drink was cold and refreshing on a hot day.
