I only got their croissants, so take this review for what it is.. . Ham and Cheese Croissant-  I like the nice big size.  I got it cold though, they never warmed it up for me.  Cold, it tastes OK, very filling. .. . Strawberry and Cream Cheese Croissant- Huge croissant, a little dry and crusty with a sugar crust, I liked how they put real strawberries inside (a huge plus, normally, it's just spreadable jam) but it wasn't a buttery, flakey croissant like I'm used to.. . They say they have the best croissants outside of Paris- yeah, right.  The best croissants I've had outside Paris are in SF.  This place is OK- it's just a good quick bite to eat if you're in the area.
