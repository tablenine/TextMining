Restaurant: Café Santorini
Category: Greek
I had my wedding reception at Cafe Santorini's banquet area, The Rococo Room.  A great experience from start to finish!  The staff did a great job of setting up the decorations and the space looked beautiful.  The food was delicious and people raved about the cocktails--especially the Raspberry Mojito.  The staff was incredibly attentive and did a wonderful job keeping everything on track.  If I were to do it over again, I wouldn't change a thing.  The banquet manager, Keith, was especially helpful throughout the whole process and did a very professional job of organizing everything and assuaging every worry I had.  And did I mention the food was amazing?
