Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I heard and read every review about this place and became curious about what "Father's Office" had to offer and after visiting Papa's Oficina , not much! . . We approached the restaurant full of intrigue as F.O. virgins and saw the sea of people embarked in the patio. We walked in, ordered our  food and of course beer. The choices of beer attained 5 stars from me. 5 for their wide selection and 5 for the ones my friends and I attempted to drink. . . Finding a seat in (what seemed to be) the only liveliest place there was to find in Culver City (correct me if I'm wrong, please let me be wrong) was annoyingly impossible. Those two words should NEVER go together, but they really do with this place.  With the large crowd that this spot draws in on a Thursday night, a party of 3 walked around with a hand of beer and our order number and in the other was a basket of fries. This was for a good 10-15 minutes. We were very patient and were fortunate to share a table with a couple who were in midst relationship brawl. Talk about awkward! . . As for the food, this is DEFINITELY NOT the place for a vegetarian, like myself. I tried to compensate and ordered the Spanish Mushrooms and Sweet Potato fries with garlic aoili dipping sauce. I can deal without the mushrooms and the sweet potato fries were not impressive. . . So, from my experience would I come back? Yes, just for the beer. Did I enjoy it as much as everyone else did who constantly raves and rants about this place? No way, Father.
