I've read about the W&amp;D truck for quite some time, so I was so happy to see them on west 4th on a Friday night.  Even after a filling dinner in the neighborhood, I dragged my boyfriend there because I just HAD to try them.  . . When I got there, I just stared in wonder and amazement.  The 2 guys there were really friendly and helpful in explaining everything.  I decided to go all out with a liege wafel and WMD (Wafel of Massive Deliciousness).  The WMD is unlimited toppings for an extra $2, so we got strawberries, bananas, nutella, dulce de leche, spekuloos spread (really good!), belgian chocolate fudge and whipped cream. AND on top of that we got a scoop of Tahitian vanilla ice cream.  (Total $9). . OMG.  It was disgustingly good!  I really didnt think we would finish all that, but we devoured that on the street like savages.  I can't wait to go get me some yummy W&amp;D again if I can find them!
