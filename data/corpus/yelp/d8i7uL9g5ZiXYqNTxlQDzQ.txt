Who is the adorable, sassy man behind the counter of the wine bar? One of my top "whatever number" service peeps in LA, hands down! The best part was when he took the Spanish peanuts left over from my caramel copetta and put them in the most precious plastic to-go container. I think they are still festering in my fridge for posterity sake.. . This last trip, it was all about the beets with horseradish. Chopped salad was unremarkable in comparison to others I have had in town, which is not to say it wasn't perfectly tasty and fresh as a daisy. I prefer the tricolore, with the fumes of anchovy goodness permeating my sinuses. Â I had the clam pizza which was nice, but I still concede that the gorgonzola doce and fennel sausage pizzas are the winners. And I really should just stick with the butterscotch buddino for desert everything, with the salt and the rosemary cookies - done! Now if only they would permanently place that exquisite olive oil gelato on the menu like at Otto - hello!. . But good service matched with healthy doses of irony go a long, long way. Wine bar for me every time...now what the f*ck is his name? Tell his boss to give him a raise. LOL
