I've only had the coffee and bought a few things in the gourmet take-out but I really like what I've seen of this place so far. The interior is wonderful - bright and cheerful and a great balance between traditional and contemporary. All of the staff I've interacted with have been super friendly and efficient. I plan on going back for a more substantial meal as soon I get Downtown again.
