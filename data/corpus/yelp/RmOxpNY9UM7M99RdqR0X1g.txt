Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
We went Saturday night and found Dolce to be an absolute ghost town which was to be expected at 8:30 p.m. the night of the 4th.  As usual, we posted up to the bar to eat.  Our server, the bartender, was very attentive and helpful, but not overbearingly so.  I felt bad for everyone working there, it was literally that slow (3 tables in the dining area and then us/another couple in the bar area) - do you hear the crickets??  Hopefully things picked up for them post fireworks.. . The b.f. had the Dolce chopped salad which was super good &amp; I had the caprese which was "meh".  I hate super soft mozzarella which is what this salad had.  The tomatoes (yellow &amp; red) were sliced a little too thin, so the mushy mozz was a bit overbearing.  . . For entrees, I had the lobster pappardelle &amp; he had the shrimp &amp; scallop scampi.  There was a generous portion of lobster claw in mine, but you could tell that it was a day or two old; still tasty and I had a nice amount to take home with me.. . I had the molten chocolate cake w/ vanilla gelato for dessert which was nothing special.  . . It was cool to go back to Dolce as it had been a good couple of years since either of us had been, but unfortunately, I'm in no rush to get back.
