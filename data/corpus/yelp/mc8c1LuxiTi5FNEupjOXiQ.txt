We made our first visit late last year as we are in downtown quite often.  We took our nephews that were visiting from Hawaii here last week.. . Everyone got the world famous beef while I of course chose the pork.  Both are great, but the pork is tastier and will kill you faster and I'm not in the mood for a slow death.. . I ordered everyone 2 lemonades apiece as they are the schiznit, but sized for very small people.  Tried the potato salad and prefer the cole slaw.  Slap some slaw in between those buns and you've got a winner!. . We also tried the tapioca pudding, which I also recommend.  The kids had an eye opening experience with the mustard.  They are used to eating wasabi, but were somewhat unprepared for the heat of the mustard.  Use it sparingly if it is your first visit.. . Even seeing the cockaroach infestation that closed Phillipe's for a day on the news last year can't keep me away.  C'mon, does anything that's been around since 1908 not have a few bugs lurking about?
