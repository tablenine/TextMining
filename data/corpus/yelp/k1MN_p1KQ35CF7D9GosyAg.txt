hee hee hee...me lerv sooooshheee long time. . Come on folks.  Maybe if you are an emaciated zombie wearing size negative 1 seven against antihumanity jeans you can get your fill from this joint, but to leave this place and not need a chili dog afterwards requires some serious cash....probably 175 a head.  Simply put, maybe this just is not the place for me.  Still does score pointage for highest quality ingredients, good service, a pretty room.  Oink!. . p.s.  It has a GREAT website!!!!
