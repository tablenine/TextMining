The meat is quite good. This is a great place for a group dinner... which I did on one night. The night before, had a date there. All good. . . The portions are enormous for a smaller person such as myself. good :) The fish was quite good, surprisingly. I thought I would be brave and go for something on the right side of the menu... and it was worth it! Most people order pork it seems. This is as Â safe a bet as you are going to have here. Their plantains are soooper yum.
