I came here on a Friday afternoon around 2pm and the restaurant was very busy since many USC grads were having lunch there. We waited for about 30 minutes before sitting down, but it was fun to people-watch since everyone looked like they were from The Hills. . . I enjoyed the atmosphere--it was lively and bustling, and the decor was clean and simple. I absolutely loved the bakery at the entrance, and I bought a box of macarons and caneles after my meal. For the bakery items, I suggest the salted caramel macaron. This was the best and most unique macaron I've ever tried!. . The food was pretty good. I really liked the pasta that I got, which was fettucine noodles with olive oil, basil, and fresh tomatoes. The pizza was also tasty, and the signature portabello fries were good as well.
