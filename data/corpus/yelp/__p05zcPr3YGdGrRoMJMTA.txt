Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
This resteraunt is AMAZING! We are from Chicago and have dined at places like Hugo's and Gibsons so we know what a good steakhouse is. The atmosphere downstairs in the bar is like an old school italian style steakhouse. Great music, drinks and very nice staff. We sat in the dining room upstairs for dinner and loved it. There is live piano music and beautiful decor. The wine list was so extensive but the waiter was great at helping me pick one out. My husband had a filet and said it was the best he has ever had! The shrimp cocktail, ahi tuna appetizer and wedge were incredible. Portions are very big but they will do half portions of certain items like the sides and salads. We will for sure be back soon as the service, food and wine were unbelievable!
