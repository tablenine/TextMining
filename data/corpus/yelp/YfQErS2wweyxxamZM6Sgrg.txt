Restaurant: Uncle Julio&#39;s Casa Grande
Category: Mexican
LOVE Uncle Julio's! My new favorite Mex restaurant! Chips were hot &amp; fresh. The salsa &amp; cheese dip have such unique flavors... the salsa was unlike any other I'd had. I couldn't quit! I had the tacos al carbon with steak... the steak was super tender, quacamole was awesome &amp; rice was different but a good different. I tried my friend's chicken enchiladas with the sour cream sauce -- delish! She ordered the frozen strawberry margarita which had the best real strawberry flavor but it was pretty potent. Our nice little server suggested the Swirl, their signature drink, (it's margarita &amp; sangria layered) and it was pretty strong but I slurped it down. So good! . I'll definitely return!
