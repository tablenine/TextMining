If I were rating Milk on their dessert menu alone, I'd definitely be giving it 5 stars.. . However, taking into account their actual menu, I'd give it a 3.5. . . On the upside, their desserts are pretty much a party in your mouth, no matter what you order. Homemade ice cream bars, ice cream sandwiches, cupcakes, oh my. Every item I've tried has been delicious. My favorites have definitely been the red velvet ice cream sandwich, as well as the red velvet "poppers", tiny miniature red velvet cupcakes with a small swirl of cream cheese frosting and a dash of red sugar sprinkles, a perfect bite-size if you don't want to indulge in all 300 + calories of the full-sized cupcakes.. . The ice cream sandwiches are amazing, but the red velvet is spectacular mainly because it's dipped in white chocolate and sprinkled with peppermint stick crumblings on top. I actually first tried the sandwich at Umami Burger, another great place on La Brea that serves Milk's ice cream sandwiches as well as some other desserts from Cake Monkey. . . The downside is their regular food. A friend of mine had their crispy skin half chicken. The flavors were good, but the food was served cold, which is a huge no-no in terms of service. I had their smoked salmon special which was a huge salad of baby arugula, boiled fingerling potatoes, green beans and a garnish of thin, crispy deep-fried onions that spilled off of my plate. The salmon itself was wrapped around some over-buttered green beans, but the fish was not featured as the main part of the dish, which I had presumed, and it tasted as if it had been left to sit at room temperature for a bit. . . All in all, the desserts are fantastic but I could easily pass on the main menu.
