I came to Birds for a birthday party and we all had a great time.  The birthday boy was able to reserve the back area where the dancing pole and cage are.  The staff at Birds treated us very well and made the experience awesome.  . . The beer is great and the food is delicious.  . . Towards the end of the night, they clear out some of the table to make room for some dancing and hoola-hooping.  They even let ladies dance on the back bar table.  It was a lot of fun.. . Occasionally, they will say a few things on the mic, to make the night even more fun.  While we were there, they said Happy Birthday a couple times and even shouted out to a girl who had her first tequila shot.. . Its a fun bar. . . You can probably find street parking.  But they do have valet and its $6.
