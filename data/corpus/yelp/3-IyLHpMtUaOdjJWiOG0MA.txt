This is a great neighborhood spot for a nice bite with a friend. I usually meet here on Saturdays for an extended breakfast/lunch with my friends and they are really okay with sitting for a couple hours, refilling your coffee and in general leaving you alone when you want them to.. . The breakfast is a great choice, and I really recommend their turkey sausage - tastes close to the real thing and fried up just rights. I really like that their omlettes and skillets aren't so monstrous that you can't finish them and are forced to waste food. Portions are great in essence. My friend is a big fan of their BBQ chicken sandwich.. . Service is nice, atmosphere is great and always plenty of seating even during busy times. A good go-to for any afternoon in Lakeview.
