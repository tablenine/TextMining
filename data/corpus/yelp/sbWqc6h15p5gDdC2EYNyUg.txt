Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
The Pad Thai was rather bland and lifeless and no heat.. . The coconut curry with chicken (ordered mild) just felt like it was missing something... salt maybe? There was no salt or pepper on the table so I couldn't give it a try. . . Their version of mild is my medium BUT they did reduce it from their normal. It matters alot to me if the kitchen responds to requests. The chicken in the dish was cooked perfectly. . . The cucumber salad was a nice break when the heat got to be too much for me. . . The overall meal was ...ok. The waiter was less than enthused to be there... but his service was timely and accurate. . . Joy's is a good place to people watch while having some lower priced food that isn't McDonalds or packed by your mom.
