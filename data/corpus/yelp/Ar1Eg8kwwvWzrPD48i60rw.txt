Fancy version of Cheesecake factory. . The interior and exterior design is very nice so i wanted to see how it was. . Bad choice. it was over crowded, like any other resturants on a weekend. but the foods were overpriced for what they were, although the portions are big, and the food isn't that great or tasty.. Service was mediocre. I would rather stick with Cheesecake factory. i love that place! . Like the others said, "Don't let the ambience fool you!!!". Seriously.......
