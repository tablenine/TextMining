Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
This is the closest Restaurant to my house and I don't go.  I love Mexican food, and I don't go.  I love to eat outdoors, they have great outdoor seating, and still I don't go.. I have eaten at Zocalo about 10 times over the past 8 years.  The food is just OK.  The only great thing I've had there is the guacamole.. Avoid the Sunday Brunch at all costs.  I've tried three times and have been disappointed every time. . The margaritas are good, not great, but are more expensive than other Restaurants in the area.. The food is a bit over priced for what you get as well.
