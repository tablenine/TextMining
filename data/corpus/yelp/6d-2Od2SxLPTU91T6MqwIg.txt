Ok people, say it with me: Pan-Asian.. .  Penny's might hide under the guise of Thai but it doesn't take a CIA operative to uncover it's more of a fusion than a straightforward store of Siam. And for that reason it's better than a lot of people give it credit for.. .  My personal favorite is the Thai Ravioli which is basically just a shrimp dumpling with a side of slightly fatty BBQ pork. Still, not that bad. My wife swears by their gyoza, I think they're alright. Your mileage may vary but I've heard Penny's accurately described as a slightly lesser quality Lulu's (see: Evanston).. . It is unfortunately smack dab in the middle of the ever-annoying Wicker Park and all the hipster traffic that comes with it. So wear those tight, tight jeans, roll your sleeves up, put those horn-rimmed glasses on and look like you're going to cry. You don't want to stand out, after all.
