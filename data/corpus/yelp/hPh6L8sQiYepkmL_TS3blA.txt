I came here with a few friends.  We left unimpressed and still hungry.  We are slim students, and even snacked before-hand!. . The food here is tasty, but definitely not worth the high prices, tiny portions, and mediocre service (i.e. the unfriendly waiter, blonde guy with the beard).  There are many other places that do most of the dishes here just as well and for less (ex: seared ahi tuna: portions were so small here.  There are plenty! of fine places that will serve you a well-sized ahi tuna that will leave you SATISFIED).  I had the duck with kimchi-hash.  To be honest, I've had very similar dishes at super-cheap Korean/Chinese restaurants.  The interior reminded me of an Ikea catalogue.. . I'm glad I checked the place out, but will likely not return.. . Btw, the host Fletcher is cordial and cool.
