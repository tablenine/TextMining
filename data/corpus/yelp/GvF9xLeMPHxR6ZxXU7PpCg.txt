Okay, I figured I'd write an update to my initial review since I have gone back a few times since then.. . I didn't follow my "drinks only" rule from my previous review. I still haven't been SUPER impressed with the food, but at least we haven't had any problems with undercooked things or anything like that. So that's good. Also, I wanted to boost the rating because in retrospect, this place has one of THE best beer lists in the area. Gotta get some credit for that, right? Plus, every time I go there I am always thoroughly impressed with the servers. The food still sometimes comes out slow, but the servers have always been good to check in on us multiple times to make sure we're still doing well. And they're always friendly and even if they are in a rush, they don't act flustered. Plus, there is a small amount of outdoor seating, so that's always good too.. . Anyway, my new summary is: don't necessarily go for the food, and don't expect it to come out super fast. Go for the good service, the good atmosphere, and the best beer list in Lincoln Square.
