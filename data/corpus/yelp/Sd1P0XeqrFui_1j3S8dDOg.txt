Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
You can get your garlic-on,  otherwise, it's forgettable.. . My wife and I went there on my birthday, Tuesday, October 20th and found that despite a garlic-themed menu, the dishes were conventional.  If you like it, the waiters will sing Happy Birthday to you - I just happen to dislike that!. . The service was efficient, if impersonal, and the food was good, if rather plain.  We had the garlic pot, and then lamb, and meatloaf.  There was nothing wrong with the presentation and the taste, but it was just too plain.  My expectation is that a restaurant surrounded by high-end restaurants would be similar.  The Stinking Rose did not meet my expectation.. . The decor was kitschy with a miniature Italian town square setting and painted cartoon stars on the ceiling.  My wife felt she was on the set of Pirates of the Caribbean!  A definite touristy and novelty feel!. . Yeah, yeah, yeah, I tried the garlic ice cream.  It was my first time tasting it, and although it wasn't bad, I don't think I'll be craving it.
