I love going here! They have great sushi and a nice variety. Prices are reasonable, especially for a college student date night. The only thing I don't care for about Yamato is how they squeeze everyone in-it isn't unusual to eat your entire dinner almost immediately next to another table. You are so close you might as well share your conversation. The atmosphere is a little on the upscale side, but don't feel like you need to wear your absolute best. Service is alright; I am picky when it comes to customer service and they don't meet my high expectations, but they aren't horrible either.
