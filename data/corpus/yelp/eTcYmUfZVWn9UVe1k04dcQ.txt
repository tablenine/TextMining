After my Halloween plans fell through, I decided to take a walk around Union Square and look at the costumes anyway.  But tired from the day, I decided to just head home and found my way to Astor Place.  And then, right before the subway station was Wafels &amp; Dinges.  I LOVE BELGIAN WAFFLES and there is no way I could pass this truck without at least sampling their product.  Therefore I ordered a Liege (the more denser belgian waffle) with some powdered sugar.  Yummy!  Oh how I wish I always knew where Chief Wafel Master Thomas Degeest everyday in my life.  But then again that's probably a good thing 'cause I would most definitely be putty in his hand just for one of his creations.
