In my opinion, over hyped. Call me a critic or whatnot, but this place does not it for me like it used to the first couple times. I would rate this a 2.5/5 but I'll give it the extra half star for the ingenuity behind the idea. I believe through the Korean taco truck, a plethora of taco trucks emerged from it which is great in my opinion. . . I usually order their tacos which is two dollars a pop. The price is not great, but I'll still take it. I believe it's the sauce they use at this joint that keeps people coming back for more. But I don't see anything special about it since it's used widely in the all you can eat Korean barbecues. . . All in all, It's a green light when craving midnight snacks. The tacos leave such a satisfying taste without making me feel guilty.
