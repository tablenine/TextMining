Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The office is a good place for someone who loves all kinds of beer. I've been there 5 times and tried about 9 different beers. The food seems to be ok but I've only tried the burger. But I wouldn't go there for the food. I do wish there were more tvs or even a bigger tv. Can't really watch the game there in all parts of the bar
