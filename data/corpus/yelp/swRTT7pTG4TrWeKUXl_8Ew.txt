I've been here once on a date and it was alright.  The food is quite good actually, its the atmosphere I can do without.  The place does not look like an Asian restaurant at all.  I felt like I was going to be meeting up with Carrie Bradshaw and the gang.  I can't remember if our server ever said anything to us.  It was like being handled by robots - trans-gendered asian robots haha.  Oh well, I'd get the food again anyways.  The orange chicken was pretty tasty.
