Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Food gets four stars because the selection could be a little better.  Korean bbq buffets are not a novelty to me, so throwing heaps of meat at me is not an automatic ticket to five stars.  Though, can't really beat all you can eat meat for $16.  At those prices, almost anyone can beat this buffet.. . My other complaint is that the servers aren't very nice about bringing out lots of meat.  Other than that, this place is great.  I noticed it's a great place for large groups (10+) and they have free valet service so you don't have to worry about parking.. . UPDATE: The service has really gone down since my first visit over a year ago. I still think the atmosphere is fun &amp; I don't leave feeling light-headed from smoke inhalation like at Gui Rim.  In terms of AYCE, Mu Dung San is far better.
