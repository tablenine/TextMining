Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Not only are these the "best fish tacos in Ensenada", but they're seriously the best fish tacos in the Ensentire Unada States!!" Wow, that was an EPIC fail.... . Being from LA, it's hard not to love Mexican food and/or tacos, and there are a million hole-in-the-wall places that you could fall in love with in this city. But for fish and shrimp tacos, this place takes the cake...or the batter (haha, pun intended...EPIC fail #2). Normally, fish tacos taste a little strange to me--not sure if it's the batter or the fish, but I've had many funny tasting fish tacos--even at really good Mexican places. . . I went for the first time last week, but I do have to rave that the freshly fried fishies (no, really, they fry it in a big vat of oil right in front of you--god, I wanna put a turkey in that mofo) are amazing here. The batter is simply superb. And they're only $1.50 each!!! There are also delish shrimp tacos for $2.00 each. Actually, sometimes the tacos are even FREE if the owner happens to be there and happens to like you (he seems like a really great guy!!). You get them plain on a tortilla and then you have the option to add the shredded cabbage; the pineapple kiss, mad mango, or guac salsa or whatever floats your boat (they're all yummy and spicy); and the magic cream sauce. DON'T FORGET the magic cream sauce! I honestly can't remember if it's actually called "magic" cream sauce or I made that up...I give EVERYTHING nicknames. Sorry. Oh, and don't forget to try the $1.00 horchata. It's made with moro so it doesn't taste like the typical Mexican horchata you've had everywhere else. It's more nutty and apparently the Guatemalan style of horchata. I very much would like to drunk eat here sometime, but whether you're pissed drunk or not, this place stands the test of taste!!!
