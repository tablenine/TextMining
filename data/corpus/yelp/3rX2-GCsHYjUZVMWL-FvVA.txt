My coworker took me here a couple years back to try out the vast amount of dumpling choices.  Everything is just great here...even the things you least expect taste so good.  Even for those of you who are not fans of vegetarian food, you will love their veggie dumplings.  They rock!  Try everything.  Their pork dumplings,shrimp/pork dumplings,crab/pork dumplings. Their dumplings look different from other dumplings 'cause the way they form and shape them are unique. Have fun eating!
