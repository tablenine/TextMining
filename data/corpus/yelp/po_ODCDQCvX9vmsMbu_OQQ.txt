I managed sandwich shops for 7 years, so I try to avoid sandwich places, but this one is really pretty good. Huge portions, amazing prices (especially for the neighborhood), good service.. . Lots of veggie options. . . Seating is a little close, but everyone is friendly, so it works.. . Probably the best option for a sandwich in the neighborhood.
