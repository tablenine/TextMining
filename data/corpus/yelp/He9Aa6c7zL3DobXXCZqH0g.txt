A little baobei (that's treasure in Chinese) for baos.. . Shared the Royal Frush (any 6 baos (ordered two of each bao), bao fries, and a cup of boiled peanuts) amongst 3 people.. . Baos and boiled peanuts were delicious. HOWEVER, my only problem would be the bao fries. Maybe because I enjoyed the baos more, but I felt that the fries acted as a filler.. . After 2 baos, several bao fries and many peanuts, I felt full but not stuffed. . . Atmosphere was pleasant, although it did get quite noisy as customers began to enter the small, I mean XS, store. At one point, I could barely hear my friend sitting next to me.. . Would recommend people if you're looking for that chill, hip neo-Asian eatery that Â serves delicious bao.
