My friends and I went here just because we needed something quick, and fast before we headed back to studio.. . I had heard many things about this place from my classmates, and they all seemed to really like this place.  This place is actually pretty good.  I haven't come by a second time but I plan on doing it so.. . Ordering here is simple enough.  If anything I'd stick to the ramen menu over the other dishes just because this is what they're known for.  I had a taste of my friends fried rice, but it's not like the best thing in the world.. . They do have a competition here and it was on Man Vs. Food.   I hadn't even known about it before until my Dad mentioned it to me.  There are different levels of spiciness and i think that the special 2 is the one where you have to finish the bowl in 30 min in order to have your picture taken and put on the wall.. . I had a friend in studio try it, and i heard that although he did complete it, he threw up like 3 times because of the meal.  I tried a medium spicy one (i cant remember which level) but i remember it being really hot! and it was a medium!. . I may not be an avid spicy lover, but I'm becoming one slowly.  I like this place.  It's clean and decent, and not overly priced.  It's fast food to go, and the portion's are pretty decent as well.  But there's nothing overly exciting about this place.
