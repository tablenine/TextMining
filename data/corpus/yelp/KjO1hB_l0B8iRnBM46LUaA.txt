Its not often I give 5 stars .. So let me just say ....this is as good as it  gets.  . I was out and about having a bad day all together and I had gotten lost on the subway so I was pretty much in a fowl mood. any place I went to I think I might have been displease with at this point but .....grumbling along the side walk stop by this place that looked to be a warehouse or something and it turned out to be the best find of all time (so far anyway).. Seriously, from the moment I stepped in until the moment I stepped out it was amazing!  I was seated almost immediately . The server was a very informative waitress. she kept eye contact the whole time which to me is important. the wine was delicious. the food came out almost immediately. And it was so ,so amazing. . After the main course I ordered dessert which again, could not have been any better. Over all this place was.......the best place I've been in Ny :):):);;)
