Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The hunt is on....for a MEATY BURGER, that is. I actually found it in my own back yard.  I first heard about the opening of Father's Office, at Helm's, last year I was taking classes across the street at the New School of Cooking.  . All I have to say is great burgers, great choices of beer, and a very hip atmosphere, this will likely be a new hang out spot for me.  The Office Burger is a gem and huge for a lone girl, I had to take the other half home.  I love the Sweet Potato Frites and the hefenweizen ain't too shabby.  I would love to try the other entrees as they look appetizing!
