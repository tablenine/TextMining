Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I am simultaneously bummed and relieved that this place isn't open past 8pm. Bummed because there have been many occasions late at night when i've been craving these more than a heroin addict craves a fix after his first week sober. And relieved because if they were open past 8, I'd look like those Guiness Book fattest twins, minus the twin and the motorbike. . . In all seriousness. This is one of the best places ever. Tacos, Yummy Salsa, BYOB and THAT'S IT. All at a more than fair price, and Joseph is an amazingly cool owner. . . I ate 5 fish tacos today, i'd like to say that's the most i've eaten there in one night. But it isn't.
