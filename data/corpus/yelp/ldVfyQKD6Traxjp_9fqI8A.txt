I came here again with a group of friends a couple of weeks ago. The wait time was about 30 minutes on a Friday night. This place is never a disappointment. We all ordered the Daikoku Ramen and boy was it good!! SO YUMMMMY!! We did order a few other things which is also worth mentioning: . . Gyoza - Very delicious. The skin of the Gyoza wasn't too thick like other places with just the right amount of filling . Sausage - Flavorful. Made from Kurobuta pork with saut√©ed onions . Sliced Roast Pork - Yummy. A Must Order dish!! The sweet glaze makes the flavoring of the pork come out. MMMM...MMMM...GOOD!! . Shredded Pork Bowl - Amazing as always. . Fried Rice - I was a little hesitant when my friend ordered this, but it is actually quite good. It even has corn in it!! . . Great experience as always.
