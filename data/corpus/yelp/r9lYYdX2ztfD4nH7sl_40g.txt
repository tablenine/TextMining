So i've eaten at the Santa Monica F.O. a few times &amp; this F.O. a few times and for some reason think Â the S.M. F.O tastes better.( Is it just me??!) I think the trick is the less time it takes to travel from the grill to your mouth, the tastier the burger is. The first time I had it, the burger was still bleeding out juice....it was so good.......  However, I give major kudos to the Culver City F.O. for being more comfortable and spacious!. . I tried non-burger dishes here with friends and shared the beet salad (good but not amazing) and the seared albacore (quite good!). I jumped along the beer bandwagon with Jenny L and joined her in an icy pale ale to go with our burgers. . . It's so nice to sit outside when the weather is nice and just gobble down good solid tasty food. Especially when it's accompanied by delicious sweet potato fries....
