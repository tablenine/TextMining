Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Tried Parkers for a safe choice for dinner with my Mom.  Read several reviews and had some strong personal testimonies from friends.  I must say Parker's met our expectations  Definitely a solid choice.  Waitstaff was a little quirky, but it made the night interesting.. . Pick up an Internet coupon and try out PP.  They also have great specials during the week.   . . My picks are the lamb app and salmon. Bread pudding dessert was excellent.
