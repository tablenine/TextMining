Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (New)
If heaven were a french fry...  Houston's would be your temple...  . . For a mall meal/ restaurant chain, this is the ticket.  The vibe is warm and cozy, yet active and bustling with the open air kitchen.  The service is great...  Penny is the best!  Her business-like radiance just makes you smile.  They have tender tasty burgers, pork chops, and BBQ ribs.  A consistently great date place, yet fun for a group too. . . Only disappointed that the key lime pie is seasonal...  =(  . Although, the apple cobbler is always a sure bet and feeds up to 6, I swear!!
