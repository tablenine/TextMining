I am addicted to their cheese rolls. I finally tried their potato balls, after numerous rec's from yelp, but they weren't really that enjoyable. I did order their Media Noche and Media Noche Preparada. Both sandwiches were decent, but somewhat on the dry side. The Media Noche Preparada was more buttery than the regular Media Noche. I enjoyed that they also carried Inka Cola!! I will just stick to the cheese rolls and only get the other items if I'm hungry and don't want to drive to other places.
