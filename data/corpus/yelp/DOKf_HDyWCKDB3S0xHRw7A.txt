I went to Comme Ca with friends for a birthday dinner.  When we arrived we were seated immediately in side room; it was quieter than the main room, which suited us perfectly.  . . We ordered sparkling water, and whenever the carafes were finished, another arrived immediately.  We started with moules frites and cocktails.  The mussels were tasty and fresh; a perfect appetizer to share with the table.  The cocktails here are good, but very strong.  . . For my main course, I had the rack of lamb which was heavenly and perfectly medium rare throughout.  The roasted brussels sprouts could have been left roasting a bit longer for my taste, but it was still good.. . My friend's duck confit, however, didn't have the skin on.  After the meal, she asked our waiter about it, and he said it had a thin layer of skin, but... I was there.  I had a bite.  There was no skin.  (That's just odd.)  She was immensely disappointed with her entree. . . All in all, I enjoyed my meal immensely, and would definitely return.  My friend's review might be slightly different.
