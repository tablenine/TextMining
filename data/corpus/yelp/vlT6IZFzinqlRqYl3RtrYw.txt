Are the portions here made for ANTS!? Zoolander thinks so. As do I.. . First and foremost, the decor had the feel of a commercial warehouse. Industrial stools and tables lined the interior; it was part grunge and part bicyclist haven.. . Secondly, the food was pretty decent.  We ordered the Korean Kogi sandwich, tostones, fries with curry sauce, and hot and sour soup. Now from my previous foray to urban belly, I came in knowing that the hot and sour soup wouldn't taste the same as one at your local Chinese restaurant. Therefore, with my expectations in check, I was pleasantly surprised with their version. The wonton crisps and spicy broth were soothing. The tostones (well mainly the chimichurri sauce) and the fries with curry sauce were definite standouts. The sandwich was basically Korean Bulgogi, sliced kim chi and pita bread. It was somewhat dissappointing - I found the seasoning to the meat lacking.. . My major gripe with the place are the portions. You could seriously leave here spending $12 and still be hungry.  Our other buddy ordered one of the salads as his main entree and the waiter came out with three small plates for sharing. Was the joke on us? The portion was good for at most one person, let alone three. Therefore, the value here, for a lack of better words, sucks.. . Probably won't be back unless I need a soup and carb fix.
