Restaurant: Hashiguchi Jr.
Category: Japanese
The Guch, as I affectionately refer to it, is one of the most authentic sushi places in Atlanta.  You know it's good when the staff and chefs are Japanese.  And being Japanese, this place definately makes the grade to my palate.  Fish is always fresh and presentation is exceptional. . . If I had to pick one dish to recommend, it would be the Beni-Toro (Salmon Belly).  Salmon does not get more flavorful or succulent than in this form.
