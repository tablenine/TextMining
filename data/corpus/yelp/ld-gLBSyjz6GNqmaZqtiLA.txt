Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
The food was very good and fresh but the service was lacking. I went on a Â saturday night and it was very crowded and took forever to get my food. Prices are also expensive but expected since the restaurant is very trendy. The sushi menu was really annoying. It listed all the sushi's they carry but no descriptions. How am I supposed to know what I am ordering. They could also use a larger bathroom. It was a one room bathroom for a restaurant that was very crowded - what were they thinking...
