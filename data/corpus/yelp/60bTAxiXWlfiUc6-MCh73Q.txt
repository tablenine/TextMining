Restaurant: Mary Mac&#39;s Tea Room
Category: Southern
I have dined here a couple of times. There are multiple rooms, and usually this restaurant is really busy. The last time I dined here, our fried fish took 30 minutes. But normally, the food comes out within 10-15 minutes. I would suggest Mary Mac's if your ever in Atlanta. I always normally get the chicken &amp; dumplins, just cause it's my favorite and it's delicious. The server usually also brings a tasty appetizer for free, which is a cup of pot likker with cornbread. Which actually is pretty tasty. Your choice of meal also comes with 2 sides. I really like the fried green tomatoes as one of my choices. The mac and cheese is just okay, and the souffle I had was just okay as well.
