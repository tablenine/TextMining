OK, I would go back here, I really would. And, disclaimer, I am not a vegan/vegetarian/"I only eat fish" type of person. My idea of a perfect night out involves something that moo'd or few, or had feathers to attempt to do so at some point in it's life. . . That being said; my much more adventurous friend wanted to go here and I ran out of excuses. . . I had the Vegan Brownie and Vanilla Soy Latte (they don't serve just coffee here). Now, very, very stoopid of me NOT to ask "how much is this brownie?" when looking at the dessert menu and not seeing any prices. . . Stoopid . . $6.50. That's right, six-fiddy for something that was about the size of my hand and was just OK. Nothing special, just, OK. . . The Latte was fine; I like soy milk so I thought it was pretty good. . . The service was fantastic. They were a little slow getting to us but after that, were super quick, attentive, and really friendly (but not in that annoying "I really wanna act" sort of way). . . My friend (who actually really likes this place) had a sampler plate with Lentils, Brown Rice, Kale, Cabbage thingy, Beets, and something else which escapes me right now). While I thought it looked really pretty; apparently, it tasted less so. The Brown Rice was a bit sweet, the cabbage thingy was pretty pungent, and she wasn't too fond of the rest. . . Now, per her words, the Salisbury steak is actually delicious and good for meat lovers trying to eat better, and their salads are amazing; so, based on that, and the service, I would totally give this place another go....just not for the SIX DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENT brownie.
