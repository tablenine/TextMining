Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
They fulfill my diner requirements:. . 1. Free re-fills on soda.. 2. They don't skimp on the french fries.. 3. Desserts are basic but incredibly tasty.. 4. Free candy at register.. 5. Feels like home. Actually, better than home because I live in a crappy studio and I am too lazy to cook for myself.
