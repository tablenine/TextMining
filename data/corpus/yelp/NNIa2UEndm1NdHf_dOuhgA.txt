Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I have been going to this place since I was 5 years old.  This place is amazing!  The food is some of the best Mexican food you can find.  The burritos are huge and always filled with nothing but the good stuff.  When it comes to burritos this place is ranked top in my book.. . My order:  Machaca burrito with extra cheese on top.  One order of guacamole and 1 quesadilla to share for the ride back with family.
