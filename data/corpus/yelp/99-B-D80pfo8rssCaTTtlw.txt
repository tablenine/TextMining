Went on a Friday night ~8pm and the place was totally packed.  Mr. Kahan (of Blackbird and Avec fame) has gone grungy with his latest venture, set in a converted mechanic's garage.  Started at the bar before squeezing our group of 8 into one of the spot's few tables meant for more 6 - it was cozy.  Ordered the entire menu (8 in total) x 2 .  The fish and al pastor tacos were great (and cheap!) but the queso fundido and salad were disappointing.   Would definitely go back for some of the food and the bar casual vibe.   Good for groups.
