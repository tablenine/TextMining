Restaurant: Nick&#39;s Food To Go
Category: Greek
I've lived in or been around Grant Park since I got to Atlanta in 98.  I've always passed by Nick's but never had the courage to go just because of the building / location.  After reading the reviews, I can saw WOW, how in the heck did I ever not try this place.  I can tell you the 1 review "nick is a monster" was all the motivation I needed to go to this place.  I figure if there is an owner who has a point where he'll just simply hang up on someone, he must be a pretty cool guy.  Like the soup nazi from "Seinfeld" this became a must go for me. . . I finally stopped there last night, great menu and the fact you can get Chicken, Fish, Livers and Gizzards made it even more interesting.  I did the simple Gyro Plate with fries, and a Greek salad.  This will become a once a week lunch stop for me now that I've found this little jewel.  I'd give it a 4.5 if yelp would let me and only because the Gyros are great, but I've been to others where they are Awesome.  The salad was simple but very awesome, and make sure you get the Gyro "all the way" it was up there on my list of best gyros.  Nick and the family won't let you down.  Just make sure you plan on taking it home or eating it i your car because other than the small bench for waiting there is no seating.  If you've never been go to there very basic web site and download the menu in word form: . http://nicksfood.com. /
