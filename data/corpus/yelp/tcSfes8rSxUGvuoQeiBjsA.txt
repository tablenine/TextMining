Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
When I moved out to LA, this was the first place I stopped at.  Someone recommended it, and I was tired and hungry from a 800 mile car trip.  Gloria still greets me as she did that first night I strolled in.  (She ALWAYS says, "hey, I know you!"  Even if she says it to everyone, it still makes me feel special!).  Her grandkids are probably very lucky and very well-fed.. . It's a family joint for the most part, and her sons/grandsons/cousin's nephews work in the back.  They'll fix you up whatever you want... although the best dishes are the traditional pupusas and the fried plantains (served in the traditional style--with black beans and sour cream).  I know when I order those two things, I'll be happy and full.  This is a good place to bring a couple of friends.  Buy a pitcher of Sangria--it packs a punch, though.  The salsa (a big deal to me) is very good and just the right amount of spiciness.  Like the rest of the food there, it's super fresh and they'll bring out as much as you can eat!. . As for other offerings: My friends and family usually get the seafood soup and the shrimp cocktail.  I usually have a bite, and even though seafood isn't my thing, it's pretty delicious. The place is cozy and a little on the small side, but really reminds me of the down-home cooking I experienced in Central America.  ~Siempre Sabroso~
