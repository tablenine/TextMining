I've been here twice now, and I can safely say, um, YUM. The pizza is delicious. The brunch is pretty fantastic. And the wine is a-flowin'--they have a pretty extensive list. Don't expect, though, to dash in and out for a fast food pizza experience. The servers here are super chill (and nice) and take their time, allowing you to relax and have a finer and SLOWER dining experience. . . Oh and don't even get me started on the bottomless mimosas. Dangerous!
