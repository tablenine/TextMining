Lala's is la la la deee da awesome.  It's the perfect place for whatever size your party is.  . . We started out the night with free bread.  That warm, chewy, fresh out of the oven taste.  The pesto olive oil was dee-freakin-licious.  I kept shoveling and scooping and smothering it all over the bread.  I must have eaten 2 baskets by myself easily.  It went well with the pitchers of Sangria that kept coming at our table.  Light and crisp.  . . The menu items are most gorgeous. Meat.  Meat.  And more meat.  During the course of the night, I managed to try the ribeye, the skirt steak, the filet mignon, flat iron steak, the rice plate, the mashed taters, salad, fries.   I think the hit for the meat was definitely the skirt steak.  It was just rare enough, juicy, and tender.  The ribeye was okay but it looked kind of small to me.  The iron and filet were decent and well portioned.  The rice pilaf was aromatic and fluffy.  The mashed potatoes almost tasted like they could have been from a mix.  The fries were freshly cut and fried.  . . So in conclusion, eat hoards of the bread, drink hoards of the sangria, and eat your weight in skirt steak medium rare.
