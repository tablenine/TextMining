Big Star? More like Big Disaster!. . My lovely colleagues and I made our way here today to enjoy lunch on their patio. It's not the prettiest of patios, but who cares when the suns shining on ya.. . The 3 of us ordered the following:. chips and salsa. a diet coke, limeade and a horchata. 3 salads. 3 tacos (a variety). . Our waitress had a little trouble understanding this not so complicated order, but assured us she was bright because she had a PhD. Â Not sure in what, but apparently not waitressing.. . * We had to ask for the chips twice. * We had to ask for our drinks 3 times. * 2 of the salads made it out, although mine got lost in the shuffle and I had to ask for that about 8 times. * After an hour and asking a dozen times we gave up on the tacos, but they came out just when I needed to leave for an appointment. . When we inquired about our order PhD waitress apathetically blamed the kitchen and mentioned every single one of her tables was having problems this afternoon. However, one of the guys from the kitchen told us the problem was that she wasn't putting the right orders on the ticket. Instead of listening to excuses we would have rather them just gotten it right.. . We asked to speak with the manager, Lisa, who was apathetic about the entire situation as well. She did end up taking care of our meal, but that's to be expected based on the awful experience.. . As for the food.... My veggie taco was inedible and while the salad tasted OK I found a hair in it, the perfect ending to the worst lunch experience ever.. . Just 1 Big Star for these guys! Never again...
