I've heard so much about this place but i never made an extra effort to drive all the way here. My sister and my mom always bug me to drive them to this place since they are so lazy to drive their ass over here. For some reason after my training I had the urge to go to this place but i don't have the address good thing my teammate had it and they wanna join too!!! So after having lunch in Pho77 we all drove here. It took us an hour to drive here since the traffic is a bitch!. . When I drove by I saw some people but once i walked in it was PACKED it was freakingly busy!!! It crazy like black friday!!! So I'm telling myself this should be effin' good its an hour drive it better be worth it. There's like two sections of the store one for the sandwiches and the other for the pastries. Since i just finished having lunch its time for desserts so pastries it is! the line was looooooooooooooong! good thing they have enough servers to assist you as you pick what you want so I looked and just grabbed 3 coconut strudels, 3 apples strudels, 4 cheese rolls, 3 cheese and guava strudels, 2 guava roll, 3 macaroons and 2 coconut balls? Looking at it it looks like i ordered too much already cause i filled up one big box so I was all set. When i paid it came to less than 15 bucks! I was like Fo realz!?!?!? I was so tempted to get some more but I have to stop cause i know i'll end up eating everything on my own. . . The best way to avoid eating all these stuffs is to share it so i brought it to my sister's place and share it with them. Â . . My favorite? . CHEESE ROLL!!!!. . Next time i'm getting a dozen!. . And i'll try the sandwiches and potato balls too.
