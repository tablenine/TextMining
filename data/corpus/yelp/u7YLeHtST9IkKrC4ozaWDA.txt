Outrageously spicy.  . . That about sums up their special 2.  My first trip to this place, i decided to give the challenge a shot--since nothing else really caught my eye.  So my friend decided to also join in on the fun.  And as we were joking about how  we could finish it, another visitor--who had already been seated and had be working on special 2 for a while--all of a sudden barfs.  And to go with the whole barfing action, he added some sound effects that I found really funny.  So my friend and I decided to start joking about how we would barf.  And if we really tried to finish it, we probably woudl have.. . Compared to the few other orders this restaurant has, the special 2 is loaded with a whole lot of soup and it definitely makes it challenging. Its key factor of attracting people is how spicy the noodles actually are.  Well, to be honest, it wasnt all that spicy.  The biggest challenge would be gulping down a roughly three-fourths of a gallon of hot water with several varieties of Mexican chili and peppers.  Thats really all the challenge is.. . The portions, on the other hand, are very lacking.  The most youll ever get from this restaurant is a lot of liquid (water, spicy oil, soup base etc).  To me, the challenge is just a gimmick to get people to try the place out.  For a whopping 7 dollars for food taht doesnt fill you up, Id rather go somewhere else to barf my meal up.  Atleast, some place where I dont have to torture myself.. . Oh and a good word for this place: the environments nice.. . I wasted enough time eating at this place, let alone writing for it.
