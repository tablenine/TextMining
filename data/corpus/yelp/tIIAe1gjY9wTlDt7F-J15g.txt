This place is pretty darn good.  We used to go to Harmony, but Green Sprouts beats Harmony.  The food is less oily and the location is more convenient.  The General's Chicken is the best!. . No ambience and the owners are pretty cranky - a husband and wife team that are usually bickering with each other.  Haha!  Its fun!
