Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
my roommate and i are staying away from meat this week for a religious holiday. so when we drove past titos after a fun tango class, starved and craving something filling, i remembered that someone mentioned they made some pretty decent veggie tostadas.. . two stars for fresh lettuce, soft and plentiful cheddar cheese, a tostada shell that didn't get soggy and LOTS of salsa. however, the salsa was REALLY mild and just didn't do it for me. at the end of the meal, i feel like i ate a bowl of lettuce w/ some beans &amp; cheese. meh.. . i guess it did the trick, but still. for $2.10 a tostada, i guess i expected more. much more. for $2.10, i can go to King Taco and get a bomb ass carne asada taco. meanwhile, Titos doesn't even SERVE carne asada?? wth?
