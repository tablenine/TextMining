Did someone say all you can eat fine dining?  Because that's pretty much what you get when you come here.  Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating the "fine dining" but this place is off the chain for sure.  Imagine endless meat, (and I mean all kinds of meat), coming your way with a simple flip of a card.  What a great idea, you gotta love those Brazilians.. . Dinner is a bit on the pricey side (about $50-60), so I always try and go during lunch (1/2 price and the same amount of food).  I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but I even enjoyed items in their salad bar.  And for dessert they have fried plantains.  The meal was so good, I almost cried.. . My favorite had to be the lamb shank and the pork ribs, followed by the bacon wrapped filet.  I've tried other chuscarisa places in different cities (Brazas in Cleveland, some other place in Charlotte NC) and I'd have to say this is one of the few "chain restaurants" I give my seal of approval.
