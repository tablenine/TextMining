Restaurant: Over Easy Caf√©
Category: American (Traditional)
I went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars on this but ultimately decided that overall it was decent but just not stellar. The service was fantastic, friendly, quick, and very attentive. The coffee was also fresh, tasty and my cup never went dry. I had the sassy eggs and blueberry granola pancakes, and both were good but nothing special, and at $10 each I was expecting them to be a bit more than average. Also the $3 tiny cup of OJ was kind of a joke. This place is so tiny too that it was packed to the brim on a Tuesday, I can only imagine what it is like on the weekends. Speaking of the size, I like small, cozy places but Over Easy is almost too small, every time the small child on the other end of the restaurant shrieked it was as if I was sitting right there, and I can only assume everyone else in the place had a similar experience. All in all I would return if someone wanted to come here, but there are definitely other places I would prefer to brunch in this city.
