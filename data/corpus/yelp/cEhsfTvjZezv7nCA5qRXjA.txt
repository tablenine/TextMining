I want this restaurant in every neighborhood I ever move to.  Ever.  the brunch is completely amazing and the atmosphere is alive, young and hip-- minus the tragically.  Everyone feels comfortable and the service is great. Not too pricely, either.  Looking for my loft off Washington as I type... ;)
