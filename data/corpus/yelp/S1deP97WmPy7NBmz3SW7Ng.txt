I agree with some peoples reviews about this place. Its a little over-rated but to me, the fried chicken tastes better than KFC. The waffles are delicous! I even dip my chicken in the syrup! This is the only place you'll see me putting pepper and hot sauce on my waffles.. It just seems to go with the crazy theme of chicken and waffles.. . I always try to make it here everytime im in the Hollywood area.. Its so different from the foods we have in the bay area.
