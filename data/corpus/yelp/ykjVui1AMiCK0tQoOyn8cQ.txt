What can I say that hasn't already been said? (And I'm sure that's already been said too). . This place is the tits. I had the country breakfast with scrambled eggs, french toast topped with banana, and sausage. It was nothing short of amazing. The staff was very friendly, the atmosphere was nice, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back and will.. . I've driven by on the weekend and it looks packed so if you're planning on coming I would shoot for a weekday. My only complaint is that it took me this long (ten years of living in the area) to find this place. I apparently didn't get the memo. I guess that's just a testament to how many great places there are in LA and how something can be under your nose for that long that you never notice but finally see it.
