I want to give this place 5 stars because the pork banh mi tried at both the Lexington and St. Marks location were delicious. Michael Bao even made my sandwich himself at the former spot. BUT, and it's a big butt (pun intended), I've never had a banh mi before I tried them here. I know, I know. Bad foodie. . . Anyways, my eyes have been opened to this classic Vietnamese sandwich. And at $5, I'm hooked.
