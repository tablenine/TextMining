This place is dangerous to my wallet. Best beer bar in LA by far. The taps are switched out regularly. Lots of wonderful West Coast brews with a good bit of other locales too. Nothing here is cheap, but it's all worth the price. If you get there right around 6-630 you can snag a table outdoors. The bartenders are very knowledgable. They will always give great advice on new beers to try. Just make sure to double check the prices before you order. There are a few $50+ beers...
