Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
Figured I need to write an update for Vic's since I renounced my vegetarianism last summer. The BBQ ribs and pork chop are my new favorite things... when I can afford them. I need me a sugar daddy, fo' rizzle. (Or maybe a pork daddy.). . I have grown to love this place so much, for reasons I seem unable to articulate. Maybe it's the cheesy Hawaiian-themed decor, which for a brief moment lets me pretend I'm back in Kona. Maybe it's Big Mike and the band, and their amazing rock-lounge versions of "Come Sail Away" and "My Heart Will Go On". Maybe it's how I always seem to meet awesome people at Vic's, and occasionally run into local celebrities (look, voice actors from Adult Swim ARE celebrities to me, okay?!). Or maybe it's the drinks, which never fail to produce amusing drunken shenanigans among my friends. Especially the mai tais, which are consistently mixed to be deadly strong.
