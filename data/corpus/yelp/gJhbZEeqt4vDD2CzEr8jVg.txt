Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
With this many positive reviews it's obvious Din Tai Fung is yum. It was my first time and I plan on returning soon. We asked the waiter what the most popular and tasty dishes were and ordered accordingly. I'm not a pork fan but naturally everything that's considered supreme has pork...when in Rome. . I loved the pork and shrimp dumplings, glad to see they have whole shrimp wrapped in the little pouches. The dumpling skins are thin so they don't overwhelm the inside. We also ordered the steamed house beef soup. The meat was tender and the soup wasn't too heavy. But my favorite had to be the dessert. I'm a lover of red bean and the red bean dumplings were bites of heaven. . . it is pricey for the size and portions but the food and staff make it a pleasant experience. I went on a Saturday for lunch, didn't run into too much of a wait for 2. I can't wait to go back!
