The place is loud and busy and the valet parking is expensive like hell. Good this is the fennel sausage pizza was great....the caprese was very good too especially if you order the bread with it.  Some things i didnt' like were the squash blossoms.  I know they're deep fried but man it was soaked through w/ oil and kind of disgusting.  I would not order the anchovy pizza again either.
