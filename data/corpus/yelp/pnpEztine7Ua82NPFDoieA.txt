As other have already posted...all you need to know is ONE thing. Pasadita (the one that sits alone on Asland) has the best steak taco's in the city. period. try them with just salsa, cilantro and onion and cheese if you must. Such a great lil taco stand that could be the best if your thing is steak tacos.
