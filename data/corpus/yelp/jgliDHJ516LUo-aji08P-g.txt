The ramen came highly recommended, and it was VERY GOOD - tasty, complex, and not too salty. Also, liked the pork rice bowl (full of taste, but too much rice). And, liked the cold sesame noodles -- except for the deli turkey. Maybe it's traditional, but in that case, I want bastardized. Good though. Real good.
