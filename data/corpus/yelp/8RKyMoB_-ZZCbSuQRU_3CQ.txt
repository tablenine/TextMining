OK, so I heard it was fantastic. It wasn't, but it wasn't bad either. Could have been our poor pizza selection - buffalo chicken pizza. Salads were huge, imagine if I got the order right it would be better and since I got two Groupons, I'll be back to confirm. Wait staff fit the atmosphere and were good - even told me to remind him to add the Groupon since he would forget - and he did forget just as he mentioned. Cools guys though. . Don't order more than one dish for two people - they're huge! And it was surprisingly expensive - kind of a turn off. $68 check for two people.
