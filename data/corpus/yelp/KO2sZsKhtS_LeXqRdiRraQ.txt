Yay  if you like to have chicken and waffles this is the place to go.  I love their chicken wings .  Their waffles are huge at least that what I think.  Upon arrival we were greeted and seated with no wait. Our server took our order. The food was done and served within 15 minutes.  Only 4 stars cause they don't have a parking lot for themselves. You have to park on the street.  I guess that goes with being in LA.  Also the place is dim inside.   They also have a security guard in front that looks like easy-e. . . Yup I am a fan of  Roscoe's Yum chicken
