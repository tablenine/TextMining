Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Home. Made. Tortillas!. . It's all about these AMAZING homemade flour tortillas! You can see them making the tortillas right by the front of the dining room. And when you get them with your order, they're served with butter. Yes, that's right. Embrace your inner Paula Deen and BUTTER YOUR TORTILLA.. . The plates of food are good. Flavorful carne asada with good sides. But damn, I just can't stop going back to those tortillas! Seriously, it's worth it to brave the 45-minute wait for a table just for some of those immaculate flour tortillas. Don't even bother with the corn tortillas.. . Paco's Tacos! I've never even had one of their tacos but it's one of my favorite Mexican restaurants of all time! On the westside at least.
