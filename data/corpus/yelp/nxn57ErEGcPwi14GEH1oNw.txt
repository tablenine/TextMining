Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
When I was a kid coming into the city for concerts, this place was great!  . . But then I moved here and realized that there are thousands more restaurants that are way better.  The food is good but it's a bit overpriced.. . Sometimes the serving staff can be grumpy and irritable, which sucks since their job is to serve you food.  . . I'd say this place is OK, but nothing more than that.  If you want simple food, go to another diner (Hollywood, White Palace, etc).
