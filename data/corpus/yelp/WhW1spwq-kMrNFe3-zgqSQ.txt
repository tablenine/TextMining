This is the place that re-introduced me to Shabu Shabu.  I had it a few times growing up as a kid and didn't think there anything special about it.  But when I tried it here, I completely changed my opinion about Shabu Shabu.  . . They have two sizes here and I got the smaller one, which turned out to be a perfect amount of food.  The meat quality here is excellent, really red and fresh looking.  You just dip it into the hot broth for a little bit and it's cooked!  The two dipping sauces are really great, although I enjoy the sesame one over the shoyu/ponzu one.  I can't remember which one is for the meat and which one is for the vegetables because I dip both into the sesame one!. . The wait is atrociously long so make sure you get there early!  I got there 30 minutes before opening and there was already a line of people.  Then an elderly Japanese gentlemen popped out with a clipboard that he placed on a stool.  Everyone crowded around putting their names down.  Mine was kind of far down cuz I didn't get to the clipboard fast enough and we ended up waiting 1 hour after it opened!!. . Luckily for me though, I live in the OC and we have the sister store, California Shabu Shabu in Fountain Valley.  I hear it's owned by the cousin of the guy who owns this one and it's practically as good----without the wait!!
