This is horribly overrated and a huge disappointment.  If you're trying to get in and dealing with the annoying reservation system of always saying all they have are 10:30pm tables left -- skip it.  First off, they have more availability but save tables for those with connections.  If you are able to wade through the game-playing and still choose to give Mario Batali a chance and can book one month early -- be prepared for a let down.  I have a feeling Batali has no idea how badly this place is and how disappointing the food is.  He clearly isn't there that much and it's quite obvious.. . Save your money and time -- avoid this place.
