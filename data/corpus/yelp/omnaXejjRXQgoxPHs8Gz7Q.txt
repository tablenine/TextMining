It was for my birthday, I should have chosen outback, but the friend that invited me was really excited about going here so I went along with it.. . Drinks were decent, but food was not. I ordered the mixed enchilada plate, and they were so gross and dry i just about gave up on even trying to eat them. I instead ate the carne steak my friend wasn't fond of because i could at least cut into it.. . It was too dark, we could barely see what was on our plates when the food was finally brought to us. The music, which by the way no one was dancing to, was not appeasing to the ears and actually made them ring.. . Needless to say, I'd much rather go to the taco truck on fulton and vanowen then to ever go back to that place again.
