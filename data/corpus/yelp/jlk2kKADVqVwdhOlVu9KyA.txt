Ehhh... this place is definitely not all it's hyped up to be.. . After seeing it several times on Food Network, especially as "best of" places... it just really doesn't measure up.. . I am a big fan of sandwiches...and this one is just plain bland. Also, my sandwich wasn't just bland...the bread was mushy... not juicy. . . The potato salad was mediocre. Nothing special but edible. . . I like the old-fashioned appeal of this place... but the food is really not that great. . . All in all, this place was a big let down. . . Try someplace else... like The Hat in Simi.
