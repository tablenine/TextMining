okay, this is another spot i take all my outta-towners to, if time (and weather) permitting..i think they open at about 4pm, so try and get there early, or you'll be waiting in the small waiting area, or out in the cold (or heat depending on the season)..although the place is cozy and dark, it was very kid friendly...the host guy is good...don't expect proper and prissy from him, he just wants to get u in and out..first and foremost, order the med breat...dip in olive oil, and shake, shake, shake the seasoning on there..delicious...yeah, and were schemin' to steal the seasoning too, but they were on to us, and took it away like the bad ass kids that we were..never got the pizza pot pie, but i'm sure its delicious..it was the reason why hit up this place, in the first place...my boy read about  it all the way from cali, and made sure we had to hit it...the sandwiches are wut u comeback for...meatball, salami..whatever, they are huge, and you will definently take the other half home to enjoy for lunch @  work the next day..haven't had a salad with the med bread, but it sure looked good on the table next to us...gotta have it next time! i'm sure everyone has said it in their reveiws, make sure u have cash..i guess thats the only negative i have of the place..but there's an atm on the corner across the street...parking is  a little rough too, if u dont valet...but the mint chocolate u get with your check makes up for it all!
