Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
old school burger joint that has not changed since it opened decades ago. one of the best burgers in l.a... worth the price and minor shortcomings. it gets crowded. a little uninviting if you're not familiar. small parking lot in the back + street parking. cash only.
