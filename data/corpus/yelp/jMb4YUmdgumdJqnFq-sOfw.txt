Restaurant: Varasano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Simply put, it was worth the wait.  My wife and I cozied up to the bar for a few beverages due to the hour wait and the bar staff was attentive and friendly.  It didn't hurt that we had a Rubik's Cube to play around with either. As some others may or may not have mentioned, the owner, Jeffrey Varasano, is a record breaking Rubik's Cube solver. Try 45 seconds!. . Anyhow, upon seating we were quickly attended to by the wait staff.  The beer and wine selection is slightly diverse, enough to provide an eclectic experience for the refined, but not pretentious palate.  I had the Coney Island Sword Swallower IPA from the folks at He'Brew.  Not bad!  The wife enjoyed a Belgian dubbed Troublette.  She seemed very pleased with her choice as well.. . We each dined on an appetizer salad, the Romaine and the Spinach.  Both solid.. . Dinner was a split Margherita Pizza and this is where Varasano's really shined through.  I was immediately brought back to a small pizzeria in Anacapri, Italy.  A light, crisp, fresh, and flavorful Italian tradition.  Nothing but dough, mozzarella, fresh basil, and sauce.  All that's necessary, when done right of course, to rock your face off.. . We finished with a combination of Chocolate Demise and a Beer.  A typical end to a wonderful dining experience.
