Came here for a deep dish pizza with my friend. I have to say that I was disappointed. You see, a friend hyped this place up for me. I thought I was going to get the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Nope, I think I still prefer Giordano's. When the server served us our pizzas, the toppings just sort of slided off... I don't think I've ever had that happened before. It was a bit unsightly.. . I think I'll stick to Giordano's the next time a friend from out of town wants to get deep dish pizza.
