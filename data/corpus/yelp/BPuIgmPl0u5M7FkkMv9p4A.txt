I gotta say..... This is Disgusting!  I felt like I was going to die from a stroke drinking this PURE FATTY soup... I honestly could feel it enveloping my heart.  This joint is over-rated.  And extremely filthy place!  This is like eating in a 3rd world country!  I guess many people enjoy drinking pure port fats.
