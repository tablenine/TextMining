Their Spiced Roobli(sp) coffee is a fancy name for a seasonal pumpkin spice coffee.  Perfectly flavored with milk and sugar, causing me to not need to add any accoutrements.  However your prices are on the high side. $4 for a small coffee... and I mean small. oof.  . . I paid for a certain flavor of coffee, then told me they ran out, and I had to substitute for another flavor, which was a buck less. Not thrilled that they didn't give me the difference. Even if it was a buck.  . . After visiting the warehouse, where they gave us a small LA MIll branded ziplock bag of their coffee, I was hoping they'd dispense something similar for those of us not wanting to commit to a lb, but alas, such is not the case. . . Anyway, 4 stars for good coffee and plenty of parking, negative star for prices. I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood.. . PARKING:  a lot behind the shop and street parking!
