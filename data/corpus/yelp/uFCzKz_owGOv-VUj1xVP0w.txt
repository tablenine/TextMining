I find myself at a loss with my Ecco experience.  I am always one to like the trendy new eateries around town and I was very excited about this one.  The place looks amazing and it is not too loud.  We were there at 8:30 on a Friday night and the noise was non-existent which is highly unusual for Atlanta trendy restaurants.. . The service was excellent.  The waiter was extremely helpful and he made sure our carb intake was met with bread and olives.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the wine selection as well.. . The side items were not very good.  I had a beet salad that was salted to death, we had the meatballs with veal which were a little on the bland side and we had a salad with pomegranates which was amazing. . . Our entrees were the highlight of the meal.  I had the strip steak which was great and Jeff had the pork pasta plate which was amazing.  A little on the sweet side but it was still incredible.. . Overall, this place gets an "A" for the entrees and a "C-" for the side items.  Atmosphere and service were, indeed, great.
