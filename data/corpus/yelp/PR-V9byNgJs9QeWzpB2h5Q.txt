Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
The food here is edible which is good because it is a restaurant, the food is mediocre and the service is one day spot on and the next pretty poor. The prices are pretty expensive for what it is . . The atmosphere is really nice kind of cozy and relaxed which I kind of like. . There are better places to eat in the city. :)
