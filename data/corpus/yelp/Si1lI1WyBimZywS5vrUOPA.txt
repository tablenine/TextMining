Would definitely recommend hanging out in the bar area at Zed -- they have fantastic appetizers and lots of comfy areas to sit in, especially around the fireplace.  Their vegetable/meat fondue dish is seriously out of this world, as is their Naan bread.  Great atmosphere if you're looking for a cool place to hang out at for a while.
