Ive been going here and getting delivery from here for years, but only as a last resort.  Their sushi is passable, but that's about it.  My relationship has ended though and not on a good note.  I pulled out my menu the other night, ordered my standard things, and waited.  Once it arrived, I was astonished to find that Kamehachi has RAISED their prices by 20% across the board!  For the same mediocre sushi, in this economy, you've got to be kidding me.  Never again.
