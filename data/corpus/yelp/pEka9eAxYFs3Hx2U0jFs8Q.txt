Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I have to admit, I'm a bit enamored by this place for its sheer bravado in having the same headlining act for over a decade. I think that when I come here, it's for the novelty of watching Thai Elvis as much as it is for the food. It's almost secondary. But I'm getting ahead of myself... on to the review:. . There's limited street parking, but fortunately they have valet parking available, at a cost ($2). The place is huge. Ample seating, though at peak times, you're still looking at a 20+ minute wait for a table. Tables are communal, so don't be surprised if you're seated with another party. It can also get pretty loud here, so don't come here if you're looking for a really intimate setting.. . The servers are busy, and they don't make any attempts to hide it. They are constantly scurrying around while talking on their headsets. It's a bit amusing to watch, actually. . . The menu is stacked, and there is a lot to look through. For the adventurous, they offer some very exotic dishes, though I've yet to go down that road. Their prices are also very reasonable. I would even venture as far as to say it's pretty cheap. As far as the food is concerned, it's pretty good. I like their curries, and they've got really good duck dishes as well. In fact, I've yet to have a dish that I did not like here.. . Then of course, there's Thai Elvis. What can I say? He's pretty damn entertaining. I love bringing out-of-towners here since I love the look on their faces when they first see Thai Elvis. That alone is well worth the price of admission.
