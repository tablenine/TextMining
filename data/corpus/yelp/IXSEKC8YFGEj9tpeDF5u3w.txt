Everyone needs a good sausage, every now and then. . . Can I tell you how excited I am about downtown LA's renaissance? I'm FREAKING REALLY EXCITED! Just a few years back my only lunch options were Korean BBQ in Little Tokyo or a bag of chips from one of the many crack-head laden liquor stores near by. . . Now? Now, I get to choose 2 sauces for my Belgian fries. And for that I thank you Wurstkuche. Thank you for not one but 3 veggie sausage options. Thank you for that extra side of sauerkraut. Thank you for that serving of apple beer that was just enough to be relaxing and still allow me to return to work in an operable state. And thank you even more for letting me sit in your devastatingly decorator perfect dining area, making me feel more awesome for choosing to lunch here.. . Long live sausage and beer. And fries.
