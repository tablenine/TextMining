Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I'm with Eli G.; I don't get it either. . . Last night was my first and last time eating at Tito's Tacos. I'm not looking for authentic Mexican food. I don't care if they only serve their "tacos" and burritos. I just want GOOD food. The meat was all dried and looked like dog food. It reminded like those tacos I had in elementary, except they had more flavor. I rather eat Toxic Hell's tacos than Tito's Tacos. . . 1 star for their chips though.
