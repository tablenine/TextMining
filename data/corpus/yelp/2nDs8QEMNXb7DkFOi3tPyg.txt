My Ratings:. Quality of Food - 5 Stars . Quantity of Food - 5 Stars . Price - 5 Stars . Location - 4 Stars . Parking - 3 Stars . Service - 4 Stars . Speed - 4 Stars. . My Opinion/Story:. Ummm... just thinking of their pastries makes my mouth water.  Talk about making it worth the trip, everytime we come down to LA, we just have to stop at PORTOS.  Their pastries are the BOMB!!!  We always come back to San Jose with 4 boxes of their pastries because all my family just had to have some.  Even my co-workers requests for their pastries.  Affordable and just very tasty.  I wish we have one of these bakeshop in San Jose.  But on the positve side, I'm glad we don't have one in San Jose otherwise my entire family will have diabetes and obesity... hehehehe!  Love you Porto's.. until next time we see each other again!
