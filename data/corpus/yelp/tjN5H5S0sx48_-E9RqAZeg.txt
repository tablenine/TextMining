Category: American (Traditional)
Twin anchors is simply ridiculous bbq. I love how when you order drinks at the bar while you wait they give you a bowl of munchies, which add a great touch. And its a real old-school feel in here.. . Anyways, the bbq here is sooo good. We started off with the onion rings (you gotta order these bad boys), and ordered up a variety of bbq plates. I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich with a side of baked beans and coleslaw. Lets just say, when they put the order in front of me, and gave me a side bowl of bbq sauce (spicy, sweet, not too thick) I was about to die from excitement. And it DELIVERED.. . The pulled pork is smoky, tender, and PLENTIFUL. I couldn't even taste the bread. Also the fact that I was dunking in it bbq sauce helped. The beans...OH THE BEANS, so good, with bits of pork goodness. Oh yeah, try the creamed spinach too. . . The food is sooo affordable (under $15 each person), the beers are cheap ($4 beer specials, and they carry 213), and the service is so quick....I love Twin Anchors. Â LEGIT
