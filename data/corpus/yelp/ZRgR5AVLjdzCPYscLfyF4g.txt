I was in need of the lemongrass beef wraps! I've been craving the wraps each week since the first time I came. I finally got my fix tonight.  I'm the type if I really like the dish, I will order it again and again. Therefore, I ordered the beef wraps and eggplant clay pot. Both were delicious.  I love the wraps!! I can't get enough of them! However, I think I'm all eggplant out.  It is a little on the heavy side.  After eating my eggplant leftovers tomorrow, I know I won't want it for a long while. Service was again very good. You know I'll be back again soon for the wraps!  Try them and you will have a new addiction as well.
