wow, seriously 2 *'s???? . yep, i said it ,TWO! . . i wasn't expecting a whole bunch and man was i not disappointed, sooo overrated. . . i really felt like this place was trying waaaay too hard. i don't need a full wine presentation for a $15 glass of pinot. the oysters left MUCH to be desired. the food was just mediocre. the braised short ribs over root vegetables, i make better meals on any given sunday, and i my friends, am no "top chef". . the whole wheat fettuccine was blah. how is it that the side dishes, gnocchi and butternut squash, were the best pieces of the meal? . . the dessert (creme fraiche panna cotta) attempted to save the whole dining experience, but it was too little to late. . . over it.
