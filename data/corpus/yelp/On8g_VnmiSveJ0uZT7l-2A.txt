Just a quick note about the all you can eat mussels special they are running during the week. I went last night and met some folks at the bar. I love Dogwood, I have to say. The people that work there are all so nice and friendly. Sitting at the bar is comfortable and relaxed. The mussels were delicious: the smoked tomato in the broth really shines. The bread they serve with them is PHENOMENAL - warm and crusty when it hits your table. The glass of Kim Crawford sauvignon blanc is a Â nice accompaniment. All in all a delightful experience and well worth $20.
