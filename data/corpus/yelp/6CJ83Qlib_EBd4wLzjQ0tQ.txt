Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Fred 62 is one of my favorite late night spots in LA. Perfect for that after-party craving. I love the edgy retro look of the place. Food is great and the eclectic clientele is entertaining. Try the Juicy Lucy its my favorite and the spicy thousand island sauce is delicious. You cant really go wrong with Fred 62. Parking sucks and depending on day of the week and time of day you might wait up to 45 mins for a table.
