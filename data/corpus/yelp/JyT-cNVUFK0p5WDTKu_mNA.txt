Restaurant: Hatfield&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
We went to Hatfield's for Valentine's day. With only 5 courses and an inflated price of $110/per person, I kind of wish we came here on a regular night. The food was good, but not WOW. Every plate is kind of a blur to me now, except for the dessert.. I LOVED the milk chocolate dasquoise w/ bananas and salted caramel ice cream! I thought some of the dishes were a little cold - Â It almost felt like they've been sitting around on the counter. Another thing I found interesting was that they prepared their cheese rolls in a little toaster oven. Hmm, kind of weird. Maybe a lot of restaurants do that? I'm not sure, but at least I don't see it!. . Service was kind of lacking that night, granted, it was Vday. There was also this lady who worked there that kept staring at me.. like looking over her shoulder staring. WHO DOES THAT?!
