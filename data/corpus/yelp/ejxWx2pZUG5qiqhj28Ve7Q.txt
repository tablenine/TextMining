I have to start off by saying that their lemonade is to die for. I'm a huge fan of their ice - strange but true. I love ice chips like that so it made the lemonade even better.. . my boyfriend took me here because he knew I was a fan of tuna melts and I have to say that I was pretty let down. Its not because of the high expectations that I came with but my sandwich was as cold as the fries it came with. Â If it had came warm with the jack cheese fully melted, I'm pretty sure I wouldve been more pleased. None the less, the grilled onions inside were great and made up for the dry tuna inside.. . service was great. the lighting and decor made it enjoyable.. . I was let down by the tuna melt but I'm sure I'll come back to try more of the items on their menu. Hopefully I wont be let down next time.
