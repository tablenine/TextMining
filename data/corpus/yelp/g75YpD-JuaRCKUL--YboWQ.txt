Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
you will truly enjoy your dining experience at the stinking rose, if the following items get your panties in a twist:. . - asparagus bathed in oil into a wrinkled, limp, flaccid shell of it's former self. . - the probability of anal leakage resulting from the ungodly amounts of olive oil slicking up your intestines like a slip 'n' slide (anyone else remember the big olestra anal leakage scare when those WOW! chips from lay's was first put on the market?). . - precious garlic sliced and roasted to dry, crunchy discs as a topping to your fish. . - your cod being presented to you on your plate and your dining companions asking you if you ordered potatoes for your main course. . - couscous overcooked to the size of the balls of a small rodent. . i gave this place three $ signs for price because the protein dishes start at $20 and all steak dishes are $30. the pastas, like any place, hover around $15. and this is for stuff that's, at best, mediocre. i had a better meal at bucca di beppo or olive garden.. . if you can to go angelini osteria and get organic half chicken alla diavola with roasted potatoes and spinach for $20 or pay $24 at la terza for branzino alla griglia with baby mixed greens and lemon, i can see no earthly reason why anyone would choose to come here.. . you like garlic fries? cool! go to weiland's and wash it down with a $2 heff on tap.. . you like roasted garlic? chop a garlic head in half, wrap it in foil and douse it in olive oil in your oven til the scent permeates all the porous fabric in your home, but don't come to the stinking rose.. . oh, and the water pitchers, even empty, weigh about eight pounds.!?!!
