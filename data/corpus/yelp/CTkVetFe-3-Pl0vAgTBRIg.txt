Restaurant: Santullo&#39;s Eatery
Category: Pizza
santullo's is now officially my favorite pizza place in chicago. the perfectly thin and chewy crust, new york style pizza is now graced by the presence of UPTON'S NATURALS.. . OMG. so the other night we ordered a supreme pizza with upton's sausage, green peppers and olives. it was like nothing i have ever experienced before...piece, i'm sorry but santullo's has now taken pizza to a whole new level. all 20" or bigger? of pure perfection. i have never been happier to spend $30 on a pie. i m in love. LOVE. . . happy hour here is always awesome. $2 slices, can't be beat that!. if you haven't been to santullo's, then you haven't fully experienced wicker park! :)
