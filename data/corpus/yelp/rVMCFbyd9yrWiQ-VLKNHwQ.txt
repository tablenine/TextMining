Category: Delis
Uh oh, folks. I'm slipping!!. . I've been mouthing off FOR DAYS about how great my experience at Langer's was.. . And I forgot to write a review! Take my Elite status away! I'm not worthy!. . Alright, already. Down to the REVIEW:. . I was hungover. My friends, it's happening all too often. . . I had been to Langer's before, on a really rushed lunch break, got a really greasy sandwich I didn't want, and was wholly unhappy. But I got the feeling my dissatisfaction had more to do with my JOB than the restaurant. So I thought I'd give it another go before yelping too soon.. . Back to the hangover. Needed matzo ball soup. STAT. Wandered over to the beautiful cultural cacophony of a neighborhood that surrounds this landmark restaurant.. . After musing over the menu (no greasy sandwiches today, thank you!), I decided white fish and bagels. And the beef stew. My may-an and I were going to split em.. . The matzo ball soup (came with the meal) was liquid heaven. I swear. I was overcome. I wanted to personally thank whoever made it. But wait, there's (so much) more!. . Out came plate after gorgeous plate of food. The white fish was PERFECT. Firm, salty and not at all fishy. It came with an entire garden of veggies, and a huge mound of whipped cream cheese.. . Out waitress gets an A++. Attentive, funny, no pressure. Like eating at your favorite aunt's house.. . I can't wait to go back. I'm working on that hangover already...
