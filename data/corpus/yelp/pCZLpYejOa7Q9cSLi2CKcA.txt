4 thumbs up (from myself and my friend) for the fried chicken, garlic green beans and mac &amp; cheese we both decided to order.  Fried chicken was crispy on the outside, tender &amp; juicy on the inside...probably the second best fried chicken I've had in Atlanta (#1 so far- Horseradish Grill).  Great location within a plaza that also houses Bacchanalia, Osteria del Figo and Taqueria del Sol, tons of parking, great outdoor dining space (and the inside also looked fresh and inviting).  Kudos for the Lemonhead candy by the door- grab one on the way out!
