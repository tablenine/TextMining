Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I've been here a few times now, and I can safely say that the Boiling Crab is singlehandedly supporting the Gilroy economy...I've never seen so much garlic being consumed in one place.   I've gotten the shrimp, clams, crawfish, and lobster, all with the whole shabang sauce, and it has been delicious every time.  Perhaps it's a good thing that the shabang sauce is so good/strong, because I think it allows BC to serve average quality seafood, ergo passing the savings onto us.  . . On the downside, parking and waiting for a table are a pain in the ass, but once you're seated you forget about all of that and before you know it you'll be full of seafood and smelling like garlic for the next few days.  All in all, I love this place and will be a regular customer for as long as I'm in LA.
