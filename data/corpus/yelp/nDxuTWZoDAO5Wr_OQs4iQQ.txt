You know what?!?!?!  I LOVE this place's Red Velvet cake.  BUT. . BUT. . BUT. . If I have endure the bad service by the crackhead waitresses they have hired at this place, I would rather just go to Sprinkles or something.  UGH!  I am so sick and tired of these hipster waitresses that take their sweet ass time and don't get your food to you.  . . I got here around 920 and did not get my food until 10PM.  As much as I love waiting around for 40 minutes to get a bunch of oily cheese on a piece of bread, I will pass.  Or....I would just get the cake to go and skip the people that work here.  If you see a blonde chubby chick with crazy eyes, that's the worst waitress ever to walk the face of this Earth.  You would think with as many "bathroom breaks" she's taking, she would be a little more "uppity!"
