Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I'm not sure what makes Tito's so good, but they are soo addicting. As said in another post, I think they might add some crack to their tacos. When you see the "chefs" (and I use that term lightly) adding the ingredients, it looks like shit lol, but when you do finally Â get that first bite in.... it's like heaven. Mile long lines, horrid parking and bathrooms so dirty that you would rather go into a Andy Gump, are things that are just worth dealing with. I'm telling you...crack I tell you!
