Everything was wonderful...! From the bread to the dessert, even our service was excellent. We even got to meet Chef Akira himself. I had the fish mousse, shrimp appetizer, butternut squash soup, beef tenderloin with au gratin potatoes as the main course and for dessert had their flourless chocolate cake with espresso ice cream...everything was delicious! Dinner came out to 75$ a person including gratuity...definitely worth it though. I recommend this place for a romantic, formal dinner.
