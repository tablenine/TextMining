Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
We brought some visitors here on our "Snoop Dogg Tour of LA", and I have to say this is the best chicken &amp; waffle place I've ever been to.  Okay, it's the only one, but the food was pretty tasty.  I had the Scoe's special.  The chicken was good, and flavorful, and the waffle was nice and crispy.  Not THE BEST CHICKEN EVER or THE BEST WAFFLES EVER, but they went well together, and if Snoop likes it, I like it.  . . Parking was annoying-- I think there was valet, we got a spot on the street approximately 4 miles away.  There was a pretty long wait, but it was Saturday night.  Honestly, I wouldn't come here again for a casual dinner with just the husband, but it was a fun experience with guests and I was pretty happy with the food.
