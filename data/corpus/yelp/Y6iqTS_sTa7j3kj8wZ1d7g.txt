I have to admit, YUM.  . . But in my opinion there is much to be improved upon.  The meat, skin, and juice are all there, but for some reason it just isn't the same as like supreme dragon or other 'regular' restaurants that serve pork dumplings.. . I think that certain food shouldn't be too glamorized; it's almost too sterilized and the food can only get so much better.  I actually appreciate some really rustic Chinese food (heck, I like come forms of orange chicken) so having this quality of food doesn't really impress me.. . I was disappointed at the fact that the dumplings tend to get cold really fast.   It really takes the taste of of the dish when you are eating them and you get to that last cold dumpling and think to yourself, 'what that work $7 for dumplings?". . I wasn't full afterward, I even ordered a bowl of noodles.  So, please plan on a) get there early b) order as you go so they don't get cold, and c) order variety so that you can get yourself full because I think i can eat about 3 baskets of the pork dumplings without a sweat.. . Not bad, but I've had good dumplings at crappy restaurants because every dog can have his day.
