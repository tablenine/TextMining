Quick and dirty:. . - Cubano sammich is nothing special. I thought it did it's job, but I wasn't fallin off my seat or anything. Bread resembled King's Hawaiian bread too much.. - Media Noche: It practically tasted like the Cubano. What was the difference?. - Platano chips: now THERE'S something you don't get with a happy meal. Good side dish, but doesn't pack enough of a punch to be considered as banana-chip worthy.. . Overall, good people, clean place, SPEEDY SERVICE, good mix of Angelenos and Cuban cuisine. I approve.
