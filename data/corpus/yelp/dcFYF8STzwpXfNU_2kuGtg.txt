Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
uh huh....that's right, i did it. I just gave manna 1 star.. . why?. . because it's trash. All of you(no offense) that think manna is all great need to grab your korean friend and ask him/her to take you out to get kbbq somewhere else. . . Back then, i would've given this place 3 stars...i mean, after all, this is an all-you-can-eat joint. But after a recent visit, no way.. . their meat is crap and service has gone down the drain as well.. . if i could, i wouldn't even give this place one star, but i guess they deserve one star for their outdoor patio. It makes for great ventilation.. . -baro out!
