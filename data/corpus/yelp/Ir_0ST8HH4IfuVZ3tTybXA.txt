went here after watching it on sandwhich paradise on the travel channel.  this place was busy and crowded just as shown on tv.  the line was out the door on a sunday afternoon.  parking was horrible and traffic to get into the parking lot was not any better.  waiting in line outside was a trip in its own.  they have 2 lines.  waiting in the line of what seems to be like a maze,  while on the outside you get pestered by bums who asks you for cigarrettes and money while they have a paper bag with booze in their hand.  when you finally get in the building you have to choose between 5 or 6 lines to order your food.  but on to the food.. i ordered the beef and the pork sandwiches.  both double dipped with extra meat.  both sandwiches tastes bland.  their mustard was spicy and good and was the only thing that made the sandwiches decent.  i also ordered the potato salad because it looked good through the glass.  i tasted it and it wasnt as good as it looked.  too much relish and not flavorful.  tasteless like their sandwiches.  i believe this place is so commercialized that this is how they get all their business.  so many people see this place on tv and want to try it, much like myself.  but take my advice,  its not worth going to or even trying if you havent been there before.  there are way better places to get sandwiches.
