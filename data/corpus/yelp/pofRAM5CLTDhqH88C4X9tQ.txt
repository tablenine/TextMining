Too crowded and too over-rated.  The margaritas come from a tap and therefore leave something to be desired.  . *** Since I wrote the above I have gone back a few times and it was much improved.  But I have to say that is because we went for lunch and didn't have to deal with the insanity of dinner time.  Dark atmosphere, strong margaritas, warm chips and friendly staff make it a good pick
