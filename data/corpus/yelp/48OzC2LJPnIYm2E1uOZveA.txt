This has become my favorite place to go for breakfast or brunch.  I still have not had everything on the menu, but I plan to.  They have great omelets and egg dishes which never fail, and when I feel like something sweet for breakfast they got that covered too (Mascarpone stuffed strawberry french toast, very good!).  There is always a wait which can be as long as 45 minutes so get there before you are starving.  You can tough out the wait with a cup of complementary coffee which they leave outside which I think is a nice touch.
