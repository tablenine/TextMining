I had brunch today at Tom's and it was definitely worth driving through heavy rain and getting lost on the way from the other side of Brooklyn to get there. As we walked through the door, we were greeted with friendly faces and a host that pumped hand sanitizer on our hands! This must've been the first time I've experienced this and was very surprised at what friendly, attentive service they provided. We did not have to wait at all for seats on a Sunday afternoon (around 2:30pm) and our food came only shortly after we placed our orders!. . My friend ordered the pastrami with two eggs sunny side up with a side of french fries (probably the crunchiest, crispest french fries I've ever had ever) and white toast. I ordered the eggs florentine with hash browns and wheat toast. We also had an extra order of the blueberry french toast and a lemonade and hazelnut cappuccino to drink. My friend especially loved that they served pastrami as opposed to the typical breakfast meats and he also fell in love with the homemade lemonade! He thought it was an awesome deal for only $2.00. To add on to this, the prices at Tom's are extremely affordable for what you get. The bill for the both of us only came out to $37.00 (tip included). . . Everything we ordered was extremely yummy and we were so glad we made our way to Tom's for our Sunday brunch adventure. I can't wait to return and try all the other items on the menu :)
