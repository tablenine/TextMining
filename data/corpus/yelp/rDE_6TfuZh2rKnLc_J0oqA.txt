Cute little place!  Very dog friendly too!  They have a few outdoor tables, a water bowl for doggies, and even a leash tie-up so you can go in and order while your dogs stay outside.. . My husband frequented this place a lot more than I did when he worked over in Studioplex.  The staff made a point to get to know his name since he was such a loyal customer - I think that little effort goes a long way in establishing good customer service.. . I've been there a few times and it has always been good.  The smoothies are excellent, the breakfast sandwiches are great, the lunch sandwiches are good, and the fruit cups are wonderful!  The un-popped popcorn (not sure the actual name of it) that they provide on the side is excellent!. . Definitely a cute place.  It takes awhile since they hand prepare everything you order - so you must bring some patience.  But great for breakfast/lunch/mid-morning snack!
