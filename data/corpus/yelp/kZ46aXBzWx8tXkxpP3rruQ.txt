I definitely dig this place.  The retro atmosphere is great and the music is straight out of my collection": New Order, The Smiths, The Cure, etc.  They have lots of great beers on tap that are not the normal ones you'll find at most pubs.  My friend tried to order a Miller Lite and the waitress talked him out of it.
