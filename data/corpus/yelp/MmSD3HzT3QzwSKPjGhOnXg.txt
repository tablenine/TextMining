Okay. Langer's yesterday, Canter's today. Down Fairfax we go, attended parking lot, around the corner, seems de rigueur for kosher deli's in L.A.   Canter's pastrami is cut thinner and piled high, leaner and less of a clove flavour then Langer's.  Although with it being a leaner cut, not as moist.  We order the exact same items we did at Langers. Diet Cokes and dos pastrami sandwiches, russian dressing and slaw on the side.  Man I can't make a decision which one I like more.  I love phatty pastrami because that's how it is in NY NY.  But the thinner cut is more of what I am accustomed too.   On a personal note, the slaw at Canter's was much sweeter then Langer's.  The pickles at Canter's had more flavor but not as crisp and fresh.  I guess it's all about  proximity.  Whichever you can make it too, it's well worth the short wait
