The Majestic is pretty awesome.  If you *need* fresh waffles at 4 AM after a long night of doing whatever, where else can you go, really?  No where if you want to remain cool (except maybe R. Thomas).  The food isn't the best ever, but it's certainly decent, the servers are great, and everything is quite inexpensive.  I find myself here often and will surely continue to go.  Let's meet up for milkshakes!
