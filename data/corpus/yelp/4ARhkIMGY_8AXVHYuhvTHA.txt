I have  been here twice in the last five days. Insanely delicious. Or at least the Jalapeno Mango Chicken was. Full of flavor! The curry ketchup is pretty tasty. They have a wide selection of Belgium beers. . . For 2 hot dogs, fries w/ 2 dipping sauces plus a beer came out to be $30. Not bad considering the quality. Parking can be a bit tricky and finding the place too. So give yourself some time to find this spot.
