I've eaten at Real Food Daily for years. The nachos with cashew cheese and the enchalads are real standouts. I find much of the menu dull though. Their saving grace is they often have fantastic specials, usually involving tempeh, which I love.. . Their Sunday brunch is also very good. I almost always get the Weekender: tempeh bacon, tofu scramble with cashew cheese, hashed brown potatoes and french toast or pancakes. Sooo long since I've had french toast. really good.. . Service is always great.
