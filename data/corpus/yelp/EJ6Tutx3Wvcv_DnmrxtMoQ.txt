Restaurant: Bob San Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
The fish is always fresh and the place is not the next hip joint want to be. Easy Wicker Park crowd, you can dress up or go casual.. . Bob San is behind the sushi bar almost every night, and I appreciate that.        I like the tempura because you can order exactly the vegetable that you want.  So I get all shitake mushroom and my bf gets all sweet potato.  We then jump into sushi ordering and get the usual: hamachi, albacore, super white, unagi, amaebi.  We always end our meal with a hand roll-try the spicy creamy scallop hand roll.  . . I have to try the Crunch roll next time, everyone seems to comment on it in their review.
