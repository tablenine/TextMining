To be fair, I'm giving this place four stars because of its chicken tortilla soup, and red velvet cake.. . The red velvet cake here puts Doughboys to shame--the frosting at Toast is lighter, and the consistency of the cake is firmer.  . . I can't figure out what the base is for the tortilla soup, but I left it in the fridge overnight, and it held up well and there wasn't a film of lard on top.  I can now eat it without fear that it's clogging my arteries.. . I had a salad, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.  But a salad is a salad is a salad.. . When I've been here, the service is just fine.  There was one occasion where there was a "shift change" (gosh, I thought that this excuse was tired), but the waiter was super apologetic.. . I like the ambience inside.  Outside, I'd probably have to battle too many elements, e.g. the homeless, the loud traffic buzz, and the insects.. . Red velvet cake.  Yummmm.
