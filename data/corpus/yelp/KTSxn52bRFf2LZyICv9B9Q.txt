Food:  i think i've liked everything i've tried here.  fried shrimp rolls, chicken, curry, pizza, pasta, salad... all pretty good... i wasn't happy when they took away the free refills on the iced cappuccino though. . Service:  good.  the wait can be bad though cuz this place is small. . Parking:  not so good
