Wow - best steak I've ever had. I had the 6 oz filet - 100% wagyu beef. Although it was ridiculously expensive ($160 I think), this steak melted in my mouth. We also had a few appetizers including the steak sashimi and although this dish may sound a little risky, you should definitely try this appetizer. . . Cut is pretty amazing but I'd recommend you come here when its on someone else's tab :)
