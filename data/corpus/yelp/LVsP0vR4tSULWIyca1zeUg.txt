Restaurant: Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries
Category: Burgers
I used to like this place, but now not so much.  Yes burgers are cheap but add an order of fries and you have a $10 meal............ for fast food?  Anyhow not my major complaint.  I ordered a burg and a dog and by the time I got home (live minutes away) both were a big pile of  *!%@   I may as well been eating raw dough cuz that's what it turned into.  TOAST YOUR BUNS!!!!!  Wont be back.............. can get a gourmet burger for same cost at a real restaurant.
