I'm still not sure how a supper club and a restaurant differ, since both will let you in and give you food if you give them money.  I have never needed an ID card.  Ah, but that's splitting hairs, on to the meat of the matter.. . Not bad.  The patio is pretty much the only reason I come here, and the fact that they do have a purty good selection of taps.  The food itself runs toward the meat loaf &amp; asparagus realm, not my thing but some folks sure dig it.  The burgers and whatnot I have had were all pretty decent, I have never waited too long for a table, and the servers were always pretty cool.  Not a place i would think of normally to get dinner, but if someone brings it up I am usually game.  I think their kitchen is open late too.  I like it, in spite of having been thrown out of the place many years ago (probably justifiably).
