Restaurant: Harry &amp; Sons
Category: Sushi Bars
Again, just like their co-restaurant across the street, this place is super bland thai, dumbed down for the masses. Â I don't understand how Harry and Sons and Surin stay so consistently busy, their food is boring. Good thing there are lots of great Thai restaurants in a 5 mile vicinity.
