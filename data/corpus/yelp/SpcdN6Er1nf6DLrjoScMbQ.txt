Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
This is perhaps one of my favorite korean bbq places and I give it 3.5 stars. I think it really gets at the essence of what korean bbq should be. Its basically an outdoor patio with a tarp as the roof. There are heat lamps around to keep the customers warm. The food was great, they had a large variety of side dishes and they were not stingy about refilling them. I also liked that they bring you the meat so you essentially never have to get out of your seat. Its really a place you can be loud and socialize with your friends because that is what everyone else is doing. My favorite part however is that if it is your birthday, they come pour champagne at you if you ask them to. So its in essence a dinner and a show. The champagne really explains why they have outdoor seating, I'd imagine its hard to clean champagne indoors. . . Just a warning though, you will stink of korean bbq smoke when you leave because the tarp really traps all the bbq smell within it. But that's what korean bbq is supposed to be, meat, champagne and smelling bad. I really like this place, the price was decent and there was a lot of variety in their meat selection.
