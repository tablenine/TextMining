Great casual spot on Buford highway.  If you enjoy Indian food, you will enjoy Panahar.  BYOB with no corking fee which keeps this spot very reasonable.  It is helpful to call for a reservation since they do fill up, but the wait is never that long.  Trust the owner when he recommends you try an unfamiliar dish.  I often just tell him to bring me what he thinks I should eat that night and the experience has never disappointed.
