Decided to try this place b/c I've always passed it and thought it looked pretty intimate.  Dinner is served downstairs.  There's an open kitchen where you can see all the chefs/sous working on our dishes.  We got a table near the bar, so it was not as intimate and quiet as I had hoped for a dining room.  Bar patrons were standing around the vicinity.  With my bellini, I shared 2 appetizers w/ my dinner guest.  Portions are not too bad, considering the avg appetizer price was $10-$15.  We shared a Tuna Spring Roll (Raw Tuna wrapped in a "phyllo dough" for a light crispy texture w/ a cilantro gingery sauce) &amp; a Black Sea Bass Carpaccio, which had a clean, refreshing taste.  Both were very delightful so I was excited for my entree to arrive.  I ordered a cod potatoe cake w/ fennel.  I was a little disappointed, b/c my mouth did not have a party!!  Then checked out the dessert menu and nothing really caught my eye but decided to give it one more try and shared a strawberry ice cream sandwich.  Turned out pretty good, it wasn't too sweet.  A terrine display w/ strawberry ice cream in btwn a cookie w/ pistachio crunch surrounded w/ a strawberry lychee soup.  Very yummy!!  Overall, the service was ok.  Drinks were a tad $$$.  My dinner guest had a chopin martini for $14, which I think is a lil too pricey, even though I understand it comes w/ the service and the sitting down atmosphere vs a bar.  Definitely won't return for dinner, maybe for a lunch or brunch.
