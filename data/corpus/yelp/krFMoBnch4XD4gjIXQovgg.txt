Been there twice, first time on weekend (bring a paper for the wait) and the last time got a table as soon as we walked in.  Let me be brief, i had the Reuben both times and i probably would only go back for that.  First time, my Reuben was phenomenal, this last time, i think it was sitting in the window for a little longer than it should have (cheese was kind of dry).  . Here's a tip, to help over look the mediocre service , the loud setting, and the screaming owner who demeans his staff,.....try one of their BLOODY MARYS!!! YUM,...its bananas...b-a-n-a-n-a-s !
