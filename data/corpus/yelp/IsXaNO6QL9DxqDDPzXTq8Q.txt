Restaurant: Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
They could probably have picked a better name for their restaurant. Not to mention location. But, this place is pretty solid for Thai food as well as sushi. . . Over the years, they've really tried to make the place more upscale. The decorations and menus have gotten nicer, but it's also gotten slightly more expensive too (and portions for the Thai food got a little smaller as well). Still, the service is pretty good when I go. . . I like the Thai tea and Thai coffee. They have their little creations as far as sushi rolls go -- which are huge rolls. The have dollar sushi nights...but I can only call that sushi ok.
