Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
All the times I've actually tried Porto's were at random Filipino house parties where the boxes of Potato Balls and Cheese Rolls were treated like gifts from God and then promptly stuffed into mouths and purse bags.. . But then, yesterday, I decided to go to God's kitchen itself and have the real Porto's Experience. Since it was my first trip, I was completely overwhelmed by the sights, sounds, and smells! Don't be discouraged by the enormous line as it goes quite quickly. Even if you are the impatient type (like me), you'll spend most of your time waiting just entranced by the large menu and the many display cases filled with beautiful baked good. Unless you're looking to buy an entire cake, all of the pastries are under $5 and all of the sandwhiches are under $10. I reccommend like everyone else Potato Balls ($.85) and Cheese Rolls (Dozen/$7.50). Get them warmed, it'll be even more orgasmic!. . By the way.. GOODLUCK WITH PARKING.
