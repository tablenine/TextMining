Excellent beer selection, and the bartenders help you decide if you get overwhelmed by the selection. . . The appetizers and entrees are amazing.  The burger is fabulous (no substitutions though), and definitely get it with the sweet potato fries, which are the best I've had anywhere.  . . I tried the beef bone marrow last time, which sounds gross, looks gross, and tastes INCREDIBLE.
