In a city where most of us spend way too much time hermetically sealed in our cars, offices, or homes, human contact can be refreshingly welcome. But shaking the server's hand when you've just been seated for a meal is awkward. I understand and appreciate that they do this, along with calling guests by their first names, to create some intimacy in this vast and impersonal space, but it still feels a little forced.. . Anyway, my wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch on Saturday on our way to Unique LA. On the weekends they pare down to pizza and brunch during the day, so we shared a pizza and salad and tried the house white. The pizza was good, although it could have used another couple of minutes in the oven to get those black spots on the crust and blistering cheese effect. The salad was fresh and generous, and the wine was just okay. I'd like to try the pastas, but will have to come back for dinner.. . Handshake aside, the service is great. This place probably has the best staff-to-guest ratio in town. I swear there must be seventy or eighty employees visible at any given time. Â . . The space is impressive too. Towering windows provide plenty of natural light, stark white walls are free of art or clutter, and the marble floors give the room a sense of drama. And the open kitchen actually works well in this space; it provides organic transparency rather than showmanship.. . It's nice to have another mid-range option downtown and I'm sure I'll be back soon.
