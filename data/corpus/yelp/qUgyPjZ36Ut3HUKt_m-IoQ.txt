Had to visit this place despite their reputation as a tourist trap after reading about their banana cream pie in New York Times Magazine years ago. It was as good as I imagined and was highlight of the meal. I also ordered hickory burger with cheese and fries (to be shared) and they were fine but not memorable. We didn't have to wait for seats, but the service left much to be desired as it was extremely hard to get the server's attention. Not that we needed much attention, but he had given one of us wrong beverage and another didn't receive his ice tea at all. I don't see myself coming here often (or again at all) but it was a good experience, no regrets.
