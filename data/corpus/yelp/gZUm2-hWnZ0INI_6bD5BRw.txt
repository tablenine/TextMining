Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
PINK was my face when I bit into one of PINKS famous hot dogs! A Â pink face from disgust! The hour wait in line was not worth it! . . Lets start with the employees. MOST of them were cordial and welcoming. Most! Most of them though looked like they've seen it all and were tired of the PINKS craze and the crazed tourists. Get a new job if you don't like it! period.. . As for the food... gross! Maybe I had the wrong thing (classic chili dog with sour kraut) none the less... it is a challenge to even be able to bite into the hot dog itself! Like RUBBER! I'm sure it's not traditional to eat their dogs the traditional way (pick it up and put it in your mouth) but I didn't want to have to cut into it with a fork and a knife. I just wanted to pick it up and eat it! Impossible rubber hot dog! My friend had a vegan dog and I enjoyed that much more than I enjoyed their "famous" hot dog!. . The CHILI is nasty. I would rather have weinersnitzel chili! Nuf said! . . The coleslaw tasted like it had been sitting there a week or two! I couldn't even force myself to eat it! Guess thats not the kind of place to buy cole slaw but geesh at least serve it fresh!. . So PINKS gets an enormous thumbs down! huge! If I had 10 thumbs they would get 10 thumbs down!
