i cannot believe i havent written a review on wasabi yet!!! this is one of my very very fave places in atlanta. sushi here is on par with mf sushi without the high price tag or the random snootiness. bartender joel is the absolute best anywhere and jen and nan prepare the freshest most delicious sushi!! great place to go with friends or SO in oh so cool castleberry hill. parking in the no mas/wasabi lot. go! you will not be disappointed.
