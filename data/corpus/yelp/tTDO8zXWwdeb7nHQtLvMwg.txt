Super packed on Sunday at brunch time. We waited only 15 minutes for a table...sweeet!  The hostess really made an effort to get everyone seated within reasonable time +1 star. . Mint + Lemon iced water? omg +1 star. . venetian chicken sandwich, with not one but TWO juicy and flavorful chicken breast pieces with awesome choice of cheese and fresh pesto spread +1 star. perfectly baked focaccia (probably not what focaccia is really supposed to be) but it was soft on the inside, had a perfect hardness and crunch all around on the outside +1 star. attentitive service +1 star. . you do the math.  I'll def be back here again, maybe on a saturday instead of a sunday.  Also plenty of shops up &amp; down Melrose to keep your mind off of food while you wait
