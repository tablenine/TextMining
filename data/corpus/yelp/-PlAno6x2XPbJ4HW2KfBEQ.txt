Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
The food here is not bad nothing to really complain about. My preference is to go across the street if it is gonna be for these prices. . . My friend being the cheese fanatic that he is brought back a tasty chunk of cheese from this place. So there could be hope. . . I cannot stand the banter that goes on at this place. Well to tell the truth I was dragged her by this dreadful girl once upon a time in a galaxy far away when Joan's was just one store and before the massive expansion. Now this place is just too hectic.
