We came here with a small group for M's birthday, and it was a great choice! Though we came on a Saturday evening there was plenty of space to sit, many people were enjoying the beautiful weather out on the patio but we decided to sit indoors. . . First off, their beers are yummmy. I had some of M's Alaskan Beer and as someone said "the nutty aftertaste" was really yummy. We all ordered the Office Burger. You have to go up to order at the bar, so don't sit around waiting for someone to come and take your order. The food came promptly and man oh man the fries were delicioussss. They're thin and not too crispy, but just right. The sauce it comes with (some kind of bleu cheese + ranch? iono) was where it has its kick. The burger was tasty because the meat was made of really great meat, the bacon &amp; caramelized onion mysterious sauce was the money. . . things to know:. 21+ only. make sure to close your tab before you leave. go up to the bar to order. . enjoy!
