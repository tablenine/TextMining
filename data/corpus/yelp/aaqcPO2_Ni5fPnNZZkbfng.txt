such an amazing dining experience. 7 course for two people = 14 different dishes over 2 hrs. so much fun tasting, not so much fun waiting between courses. . though it was a perfect romantic dinner, we weren't really blown away by food itself. they use too much of puree for everything and lack creativity. wasn't a huge fan of their interior, but i liked quiet, intimate atmosphere. . portion might be a little small, but i felt ridiculously full afterward, believe or not. i think it's because of all that puree, heavy sauce and yummy cheesy bread... . . highly recommended for special occasions - reasonably priced 7 course tasting ($79 per person). $25 corkage fee, $5.50 valet parking.
