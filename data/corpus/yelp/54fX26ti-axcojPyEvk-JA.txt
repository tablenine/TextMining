Holy Moses! The cocktails! I had the "Lily Cup" which drew me in because it consisted of elderflower liqueur and Meyer lemon. I was tantalized to the point that I actually had a cocktail at lunch on a workday which i never do. It was SO worth it. I wish I could've had another, but that would've been plain irresponsible of me, considering my lightweight status. So I recommend going when you don't have to pretend that work is the most interesting thing ever on a Friday afternoon.
