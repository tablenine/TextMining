Yes, its shaved ice.  For most Americans, shaved ice is a mound of coarsely ground ice, jammed into a leaky paper cone drowning in artificial fruit flavors (mmmm cherry cough syrup flavor!).  For the Taiwanese, its an opportunity to mix together different flavors and textures to create the ultimate dessert for a sweltering hot smoggy day.. . This place has the best shaved ice.  Its a bargain.  If you've never had shaved ice and you are unfamiliar with the various crazy looking toppings (red bean? green bean? wtf is grass jelly? rice balls? taro have balls? coconut jelly? condensed milk? what is this stuff?)... GET THE MIX SHAVE ICE.  Its got them all and its really really good.. . Trust me.
