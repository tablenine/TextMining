Sorry cafe sunflower... i love your food, but you've just gotten to be TOO FREAKIN EXPENSIVE! i ordered takout today, apparently i had an old menu... what i thought was going to be $14 (according to the old menu) was actually $18!! and i REALLY didn't want to spend the $14 to begin with... i don't know, maybe i'm just cheap (which i'm not)... but if you're going to charge me more than the lunch menu AT LEAST give me more food than you do at lunch... i don't know... i'm pretty sure today was the last time i'll be eating there (at least for dinner)... BLEH!
