Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
This place is fantastic!  . . I actually learned about this place while watching a Rachel Ray travel show on the Food Network. I immediately put  it on my "must eat here" list. At the time my now-husband, then-boyfriend, was living in Chicago and I lived in Michigan.  CPOG was the restaurant we went to on our "First Chicago Date". We actually ended up eating here right before he proposed....I have sentimental attachment :). . First of all, you must know that this is a CASH ONLY place.  Not a big deal, so long as you are prepared.  There is an ATM not far away, just a bit awkward if you don't know and have to run out in the middle of a date. . . I would suggest starting with the Chef's Salad. The dressings are sooo good! They give you three options, a sweet poppyseed, sour cream and garlic, or traditional Italian.  . . I always get a Half-Pounder vegetarian pizza pot pie with white crust ....pepperoni slices on the side.  NOTE: The original comes with Italian sausage and mushrooms.  You can also get wheat crust.  Pepperoni only comes on the side. . . This place isn't your run-of-the-mill pizza place. The pizzas are unique and taste great!  I mean, it is pizza pot pie...how fun is that??!?!?!. . I would definitely recommend this place for a date night! Or for any other occasion...it is an awesome experience from ambiance to the food!
