Certainly one of the best dining experiences I've had in the Atlanta area. Since it's a Tuesday night, the restaurant is rather sedate. . . I find a nice spot at the bar and I'm immediately greeted by Dan, who was my bartender as well as gastronomic guide for the evening.. . The 5 course was interesting to me, each course was more and more alluring and luscious. A few of the highlights were the grilled scallops on a bed of corn and leeks and the duck confit which was so creamy and delicious. I will say though that the highlight was one that Chef Gillespie literally threw together. He prepared shrimp on top of risotto with fried pork skins. Trust me, when I say the flavors for this particular dish was amazing.. . Another fantastic highlight was actually meeting Bernard, one of the owners as well as having a brief conversation with Chef Gillespie. These guys have a lot of pride in what they do and it shows.. . Highly recommended!
