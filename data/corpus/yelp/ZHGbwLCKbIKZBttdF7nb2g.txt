Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Chicago's best sushi restaurant, period.. . I have dined here twice and both times were worth average of 1.5 hrs wait. The service can be little slow despite 3 or 4 waitresses working in this tiny hole in Lincoln Park. But they try their best with warm, nice smiles so no complains on that.. . Instead of ordering usual toro, try their white tuna. It melts in your mouth almost like that fat piece of belly of its cousin with the price that will make your sushi night just a bit more enjoyable.. . I forgot the name of this roll (think it had a word "sunny") I tried last time but it was really good with crushed sunflower seeds mixed in with the filling. Totally new experience.. . Get here by 6 if you don't want to wait.
