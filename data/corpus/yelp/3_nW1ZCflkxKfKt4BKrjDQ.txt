Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Made another pilgrimage to the legendary Titos. In a world of constant change, the most wonderful thing about Titos is that nothing has changed in the last 20 years I have been coming here. The refried beans are just as phenomenal as they were when I was a kid. And in fact, they are served in the same container by (some of) the same people from the same window. The tacos are the same; they may not be the best in the world, but they haven't changed. I love the reliability here and the fact that when all else changes (and often degrades) I can still rely on Titos to server up exactly what I want. I don't live in LA anymore, but when I return, I always go out of my way to come here for a taco and the best refried beans north of the border. Generous amounts of chips and salsa are included (in a box) as they have been since the beginning of (my) time. If you own Titos, please don't change a thing... not a thing (well, except adjustments for inflation... :) You are perfect the way you are.
