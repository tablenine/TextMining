Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
Overall:  Food is pretty good, but my experiences with service being bad makes me not want to give them anymore business.. . Well, I give them that their grits are killer, and a lot of their food is pretty good.  I used to go here often, not the Buckhead location, but others around town.  The last time I went to the Buckhead location, something about the service ticked me off, and I didn't go back for a year.  This morning, my husband talked me into giving them another try.  I went in ready to make a new start, but after today's experience ... I don't think we are going back.  The pancakes came out just slightly warm to touch, but cool to eat.  And on a cold day, the last thing I wanted was cool pancakes.  But the server never came back to check on us, it wasn't even that busy, he was just chatting away with other servers.  After my husband was nearly finished eating his meal, I finally had to ask someone to get our server. I asked if I can get a substitute for half of the pancakes, I asked for a biscuit and grits instead.  That didn't seem like it was going to be a problem, but when the bill came, they charged me for the extra grits.  And no one apologized to me about the pancakes.  In fact, our server ignored us and tried not to make eye contact the rest of our visit, not even asking how everything was the second time my food came out.  It's weird, because it's not like I was snobby about it, I approached it in a nice way.  In my opinion, servers need to care about their customers, care if they are happy with the food. And if something's wrong with the order ... they should be happy and willing to make it right.  I'm just not used to bad service in restaurants, you know, since they work for tips.
