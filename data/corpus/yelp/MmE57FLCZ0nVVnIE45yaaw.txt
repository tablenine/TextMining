Sooo....I promise my three sisters authentic Spanish tapas at LA Paella for Presidents Day.....my treat....cuz that's how I roll....FFWD to 2:15pm on Beverly Blvd. DESPERATELY looking for San Vicente blvd cuz thats where the place is AND cuz it closes at 2:30 for lunch!  As you...my astute yelper have already inferred....we DID NOT find LA Paella OR San Vicente AND it all turns out for the best! WHY you ask?! It's simple....we end up at Versailles for a killer cuban lunch! (Ah yes!....Cuban B......). . We stroll into the spot and are creepily welcomed by NEARLY EVERY WAITER THERE....it was cool and weird all rolled into one.... Pick the table of our choice and I order a much deserved Bohemia (Cuban beers don't exist here...apparently)  and the Yucca Frita for the table... Cold Bohemia, hot yucca....life is good thus far.... Two of my veggiesaurus sisters order the only two veggie options on the menu (bananas and salad?) and my fellow meatasaurus orders up the 1/2 pollo en salsa barbacoa (Sweet n Juicy roasted half chicken with BBQ!) and I opt for the Pan con Lechon Samich (Shredded Roasty Pork on Cuban Bread with grilled onions!)  Now...Dudes....i kid you not....I hardly nibble on some yucca and sip on my brew when in mere minutes ALL of our food is upon us!  Our humble clan is all near starvation thanks to MAPQUEST(BOO!)....and we all happily dig in! The roast pork is too much.....too much good stuff....think carnitas torta... cuban style....magnifique! The siblings all give the universal "thumbs up" after all is said and done....and all is well and good for Cuban cuisine in honor of US Presidents Day =) Viva Fidel! haha.
