Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
I've only ordered take out from Sticky Rice about 3 times and it has quickly become one of my favorite Thai restaurants. If you love Thai food, you have to try Sticky Rice. Don't let the exotic food options scare you away. You don't have to try any of those dishes. I haven't and don't plan on doing so. . . My favs:. Tiger Prawn and Chicken Karee. En Too soup. Pad se ew w/ tofu and mixed veggies. Salted fish fried rice w/egg. . I definitely want to try more dishes!
