Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
My visit to Taco Cabana was a triumph of nostalgia over first impressions.. . When I first lived in Atlanta in 1990/91, this place had decent, fast chow and was usually hopping with interesting people.. . Move the calendar forward to 2010. I had time to kill waiting for Jim to cut my hair at Axiom, so K and I strolled over to Taco Cabana to grab a fast knosh. I told her about eating there with friends in the 'before time'...and that was where the fun died.. . The lot was trashy and unkept, and the building looked as if it had not been painted since I last walked in the doors 19 years ago.. . The interior was no less shabby, and the cashier clearly had a case of "don't give a shit" in both English and Spanish. I ordered a burrito and K a taco. When I brought them back and we opened them, we were both disgusted at the unidentifiable orange fluid in each. . . Had I ordered something with chorizo, I would know that orange fluid. I didn't. I ordered chicken, and all that was in it was some sad-looking strips of lettuce and a couple of chunks of wilted tomato along with the mysterious orange fluid. I choked down enough to not be hungry and tossed the rest.. . Some other reviewer mentioned Taco Cabana in Texas; comparing this run-down excuse to any of those in Texas is beyond idiotic. Having dined out in Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Harlingen, Galveston, Odessa, Dallas, and Ft.. Worth, I can assure you: at no taqueria in Texas do you get food this bad or service this indifferent.. . I'm not sure I can apologize enough times to K to make up for taking her there. Don't make the same mistake.
