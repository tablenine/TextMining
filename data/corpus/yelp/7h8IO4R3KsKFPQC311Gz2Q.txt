Ending up here on a whim, we found the uber modern decor and furniture to be quite telling of the establishment itself.  The front door opens into what looks like a carry out counter.  We were seated in a room over to the right that had a bar running the whole length of it.. . Our meal started with an app.  The 'Deconstructed Tapanade.'  This was actually the highlight of our experience.  The flavors mixed well and though I know next to nothing about what a tapanade is, it had some of my favorite foods in it.. . I split the main dish with my date, the carbonara flatbread.  The problem is that it comes as a whole pie without any slices cut in it.  If the flatbread weren't so tough, I wouldn't mind, but just trying to cut slices was making a huge mess.. . Also, I find the non-alcoholic drinks to be a little bit silly.  There's basically a selection of lesser known sodas and some kitschy fruit drinks that are basically virgin cocktails like "Safe Sex on the Beach."  These in my opinion are overpriced for what is really just juice.  In addition upon being seated, I felt like I was dealing with a hotel mini-bar because there was some fancy name brand water on our table that we were given the choice of or tap or sparkling.  Maybe I'm just not that classy.. . I was also in a bad mood because they had the bears game on the tv's over the bar.  Maybe if they were having a good season, but then again, I wouldn't be out having dinner at that time.
