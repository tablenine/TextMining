Went here with work folks and damn.....great pizza.  Maybe it's better to go at lunch on a weekday.  The pizza is damn good.  Fresh, thin crust - sausage &amp;amp; arugula.  I could not stop saying yum with a big smile on my face.  Service was slow - I think they were short-handed.  I'll be back - fer shur!  . . Update:  I don't know what crazy person gave this only 4 stars...i musta been drunk or something.  This has become my FAVORITE pizza place in Chicago.
