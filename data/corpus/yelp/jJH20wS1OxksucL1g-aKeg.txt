I love it here!  I gotta say though...I've been very lucky in that every time I've gone - no matter what day/time - I've always found a spot at the bar with minimal wait.  And from reading many of the reviews, that's a big issue.  I also agree with most people that the burger is kinda over-hyped.  I personally am not much of a fan of the burger.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's delicious!  BUT...it's waaaay too fancy to be considered a "burger".  Even for gastro-pub standards.  It's a very good burger, but there are probably 3 or 4 other burgers I crave over the FO burger.  . . Now the duck confit salad...that's something else!!  It already sounds pretentious!  The fries and sweet potato fries are both must-haves too.  (over the FO burger too).  I definitely crave those items.  . . I do like how the bartenders will always take the time in teaching patrons about the beers, no matter what the wait is like.  The beer selection is great!  I love it!
