The food was unbelievable!  We had the Chicken and Mushroom Dumplings, Duck and Pho Spices Dumplings, the Udon Noodles, and the Rice Cake Noodles.  We went at about 4pm on a Sunday so there was no wait and we didn't feel crowded at the communal tables.  Our only complaint was there were not a lot of options for healthly eaters. Definately will be back!
