Horrible! I've eaten here twice, the first time was 4 years ago and was bad. I thought I'd give it a second chance but it was worse. I am picky about meat and the first time I ate here, I found a hard piece of something (probably cartilage, we called it a knee-cap), the second time I found a bone. The meat is flavorless and you have to pick out skin and bones. Not worth eating here in my opinion. I also used the restroom downstairs at Underdogg (same owner) and was sick to my stomach for an hour after seeing the facilities. The toilet was caked with vomit/diarrhea and they had a bread rack next to the toilet. Here's to hoping I don't get food poisoning.
