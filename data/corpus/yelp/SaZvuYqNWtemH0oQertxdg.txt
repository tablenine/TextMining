I can't take allot of these negative reviews seriously!. it inspires me to go more to these places lol!. . As for Amanda's nasty review um it was brunch and when you go to brunch you gotta wait- The whole of Chicago is going.. try NEW York city lol!. . we went to FF on a Friday night it was escellent , service, presentation quality of food and back ground atmosphere.. The pinot noir wasn't the best but this isn't a fine dining wine bar, so you get what you pay for.. we will be back !
