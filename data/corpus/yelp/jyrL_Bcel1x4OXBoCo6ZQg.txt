Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This is a tough review because Little Door used to be one of my favorite places until my last visit.  I've always had great ood and service there,but on my visit the food was just so-so and we had a HORRIBLE waiter.  He was French and had that attitude and look of "what do you want?" like we were bothering him to be at his table.  Hopefully it was a one time thing.
