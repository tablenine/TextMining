Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Breakfast: Lox, eggs, and onions scramble.. . Lunch: Pastrami on rye, yellow mustard, and a vanilla egg cream.. . What could be better?  Minus a star because this place started the trend of vastly overpriced deli food.  BTW it's a crackup that they call it "Kosher-style deli" when it serves bacon.
