Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
Finally,  truly spot-on Ethiopian food in Atlanta!  I'd tried a couple of other places and been satisfied, but unimpressed.  After consulting Yelp, we gave Desta a try and were thrilled.  The vegetarian sampler is definitely the way to go - it comes with six different delightful dishes and plenty of perfectly-tangy injera.  Great for both newcomers to and longtime fans of Ethiopian cuisine, Desta's won me over.
