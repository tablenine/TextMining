Beer and chicken wings is the way to go. their fried halibut makes you want to turnto  the right and hump their legs, its might tasty. Their rice bowl with ground chicken and quail egg a must order before anything else. wait i think the beer is the first and than the rice bowl. Its a great place to get your stomach full with your friends and talk smack to each other.. . This place is small and cluttered with wood beams coming out of everywhere. I never sit in the backroom where you have to sit on the floor, if you don't do yoga or stretch ever so often the backroom isnt for you. parking isn't too bad, sometimes you have to double park in the back and the waitresses will let you know if you have to move your car.  i only tell you this so you don't go here, so that when i go here there will be a table already open for me =0)
