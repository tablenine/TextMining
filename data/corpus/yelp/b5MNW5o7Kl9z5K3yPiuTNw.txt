I can't believe this place has earned an average of 4 stars. I tried to eat dinner here the other night with some friends from out of town; it was easily the worse restaurant food I have had in Atlanta since moving here several Â years ago. . . I tried the shrimp salad, husband got the turduckon burger, and friends had the veggie burger and beef burger, respectively. Only the beef burger was even close to edible. It was late and there were no other options open so I choked down my salad. My husband only took one or two bites of his food. If Grant Central Pizza had been open, we would have sent the food back and gone next door. Maybe they were just really, really off the night we went. Be careful.
