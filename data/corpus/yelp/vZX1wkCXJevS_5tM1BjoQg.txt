If you're going here for the food, you've got your priorities confused.. This place is for desert exclusively.  I mean, go ahead and try the rest, but really the desert can't be beat.  . Tarts, cakes, tortes, cookies, eclaires, I could go on.... Try it.. It gets crowded, and they're not open SUPER late, but go out of your way if you're down with sweets.
