Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
This restaurant is a disgrace to Mexican people and Â Mexican food. There is nothing authentic about this restaurant. I was completely turned off by the food...YEs, the place is all Mexican decor, that doesnt mean that the food is going to be great. I went with 3 other people and we all ordered three different dishes. And you know what? They were all made the same exact way with the same exact flavor: horrible! I would not recommend this place to anyone unless it was to torture them.
