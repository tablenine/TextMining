I hit up Straits with a group of guys I ran into at a concert, just a few blocks away at the Fox. Since they invited me to their post-show outing and included me in their rounds of sake shots, I couldn't help but have anything but a great time. . . Straits offers a chill, modern atmosphere. I especially like the lights hanging above the bar: bright red and white squares, almost moving like the clocks in a Dal√≠ painting.. . I sampled several appetizers: the Roti Prata (a delicious, soft, warm Indian flatbread served with a curry dipping sauce), the Poh Pia (spring rolls stuffed with shrimp, sausage, carrots and peanuts, the accompanying spicy sauce adding the perfect ka-POW!), fried shrimp wontons (Wontons. Fried. Need I go into more detail?) and the Kung Pao "Lollipops" (an amazing chicken dish, cut like rack of lamb, topped with crushed peanuts and red jalapeno). . . On the way out, one of the men in the group yelled to the manager, "Hey man, I loved those chicken fingers!" Hahaha.
