Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
apple pan is pretty legit in my book.  good burgers, good fries and good pie.  and considering that this is most of their menu, they pretty much win in life.  they are cash only.  you sorta need to know what you want to order very fast.  indecisiveness is never a good friend for anyone, especially if you are eating at apple pan.  the seating is first come first serve.  yeah that means you have to watch people eat the delicious burgers in front of you but soon, you will have your time. i love how they serve their drinks in little paper cone things too.. . p.s i think the number listed here is wrong bc i called and i got a very pissed off old lady telling me that "no this is NOT the apple pan!"
