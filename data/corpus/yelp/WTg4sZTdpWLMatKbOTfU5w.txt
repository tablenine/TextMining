pretty pricey with small portions.. i guess just you go to see and be seen.... by who? i dont know. arent there better places for that these days? . came here with a date a few years back, and we were so dissatisfied with the portions/quality of the food that we ended up going to in n out afterwards to fill our stomachs. now THATS something to yelp about.
