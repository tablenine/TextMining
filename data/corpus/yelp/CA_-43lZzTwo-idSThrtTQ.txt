Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Apple Pan... oh man, where can I start?  Delicious burgers, great service (or at least the most entertaining service) and the best pie in LA.  For your best bets get: Hickory Burger, fries, and a slice of Apple Pie (or their delectable Banana Creme Pie)-- although this place is a once and awhile place for me because all that above will run you 20+ dollars with tax and tip.  Until I write that million dollar screenplay, I'll never get to come here as often as I would like to...
