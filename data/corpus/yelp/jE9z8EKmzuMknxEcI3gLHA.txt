Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Visited 5/29/2009 at 9:15 pm and it was busy.  I had the turkey burger and my friend had the Umami burger.  We had a small green salad and two orders of french fries.  . . The turkey burger was small and the top was dripping in the garlic aioli.  I sent it back and they quickly brought a new burger with a dab of goat cheese (less than a teaspoon).  The fries were cooked to perfection.  I wish they had salt &amp; pepper on the tables.  Their homemade ketchup tasted like tomato sauce with agave nectar (pfst).   The Umami burger has a shitake and roasted tomato flavor that is satisfying.  My friend's complaint was that his burger was very buttery and rich.   The green salad was fresh.  It was tossed with a perfectly balanced vinaigrette.  The service was quick.  The dinning area is modern decorated with glass, metal, wood and concrete.  Any sound made indoors bounces and echos endlessly, so I recommend eating outside.   The photos show voluminous height and bigger burgers.  The actual size of the burger is smaller.  We ordered pickles and it cost $4.00.   So total cost for:  two burgers, two french fries, one salad and two glasses of tap-water came out to $36.00 without tip.
