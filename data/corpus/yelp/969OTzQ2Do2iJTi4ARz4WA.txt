Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Good atmosphere, full of people (in a good way)... offers indoor &amp; outdoor seating.  My group snagged a secluded booth in a corner of the restaurant near the kitchen.  . . Overall, I didn't like the idea of having to pay for all the extras in the soup and would have rather had them come free.   Also, the spice seemed to wash out some of the other tastes in the food.  . . A fun experience overall.  . . I personally prefer Daikokuya even though there can be a long wait for a table.
