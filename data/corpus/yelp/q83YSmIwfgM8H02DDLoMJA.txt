I want to like this place so more than I do. In theory, I like everything about it. I like that it's independent, I like that it's a real coffeehouse, I like that it's full of books and art. But.... . The service here is stunningly bad. Granted, I'm not here that often, so that may have improved. I now go in only once or twice a year (despite living less than a mile away) because I have a friend who loves the hot chocolate. But I used to shop here all the time, primarily for whole bean coffee. And it was next to impossible to get anyone to serve you. The staff are far more interested in chatting with each other than waiting on customers.. . I'm kind of a grumpy old man, so I am not really Kopi's demographic. But with Taste of Heaven right up the street, I have no reason to come here.
