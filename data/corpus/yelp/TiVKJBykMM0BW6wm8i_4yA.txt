A friend and I did Straits a couple of weeks ago and can't say anything bad the experience.  I enjoyed the restaurant and atmosphere...very cosmo, upbeat and contemporary...the interior design wasn't much different than I recall Spice being.  Enjoyed the food which...asain influence, small plates and sharing.  Service was on point...seated promptly with reservations on a beautiful Friday night, and great attention without being pests while dining.  The bar area looked cute although I did the dining area.  I'll definitely be back soon.
