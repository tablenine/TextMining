Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Everyone is their own critic, but I happen to like it. My friend and I just got done with a Tosh.O taping and the only thing we know in Culver City to eat is Tito's Tacos. Love the cheese on the tacos and the salsa. Yea the lines might be crazy insane, but you get your food fast.
