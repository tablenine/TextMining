Visiting LA and went to dinner here last night w/ friends. We had made a reservation for 8:30. We called at 8:00 to see if they were running on schedule for our reservation and were told they were running 15 minutes late. We arrived at 8:45 and checked in. We ended up waiting (standing outside holding our BYOB) until 9:30. The hostess never came out to give us updates and didn't offer any explanation about the wait time. Call me crazy, but I think an hour wait after you've made a reservation, deserves a little something - free dessert or just a little communication would have been nice. . . Once inside, all was well. I thought the food was delicious. We ordered: . Bacon wrapped dates (yum!) . Roasted Beet Salad (I love beets and was disappointed by the really small portion) . Wood Fired Asparagus (yum!) . Steamed Mussels (well prepared, nothing spectacular) . Fried Chicken (super good - we ordered a second portion) . Socca Cakes - with cilantro sauce &amp; with honey and goat cheese (ordered a second portion of cilantro - wouldn't order the honey and goat cheese again. too much like eating pancakes.) . Risotto of the Day (delicious and piping hot) . Crispy Green Lentils (YUM YUM YUM! my favorite!!) . Olives (great to nibble on throughout the meal) . Paprika Spiced potatoes (served w/ ketchup and aioli. very crisp and tasty.) . Churros (like big doughnuts served with delicious melted chocolate. bigger portion than i expected given the other portion sizes. these were delicious.) . . Fun place to go w/ friends, take your own wine and enjoy the high-energy atmosphere. The five of us ended up ordering a whopping 15 items by the time we were done, which, while that sounds like an obscene amount of food, left us all satisfied but certainly not stuffed.
