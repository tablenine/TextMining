Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
Attended Nacional 27 this weekend for a birthday, and my overall experience was okay.  The complimentary chips and salsa when we sat down was excellent, more so the salsa which was very tasty.  For my entree, I had the tequila marinated chicken.  That didn't blow me away, was just okay.  My friend ordered the suckling pig.  I imagined a pig, or big chunks of meat, with crispy skin on the outside.  But alas it was only a plate of shredded or chunks of pork....very disappointing.  At 11PM on Saturdays, they have have a dj and clear the floor to dance.  We danced a little with the ladies, and had a good time with that.. . Overall, okay food, good service, okay downtown prices.
