Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
THIS IS MY PREFERENCE! I've been to Lawry's several times and London Broiled is not my preference, I like mines smoked, bbq, Texan style! Lawry's would be the proper English way of eating prime rib, "Lawry's cut" its a nice good cut, order some asparagus, and cream spinach, and your set for the night. But if you really want some flavor in your meat, skip over Lawry's, and just go down the street over at Stinkin Rose! If you really like prime rib Texan style with a nice ambiance, go to Houston.
