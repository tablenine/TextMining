For the price, the location next to Kroger's isn't all that great and the food isn't very authentic. The interior makes it seem dismal and sort of old, so it's not very appealing.. . If you're shooting for authentic japanese, I'd seek elsewhere. . . We paid over $30 for dinner, which is alright, but I'd expect more from the taste and ambience.
