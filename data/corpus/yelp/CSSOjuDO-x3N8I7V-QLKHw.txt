This place is either very good or very bad. Its weird becuse you get to have both at the same time. Its like a sandwich with deliciousness on one side and ickyness on the other. . . The wait sucks, but I expected that.. The staff was bizarre. The host was so over the top happy to see us I was worried that he mistook me for someone on americas most wanted and was planning on collecting a huge reward.  My actual waitress was absent. we got bread at the end of the meal. (Unless bread is a traditional Italian after dinner mint?)  Every time she did show herself she kept asking where she knew me from. Its possible that she eventually remembered where she knew me from, decided she hated me and took it out on me by ignoring me. Whatever.. . The cheese was good, but its not like they actually make the cheese, you know? Its just cheese. And that was the best part of the meal- everything else was just ok.
