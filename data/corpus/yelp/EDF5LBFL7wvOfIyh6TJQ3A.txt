Why all the hate? I went to Rosa Mexicano with my boyfriend for Valentine's day and I absolutely had no qualms. We got the famed guacamole and it was so delicious that I wanted to lick the bowl. As said in other reviews, it was made fresh in front of us and well worth the $12. . . Our waitress was amazing and very attentive. She asked for dietary concerns and directed the boyfriend to another dish since he was allergic to shrimp. He had the Tablones and I had the Arrachera Con Camarones. They were both delicious and a pretty decent portion that when we were done eating those, we had no room for dessert. The bill came out to around $60, no alcoholic drinks.. . Very good for dates, the interior is gorgeous!
