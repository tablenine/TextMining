Restaurant: Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries

Hey, I'm a vegetarian and I love this place.  . My boyfriend is omnivorous and enjoys a good burger. . This place uses fresh ingredients - not frozen beef, high grade.. The veggie sandwich is really good!  Cheese, lettuce, tomato, and grilled shrooms, if you please.  They have assured me that they cook the veggies on a different grill from the cow flesh.  :). Best fries - ever.  Fried in peanut oil and they give you a lot of them.  . They have vinegar, also!  Downside:  they use styrofoam.  :(
