This place looked so promising on the website and I was excited about the chefs.  However, we experienced something else.. . I understand that they haven't been open very long and they filled up quickly so some people had to wait outside for a table.  Speaking of tables, they have these long communal tables and ironically, my friend and I were seated across from a high school classmate from California that I haven't seen in 9 years!  Small world.. . We think that they mixed up our order with our neighbors since we practically ordered the same thing.  The duck dumplings were good, but $8 for four little dumplings?  The pork and cilantro dumplings were also good but seemed pretty typical to me.  I also tried some of my friend's ramen and pork belly but I've had better ramen at Sea Ranch.  I ended up ordering the soba noodles but then again, I've had handmade soba noodles so that was a bit disappointing, as well.. . Overall, for the quality of the food, it was definitely overpriced compared to what I've had, and I probably won't be back again.  A+ for effort, B for food, but overall experience, C-.
