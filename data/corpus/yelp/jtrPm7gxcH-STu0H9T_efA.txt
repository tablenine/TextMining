Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Two things you should know about the Stinking Rose:. 1)It is the place you should take your friends when they visit LA.  Semi-famous and in many ways the quintessence of LA . 2)You will come out reeking of garlic. Ergo, not a specially good date place, especially as it's always very crowded and rather noisy. But great for a meal between friends or with a group of friends. The food is amazing, if pricey, ranging from pasta to steak to seafood. My friend and I had a huge lobster platter and it was one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted.  Budget is high($20-up) but worth it - this is one of those once-or-twice a year places. Decor is faintly Indian, faintly Spanish; very red and exotic. In fact, it reminded me of nothing so much as a harem, but in a good way - a highly unusual setting. Valet parking. Definitely try to get a reservation ahead of time; this is a very popular place. And in case you missed this poignant fact...everything they make has garlic in it. . Enjoy.
