I went there with my relatives who live in chicago. Unfortunately we had a waiter who was desi, as we are. So he thought we didn't know anything and tried to give us steak with masala and everything, desi style. now i know its out of good heart and everything but that ruined the steak place for me. me and a couple of my cousins were really getting pissed, we just wanted a normal steak, not spiced. if i needed to add spices and masalas to my food i would get a meat that has no taste like chicken. but steak come on man, it taste amazing just with butter. a tender and juicy steak thats all I was asking for. so the meal went on he brought this food out spiced and just wasn't fun or good. hopefully i will get to go again and have the true gibson experience but so far i havent. but i will give the guy credit on service he did a good job, but just tried to hard.
