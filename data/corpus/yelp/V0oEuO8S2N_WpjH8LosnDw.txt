Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
My go-to restaurant for group birthday dinners and other special events (on the cheap). Â BYOB, delicious pad see eew, great value for the sushi... I particularly recommend the dragon roll and the samurai roll!. . I have also ordered delivery and takeout from Butterfly, and it always does a great job - timely delivery, still delicious at home.
