You can do whatever you want with your seafood herell. They just throw it in a big bag and mix it around for you in their spices and sauces. Gets pretty messy too, but its pretty darn tasty.. . The wait in line kills it though... They're opening up in a bunch of places though so hopefully that'll shorten the line here a little. Actually haven't been back in a while, shall return soon
