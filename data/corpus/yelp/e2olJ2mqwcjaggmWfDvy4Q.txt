Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I can't stand Hollywood places that are overly trendy and all about prancing around for one another.. . Now, if I liked those kind of places, Geisha House is the perfect place for that.. . I remember thinking the food was alright and the drinks were alright but so expensive. I was there for a bachelorette party. I don't think the girls had all that much fun. We tried to get out of there as soon as we paid the bill.
