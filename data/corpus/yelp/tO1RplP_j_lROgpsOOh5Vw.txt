Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
I had this place recommended to me by two friends. However, they didn't take into account my (pseudo) vegetarianism. I ordered the vegetarian pizza pot pie, which is just not that special. It's not bad, but... I'd rather be eating actual deep dish pizza. I really like the space though and had an enjoyable experience there.
