I think the food here is GREAT. Service has always been good. I think the manager needs to keep up with presentation though, because the last time I went in there the floor looked kind of dirty.. . I love that it stays open really late.  The parking isn't great.  The only time I ever go is after clubbing, and all the parking around is taken up by those going to the different clubs in that area. It might be better during the day.. . Overall my experiences there have been pleasant.
