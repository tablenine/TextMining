I have heard about the ribs here for years.  I live close but never went till last night.  At about 10:50 pm, place was empty which I found odd and unsettling.  (Waitress said that earlier there had been 2 hour wait.  Well, most everyone had cleared out by the time we got there).  We split a slab of ribs (yikes $4 splitting charge), got the onion rings (off of the very limited appetizer menu) and the creamed spinach.  Ribs are quite good.  Onion rings good and cream spinach good.  Drinks were good and on the inexpensive side.  Waitress (who has worked there 13 years very nice).   If I am in the mood for ribs I would venture back.  But wait 2 hours for dinner here??? Never!
