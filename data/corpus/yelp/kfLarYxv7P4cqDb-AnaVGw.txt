Last time I was here, I waited in a really, really long line! It's kind of a small place.  Once you make it inside, you will notice there are autographed pictures of famous celebrities that visited over the years.. . The length of the dog itself is about 8 inches long and pretty thick.  You can get them regular or spicy.  Add as much toppings or get a pre-ordered topping.. . I'm not sure if it's worth the wait, per se, but definitely stop by to give it a try.
