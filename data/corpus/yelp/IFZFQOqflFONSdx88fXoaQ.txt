Now I am a sushi lover and this place blew me away. Its literally a whole in the wall spot in a strip mall but I guess the sushi chef make up for the location.. I would return any-day, anytime. I am not a particularly big fan of the other Katsu-Yas but this one was great. We had reservations and luckily we got seated immediately.. It definitely is a hotspot to meet celebs and i caught 2 or 3 coming in while we were eating.. The order:-. -Crispy Spinach with seared toro...seasonal but totally yummy. -Tuna crab cone...dip in soy sauce with a bit of wasabi...your taste buds will tanks you. -White fish carpaccio with cumquat...too bad its an appetizer i want way more.. -Red snapper with Shizu leaf &amp; lemon...special order, not on menu but def one you should try.. -Spicy tuna roll with Rock shrimp tempura...good combination especially in soy paper.. -Honey Roll...couldnt leave without trying it!!!. . Overall this place hit it on the spot in all the areas I was interested in =)
