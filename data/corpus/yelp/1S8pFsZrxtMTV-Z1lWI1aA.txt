The food is okay. I really like the spicy basil fried rice some times however , it is oversauced and a little soggy. Once I asked the waiter if they could special make the spicy fried rice but use diet glass noodles instead. he wouldn't even check. he just said that they only use the glass noodles for special dishes, and then pointed out a $25 dish. I explained again, and ask if he'd check with the kitchen. He stated, he's had experience in the kitchen and it couldn't be done. Â It would have been nice if he indulged me and walked back there and come back without even asking. but he didn't over that much. we gave him a bad tip and explained why we did it. Next time we went in there, he fawned over us. we even got hot towels even though we weren't ording sushi. This time he got his full 25% and I didn't special order.
