Cha dol gui is simply the best meal you can get for the price you pay! All Korean restaurants give you banchan - which are small side dishes for garnish and appetizers. The meal will also come with fried rice at the end of the BBQ. It is mixed with all the banchan and plus kimchi stock. I wish that I took my parent's here when they came to visit. . . The other dishes were delicious but I've had better in NY. I do love mul nang mun - buckwheat noodle with cold beef stock, pickled radish and cucumbers. It is refreshing with the korean BBQ.
