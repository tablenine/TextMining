Restaurant: Green Sprout
Category: Vegetarian
This was the first vegetarian restaurant I found after my vegetarian girlfriend moved here from New York. She absolutely loved it and so did I, and we proceeded to go here once a week for the next month or two. Though we go less now (Average prices but it sucks to rack up a $30 bill once a week!) I still love this place. I'd recommend the chicken curry (In general their fake chicken is great but this is especially savory), the drumsticks (Yes!), and the house mushroom soup (Different, but a highlight for sure.). . The staff is fantastic, I will never forget when the chef made me a fantastic off the menu dish. . . Go to Green Sprout, get the drumsticks. . . (PS- Thank you Green Sprout for delivering to my Downtown condo- very much appreciated.)
