I really enjoy the menu and the staff is pretty fun. It's a microbrewery, and their selection of beers is as varied and tasty as a Chinese buffet. The prices basically meet your expectations because it is in the heart of tourist central, but you're not going there to save money. You're there for the great rooftop bar, the great atmosphere and the pretty people.. . In the fall, they added a whole bunch of TVs in their back room to ramp up the sport-friendly vibe, but when during my last visit in the late fall, there were some oddities about the redesign. There is a giant wall that has four flat screens in a square pattern, but if you're sitting in one of the comfortable booths on the opposite wall, you're not going to get that great of a view. Each TV needs to be at least another 20 inches bigger to accommodate the size of the room. And a game was projected on the brick wall where they used to hang large vintage beer posters. Literally, ON THE BRICK WALL. I just assume they didn't have the screen hung yet, but it's complete nonsense to have an 8 foot projected imagine on brown brick. If it was some sort of post-modern statement on America's obsession with sports and how following sports does not make you an athlete or something, it didn't work.. . Technical issues aside, you're going to find some solid appetizers and entrees that won't see on every other menu in the area. You and your friends need to order a few things and share them, like the ball park pretzel, chicken fried chicken, firecracker shrimp, or the mac and chicken. And don't forget to get a sampler of their microbrews so you can decide what to drink for the rest of the night.
