Been here twice: once for dinner and once for brunch.  Dinner was great--I tried to get in elsewhere and they were all booked (Saturday night dinner and I forgot to call a few days ahead).  Hostess said, we're booked, but let me see what I can do for you!  Sure enough, they got 3 of us in at 7:45 p.m. perfect!  Fresh food, fresh veggies, good wine list.  My husband had some Cabot cheddar as an appetizer, which was SO good.  I had pork belly, which was delicious and I think my dad had some pasta or something--everything was delicious.  Service was excellent.. . For brunch, was able to make a reservation easily for Sunday at noon (made the reservation I think Thursday before).  Staff was very nice and accommodating.  The bloody Mary was delicious and I had the biscuits and gravy, which were very good.  Unfortunately, our server was new or was just "off" that day because she didn't know what beers were on tap and my husband asked for the beer list and she brought the wine list... just totally didn't pay attention to the list she gave us.  Our friends got their drinks after 10-15 minutes, which was too long.  We kind of thought she forgot.  They were out of crab cakes eggs Benedict (damnit) and no duck confit... two big items on the menu they were out of?  Oh well.  My husband really enjoyed his burger and the spicy ketchup it came with.  The fries were big fat steak fries, but were hot and salted well, so that was fine.  . Overall, we really like this place, it's close, the food is fresh and the staff are always super nice and accommodating!  It's unexpected since you might think it's a pretentious place, but no.  Definitely try Perennial!
