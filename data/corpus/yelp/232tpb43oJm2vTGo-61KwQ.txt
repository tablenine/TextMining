Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
What more could I add that hasn't already been said?  This is a great mom and pop restaurant that has been around as long as i can remember.  Although the pepperoni pizza is good, they make a great hot roast beef sandwich and the garlic bread is great!.  I rarely go to Casa on the weekends as there is always a line out the door to get in.  I am not very patient  especially when I am hungry,  So if you go here on the weekends go early!!  Parking is also a challenge but it is worth it.  I run into old high school friends from time to time.  You never know who you might run into if you grew up in Eagle Rock.
