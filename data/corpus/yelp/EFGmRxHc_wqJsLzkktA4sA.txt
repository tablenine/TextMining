3.5 stars.. . Setting, service, decor, food, ambiance, and great company. Everything was irreproachable, until that fateful moment. . . I was recommended to try the monk fish "francaise". It was 3 hearty chunks, on top of spinach, and creamed potatoes. Was it good? No! It was GREAT! They cooked the fish perfectly. It was slightly undercooked, which left the fish super moist. Great entree, and cooked perfectly. We first started off with fresh mozzarella, Â on top of prosciutto. I didn't try the prosciutto, but the cheese was super. It felt like it was made, one minute before I ate it.. . Then, it happened. Remember a time when you first had bad sex? You were looking forward, to such an momentous moment, only to be let down? Sucks right? That's how I felt when the dessert came. I was told they have two pastry chefs. I am curious if they've ever tried their own concoctions. If they do, then I am left uneasy. The only nice parts about the dessert, was a small dollop of ice cream. As grandiose the ice cream tasted, it still left you in a difficult predicament. A great meal, with a bad dessert. . . I would come back for the food, but never for the dessert. . . Minus 1.5 stars, for uncreative pastry chefs.
