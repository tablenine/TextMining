Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
I'm shocked by some of the reviews here...I'm not from LA, so maybe I haven't had the exposure to such amazing restaurants, but I felt the need to stray from my Denver yelping to comment on Osteria Mozza.. . This was the best meal I think I've ever had. It had been recommended to me by others who knew I was in town, and I am forever in debt for this referral.. . We started with the Octopus and the Mozz trio. I don't even like Octopus and it was delicious. The burrata...wow...let me just pause for a minute. It was heaven on my tongue. I actually giggled and didn't know what to say when I first tasted it, it was so good.. . We tried a couple of the pastas and each got a different main course too, so tried quite a variety of things. They were all completely amazing, mouth watering. I have to apologize for not remembering the name of the wine we had...it was a Chianti bout $60 and it was soooo good. If I wasn't so distracted by the party in my mouth, I would've written down the name.. . We had a late reservation and had to wait a bit, but got lucky by being seated in the quieter room off the main restaurant. Regardless,it was worth the wait. Mario Batali is a genius.
