This place isn't as nice as Tahoe. It's got a more backyard bbq feel to it, but hey sometimes that is what you need. It is 2 dollars cheaper than Tahoe. Seating is cramped, but the meats are good. If it's your birthday tell them. They will give you a bottle of champagne on the house, but it will ultimately end up all over you. It's a good place to kick back with some buddies, but watch the alcohol tab because it can quickly add up esp the yogurt soju. Stick with the beer and straight soju.
