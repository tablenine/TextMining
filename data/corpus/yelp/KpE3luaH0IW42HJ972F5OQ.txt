For the best martini's you'll ever have, come to Lola's! Just remember not to come here for the food, it's all about the martini's! First off, you can't come here without trying their apple martini (word on the street is that they are the original creators of this concoction!) Other must try's are the Chocolate Martini (yummy, chocolatey goodness!), Clockwork Orange (tastes like Orange Julius), The Star F*cker Martini (really good AND gets you tipsy pretty quickly) and The Strawberry Fields Martini. The drinks can add up pretty quickly so if you're on a budget, I would recommend coming during Happy Hour, which is from 5:30-7:30 daily and for the ladies there are 2 for 1 specials on Sundays! One last tip, save your $5 for Happy Hour instead of Â the valet parking, if you drive around there's usually street parking available in the area.
