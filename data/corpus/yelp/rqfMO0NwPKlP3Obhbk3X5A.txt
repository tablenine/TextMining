Restaurant: Mirai
Category: Sushi Bars
I've had a lot of sushi from a lot of restaurants and Mirai is the BEST BY FAR! Atmosphere-wise, the downstairs was just ok, almost like a cafeteria. The upstairs is much sleeker. All in all, it doesn't stand apart from the other trendy sushi lounges in decorations. But where it separates itself from the crowd is in the actual food. The baked king crab app and the specialty rolls (the first four on the menu) are like nothing you've tasted at other sushi places. It would be a travesty to let these rolls touch the soy sauce.
