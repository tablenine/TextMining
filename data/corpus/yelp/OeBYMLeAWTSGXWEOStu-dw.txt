Visited this popular LA establishment today and came away neither impressed nor disappointed.  I had the lamb sandwich with Swiss cheese and was impressed with the flavor; make sure you specify you want your sandwich "double-dipped."  The lamb was very tender which made the sandwich taste good.  The horseradish is great; it'll clear out your nose that's for sure.  The portion size was much smaller than what I expected so that was a disappointment especially paying nearly $8 for it.. . If you're looking to get filled up, this is not the place.  If you want a flavorful sandwich, definitely get the lamb and enjoy yourself.
