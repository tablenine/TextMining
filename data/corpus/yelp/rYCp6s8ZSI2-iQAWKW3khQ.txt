Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Well the link to the LA Weekly story no longer works, so basically it mentioned the owner of Father's Office, (who allows No Substitutions to his sacred menu) was caught at another well known LA restaurant trying to talk the waitress into making a substitution....and she shot him down based on his own policies...lol
