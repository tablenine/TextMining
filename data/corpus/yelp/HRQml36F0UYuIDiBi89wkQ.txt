Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I don't go to deli's much so I can't compare this place to the Pastrami sandwiches at Juniors or???. . I know I like Johnnie's with swiss and mustard.. . The pickles are great, very crunchy and garlicy.. . Onion rings are what you would like to expect in an onion ring.. . This place is expensive for a sandwich but. good when you are craving Johnnie's. . Occasionally the meat is oversalted and it Â is unbearable. but, that happens rarely.
