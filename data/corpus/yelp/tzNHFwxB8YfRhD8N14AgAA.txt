I love Shanghai dumplings! No, really, I love them. They would be my favorite food if I didn't feel so guilty and choosing just one. And this place, although not five-star quality, is pretty close. It's a 4.5 in my book, but I'm reluctant to give it five-stars.. . Their Juicy Pork Dumplings are divine, and are just the perfect size with just the right amount of soup. If I could, I would eat Shanghai dumplings every day, although not necessarily from this place alone. I also tried their shrimp wonton, and I can't complain. Although, it was just average.. . Finishing up my meal, I had the red bean "dumplings" and if it's anything I learned, it's to not stuff the entire thing in your mouth. Despite it's size, it will have you chewing its goodness for at least two minutes because it's so pasty.. . This place is my second favorite dumpling place, and it will satisfy my craving until the day I will try Luscious Dumplings because, apparently, that place is pretty bomb.
