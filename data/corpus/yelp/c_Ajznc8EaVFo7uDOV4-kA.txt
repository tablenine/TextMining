The truck experience is not for me.  I was encouraged by the crazy long lines, Im thinking so many people standing could not be wrong.  But I'll just say this, I did not like the food. I did not like standing in the street eating the food.  And I did not like standing in line. Perhaps if the Korena flavors were more appealing to me I might have been more satisfied. But Im gonna go with "No thanks, its not for me."
