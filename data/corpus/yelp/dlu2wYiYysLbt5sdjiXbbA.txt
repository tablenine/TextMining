Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I tried this place several years ago, and I think i like it less this time around.  Reason?  Because i have tried (and liked) other soup dumpling places since I've eaten here (Joe's Shanghai in NYC..mmmm!).  Its a bit of a drive to get here, so i made the trip on an errand while in that part of town.  I don't think I would make a special trip just to eat here but its definitely worth a visit if its convenient.  . . Should have just stuck to ordering dumplings, because the other menu items we ordered brought the star rating down to a 3.  The sticky rice shumai was not great, and neither was the pork and vegetable steamed bun.
