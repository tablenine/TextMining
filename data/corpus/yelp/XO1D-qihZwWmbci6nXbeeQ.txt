I had so much garlic here I swore the starlight mints at the exit were garlic flavored.  Now, I'm not so sure.  Hearty meals with more garlic than you can shake a stick at.  The wait staff was attentive and parking was decent. Come to think of it, I really can't say if the food is actually good or not.  What would happen if they didn't put in garlic?  Hmmm...
