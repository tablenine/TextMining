Great place for sushi with a great value. I didn't expect the sashimi plate to fill me up, because it rarely does at other places. But I actually couldn't finish this one. Services was friendly, and we surprisingly didn't have to wait long.. . General rule on Japanese food: Don't let one of your friends convince you that the wasabi is green tea ice cream.
