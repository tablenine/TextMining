Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Unimpressive. Mom does better fried chicken. Hell, I could do better. But, to be fair, when my brother arrived in town, I asked if he was hungry. He's a big boy, easily making two of lil ole me. He was (hungry), after all, just arriving from St Louis eating lousy peanuts. I asked if he still ate fried foods (duh!, but I always try to talk him into non-meats, veggies, etc., he'll never learn). Roscoe's it was, then. Both on our first visit after hearing so much hype about this place, we really wanted to dig into this place. But hey, I'm a "sharp, no b.s." type biatch, and this place was....get ready for it....poor to the max. Let's talk grease. More than enough to coat your insides for weeks no matter how much Metamucil you flush down your innards. Mashed potatoes were watery and tasteless. The gravy only helped slide the greasy chicken down (now two varieties of grease). Veggies were overcooked and soggy. I guess the best thing I found in Roscoe''s was the dry biscuit. You could at least swab it in butter (more grease) and have it act as a sponge to grab onto some of that grease lining your esophagus. Â I didn't like the place. I think I'll pay a visit to dear, ole mom.
