Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Jamie said most of it perfect.... . But, the Coal oven is definitely an interesting twist. Â I'm an Italian from new New Jersey whose grown up around the best pizza on the planet (Jersey, baby).. . Pizza normally cooks in 600 degree ovens. This place has an 800 degree oven.. which is interseting and it seems to work out for them.. . Pizza was good. The sauce, which is what makes the pie, was sweet and soft. Great stuff. . . They're only open 5-10/11, so don't go for lunch
