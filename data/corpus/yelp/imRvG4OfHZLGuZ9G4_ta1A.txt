After hearing so much about this place from friends (and fellow yelpers) it made the list of places for yesterday. . . Location: Easy to get to, off 75, with plenty of parking. . . Decor: The white booths and clean lines gave it a very contemporary and modern feel. The high top tables in the middle was where we were seated. . . Food: App- Vodka battered onion ring, which were very tasty. Entree - Southern Fried Burger, which was a 5.5 oz meat patty, that was deep fried, served with green tomato ketchup, with pimiento cheese. I ordered the side of Sweet Potato tots, which are served with whipped blue cheese spread. . . Drinks: We enjoyed the Apple Cinnamon martini, served with Apple Vodka, apple juice and rimmed with cinnamon and sugar. The Peach Tea beverage was heavy on the ice and not very flavorful. The final drink was the Krispy Kreme milk shake, which was surprisingly not overly sweet. . . The menu is a la carte, and portions were small, which I was quite happy with. Our server was knowledgeable and our wait was no more then 10 minutes, granted it was 5pm on a Saturday. . . Would definitely return back again!
