this place is really cool.  The outside looks like a garage with clear glass, the inside is all metallic tables, kind of like a cafeteria.  The server presents you with a choose your own burger sheet on a clip board.  My 1/3 lb burger was WAY too big to eat, even my pretzel bun couldn't hold the whole thing together.  The burger was so flavorful, perfectly cooked.  I like my burgers medium rare but some places makes it way too bloody and my burger was leaking pink juice but definitely not still red in the middle.  PERFECT.. Their fried onion strings are super delicious with sweet bbq and ranch sauces. I could've eaten the whole order if it wasn't for my foot tall burger.  . Hooray for Groupon again.  2 burgers, an order of onion strings, 2 beers and I paid only $25 for two people!!!! . Can't wait to go back!
