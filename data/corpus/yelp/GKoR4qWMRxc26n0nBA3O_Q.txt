MexiCali has a great atmosphere filled with really attractive male servers!!  The food is amazing and there margarittas are great.  I like the place so much because they have about 50 different types of tequila you can choose from.  Your drinks are not premixed which right there beats most mexican food restaurants.  The drinks are strong and everytime I go I have a blast.  I would say that it is not to upscale but it is a nice place to go with friends to have a great night.  I go there normally once a week and everytime have a blast.
