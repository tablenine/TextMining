J-town L.A. is nostalgic in many ways... . . When I was going to a school nearby downtown LA, my dad and I regularly met up in J-town and explored all the sushi places.  Over the years, it became a routine that we'd check whether the (long) wait at Komasa was tolerable, move on to Sushi-Gen, and then Hama Sushi, in that order.  Even after I moved out of LA, somehow I'd find myself in J-town during the holidays... . . Last night, I retraced the steps and found myself @ Sushi-Gen again, after Komasa closed early because the chef went home sick.  . . Sushi-Gen was exactly how I remember it to be - fine quality sashimi and sushi (albeit over-priced), with a live buzz in the air, esp. if you sit at  the sushi bar (with a minimum of 4 orders per person) where you can see real kitchen action.   The Asian sushi chefs in the front line, and the Mexican sushi sous-chefs in the back.  This is just an awesome melting-pot scene, typical of LA, that you've got to appreciate.   As I did many times before, I secretly wished that one of the Mexican sous-chefs would be promoted to front-line...  but it hasn't happened yet... not when I was there anyhow.  And as I did before, I secretly contemplated an employment class action lawsuit, on behalf of all Mexican sushi chefs who have ever worked at Sushi-Gen...  If my dad was there, he would've heard a whole earful of how the situation was "F@#&amp;%-up", while I'd have to endure one of his lectures on the fine art of sushi by only Japanese chefs. .   . Our politics disagreed, but we agreed that Sushi-Gen served fine sushi.  And last night, even without my dad, Sushi-Gen's sushi was just fine.    . . $2.50 for parking.  Reservation highly recommended.
