This is good stuff. Unlike a few Korean places I've visited, where my Korean friends had to bitch out the servers for not bringing the same panchan as they were providing to entirely Korean groups, I got the full variety of options. As for the food, it's really good quality and I have no complaints. I'm a bigger fan of Korean places that have charcoal grills on the tables, but the stone pans are a pretty good substitute.. . This restaurant can get very crowded, so be forewarned. It's popular, and rightfully so. My only complaint is that even though they do offer beer, for some bizarre reason it's not on the menu. Maybe I'm just utterly idiotic, but I swear they don't list it at all.. . I've had better Korean food in Chicago and NYC, but I'd go back here any time.
