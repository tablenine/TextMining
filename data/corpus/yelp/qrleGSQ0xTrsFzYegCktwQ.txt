Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
After trying to find someplace to eat in the Loop on a Sunday night after a day at the Planetarium, my husband I gave up on that fool's errand (plenty of great places to eat, but most of them closed), and returned home to Logan Square.  I had noticed a small Italian restaurant on California the week before, so we decided to try it out.  Buona Terra turned out to be great!  It's very cute, the bread with dipping sauce is amazing, and our entrees were very good.  I had Paillard di Polli al Palio, and my husband had the Fettucine Primavera.  Both had a very good, but delicate flavor.  We ordered the New York Cheesecake with chocolate sauce for dessert, and it was delicious.  The chocolate was sweet, but not overpoweringly so.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant out.  I give it four stars because it didn't knock my socks off or make me dream about their food.  But it was a great meal with great atmosphere at a good price, so I'll definitely be returning.  I'm excited to head over for the Thursday night prix fixe!
