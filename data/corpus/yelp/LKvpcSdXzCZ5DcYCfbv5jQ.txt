Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I made my first visit to Johnnie's earlier tonight, on a coin toss decision between the aforementioned purveyors of pastrami and Tito's Tacos.  I had the house special pastrami on roll.  Pastrami was fatty and delicious, served to table in a veritable instant.  High praise for the rolls that they serve, it holds up to the grease of the pastrami.  Onion rings followed the sandwich, golden brown, small, sweet, with a cracker meal batter (these are old school rings, hard to find these days).  I dined al fresco, on their patio next to the fire pit.  The astro-turf, malibu lighting, and fire pit fused together with the pastrami and rings and I was caught in a Tarrantinoesque scene that you can only find in one of LA classic eateries like Johnnie's.   If you are a Pastrami lover, you know who you are, try Johnnies for yourself.  I think you will like it.
