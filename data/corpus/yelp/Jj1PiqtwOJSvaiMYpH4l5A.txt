I don't get the hype.. . Came here late one night when not much else would be open, so I was thankful for that.  . I didn't care about waiting in line.  It moved quickly enough.. The sandwich was totally...fine.  Just fine.  The hot mustard was good.. . Before I came here, I had almost gone out on a first date with a guy who suggested this place.  I'm not a dating snob, but honestly, first date to a place where sawdust covers the floor and sandwiches are meh?  You can do better.
