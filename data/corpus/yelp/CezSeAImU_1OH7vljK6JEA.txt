Raspberry Chocolate Fudge Brownie.  Do I have your attention? . The coffee is great too!  I've eaten in, people-watched, talked art with the server, even gotton my coffee-phobic BF in for breakfast. . Pick up to-go too!  Grab a sandwich before seeing a play! Sit on the bench outside, feed some croissant or scone to your dog and enjoy! . P.S. I have GOT to support any place where they ask kids to behave. The sign is polite and truly non-offensive. If your kids are well-behaved, it doesn't apply, right?  So get over yourselves if you hate it, go somewhere else where you aren't offending ME with your tedious whining complaints. Take the brats to McDonalds!
