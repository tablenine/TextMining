Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So forever I wanted to come here, finally did and was not blown away. Sad to say I was really looking forward to loving this place. . . As usual it was crowded, waited for 1hr. Finally had the chili dog, and suffice to say it was not the best. I ate it but was sad deep down inside because I was expecting Delicious flavors. . I do have to say that TJ hot dogs or LA vendors are better!! Good place to come at least once in your life!
