Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Tasty banchan/panchans. They keep 'em coming too. You needn't know the names.  Just point at it with your chopsticks and go "Mmm! Hmmmm mmmm?" while chewing and nodding vigorously and they'll get the point.. . 3 people, 3 meat dishes: pork, chicken and beef galbi. It was way too much for even 3 carnivorous piggie-outers.  The marinated beef &amp; pork BBQ was insanely delicious. The chicken was a little forgettable so next time we'll stick to our other animal friends.  They also keep switching out your grill so it doesn't get too blackened from all your food but...that means that some poor bloke is back there in the kitchen scrubbing these f***ers down all the live long day. Bless that little man!. . Can I have more of this...what is this?  Dried eel banchan thing?  These little pancake-y bastards are good too. More of this shredded radish in a light vinegary broth too.  Mmm mhmmm hmm?  More rice wrapper. More of everything.. . Bottom line: I was so full, I had to be pulled out of our booth.  I declared loudly for the other diners GOOD GOD I ATE TOO MUCH.  I said KAMSANIDAHHHH as we walked out and then probably burped epic-ly in the parking lot.. . ((Also, Yelpers. Can we please stop saying that K-town is "ghetto-y"? I don't come to your neighborhood and call it "sanitized of anything interesting whatsoever".))
