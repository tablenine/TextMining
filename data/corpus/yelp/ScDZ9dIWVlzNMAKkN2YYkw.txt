Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
First off, despite the hype, hassles with parking, and the need to call one month in advance for a reservations ("you are currently #7 in the queue..."), the food at La Mozza is great.. . The service here is top notch - I really appreciate going into a US restaurant where they've trained the staff to behave (ahem) consistently,  At La Mozza, they have it down perfectly.  The sommelier, for example, was perfect.  We splurged on a $75 bottle of a Tuscan wine (Sangiovese, Syrah, some native grapes) that comes from a vineyard Batali co-owns.  Just right.. . I would order any and all of the mozzarella dishes.  The one I got with fresh peas and mint was unlike anything I ordered before and worthy of 7 or 8 stars.  . . Duck for my entree: simple, juicy, skin roasted just right.  . . The place is pricey and loud.  But after eating at Angelini the previous night, my verdict is: c'mon.  That place isn't anywhere near the same league for food, service, ambience.  La Mozza is a memorable meal and I'd recommend it with no qualifications.
