Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
This is an ATL institution.  It's been here forever and it is always a good time.  Trader Vics is like a time warp, but in the best way.  The drink menu is amazing.  For the record, locals skip the food and go straight to the bar, where all the fun is.  Bring your crew, set up for a few sugar fueled cocktails and then beep down the street for a wild night.  Also, plan on being hung over the next day.
