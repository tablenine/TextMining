Ok, so on the inside, you'll definitely have a "clutch the pearls" moment- however,the wait staff, the GOOD burgers, and well priced libations will definitely change your mind.. . I tried the Black and Blue Burger, with the tots, and I was ready to personally kiss the self! Â . . This place is now high on my list on the place to go for burgers!
