Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
My first experience at Manuel's turned me off. I ordered a tuna sandwich for lunch, and all I remember is a layer of banana peppers and two pieces of wet, mushy bread that grew soggy from the b.p. juice and maybe mayo. . . I came back again last night for the first time in 5 years. Before the MothUP storytelling event started behind wooden, swinging doors, my friend and I ordered some beers at the bar. I enjoyed the chill atmosphere and chatting with my bud in addition to the heavy metal musician on the other side of me, but I eventually gave up on paying for my brew before the MothUP. I stared at the bartender for a good 15 minutes while he patted his hand on a towel, staying away from my end of the sparsely populated bar. . . After the MothUP, it still took me a long time to get the guy's attention, so I could pay for my libation. I don't think it should be that difficult to pay on a slow Tuesday night.
