This place gets busy!. The long selection of pastries kept me undecided but since it was my first time there, I got a spinach and feta cheese croissant, a chocolate croissant and a cup of milk. My friend got inca cola, 2 potato balls and 2 meat pies and our total was only $13,55! Really cheap in my opinion.. My croissants were delicious; the ham and cheese was served with fried bananas and had mayo, lettuce and tomatoes; the other wasn't completely filled with chocolate but it had both sides dipped in sweet cocoa.. I tried the potato pies (filled with meat) and didn't like it. But the meat pie was delicious.. Parking lot is big but since the place is busy, look for parking on the street.
