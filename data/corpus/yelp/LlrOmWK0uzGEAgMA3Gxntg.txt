Excellent. Came here with my cousin on her recommendation. Came here for a "lunner". . Had the chicken omelette, the chicken has a LOT of flavor. Â The grain toast was good, the grit was plain. Also had some of my cousin's french toast with pecans and whipped cream. Yeah, that was freaking good.. . Oh and if you're bored, the scientology HQ is right down the street.
