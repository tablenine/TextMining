These guys suffer from most places featured in Check Please.  They get a huge surge of new diners due to hype and exposure but do not have the capacity or servers to accommodate this.  . . We arrived and the host, while nice, underestimated our wait time which was a little irritating. As soon as we sat down we ordered right away. Our food literally flew out to us in no time and I have to say it was very good.. . We had a sampling of everything since this was our first time.  We started off with Duck &amp; Pho spices dumplings which were tender and full of flavor.  Then we had the short ribs &amp; rice, Soba: Bay Scallops, Oyster Mushrooms &amp; Thai spices and a side of Spicy Kimchi.  All delicious with careful attention to separation of spices and ingredients so they all pop out.  I was impressed.  I love the Kimchi.. . Another interesting aspect of this place is that it is communal style eating.  We had a good conversation with another couple which made the experience even better.. . Pros: Good food, friendly service and BYOB.. . Cons: Long wait and severely overwhelmed. They should consider a larger space or another location.
