Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
Originally, I wanted to give this place 5 stars for being my favorite restaurant in Chicago, then given its been a year or so, I realized ... perhaps I was wrong and there's really nothing super special about this place other than, as one reviewer said, oversized entrees. . . Overall, Joy Yee has an extensive menu. By extensive I mean they more or less cover the whole Pan-Asia Pacific region, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam ... you name it. They have food from every which corner that can be called Asia. You will not find a more varied menu than here at Joy Yee. . . They also have a separate drinks area outside that you can order for to-go where they serve huge drinks full of boba, pearls, jelly and all kinds of goodies in many different types of drinks. Their drinks are pretty good but, as I'm sure, full of delicious multi-grams of sugar as well.. . The food here is good and in abundance. You can't order something without having it left over for dinner, and then maybe breakfast the next day. Everything comes in a larger than your head bowl and a longer than your forearm size. It's impossible to find any different even when you order an appetizer. The flavor is good, and the service is extremely prompt. The inside is a little run down and they definitely could use some better tables and chairs ... but what's that to a Chinese restaurant anyway.. . Would I come back? Probably not, but it was a great experience. If I lived in Chicago, I would probably think about it again.
