Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
I like to go to this place for lunch if I want to sit outside. Pretty tasty for bar food, and moderately priced. However I wouldn't visit on the weekend nights; the crowd is full of a-holes who only know how to get drunk and start trouble. Pretty much what one would expect from a sports bar weekend crowd. . . A+ for the staff. Everyone there is very nice and the service is excellent. With out the staff, The Boundary would just be another joint on Division.
