This was a good find indeed.  Went on a Thursday afternoon 1:30p'ish, and got seated almost right away.  Had their featured ramen (tonkotsu) and thought it was good... a delicate balance of flavors.  Having been to Japan quite a few times and had true authentic ramen there, I had something to compare it with.  The broth was milky white, as expected, but it was actually thinner than I expected.  Because of that, it didn't feel as heavy, nor salty.  Perhaps I should go for the xtra flavor option next time.  But it was rich enough by the time I finished.  The egg was done just about right, and the pork melted in your mouth and was very flavorful....  not for the faint of heart because they're quite fatty but that's why they melt.  Had the combo shredded (i think) pork in rice, and that was stellar!  It had just the right amount of green onions and fixin's on top to not overpower it.  The gyozas were above average, delicate skin and flavoring.  Liked their bottomless refillable green ice tea.  . . In short, this is where I'll go from now on for ramen in LA.  Beware that most street parking there is 1hr limit.  Bring lots of quarters.
