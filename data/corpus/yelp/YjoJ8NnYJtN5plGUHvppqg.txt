If you have 2 1/2 hours on your lunch break and don't mind waiting an excruciatingly long time for a sandwich...this is your place! . . With lines longer than the DMV and the irritating din of screaming children and too many people packed in one space, I don't even remember what my sandwich tasted like because I was too busy figuring out an excuse to my boss why I was an hour late back to work when just running down the street for something to eat. . . Like Yogi Berra said 'Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded.'
