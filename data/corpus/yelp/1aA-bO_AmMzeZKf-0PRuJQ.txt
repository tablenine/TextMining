Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
Very tight dining space.. Good service.. Byob is a plus- they even offer to put your alcohol in the cooler.. Not good for big groups.. No alcoholic beverages allowed in outside dining.. Overall good food. A little on the expensive side for tapas.. No paella but small menu made it easy to order.. Not a good place for clausterphobic people.. Watch out for loud neighbors.
