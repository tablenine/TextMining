Restaurant: Fraiche

I had three great courses recently at Fraiche. I seldom get that at any restaurant. I get a good app and main and then bad dessert or some other variation thereof. App, Main and dessert were all excellent. Bread was too. Service was on the ball, efficient but unobtrusive. Mushroom salad was lightly dressed (finally a salad not dripping with dressing) delicious warm mushrooms very tasty. Special of Halibut with Succotash and brown butter, light sauce, well orchestrated. Roasted peaches with rosemary IC for dessert hmmm! A delight and fairly priced for a restaurant of that caliber I thought. Great room with outdoor dining.
