Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
What a disappointment.  . . I've been wanting to visit Tito's for quite some time now.  One late evening last month, this wish almost came to fruition, but the line was long and we were cranky, so we drove on.  Apparently, we should have kept on driving.. . The tacos are cheap.  They're fairly big and therefore satisfying.  However, they were like "meh..."  :(  We tried a tamale, and it was like "eh..."  I ordered a side of guacamole, and it was watery and soupy and more like "eek...". . We looked at each other and our thoughts were clear from the expression on our faces: "What the hell?". . To repeat, what a disappointment.
