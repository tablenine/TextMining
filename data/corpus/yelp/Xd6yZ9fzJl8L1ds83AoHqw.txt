Restaurant: Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries
Category: Burgers
I went here last week and enjoyed my same hamburger i always get. but this time added a hot dog- it had BACON on it!! yayyyyyy!!! the fastest way to my heart is BACON!!! yayyyy! . . it was grilled, so it was crunchy on the outside. it was split down the middle and had cheese and 2 slices of crunchy, satisfying bacon stuffed on the sides. this is what the meals must be like in Heaven. . . the only thing i don't like about this spot is the fries. I always go to the 5 guys in peach tree city and their small order of fries are freaking huge!!! Caroline st- not so much. 2 ppl could NOT share this order. and the fries were dry and soft, greasy and mushy. while the ones in ptc are salted to the right perfection and crunchy on the outside. . . So i had to take away a star! sorry charlie.
