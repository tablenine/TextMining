3.5 Stars. . I used to come here all the time for brunch, forgot about it, and then came back for the first time in ages last night (I love that they're open @ night now) and realized just how stinking good this place is.. . Here are the highlights:. . + The best GARDEN SALAD EVER.  And no, it ain't just veggies.  They throw in avocado slices, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, pine nuts, WARM garden burger and a delicious balsamic dressing....seriously, one of my fave salads in LA..... + Love their pressed/grilled sandwiches - particularly the grilled cheese and the tuna melt. + One of the few places w/ a solid fruit salad which includes mangos, papaya, blueberry, melon, strawberries, etc.... +Great soups - must try the Chicken Tortilla.... + Their breakfast sandwich (Eggwich) is divine...... . The one and only thing I've had here that I didn't like was their turkey burger...the patty was hard and dry.  Other than that, this place is defreakinglicious.  . . Keep in mind that it gets wayyyy crowded (esp on the wknds) with sceney hipsters and their yappy dogs....which can result in a really long annoying wait.  Plus, the bathroom smells really nasty, sorta like a dog kennel (could've just been last night - but in any case, nasty).
