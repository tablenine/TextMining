My neighborhood secret. They are a really nice family restaurant that is slowly becoming very popular.  Make sure they bring you some cactus salsa - it's free and amazing.  . . Their menu is really bad for vegetarians, such as myself.  However, they will make you any thing that you ask for!  I usually ask them to put all of the veggies they have in the house into a big burrito, and put some avocado on the side.. . Finally, their margaritas are really strong.   Many a night I have gotten a little too drunk because I ordered a large margarita or three.
