Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
If you like cheap Mexican food that is pretty good for its price then Tito's is your kind of spot. Everything is cheap and comes in cardboard boxes. Its always fairly busy, when you get in line just keep in mind that it moves pretty fast so have your order ready when you get to the window out of respect for the other customers. The menu includes: Burritos, tacos, tamales, tostadas. My favorite is the plain old tacos smoothered with tito's tomato salsa (tastes like tomato puree with salt and pepper in it).. . I have never been disappointed with tito's and when family flies in from out of town, they often request we get tito's for lunch or dinner.
