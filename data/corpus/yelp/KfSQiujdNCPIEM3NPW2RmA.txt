Really good. Stood in line for 2 hours in the Valley and totally worth it. This was my second time going there and following them from my Twitter.. . First time I was at Abbot Kinney in the daytime and was the 3rd person in line. Kimchee quesadillas? Totally crazy, but works, moist and warm and spicy and i LOVE their short rib tacos. If anything, be ready to wait. Last night I lined up at 11 and didn't leave until about 1:30 a.m. and honestly it's part of the experience. It's also fun if you're outgoing. You can talk to other foodies. (Hell I got to know a cute boy for the 2 hours I was in line and got his digits, whaddup?!). . Don't be a douche and order for other people because if you think about it, you're the one that did all the work and then have people like me and wait they run out.
