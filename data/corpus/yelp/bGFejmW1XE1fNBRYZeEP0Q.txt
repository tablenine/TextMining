Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Bottega Louie is one of my favorite hangouts in Downtown Los Angeles.  I took my friend there for her birthday and we had a great time.  I had a dirty martini which was really strong.. almost too strong to drink. We had the shrimp pizza, which sounds disgusting, but it was delicious.  The pizzas are huge, which are large enough for 3 people.  The best part was dessert.  We had a caramel pudding, which was magnificent.  I think it was their special that day so I'm not sure if they serve it daily.  The one thing that I did not like about the restaurant is it gets really loud, but other than that it was perfect.  It is also in a great building and love the high ceilings.
