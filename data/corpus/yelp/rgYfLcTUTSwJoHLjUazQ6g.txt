the potato balls are to die for. tapatio on it makes it even better! the balls are fried, you bite into it and its creamy mashed potatoes and inside is beef. my profile picture depicts the deliciousness. . cheese rolls are yum! love crispy flaky pastry with cream cheese filling.. lines are long but worth the wait. been here 2 times and has been delicious each time!
