Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I love Philippe's, and even if you don't love it like I do, it is still worth a try.  Its just one of those LA places you owe it to yourself to check out at least once, for the food as well as the historical value.. . Other reviewers have already talked about the sandwiches, which I like, but it is really the spicy mustard that keeps me coming back.  Rarely do I leave without purchasing another bottle to take home with me.  Word to the newbies though, use with caution!  Their apple pie is also scrumptious.  Yet another item I always get to go since I stuff myself with my sandwich, sides, and lots of lemonade every time.  . . TIP: This place is always crowded, and sometimes it is crazy packed.  Don't be afraid of the lines for food, it is always quicker than it looks no matter how long the line is.  But I still always suggest doing the 50/50 for this place:  half of your party stays in line to order and carry food/ drinks, while the other half searches for a table.  Food lines move fairly quickly but it is still hard to find a table at times, especially carrying all that food through the crowds.  There are tables upstairs as well, so happy table hunting!
