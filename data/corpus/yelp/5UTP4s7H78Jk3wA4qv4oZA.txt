In a word: excellent. I really enjoyed this place from top to bottom. I like its location, I really like the decor, and I loved the food! Why only 4 stars? Well, it's a bit pricey and that's always been something I weigh heavily when rating places. It just got a bit too pricey. I loved everything I had, but unfortunately it's not somewhere I could afford to visit regularly. With that said, onward with the review!. . I like Steve Dahl, so clearly I ordered "The Steve Dahl" which is a mouthwatering Pastrami on Rye, piled high. MMM mmm Mm! So now I can say that Steve Dahl has never steered me wrong when it comes to food. Heh. My date had the portobello something or other... who cares. Dumb women and their vegetarianism. Why would anyone waste their time ordering a veggie-anything when you're in a delicatessen and large piles of sliced meat are waiting for your consumption? /sigh. . We also enjoyed a few beverages from their "in-house soda jerk" To my dismay their jerk was not, in fact, Steve Martin. Alas, the concoctions were still very, very tasty. We had a Boston Cooler and a Brooklyn Egg Cream. Wow, on both counts. I'm too young, but were I an 80 year old man, at that moment, I would have stop mid-meal to run outside and play stickball. That, or anything else youngsters use to do back in the day when wonderful places such as this were commonplace.. . This is a definite must try. This place puts the deli in delicious! As for me? To quote MacArthur, "I shall return!"
