I've only been here twice -and both times were just for late night drinks.  The first time was back in December -and I wasn't too impressed with the drink I ordered.  I just recently decided to give this place another try (in a spur of a moment -just because we were walking further North from Wriggleyfield and realized that there won't be too many bars left for the next couple of blocks or so).  I ordered the Treetini, and my date ordered the Lemon Ginger.  Both were good!  And with every order of Treetini, they promise they'll plant a tree somewhere (hmm .. i think I'd like to see the tree that I 'plant'!!)  The Lemon Ginger martini was good -and we decided we're going to come back for the ginger martini when we have a sore throat.  On top of that, I like their ambiance and interior design -in particular their lamps (yes, I'm a sucker for lamps!!).
