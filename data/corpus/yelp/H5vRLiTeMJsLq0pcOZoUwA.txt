I knew Wicker Park was going to shit when I was having a beer and eating a portabello slice when I heard four muscular backward-hat-wearing, unironed-striped-shirt wearing men of unusually large pectoral muscles ask the punker behind the counter "hey man, what's a good bar to go to around here". I asked myself "what the hell are they doing out of lincoln park"... and then they came in droves.. . Vegetarian: It's pizza come on!
