Hao tze!  I find the Din Tai Fung in Taipei to be tastier and a better overall experience, but this is the next best thing to flying to Taipei, although the wait here can rival that of a 13 hour flight.  . . While you wait go hang out in life plaza and buy something you don't need, like a hello-kitty air freshner.
