Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
Bird's features pleasant ambiance, indoor/outdoor seating, a full bar, loads of chicken, and... Frickles!  Frickles!  Frickles!  . They're so delicious, plus, I love the word.  It's right up there with the word smock.. . I was introduced to fried pickles at Bird's.  I had heard of them before, but had never tried them.  I think I'm in love.  I might need to make a monthly pilgrimage to eat these pickly treats.  Not that it's really needed, but they also come with sour cream and ranch dressing as dipping sauces. . . I ordered a chicken pot pie for dinner, which was also good.  I wished the sauce part of the pie had been thicker and creamier.  Instead, it was sort of like chicken soup in a pie.  It was a great dinner, nonetheless.  My friend ordered a steak salad, which she gets frequently when she eats at Bird's.  They also seemed to have a unique selection of beer.  Another friend ordered a bottle of Holy Grail Ale, something you don't find just anywhere.  I know I'll go back to eat more chicken and to visit my friend, who lives just across the street.  . . Frickles.
