What are you people smoking? Oh wait, I've just through the reviews and a large majority of people reviewing this place consider cup-o-noodles "ramen." 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!. . =/. . I first came here 7 years ago when I was a ramen rookie...Thought it was incredible...13 trips to Japan and 7 years later my taste buds have seen the light...While it's not fair to compare this place to legendary spots I've had the pleasure of eating at in Japan...I think it's time to be honest about Daikokuya...It's REALLY average at BEST.... . And oh boy, has this place gone down hill.... . I haven't been for over a year, but I used to work in the area and the soup just kept getting more and more bland...Quality is obviously suffering due to the massive influx of USC kids and non-LA natives drinking the Kool-Aid...It's nearly impossible not to laugh at all the sheep outside when I drive by on my way to Izayoi.... . While Santouka isn't exactly a stones throw from Little Tokyo, it's easily the best Ramen in Los Angeles...So if you actually want GOOD ramen...Go there...Otherwise, feel free to keep feeding the Daikokuya hype machine and enjoy your california roll/ramen combo...
