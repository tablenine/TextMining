Restaurant: Tamarind Seed
Category: Thai
They should change the name to Little Bitty Rice Bowl.  This is some of the best thai in Atlanta, but they've been serving entrees with those little bitty rice bowls since they were located at 14th and Spring.  My waiter's name was Bell; he is great and he has been working there for years.  I told him, "there is something wrong with Asian restaurants that skimp on rice.  Its like going to a soul food restaurant and getting an orange-juice sized glass of sweet tea.  The food taste great.....but I'm gonna need more rice Bell.". . Everything else about Tamarind is damn near perfect.  Great location, the décor is in line with the food themes, service is consistently good, and the food is the perfect mix of spicy &amp; sweet while maintaining full flavor.  You are guaranteed to enjoy yourself.  If Bell is your waiter, just let him know... I'm gonna need more rice Bell. . . 4.5 Stars 'cause.....i gotta have more rice Bell!
