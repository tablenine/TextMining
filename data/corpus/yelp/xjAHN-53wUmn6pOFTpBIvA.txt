Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
Versailles is comfort homey Cuban food. It lacks the refinement of Cafe Habana in NY, but none of the flavor. I had the Lechon Asado. Cuban Style Roast Pork, which is pulled pork in a tangy marinade. I loved the rice and beans. Probably the best Cuban rice and beans I've ever had. The fried plantains were absolutely delicious.. . The serving is a huge platter of food. Come here hungry and ready to eat because they're ready to feed you.
