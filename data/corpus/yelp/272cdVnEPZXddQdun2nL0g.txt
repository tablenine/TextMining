OMG this place is ridiculous! Thank goodness I don't live close to one... I'll be a hefer for sure! The best fried chicken I've ever had!!! You gotta consider that I've only really had KFC and Popeyes so this is the most authentic southern chicken I've ever had... And who said collard greens were nasty?! The collard greens were sooooo good. The waffles were great, cornbread was awesome, candied yams were yummers... I love this place! . . *DRRRRROOOOOOLLLLLLLL*. . Mac and cheese could've been better though.
