We had a great experience at Mana Food Bar.  The place is tiny and the hostess was extremely gracious and helpful.  She suggested and described a few bars in the area for us to hang out and wait for her to call us when our table was ready.  . . We ordered two sake cocktails and they were tasty.  To eat, we shared beets, bulgogi, rice noodles, asparagus, and maki.  Everything was delicious, except the shiitakes in the bulgogi were too salty...they made my eyes water.. . Even though the place was tiny, we felt like we had enough privacy and never felt rushed.  I'm looking forward to going back.
