Beer: terrific. . Burger: pretty good, though not as sensuously tasty as I remember from the SM/Montana location. . Crowd: OK, not as douche-y as I feared.. . Seat yourself policy: Hell no.  This works in places like Germany (beer halls, etc)  where there's a sense of socialism and common good.  But in LA, no way.  This is the land of individual entitlement, remember?  People here don't even THINK about carpooling, so what makes you think they want to share tables with strangers, or even hit those strangers up to see if they'll be finishing soon?  And what sort of attitude to you think you get when you ask said patrons whether their table will be free soon?  If looks could kil.... . I dig the space and setting, but that seating policy is just a**.
