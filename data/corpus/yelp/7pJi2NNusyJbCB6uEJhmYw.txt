I miss the laidback charm of it's original tiny location on Grand, but nevertheless the food remains excellent, unless you have a problem with southern soul food. Brunch is by far my favorite time to eat here, with their crab cake benedict and corn muffins. Beware, both locations are hella busy and you may wait up to 2 hours depending on what time you go.
