Geddafuckouddahere!      . . This isn't no 5 star churrascaria (Brazilian BBQ)!!!     "Beverly Hills, Century City - everything here is so nice and pretty."     I set the bar high on Fogo De Chao, but left disappointed. . . 5 star-like prices, 4 star service and ambiance, but 2 star quality food.    Don't get me wrong though, I love me some hearty Brazilian BBQ anyplace, anytime!    I have traveled to Brazil 3 times, and have eaten at many places there.   I know: churrascaria.   . . I even tested our waiter on his Portuguese to see if this place had really hired conversational Portuguese servers:   .    Me:  Boa Noite, senor Gabriel!   Muito Prazer.   Como Vai?!   .   He responded correctly.  Impressive.   Ok, props.   But he had to come up and assume:  'hey, you train in Brazilian Ju-Jitsu, huh?'    lol!  . . 5 star prices for a buffet.  Expect You and a date, with drinks, to exceed well over the into $130 mark.     Sadly, the food, I felt, was only about 3 stars in quality.    Some of the beef was excellent, but most were over cooked and tasted like rawhide.    After your first round of meat, the servers assume that you are full and suddenly 'get ghost.'   Then you have to twist your neck looking around for that select piece of meat you want.   . . Salad bar was uninspired.  Vegetables were not the freshest.   Maybe i caught them on a bad day.  . . I wanted to believe that this particular Fogo De Chao on La Cienga was just as good as the one I've eaten at in Sao Paulo, (even if it was twice as expensive, than Brazil) but unfortunately it was a major letdown.
