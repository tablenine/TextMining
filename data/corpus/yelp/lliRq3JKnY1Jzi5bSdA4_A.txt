For 'fast food'ish fare, Spitz is really aces.. . -The chicken doner's meat melts in your mouth. -My daughter salivates over the sweet potato fries. -Great chili sauce for above sandwich (i recommend the wrap instead of ciabatta bread version). -a tasty selection of gelato . . great prices, fun and hip boys behind the counter.. . Did i mention the yummy sweet potato fries?
