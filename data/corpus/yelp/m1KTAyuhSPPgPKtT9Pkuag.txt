Restaurant: The Porter Beer Bar
Category: American (New)
A beer connoisseur, I am not, but I do know what I like &amp; dislike, &amp; I'm definitely down with The Porter! I've tried &amp; finished both the Franziskaner Dunkelweizen beer &amp; the Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier... enjoyed both very much. Ironically, I've gone with a large party &amp; the service was spectacular... I mean, they even cleaned our cake tray dish for cryin' out loud! On the flip side, I've gone with a small, intimate group of 4 &amp; our server couldn't have cared less about us. When you have to ask for a glass of water 30 minutes after being seated, there's a problem. In their defense, this place gets PACKED, I mean SLAMMED, on the weekends. Given the narrow hallway in the entrance, getting to the restaurant side of things can be a feat in itself. Personally, I'm a big fan of the food here for the most part. I didn't love the calamari, but that's because most of it was fried lemon peel or fried jalapeno as opposed to fried squid. That said, you can't go wrong with the arugula salad, the garlic french fries, or with any of their sandwiches/burgers... yum-o! The Porter is definitely worth a look see if you're strolling through the L5P area... or if you're simply lookin' for a good place to chillax, eat &amp; grab a brew with the buds!
