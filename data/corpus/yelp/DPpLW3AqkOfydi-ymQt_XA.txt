Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I love this place. It is larger than life and twice as stinky! (in a good way!). . . I recommend arriving very early, that way you can enjoy the expansive and relaxing bar before seating for dinner. . . Is anything on the menu disappointing? Not that I am aware of... But I can definitely recommend the lamb.
