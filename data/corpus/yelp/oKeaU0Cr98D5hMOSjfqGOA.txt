Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Many call Mastro's the finest steak in LA. While I hesitate to say best, it is certainly one of the best. I've been three time and tried a different cut each time. The bone in filet is to me the best cut I've had here. It is tender, juicy and every bit the delight one would expect. The real surprise to me was the Gnocchi. It was creamy, tender, as good as the steak and paired so perfectly with the steak. The seafood, while not quite as good as the steak, is still very good. The one bad item is the 1lb baked potato. It's just obscenely large and just takes away from the meal.. . I have only made it to dessert only once and even then I was pretty full. I had chocolate cake. I wish I could remember how soft it was, but all I can remember was it was rich and chocolately.. . The cocktails are pretty mediocre. They can do the classics adequately but nothing of note.. . If you are looking for the best steak in LA you cannot help but highly consider Mastro's.
