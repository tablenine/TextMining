I love MF Sushi Buckhead, it the home of the Sushi power-lunch and is actually quite a bargain.  I have never been for dinner, nor will I as Taka my favorite for dinner (MF is a little to shi-shi for my tastes for dinner).  . . Great product, great price and nice environment for lunch.  You will need a Bentley or better for the Valet to leave your car up front though!
