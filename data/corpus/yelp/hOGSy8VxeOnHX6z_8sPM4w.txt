Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
So...it's is a bit overrated. It's not the greatest meal on Earth, or even close to making the runnings, but the chicken and waffles are pretty damn good.  . . It is an institution, so you'd be playing yourself if you didn't make it out to Roscoe's at least once or twice in your life, but it's no place I frequent on a regular basis.  It's a very carve your name in the tree bark with "I Was Here" written underneath it type of establishment.  . . As for this particular location, the dining room is small and it gets super packed, so the wait may be long depending on the time of day.  If you're particularly conscious about the restaurant grading system; the last time I was here it was rated B.  I only saw the grade after we were leaving, as it was inconspicuously located.  . . I just felt like that was worth mentioning for some dramatic effect.  I would've sat down to eat regardless.
