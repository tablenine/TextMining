An L.A. landmark and a fun place to visit just to say you've gone.  I don't think much of the food in general, but I'm not a real deli kind of girl.  I can't stomach all that meat.  But they have very very good potato pancakes, and yummy egg salad, and they're open late.  The bakery is so incredibly cute, and everything looks and is so delicious, but for some reason it all has generally the same flavor, like it's made with the same base dough.  A pretty good L.A. black and white cookie if you're craving one, but once again, it all kind of tastes similar.  Try it at least once.
