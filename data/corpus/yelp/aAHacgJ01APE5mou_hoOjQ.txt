Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Overpriced, boring thai food. I felt rushed to finish my meal and then recieved my bill with all kinds of hidden prices. They practically took the plate from under my nose in an effort to shovel in more people to the already crowded mediocre restaurant. My spicy fried rice was alright but a little undercooked. The rest of my party enjoyed their meal alright but the shrimp in both me and my friends pad thai was bad. i mean, bad. it tasted fishy as hell and was NOT very fresh. In fact, it made me so nervous that I wouldnt even eat the rest of them for fear of food poisoning. The waitress stood over us like a vulture after dropping off the outrageous bill. overlal i think it was some of the worst thai food and service i have ever received. GO TO STAR OF SIAM!
