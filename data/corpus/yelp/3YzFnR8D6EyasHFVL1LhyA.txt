Very impressed with our tasting menu, especially the lobster tagliatelle, trout and short rib. The foie gras ($12 extra) wasn't the best quality I've ever had but generally things were enjoyable. The sommelier was helpful in picking wines out and service was attentive. The d√©cor is similar to craft in new York with cool dim light bulbs and subtle curves. They also validate parking which is nice.
