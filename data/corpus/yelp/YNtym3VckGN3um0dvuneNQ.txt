Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
So, I've been wanting to go here ever since I heard about it and here's my take on it -- meh.. . The breadsticks that everyone is raving about must not be there any longer, because they were just long, cold, crunchy pieces of bread -- bland and boring.. . The pizza was really meh.  It was way too airy until the last of the 4 slices I had, when the crust finally had some heft.  I had the margherita pizza and couldn't really taste anything, other than a somewhat tomato-esque flavor.. . However, the dessert was fantastic.  I had vanilla gelati with chocolate sorbetti.  Mixing the two together made for a great balance of taste and texture.  The only downside was the use of the "house fennel" in the waffle piece, which led to some interesting faces being made by yours truly.  It wasn't "bad," per se, but I would have loved to have had it be simply sweet rather than savory.. . In general terms, the restaurant is very L.A. -- small and loud, with pretty okay service from the wait staff.  The parking is a retarded $8.50 + tip.  I'd recommend going once to see what it's about, but it's a solid B- in my book overall.
