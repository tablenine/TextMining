Is anyone going to read this? Prolly not. I shouldn't have used up my extended analogy with The Rose Bowl on Kogi, which is quite clearly the review slut of Yelp, everyone can and does review this place...but I had to! No food truck 'belt' is complete without the Kogi 'notch'!. . Kogi is "The Grandaddy of 'em all" when it comes to food trucks in Los Angeles. And, like "The Rose Bowl" (which is where I'm taking that phrase from - Don't worry, Rose Bowl trademark people, I didn't use the full "them" so technically I'm not infringing on copyright. Technically.) there are a few things you should expect from ol' grandaddy:. . 1) It's a big production and it takes a while. Why? Because it's so famous. Lines will be longer than other trucks, and prices might seem unfair, at first. But just give it a second, and wait for delivery on expectation number. . 2) It will deliver the goods. Just like The Rose Bowl, it's an experience for any Angeleno/tourist that you need to check off your bucket list. The Korean BBQ is delicious, the best options are the pork tacos, the sliders, and the kimchi quesadilla. This food is tasty but you should keep in mind expectation . . 3) It's only what it claims to be. Korean BBQ isn't the elixir of life, and The Rose Bowl won't completely change the course of your life after you attend. It's a fun event and worth getting at least once (or if you're like me, you might 'Mario Andretti' it for a second time and pull an illegal u-turn on Cahuenga).. . All this being said, if that line looks longer than a half hour - drive to The Alibi Room (Kogi with roots) and eat the same fare at an actual table.
