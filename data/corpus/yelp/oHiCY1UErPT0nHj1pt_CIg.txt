Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
i used to LOVE tito's. It hasnt changed it all but i've just realized how bland it is. Simple tacos with very watery salsa and guacamole and runny refried beans. At least they are cheap. Ordering can be kinda hectic and cramped and it's kinda lame how they only take cash but i'll take it!
