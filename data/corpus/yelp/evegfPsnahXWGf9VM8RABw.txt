Came here last night for a friends surprise birthday/engagement party. I love garlic, but the food here is just plain and blah. Nothing special. You could probably make most of the dishes on their menu at home by just adding a ton of garlic. The only thing noteworthy is their garlic ice cream, and maybe their bread with the garlic/oil spread.
