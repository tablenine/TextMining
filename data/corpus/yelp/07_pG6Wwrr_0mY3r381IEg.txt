PORTO'S Bakery really is as GOOD as it Gets~. . I may be biased since I am Cuban, but all I know is that If nutrition was not an important issue in my life, I would eat at Porto's EVERYDAY. That is the one downfall of this place, it makes you fat!. . They have scrumptious papa rellenas (fried mashed potato balls stuffed with meat), ham croquettes, buttery lil meat pies, cuban coffee, cream cheese/guava pastires, cheese rolls that melt, i mean MELT in your mouth, cuban sandwiches and media noches you will only find done better in Miami. . . The other day i tried a non-cuban dish and that grilled sourdough chicken sandwich with roasted red peppers was off the hook.. . I gotta check out the rest of the menu, but it's so hard to say no to all the sure shots!
