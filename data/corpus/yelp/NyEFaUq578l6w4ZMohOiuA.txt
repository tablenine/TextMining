We hit up the patio on a Sunday(no wait). Service was a little scattered. Fantastic Chilaquilles. Also had the short rib benedict that was good(although a little heavy for summer). And my little one had the choco-banana-bacon pancakes which were also good. Nice breakfast cocktails. A little pricey but everything was tasty.
