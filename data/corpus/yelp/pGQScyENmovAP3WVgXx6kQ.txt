I have been to the Long Beach location twice, and I enjoyed that location more.  I never felt the fried chicken was anything great at Long Beach, but I do remember the waffle being exceptional.  The waffle here was really bland.  It may have just been a bad batch.. . In terms of the fried chicken, I've always felt that the waffle was very superior to the chicken.  I had the Carol C. Special (chicken breast).  Chicken breast is often dry and tough because it is so lean and easily overcooked.  I will say that the chicken here was very moist.  It was just bland.  Could have used a little more seasoning.  The honey they brought out (by request) helped.. . The service was good.  And the prices were not too bad (though I could see some saying it is expensive for something as simple as chicken and waffles).
