Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
The way rappers rap about Patrón and Hennessey is the same in which they would talk about Bossa Nova. Unlike Canters, yes very unlike Canters but like Canters only in the sense that is the one of few places in LA that has a massive menu of upper-middle scale food that is open through the wee hours of the morning. Claims to be 'pizza, pasta, and grill'  Bossa Nova is more a mix of Americanized Brazilian dishes such as chicken, thin steak, rice and plantains. At least, that is what you should order. The pasta and pizza are rather mediocre. The vibe however, is rather exciting. Conquistadors keep calling and brewing flirtations are never ending at Bossa Nova, especially the Hollywood location located directly across from two strip clubs and a motel. I have often see dates take their pro's here before a night of savagery. The idea of Savages and Bossa Nova go well together, however the service is always impeccable despite the food being like battleship (hit and miss).
