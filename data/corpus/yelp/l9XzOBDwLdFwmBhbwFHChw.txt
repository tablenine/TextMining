Adorable and quaint, this is a lovely place for a nice evening out.  Though the restaurant is a little hard to find the entrance to (we walked completely around the building and finally found a staircase going up. My friend noted, "well, on Yelp, it doesn't say you would get murdered by serial killers before you get into the restaurant." Once we got to the top, we were able to feast on some yummy yummy mediterranean food.  . . Our waiter was a little funky and we had a hard time getting ahold of him the entire night. It was as though he noticed when we would need him and he would conveniently step out of our view at just the right time.. . The food more than made up for it though. We of course dished on the free bread, then ordered more carbs in the form of some pita bread and hummus. We also dined on some bruschetta. . . I can't really remember what we ate for the main course but I can assure you that both dishes were superb and cooked to perfection.. . And the dessert of bread pudding (how is that greek or mediterranean?) absolutely topped the night. YummOs!
