Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So many kinds of hot dogs -- chili, cheese, sour cream, onions, guacamole, bacon.  If you're in Hollywood for any reason and find yourself there late at night, stop by and a good dog will hit the spot SO GOOD.  The line can be long sometimes but there's a reason for that.  It's worth the wait.  Only downside is cash only.  Otherwise it would get five stars easy.
