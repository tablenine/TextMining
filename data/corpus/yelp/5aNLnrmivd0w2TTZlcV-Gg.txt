Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Chicken and waffles are a winning combination.  The savoriness of the chicken and the sweetness of the syrup.  Mmmm.  Makes me want to try other dinner breakfast food combinations.. . After a day full of gluttony, my friends and I split a Herb's special.  The waffles were ok, not the best I've ever had.  They served their purpose...to basically serve as a vessel for the butter and syrup.  Granted, I could always just lather butter and syrup directly onto the chicken, but that's just too much.  The chicken was pretty good...crispy and flavorful skin.  Throw on some hot sauce.  The key to maximum enjoyment is taking a bite of chicken and then quickly following that up with a bite of waffle.  We made this a to go order and the chicken held up pretty well on the ride home.  I'd recommend getting food to go because this place was packed...at 3 pm on a Sunday.. . Overall, if I ever come back to LA, I'll be sure to make it back here.  Granted, there are options in Virginia that rival it.
