The food is good, but never Wow when I went.. Pricer than should be and the lines each time. I have been were killer.. Not bad to go if you dont realy know this food. and want to try some Taiwanese dumplings. in an easy to order... "im talking to you other gringos". . Ive had better in LA, but not bad.
