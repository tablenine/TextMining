I would actually give this place 3.5 stars but I would go back so I'm rounding it up to 4.  I tried all four of the tacos on the menu - the lamb tacos were a little too salty and vegetarian (poblano and cheese) was a waste of my time.. . However, the Pork Shoulder with pineapple and Pork Belly were both great.  You need to get 4-5 tacos because they are very small.  Also, it's very busy so you are better off ordering from the carryout window and eating your tacos elsewhere unless you plan on getting alcoholic drinks in the service area.. . Next time I go I will get 3 pork belly tacos and 1 pork shoulder taco.. . Another important note, the tacos are very messy... so make sure you have enough napkins :-)
