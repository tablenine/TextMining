Restaurant: Koronet Pizza
Category: Pizza
I hold two warring pizza philosophies.. . Philosophy #1:. Pizza is a canvas; crust (and, to a lesser extent, sauce) matter far less than what is put on the pizza.  Good pizza can and should be weird and entail non-traditional toppings.  Under this philosophy, I've eaten and enjoyed pizza with meatballs, pizza with ranch dressing in the sauce, pine nuts, pizza with chicken and bacon, etc etc.  . . Philosophy #2:. The true pizza is sauce, cheese, and crust--nothing else.  These things must be in balance for the slice to be any good.  Additional toppings cannot mask any fundamental imbalance and may in fact serve to worsen the experience.. . Koronet fails philosophy #1--I had a slice with sausage and found it to be quite terrible.  The sausage wasn't fresh or particularly tasty and it threw the whole cheese-grease-sauce matrix way out of whack.  However, I am reasonably pleased with Koronet's performance under philosophy #2.  The plain cheese slice needs a bit more tang in the sauce--barring that, they might be able to get away with a bit more cheese--but with some parmesan and a healthy dose of peppers, it's not an altogether bad way to spend $3.  It's not the best pizza in Manhattan, or probably even on the upper west side, but if you want pizza and you order a plain slice you won't be entirely dissatisfied.. . The slices are also huge but that's old news.
