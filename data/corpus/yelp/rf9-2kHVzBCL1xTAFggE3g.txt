Restaurant: Apres Diem
Category: French
Apres Diem seems out of place in this little strip mall off of Monroe.  Nestled between The Highlander and Midtown Art Cinemas this little Bistro.  I don't know whether to call it a Bistro though.  It's advertised as French Cuisine but other then the atmosphere there is no French on the menu.  . . The menu itself is small but tasty.  Everything I've had from the Baba Ghanouj to the Portobello Sandwich was fantastic.  It's nice to get a salad and fruit as sides rather then french fries.  The patio is great...  fenced in by potted plants the atmosphere is nice for a summer afternoon, or late night drinks with the lady friend.  Late night I've heard gets a bit loud inside, but I've yet to experience that.. . The walls inside covered with local art reminds me a lot of it's sister restaurant Carrol St. Cafe.  Apres Diem was a nice treat this evening when the weather was nice and I wanted a cold Peroni and a good meal.  I wouldn't say they do anything extraordinary, but instead do the ordinary quite well.
