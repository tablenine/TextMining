Went for brunch on a Sunday.  Parking was very easy and plentiful.  Had Dale from Top Chef 3 as our waiter (didn't know it was him until after)!  He was pretty attentive and was thoughtful enough to let us know our food might take a while due to a large party.  I had the crab cake benedict - WONDERFUL - came with a very large helping of hash browns. Everything was very tasty.  There were a lot of big groups there, but noise level was not bad.  Overall a great experience, I'd be a regular if I lived closer.
