Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Although I go to the Hungry Cat at least  once a month, this past visit was disappointing enough to say something. I'm either not hip enough or just don't have the right look, but it is consistently assumed at HC that I do not know good food or that it's my first time eating...well, anything. I will swoon over the pug burger, I will always order more than a fair share of oysters, but the uni was extremely disappointing.  I wish I had the guts to send food back, because I would have. Who knows if it was the uni or just the service that is overrated, but if you want consistently good uni with no assumptions made, go to Quality Seafood in Redondo Pier for half the price.
