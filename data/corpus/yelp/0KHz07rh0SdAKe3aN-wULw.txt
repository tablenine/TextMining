Everything about this place is absolutely amazing.  The service is great and the food is incredible.  We started with the crabmeat avocado, which is one of the best dishes I've ever tried.  I had the grouper for dinner and my friend had the crab cakes.  Everything was great and quite large, portion-wise.  We also had dessert, a chocolate mousse pie that could feed (I kid you not!) 10.  Easily.  We ended up taking most of that with us.  Also, I had to take home the carrot cake for my boss.  That is some of the best carrot cake I have ever had.
