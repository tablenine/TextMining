Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I eat at Stellas about twice a month, usually for breakfast, sometimes for dinner.  The food is consistently good.  My personal faves are the West Coaster skillet, Country eggs benedict (even though poached eggs are not my fave, the rest of it allows me to overlook the poached texture), and the weird harold is my current favorite sandwich anywhere.  The biscuits and gravy are pretty good also.  Service is always very fast and friendly.  The owner(??) that works the register is friendly, but maybe a bit too friendly, particularly if you are hungover.  Overall, a good place for a quick meal of comfort food for 10-15 dollars.
