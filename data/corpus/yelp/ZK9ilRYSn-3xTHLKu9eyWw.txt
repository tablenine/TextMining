Restaurant: Ben Pao
Category: Chinese
For Americanized Chinese, this is the best I've sampled thus far in Chicago. I grant it 4 stars relative to other places I've been in the city, even if strictly speaking these 4 stars don't translate to say, Chinatown. . . Taken for what it is: a large Loop restaurant that does Chinese cuisine, I was amply satisfied to return again. A meal for 2 runs about $70.00 including a couple rounds of beers. For the service, ambiance and food I'd say thats quite reasonable.
