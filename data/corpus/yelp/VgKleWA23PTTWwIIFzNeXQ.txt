Oh Barney's, how I love thee.... . Tons and tons of TVs, plenty of NY transplants to watch the Yankee games with, beer, good food (including all-day breakfast!!), and a nice staff.. . Plus the decor' is awesome. Â Nifty tables with old newspaper clippings and at the moment (October) they're decorated for Halloween.
