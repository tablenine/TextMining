Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
This place is DESSERT HEAVEN! They have everything you can imagine and more... the highlights for me are the guava &amp; cream cheese pastries, apple pastries, chocolate cake, and POTATO BALLS! =). . I just wish there was a Porto's in the Bay Area! We are in dire need of one... Anderson's Bakery just doesn't compare.. . Oh and the fresh squeezed OJ is to die for =)
