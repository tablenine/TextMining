Cute and quaint little tapas bar. Great vibe. We got the potatoes with spicy aioli sauce. AMAZING. crunchy, perfectly seasoned and topped with a decadent and creamy aioli sauce. Delicious beer as well, and wide variety of wine. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the street view. We only stopped by for a quick bite and it definitely hit the spot!!!
