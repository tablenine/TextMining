At Yamashiro you are paying rent for a view. I went to Yamashiro for a friends birthday dinner. Overall the experience was nice but not anything I'd rave about. Their cocktails are a bit on the weak side so I'd stick to your beer, wine, and sake fair.. . I had the hawaii five-o roll, spicy tuna on crispy rice, miso soup, and the grilled seafood entree. Nothing was bad but it wasn't great. I felt like everything I ate could have used something. For what I spent I'd hope to walking out of there wowed but I wasn't.
