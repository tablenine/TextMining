yumyumyumyum. Really, if you like (ok, love) garlic, you can't go wrong here. I drive by this place practically everyday so this was a long overdue trip. The decor, from as soon as you walk in the door, smacks you in the fact almost as much as the *amazing* garlicky aromas. From the little 'cabana' dining tents to the x-mas lights and the wall murals, this is not for the faint of heart.. . As for the food? 5 stars. Awesome. Tried a pasta dish, a seafood dish, and had the spinach-artichokey-garlic dip as an app and walked out pleasantly food comatose and toting leftovers to torture my office mates for lunch leftovers! . . Would have totally given it 5 stars if not for the 'meh' service. Attentive, for sure ... when you managed to flag a waiter down. Slow was the name of the game, and after we'd been handed our doggy bags it took so long for us to get the check I was almost sure I could have pranced right out and no one would have been the wiser. . . Fortunately, I'm not That Girl.
