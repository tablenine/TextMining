The only reason why this place doesn't get a five star rating is the crazy wait, but other than that this place is great.  The atmosphere is fun and hip, flat screens on almost every corner of the restaurant,  customers "artwork" on every inch of the wall, including mine.  Most of all the food!. . So flavorful and fun to eat! Just dump the grub right on your table and chow down!  You have the choice of your sauce and seasoning..i highly recommend the "whole she-bang mild" and the fried oysters! Again be prepared to wait a while especially on Friday nights, I suggest getting there right when they open to avoid the hour or so wait.
