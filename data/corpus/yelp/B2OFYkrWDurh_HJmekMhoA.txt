Ok. I want to like this place, I really do. But there are just a couple things that turn me off. . . First and foremost, I've never been blown away by the food. Maybe it's the fact that I cringe every time I find myself in front of the cash register. It adds up pretty quick. Everything is priced just a few dollars more than what it probably should be- which would be fine if I felt what I was paying for was exceptional. I'm not just being cheap or picky either- I actually ordered a dish that tasted so bad that I couldn't eat it. I was pretty shocked. . . The service has always been pleasant, but the atmosphere is pretentious. There I said it! . . I'm just not impressed. Bummer.
