Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I've been to Father's Office in Santa Monica for awhile now, love it. A friend want me to take her, so we headed to the Helms location, since I haven't been before. Love this new location, we went on a busy Saturday night, so it took awhile to get a table under the heat lamps.   . . As I told my friend before we arrived, it's not a standard burger.  It's something different.  My friend loved the burger, the caramelized onions, the different cheeses, and the sweet potato fries were cooked just right.  They have a great selections of beers and wines on tap.  I love trying new beers and have tried about 8 different beers and ales at FO.  So far, I haven't been steered wrong by the bartenders.  I did make a bad choice once, but that was my own fault.
