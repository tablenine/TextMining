I came here Â with a date who HATES to wait in line...bad choice then buddy, 'cause we waited about 15 minutes and ended up sitting at the bar, which is fine by me. I usually dine alone, so the bar is the best bet. . So many things to try! I ended up with one fish taco (good, but I wish it could be grilled) and a brisket taco (that day they were ON IT! Not dry like some have said) What I really liked were the starters and sides.. The salsa trio and guac were fab and the greens (spicy yum) geans and jalapeno slaw were better than the tacos. I make a meal of those alone! Shame I'm always on a mission when I drive by and think "I should've had lunch here"! I'm always either too early or too late, but I've got to put TDS on my list for lunch.
