I love ordering the chicken doner on foccacia, street cart style.  The foccacia is grilled so it has a great crispiness.  The chicken I think is a little juicier.  The sweet potato fries are AMAZING.  The regular fries come with a yummy seasoning so I enjoy those as well.  I also usually end up getting a gelato.  Their gelato is very thick and decadent.. . Although I do enjoy the food, I have to say that it is probably not as good as it *could* be.  I've had food from some Mediterranean style places where the meat is much more flavorful and juicy, where the lavash wrap is amazing and comes with a super delicious spicy sauce.  However, I still think Spitz is good for what it is.
