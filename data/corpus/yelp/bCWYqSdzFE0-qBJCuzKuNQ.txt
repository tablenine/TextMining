I'm sorry but this place really disappointed me! All my friends had been raving about it. And yeah, it's a great happy hour spot. The crowd is decent. Tons of beer. I like beer and decent crowds, so this is fine with me.. . But I went there to have a meal and some beer only to find that FO offers ONE BURGER. JUST ONE! No one made that clear to me when they were raving about how great the burger was. One. Burger.  And that one burger has blue cheese, which I don't even like to eat. Since there are no alterations, I just ate nothing at all. . . Plus, I wouldn't even feel comfortable eating  during Happy Hour because its crazy crowded and no one is really eating. So you'd feel like a fat ass standing there, shoving your face, while everyone else socially sips beers. . . I'm not into it. . . Now, if you read between the lines of this review, you might find exactly what you're looking for: A boisterous happy hour with good beer. Ain't nothin wrong with that. But just know that it is only that. Don't be lulled into the false hope  that you'll actually be eating anything while at FO.
