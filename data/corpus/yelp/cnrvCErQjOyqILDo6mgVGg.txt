A few friends and I decided to dine here for DineLa. I had the pre-fix of  Mac and Cheese, Short Ribs, and the Bread Pudding. The Mac and Cheese was mediocre but it seemed popular on yelp so I decided to try it out. The cheese on top of the pasta was delicious.  The rest of the pasta did not taste like anything but carbs. The Pomegranate Salad is an ordinary salad you can get anywhere so I wouldn't get it. My main problem of the night was the overall taste of the dinner. The Short Ribs were tender and served with undercooked noodles. The noodles were still hard and had no taste. The Short Ribs were under flavored. The Pork Tenderloin was the obvious winner. The Desert was the best part. The bread pudding had great texture and you can never go wrong with ice cream. . The service was mediocre. The server was not happy to serve us and they kept on bringing out the wrong order, giving plates to the wrong people, and even had to exchange receipts.
