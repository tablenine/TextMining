Dude, this place rocks.  I went there with a friend who raved about it and lo and behlod, she wasn't kidding...the pancakes were ginormous (frisbee size) and really damn tasty.  We shared the "boysenberry rain" pancakes and the eggs benedict (which I'm a big fan of and the Griddle's passed the test nicely).  We tried to finish it but it got to the point of almost heaving so we stopped.  Word of advice, get there early like before 10 or you'll be waiting a solid hour.
