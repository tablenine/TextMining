Wowza!!! This is probably the best restaurant I have been to in at least a year - if not ever. A little background on The James/Primehouse: We were actually going to have our wedding reception at The James - primarily because we had heard the food was amazing. We decided against this location because of the lack of windows in the reception room. It was really nice, nonetheless, but we found The Sutton Place hotel and not even the food could convince us to book The James.. . We started off in The James lounge with the surf and turf dumplings. Pretty good, but I wasn't incredibly impressed. Once we sat down for dinner at Primehouse, our server was at our table promptly and her service did not wane the entire night. She was so great - knowledgeable, friendly, curteous - you name it - her service was second to none. We had the kobe beef tartar - served on a bed of salt rock - that was to die for! I couldn't believe how much I loved raw meat! Don't miss it when you are there.. . For the entre, we had the chateubriand for two. I just can't say enough about the meat - AMAZING.. .
