Starbucks was full so I walked down to bakeshop and I was sooooo glad I did. . I came in for coffee but I decided to get a mini pizza which was actually really good. I also had my fill of free samples! I had 3 slices of bread: the pumpkin, the rosemary onion and thyme, and the walnut blue cheese. They were all great. . There were only a few people in there on a Saturday evening so made myself comfortable and took out some reading material. I loved people watching out the windows as well as watching them bake all the breads. The smells coming from the ovens were to die for! The music selection was better than starbucks too. Next time i'll try a pastry.. Free wi-fi too!
