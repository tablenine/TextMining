My broski and I were making fun of walking-by (because when I'm at bar I usually make fun of people that don't look like me) hipster douche and trying to say what he might say to us. We finalized on "hey you lincoln parkers, you're in the wrong neighborhood, go back to the north side" (we were both sporting polo shirts and flip flops).. . Then, a girl behind us took offense saying "do you guys have anything better to do than make comments on people walking by?" (no, we don't) We quickly explained that we were only making hypothetical statements that some one else would say. She was obviously one of us, so her stance softened. We then learned that Waukegan is apparently the North Shore's red headed stepchild.. . I think that sums it up. Kinda confused place. Hot bartender. $5 for a top shelf gin and tonic. Nice tvs.
