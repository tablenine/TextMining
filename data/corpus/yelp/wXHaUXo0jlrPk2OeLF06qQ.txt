I ordered dinner from Oinkster for the family a few weeks back.  Although the food was good, i don't think its worth the $7.99 for the sandwich from a fast food place.  I tried the house cured pastrami and the cheeseburger.  The pastrami was tasty when i first tried it, but i honestly can't remember what it tastes like now.  The cheeseburger was just like any cheeseburger from any fast food joint.  The cashier insisted I try the belgian fries.  After she gave me a 2 minute description of what they exactly were, i proceeded to order three as she had told me one was big enough for 2 people to share.  I rushed home eager to try them only to be quite disappointed.  The fries are a lot harder than i would normally like fries.  It felt like i was eating tree twigs.  The garlic sauce absolutely made them taste better.  . . Oinkster opened up a few years ago, after i moved out of my parents' house.  I had been wanting to try it for a long time.  Now that I have, I probably wouldn't want to go back.  I would rather make the longer drive to Lucky Boys in Pasadena.
