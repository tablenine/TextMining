Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Not worth the time or money. I had lunch here this afternoon and will never go back. The food was okay at best -- the chips were soggy and the sandwich looked to have been put together in a hurry. The server was excellent, even though he was incredibly busy. The manager, however, is a different story -- very imperious and arrogant. It's a sandwich shop, man, not Charlie Trotters!
