Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Never had a dissapointing visit to this place.  I love the spinning salad, if you like your salad drenched in dressing, Love the bread pudding and Absolutely love the Prime Rib here.  My mouth waters every time I see the Football Players in the Rose Bowl Tournament eat at this place.
