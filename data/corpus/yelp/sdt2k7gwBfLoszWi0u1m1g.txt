I absolutely love Mirai, and go there for special occassions since the price is slightly prohibiting.  They have great specialty options and really fresh fish.  . . My favorite items are:. 1)  Kani Nigiri.  OMG. Spicy crab nigiri served with a lemon garnish. So freaking good we end up ordering 3 or 4 servings every time (this probably doesn't help the bill situation). 2)  Spicy Tar-Tar Appetizer, choosing the octopus and scallop.  They serve these in little fried cups that you can eat after (or with) your fish.. 3)  Spicy Mono Roll.  A delightful combination of spicy octopus, spicy tuna, and sweet unagi sauce. 4) Special Hirame Roll. Yummy soft-shell crab with fluke and ponzu. 5) Special Zuke Roll. Fried shrimp and salmon with a tasty soy sauce.. 6) Any of their sashimi.. . What I love about Mirai is that as they serve you the dishes they say "the chef suggests no sauce with this", or the "chef suggests a little soy", etc, etc.  Let me tell you, the chef is always right.. . If you're there in the summer, make sure to go to the gelato place next door for some awesome dessert.
