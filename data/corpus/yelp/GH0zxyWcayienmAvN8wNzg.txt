Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
3.5 - i was ready to be impressed. i mean, it's gotta be special if they tout "umami" no? a certain savoriness of quality and overall good taste if by japanese translations.. . i think my burger met the standard. i had the truffle burger ($11) with truffle cheese and truffle glaze. it was very truffly. it delivered on its name. what i enjoyed was the size of the meat patty. it was big and thick, juicy and cooked medium rare so that when you take a bite, you still see the pink. that way you know it isn't too tough. you can ask for it however you like of course but i prefer mine this way, and they got it perfectly. the buns were cute and plump but the best part was that they were SMALLER than the patty. i'm a firm believer that the meat should be bigger or at least the same size.. . i also had a quarter of the umami burger ($10). it seemed bland in comparison to my truffle glaze so honestly i have to say mine was better.. . * the sweet potato fries ($4) were skinny and crisply fried. mmm.. - the tempura onion rings ($3) that most tables seemed to have ordered were a touch disappointing for me. while the batter was nice and light, there wasn't much onion flavor at all. so it begs the question of what you're really eating - basically just tempura batter, which was pretty oily. bleh.. * i also had a bottle of their diet coke. it came in glass and in a mini size. waiter told me they were imported from denmark. cute.. . cool vibe. casual food. friendly staff. not bad.
