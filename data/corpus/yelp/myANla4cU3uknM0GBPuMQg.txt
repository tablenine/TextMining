I was really disappointed by this place. The prices were ridiculous - and I understand that they use mostly (not all) organic/local ingredients, but 6 bucks for a mug of chili? The food was okay, mediocre at best, and no where near the prices we paid. The service was eh. Our waitress was attentive, but she messed up both of our orders. When I tried to tell another waitress who served us our food, she argued with me when I told her I ordered a chicken sandwich, not turkey - she tried to tell me that the turkey, which they delivered, was chicken. They eventually gave me the right sandwich, but I shouldn't have had to argue to get it.
