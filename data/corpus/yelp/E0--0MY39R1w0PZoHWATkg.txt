I'm not a regular there, not yet anyway (living between the Porter in L5P, The Local and The Book House on Ponce, and the Brick Store in Decatur, I am in Pubtopia, so it's hard to settle on just one). But I'm always treated like one. The brisket is terrific, and while there are only two desserts to choose from, they are very nice and served with two spoons. The Tuesday Celtic jam sessions are terrific. I adore this place.
