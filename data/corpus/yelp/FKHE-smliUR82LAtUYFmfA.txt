Well I have never written a review while being so wasted, but that was dang good. Forget the foo foo reviews about the food and stuff. Everyone comes here in droves of large groups to get wasted. Wow. The beer and ale assortment is ridiculous. Off the freakin' hook. Oh, and the bar tenant is really cute for all you ladies and gay men. Yum. The Spaten Pils is just like my favorite British Boddington's Ale. It is so smooth....sort of like a silent killer.
