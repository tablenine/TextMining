bf and i went here the other night. it definitely looks like a work in progress. the front counter was a bit awkward, and i think they are still trying to get their ordering and serving process streamlined. you walk down a long hallway to get to more seating and the bar. they are still not quite finished with construction but the space looks like it will have some nice character. the chairs were kind of uncomfortable but the food was really good and so was the beer. the fries were super fresh. bf had the filipino sausage which he really liked and some other funky sausage with weird meat. i had the veg. one of the owners came to talk to us while we were eating and was really nice and offered us beer samples. this is the kind of place that seems like a local person's special project and you hope does really well in the future once it gets more established. the owner talked about having outdoor seating eventually which would probably be lovely in the summertime evenings.
