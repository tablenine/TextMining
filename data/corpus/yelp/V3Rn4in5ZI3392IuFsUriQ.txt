HANDS DOWN the best brasilian bbq place in the Los Angeles area!. . My best friend is from Brazil and he's been taken me to many Brazillian bbq places. We both agree that Fogo is a notch above the rest. I also went to the Fogo in Dallas and that place was amazing as well.. . The service at Fogo is very good. I find that most high end Brazillian bbq joints have excellent service. . . As for the food... AMAZING!. Fogo has the best cheesebread. Talk about fresh. The meat quality is epic quality. The pichuana and beef rib are to DIE for. The garlic beef is very inconsistent imo. Sometimes its the best but on other days is just too cooked and tough.. . The only drawback if any, is that they don't have beef stroganoff or chicken hearts. OMG these dishes are the best and for Fogo not to have... sigh
