Best pizza in town. The appetizer are good for 2 people and are great. If you like lentils try the lentils with goat cheese, match made in heaven. But make sure you come with a reservation, if you don't you will wait at least 1 hour standing up and probably get seated at the bar. . . Great food, is worth some planning.
