Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
The menu is unique and diverse, the sushi is fresh, the specials are very tasty, and the cost is reasonable.  Thirty-five bones for lunch is steep, but somehow it satisfies.  Throw in a bamboo shaft of cold sake, a couple of Kirin Lights, the view of some nice-looking patrons, and your bill obviously goes up, but again, somehow it really satisfies (particularly when you have a driver).. . You need a reservation pretty much any night of the week, and even for lunch sometimes, but it's worth the hassle.  If you don't know what to order, just ask the waitress to give you "the top three".  Twice.. . And now that there are more Katsu-ya's in L.A. than McDonalds, it's okay to refer to this place as "that place across the street from Roku."
