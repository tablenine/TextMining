Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
What is this?! Is this supposed to be a slider? Where's the other 2 that's supposed to come with this mini-burger?? Okay, I know I'm in LA, but just because Kate Moss gets full off of this, doesn't mean regular people will. Horrible portions for the price. I literally was hungry as soon as I stepped out of the restaurant. . . I ordered the Umami Burger and it was pretty good. I just learned recently what "umami" is -- from what I remember, it's the oily, buttery, meaty, hearty taste from foods like cooked tomatoes, thick portabello mushrooms, and chicken stock. Now that I know that, I know that the Umami Burger definitely had a lot of "umami." It was rich, oily, meaty, and hearty. But it wasn't -- what's the word? -- TASTY.. . Don't get me wrong -- it was good in the way that I think eating cream cheese is good. It's fulfilling in that sense. But honestly, it really doesn't have much flavor -- it's not tangy, it's not sweet, it's not creamy, it's not bursting with really anything other than... "umami". So yeah, it was good -- but it definitely wasn't memorable. I also hated the "homemade" ketchup they had -- I vote that all pretentious "gourmet" burger joints all keep a bottle of Heinz ketchup on deck, in case somebody doesn't want to dip their french fry in a strange organic red paste.. . I also tried the beet salad w/ truffle oil &amp; aged cheese and that was pretty good. Beets? Good. Truffle Oil? Good. Cheese? Good. Can't really go wrong there. I'm also happy that they have Sarsaparilla root beer which is awesome.. . All in all, this place really is nothing to rave about. The famous Umami Burger was a huge let-down, in taste and in size.
