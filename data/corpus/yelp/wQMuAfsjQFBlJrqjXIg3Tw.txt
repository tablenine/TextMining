WAY overpriced for what you get.  I went to the host stand to check on how long it would be until we got a table and the bartender removed my drink before I finished it... and didn't apologize at all when I mentioned this to him.  They couldn't give us a table due to tables being held for reservations and were VERY apologetic.  My group of 5 was able to have drinks at the bar, drinks by the fireplace, eat appetizers by the fireplace, settle our check, and leave without anyone being seated at tables they were holding for reservations.  The hosts were young and incompetent.  They apologized too much.  The server apologized too much.  The food was fine, but out of the five things we ordered, only 1 was a hit (calamari.)  The chopped salad was definitely not chopped and definitely not worth $15.  Not recommended.
