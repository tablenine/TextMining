3.5 stars.  We ordered delivery, so I have no idea about the actual restaurant.. . The pan pizza was really tasty, I enjoyed it and I wouldn't complain if I had to eat it again.   We also ordered prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls.  If you're a prosciutto or mozzarella snob, I wouldn't recommend this.  While tasty, neither were very high quality.
