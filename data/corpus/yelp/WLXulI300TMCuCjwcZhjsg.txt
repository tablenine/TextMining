Ha!  Well, seeing as this is the 506th review and the place retains a solid 4 stars, there shouldn't be much else to add.....so, bullet points it is!. . *Elbow your way through the crowd and find the beaten up clipboard sitting on a chair, quickly enter your name and party size!  First available seating is the way to go....only a few booths and a small bar...expect to wait.. . *ONLY get a bowl of ramen.  Don't be tempted by larger combos with appetizers, it's just too much food, fatty!  Sorry, I take back the "fatty" comment.  Anywho, ramen's all you need.. . *I dare you to find street parking.  So, don't be an overachiever and just pay a few bucks to park at the lots across the street.
