Hooooooray! Free wifi in Logan Square in a bright, airy, spacious cafe! Hoooray!!!!. . Why only three stars? Because I'm not impressed by the coffee - the Metropolis coffee is fine, but not particularly inspired, and the accompanying coffee service makes me appreciate places like the Coffee Studio, which actually takes coffee seriously. The cappuccino wasn't particularly well-made either, which really disappointed me. Come on now, barista. Make your foam count!. . But I'll go back. Again and again and again. Because the sound track is straight outta my adolescence and because the wifi is free and I'll suck up bad joe any day of the week if it means sitting in a sunny window and taking in the hipster landscape a mere 2 blocks from my house.
