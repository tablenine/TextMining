Not sure about the prior yelper's review regarding the meat being too dry, but when I went there last Monday, it was juicy, peppery, and perfectly cooked. Maybe they went on an off day. I usually prefer thick Pastrami like Katz in NYC or Langers, this one was just in between thick and thin. Nice selection of IPA's as well. Also like the condiments they have here. Try dipping the sandwich in their Carolina hot sauce. Â Only thing missing was a horseradish type sauce. Hands down this is better than the Hat.
