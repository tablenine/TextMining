First off, I'd say the food and drinks are top-notch.  The skirt steak was probably the best I've ever had, and my girlfriend's grouper was absolutely fantastic.  That being said, our waitress was horrible.  She had zero personality.  She had no smile, no inflection in her voice, and read us the "rules" of the menu (fixed menu for Valentines Day) as if she were reading us the Chicago zoning law.  I couldn't hear most of it over the music.  We didn't know it was a fixed-item menu (which was ok), and the waitress immediately said, "Well, they told us ALL the customers were told about this, so you can only order from this menu so I'll come back when you're ready".  Very abrupt.   A waiter brought us our first course and blurted out what was on the plate as he were in a speed-reading contest.  I asked him what the "shot" was and he replied "Gazpacho shot!" and walked away without an explanation as to what it was.  It was one of those moments where you look at your date incredulously and lift your eyebrows and say, "HUH? What was that?"  Luckily, the waiter who brought our actual dinner was great, explaining what each item was, and he had ... what do you know.... a SMILE!  To top it all off, the waitress brings us our check, unsolicited, before we're done eating our dessert.  The look on her face when I ordered another beer was priceless.  How DARE I cut into her free time like that while she needs another customer to sit in our seats!  The waitstaff needs a TON of personality training.  The food alone does not pack the seats.    I like restaurants where you leave and say, "Wow, those people were great!"  We won't go back, that's for sure.
