Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
I wanted to give The Hungry Cat three stars for food, but I had to give them 2 stars for ambiance instead, because it kind of overshadowed the food (which was good).. . The indoor area is nice enough, but the outdoor seating area is just weird and tiny.  It's kind of sandwiched in between the service entrance to Ivan Kane's and the front entrance of Borders, so it feels like being at the mall when you're out there.  . . We ordered half a pound of crab legs for $20, which is a decent price in my opinion and the crab tasted nice and fresh.  Then I tried to order a Gibson and the waiter tried to pressure me into ordering some shmancy hard lemonade specialty cocktail instead (??) thanks but no thanks, I'm sure my Gibson cost just as much as the lemonade anyway!  . . They have some interesting specialty vodkas, none of the usual bar options.  I was skeptical at first but the vodka I tried was really good, A+ would drink again.  My drink, however, was teeny tiny and served in a teeny miniature little vessel that looked like it was designed for a gnome, I could have done my martini as a shot, basically.  Boo on that.. . They give you trendy designer bottled water for the table, which I hate, but I know a lot of people love that so it's OK.  Just one of those things.  . . Anyway, our food was good.  I had the lobster chowder which was fine.  Nothing special.  I was totally jealous of my friends' meals which were much better:  The grilled Barramundi with crab pierogies - yummy; and the bacon-wrapped trout  - also good.  Prices were not cheap but not offensive either.  . . If the environment were a little cozier and less arbitrarily froofy, I'd go back.
