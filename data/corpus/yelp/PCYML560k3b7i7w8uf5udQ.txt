It's a shame that it took me more than 24 years as a Los Angeles native to finally make it over to Versailles Cuban Restaurant.  I'd always heard of it, but never had the opportunity to taste the cuisine of this LA staple.  As my exposure to Cuban food hasn't been too extensive, I cannot claim an expertise on the subject, by any means.  . . During my first visit to Versailles a few weeks ago with my boss, I ordered the lechon asado- Cuban style roast pork marinated in a garlic mojo criollo sauce, served with black beans, rice, and grilled plantains all for under $8.  Now...Versailles is not about the best presentation or anything, but the main feature is, indeed, the food.  The pork was soooo tender, and the oily, buttery, garlic infused sauce paired with the bitterness of the raw onion and the softness of rice- all of this was pure indulgence for the senses.  The slight acidity of the garlic sauce was countered nicely by the sweet and char of the grilled plantains.  . . During my last visit to Versailles a few nights ago, I opted for the restaurant's famous dish- the "famous garlic chicken"- a roasted half chicken marinated in the garlic sauce ($9.95).  They are not messing around about the portions.  The tender meat was juicy and just slipped off the bone at the touch of the fork.  There was just enough of the garlic sauce to be sopped up by the meat and rice.  Again, how can you not be pleased by grilled plantains.. . All of this was washed down with a delicious guanabana (one of my most favorite fruits of all time- white flesh, big black seeds, flavor reminiscent of coconut/berries/pineapple) shake ($3.50).  . . Affordable.  Down to earth.  Delicious.  Los Angeles. Grand, I tell you.
