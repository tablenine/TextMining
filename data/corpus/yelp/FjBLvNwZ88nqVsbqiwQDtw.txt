Don't knock the hustle... It seems that a few Angelenos with questionable palettes say the food (sausages) is okay and the fries good (really? just good?), but they may have never ventured beyond the 101... Common local yokels, expand the horizon.. . Take it from a person fortunate enough to have sampled culinary delights and disasters beyond the great US of A; these guys do it right! Inspired by a bauhaus looking beer hall, with a sparse menu and good ale on tap, what more could you want? The name says it all btw (Wurstkuche = Sausage Kitchen / Cuisine - depends who you ask...). Sausage + Beer, easy enough.. . To the food... I've sampled various sausages on three different visits with winning results. Outside of the annoying line (what can you do, this place has a mean ol' buzz around town), it's definitely worth the wait. Cool staff, good food, all in all good times. . . I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but rounded up due to a few of the negative marks left by others. Not tear worthy, but definitely worth a trip with good friends and engaging convo.... . Hoist your glass to the flemish next round for giving us such stellar libations.
