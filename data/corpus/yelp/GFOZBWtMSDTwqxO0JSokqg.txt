While I was visiting the LA area a really good friend of mines treated me to Tender Greens after I told him that I was eating better and Roscoe's wasn't on my list of healthy things to eat. Plus I'm running a triathlon soon and I don't need any dirty carbs inside me. . . Tender Greens was the best! I really like the set up order inside and eat outside in the patio areas. Since the weather was so nice eating outside was great. I order the Tuna Nicoise and it was perfectly seared the vinaigrette wasn't over powering and the tuna just shined. The melody of the capers, tomatoes and greens came together nicely! . . Now the Acai Fresca wasn't that great but it was a nice try so I'll stick to the Mexican spots for my fresh Â squeezed drinks.
