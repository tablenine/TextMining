Came here on a Monday afternoon (sadar) and it was pretty busy. I will start by saying that our omelettes came to our table within 5 minutes of ordering. That is impressive! On the weekends this is "the spot" there's a huge line to get a table.. . I had the "Toast special" omelette, scrumpious with mushrooms, basil, goat cheese, etc. No grease. The side of fruit was a great selection compared with generic grapes, unripe cantalope and pineapple that most places throw together. Had a blended coffee drink with a bit of that "out of a pre-mix machine" consistency, but then again the liquid didn't separate like a frapucinno, so I can't really complain. . . No, it's not that hard to do breakfast, but this place makes it really tasty. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the mood for sweets to try the banana pudding stuffed french toast. Yumm!
