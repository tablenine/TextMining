The ONLY reason I came here was because my teenage sister (obsessed with LA and famous people) was dying to go...SO I took her and her teenage friend to dinner thinking it would be exciting for them to be in a trendy "Hollywood" hot-spot (it was when we went, maybe not now) and maybe catch sight of some flavor of the week celebrity. . . Anyhow, the food, atmosphere, etc.. was actually kind of tacky Tokyo chic and I actually was enjoying myself until...THE HORRIBLE SERVICE. Our waiter, a struggling model/actor/posuer no doubt was LAME. My sister, a mere 14!!!, had never eaten sushi before and ordered the California Roll because it seemed easiest to digest and is entry-level sushi. The waiter literally told her no, she could not order it because you don't come to a restaraunt like Geisha House and order the California Roll. I can see his point, but his tone and the way he said it embarrassed my poor sister and her friend. Then I ordered a bottle of wine (for my of age friend and I) and he AGAIN chastised us for our choice.. . THEN he has the audacity to NOT bring us what we ordered, but instead what he believes we will enjoy instead. WTF who doe sthat!?!
