Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I wished I had a larger appetite to fully appreciate this restaurant.  The ambience and service were excellent.  The round cheese bread was awesome but the highlight was the barage of attractive waiters wielding swords of meat throughout the night.  The house special steak was my favorite--tender, flavorful and hearty.
