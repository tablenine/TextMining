Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
1st impression: Fancy. 2nd impression (within 1 minute): Super old-fashioned!. 3rd impression (next minute): Upscale cafeteria with scary paintings of people that really belong in haunted mansions (I scare easily). 4th impression (after dinner): Sharing a dish next time (can I do that?). . 3rd try is the charm, I guess.  I have been trying to get to this restaurant for months now!  1st time I tried going was with Jeff H. and the traffic was horrendous, missed our reservations, was starving and opted for Cheesecake Factory instead.  2nd time I had reservations was with someone I was dating and we called it all off the day before our date was scheduled!  I finally decided that I'm better off having dinner with a GIRLfriend instead.  And it worked - I finally went tonight and here's how it went... . . Drove up to the valet and they took my car promptly and I walked into the very fancy shmancy restaurant... fancy in a very old-fashioned kinda way.  I first noticed the waitress uniforms... aprons.  Really?  Aprons?  Then our host pulled out the table from the booth so we can seat ourselves without having to slide in - that was kinda cool.  We were greeted quickly by our server and she was really on it all night - must commend her for that (although - I forget her name!).  Amy B and I ordered the same thing (again!) and got the following: . - the English Cut - 3 thin slices of medium prime rib $32 (It was good and tender, but I'd rather have a filet). - 50/50 creamed corn and spinach that had bacon crumbles $5 (I wanna have a love affair with their creamed corn). . And everything comes with: . - spinning salad mixed right in from of us - the BEST croutons ever. - fresh bread. - mashed potatoes - Eh... normal... I've had better. - Yorkshire pudding - I don't get what it really is.  Tasted like dry crust.  Wasn't impressed.. . IF I ever go back, I'm starting with dessert first which I didn't have room for tonight.  : (. . After eating all my creamed veggies and only 1 piece of prime rib... I was STUFFED.  This was a lot of food... so we had everything wrapped up.... and can you believe it... we f*cking left everything on the table!  Totally forgot about it!  Grrr... what a waste!  Was so looking forward to a prime rib lunch tomorrow!  Damn!. . Cut to: mediocre food served in a fancy restaurant with excellent service still gets you 4 stars.... . ***************************. UPDATE: . No, I didn't go back... but I was just realizing how yucky it was that the food was on pretty much a rolling tray line.  Here's a dollop of veggies and 5 different slabs of meat on this cutting tray on wheels.  Thinking about all that meat is kinda grossing me out.  Especially since the guys who cuts it up, pretty much just rolls it from table to table... meaning that food has been exposed many times throughout the night.... none of this is fresh.  Ick.  I'm changing this to 3 stars.
