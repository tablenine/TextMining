I am so glad we strolled in to this wonderful restaurant in our neighborhood. Every experience has been a good one, which is why we visit at least once a week. . . The food is fresh and consistent. The enchiladas suizas are a favorite as well as the chipotle shrimp. I always enjoy their tortilla soup, while munching on their tasty chips and (as mentioned in other reviews) unique salsas. Â What is also refreshing are the portion sizes. They are normal and I never walk out feeling over-stuffed. . . The family that runs Los Nopales is very sweet and attentive, even when it is packed. They know us now and always make us feel like special friends. On several occasions they have treated us to appetizers or dessert!. . Try the flan if you are up for a little sweetness. They have many flavors available and I love the coffee flan. . . As the owners become more settled they have made little improvements throughout to make the restaurant more comfortable for all. . . Even my parents - who live in Elgin - beg for it every time they visit. The specials are always a hit. The cactus salad is a nice touch with out a snobby foodie feel.
