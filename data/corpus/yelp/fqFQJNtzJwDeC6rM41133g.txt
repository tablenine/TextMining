I have a tendency to only write reviews for places I love! My friend used to waitress here so I'm been a few times. I've sat at the bar and had amazing wine and appetizers with my friend. I love so many things on the menu and everything is so good. All the pasta is homemade and you can certainly tell the difference. I just love the gnocchi I've had it a few times. I recently went to Gioco for a holiday dinner with my family and tried the homemade spinach and cheese tortellini and it was out of this world. The atmosphere, service, menu and wine are all 5 stars to me. I really like small restaurants with good service and good food. You really do feel like a guest at Gioco.
