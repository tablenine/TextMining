Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
yaaay!!! champagne!! Sparking wine!!! Rose!!! Hooray for a large selection of dessert wines, great beers, but most of all a majorly varied selection of sparkling wine and champagne! yum city!. . We secured the back room for an after rehearsal dinner gathering for a wedding and it was perfect.  The space had 3-4 high top tables and opened up right into the main bar room.  The service was awesome, prices were high but worth it, and the cocktails were stupendous! The bellini was overflowing with sparkling rose and fresh peach puree...deeeeelish and PERFECT for a celebration.. . I would ABSOLUTELY come back here for a date, a girls night out, etc etc.
