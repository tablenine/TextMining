came back again last night.  i didn't learn my lesson the first time:  Sashimi Dinner is too big for me to defeat.  I walked out holding my stomach and back like I was preggers.  Last night, i ordered the Sashimi Dinner again and afterwards, I wanted to give birth to the biggest turd-monster as soon as i got home.  . . Next time I'm gonna order the Sashimi (not Sashimi Dinner) at dinner time, and save the $5 for other delicacies instead of shoving the tempura + miso soup + sunomono + rice down my throat.   Bulimia is no good if i don't like to throw up.
