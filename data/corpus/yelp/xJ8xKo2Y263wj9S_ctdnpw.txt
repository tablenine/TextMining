o Food - love my tuna tartar and sesame beef appetizer - however, my steamed veggies weren't exactly steamed and had a weird dressing - also had the seab bass - literally melting in my mouth - good noodles - but something was a little off- little heavy??? - great portions though for such a Â nice place!!! - banana wantons were AMAZZZINGGG but chocolate mouse was just so so. (maybe it was the raspberry sauce). . o Price - expensive - over 50 each. . o Drinks - oyster bay sauvignon blanc - delish even though twist off . . o Atmosphere - really cute! Palm trees - very Vietnam - orchids loved it. . o Service - really good - very attentive waiter - always checking on it - very friendly hostess'. . o Go back? - yes
