I am always searching for the perfect milkshake and after reading the scathing reviews of Millions of Milkshakes on Yelp, I skipped it in favor of MILK. Probably a wise choice as MILK has some great contenders:. . - Coffee Toffee Crunch Shake - $6. . - Banana Peanut Malt - $6. . Both were big and delicious - my only complaint would be they're SO sugary sweet they're tough to finish. But overall, great milkshakes ;). . * Also ordered a small vanilla eclair and it was kinda bland - not recommended.
