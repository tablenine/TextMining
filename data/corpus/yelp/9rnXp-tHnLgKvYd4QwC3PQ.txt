Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Ok, so may be it is because I use to live in Houston and had great home made sole food and home made Fried Chicken, but I was not impressed. I was so looking forward to trying Roscoe's, perhaps I created a false level of expectation in my mind before I sampled the food. You need to try it since it is an LA institution, but do not get your hopes up.
