I was impressed with everything here. The belgian fries dipped in the garlic aioli then swirled around in the chipotle ketchup was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. I was also pleasantly surprised by the oinkster mustard. Wow! But enough about the sauces.... the burger is my favorite kind- regular ass griddle burger with thousand island, cheddar, lettuce tomato onion. Can't be beat. My only gripe was that the patty itself wasn't very warm, it kind of tasted like it had been made earlier and was maybe sitting around for a minute. Then the cold cheese and cold toppings made the burger, well, cold. But it was delicious anyway. Can't wait to go back. The service was incredibly friendly, too.
