I must be in the movie Groundhog Day. Keep having the same experience. Amazing cocktail, ok food. . . SUPER chicken? Understood.. Mac n Cheese at it's best? Yes. . Other stuff? Hit or miss.... . We went to celebrate my friend's bday on Chicken Tuesday, but after consecutive days of turkey mole, turkey soup, turkeyturkeyturkey..... No, I did not get the chicken. . . The gumbo was not dirty enough. No earthy bottom notes. Not enough spice. Too many bell peppers. Not thick. The rice should not float in the broth, it sits at the bottom. It was like gumbo lite or something. Seemed like it was made by someone in the midwest. For $21 a bowl, that sh*t should be heaven. And it was purgatory.... . The highlight of the evening was an apple bourbon concoction that imparted a lovely flavor and buzz. Thank you, bartender.... . Cheers~
