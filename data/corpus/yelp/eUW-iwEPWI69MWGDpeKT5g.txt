Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Still love this place it is a simple menu, $2 shrimp or $1.50 fish tacos with a variety of salsa, crem, guacamole, and cabbage.  They are hot, fresh and made to order. Now open 7 days a week you will no longer be disappointed  when you pull up at noon on a Monday to an empty converted garage. Cute simple place where you come to eat tacos, when you are done eating tacos you leave, that's it! If you ask for them to go, he will say, "I don't make them to go, but I'll give 'em to ya". You see it is designed to eat right away and if they get carted up the street for 20 minutes and they get soggy and don't taste as good then it is their fault in his view....like I said before, "It's a taco stand you come here to eat tacos when you are finished you leave", plain and simple. So please stop eating that fish taco at home and get out and try this one, I am sure she won't mind.
