Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
when you say spicy, sticky rice does NOT fuck around. their nam tok will walk all over your taste buds, kickin' ass and takin' names. their gang hung lay is not only fun to say but is also freakin' delicious (along with pretty much everything else i've tried on the menu). . . the selection is crazy extensive and pretty much has something for everyone. so if you're a true thai lover and wanna go out with your picky, lame-ass, "i love generic asian food", vegetarian friend... don't worry, they have tofu pad thai. . . i was oh so tempted to deduct one star since sticky rejiggered their delivery boundaries to exclude my house, but i just couldn't do it. its just that good.
