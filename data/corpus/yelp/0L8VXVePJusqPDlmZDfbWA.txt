I was forced to come to this restaurant for a friends birthday.  Buckhead life group is not one of my top restaurants to go to.. for spending that kind of money.  I had to go.. . The first thing that came out wats the bread.  It came out with marinara sauce with goat cheese on it and it was really good.  All of us practically licked the bowl clean!  The random appetizers that we also ordered  was all good.. . My pasta dish was alright.  I tried to venture into something different and wasn't all that good.  I had the Orecchiette and, maybe it's the korean in me, but we asked for some hot sauce and our server gave us chili oil.  The oil made it more greasy looking.  Shall try something else next time.  . . The service was great.  One of my friends was half finished with his lasagna.  As he was passing a plate, he  tipped his own white wine all over his shirt and meal.  The server just happened to be right behind him and in one motion, he lifts up the lasagna to take it to the kitchen yelling.. "Lasagna on the fly."  . . they also gave us a dessert for my friends birthday.  with a very good handwriting of happy birthday.. . I would go again
