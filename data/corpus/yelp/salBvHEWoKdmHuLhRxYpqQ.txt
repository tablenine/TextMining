Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
It's one of the better all-you-can eat korean bbq places in socal. The outdoor seating under a giant tent is a Â smart way to ventilate all the sizzling meats on the grill under it.. . They have a nice little system to get the waiters attention. There's a small button that can be pushed on the edge of the table to get your table number up on the wall so that it can be seen. But the small screen that displays these numbers can only display 3 numbers at time. So you gotta keep watch on this and push the button over and over if you're fighting for a spot on the board. It's kinda fun in a way, like a little battle.. . The meat is fairly good. They have 7 meats to choose from, and once you find your favorite you just keep ordering it till you full basically. They also have a lot of little side dishes. My favorite is the potato salad, or the kimchi, but i've had better kimchi.. . I used to come here all the time until recently because I found a better place that's not as expensive and has better seating. But this place is still very good, I'm not bashing it. Introduced me to all you can eat kbbq!
