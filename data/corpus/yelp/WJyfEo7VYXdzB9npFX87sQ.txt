Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
This place is larger on the inside than it looks from the outside. It looks like it could have formerly been a Denny's or something. Came here on a Sunday night. There was an Asian Elvis singer singing all hte classics and we were told that he is pretty much there every night. . . The staff all had ear pieces so they could put your order in immediately. This is the most efficient restaurant I have ever been to. There is a team of people bringing you things and taking your plate, all with ear pieces.. . The food was excellent. The Pad See-Eww had lots of flavor and was filling. The Kee-Mo was spicy and you can request the level. They have soups that come in hot pots and are definitely for the whole table. Everything was in the $6-$8 range each and it was well presented.. . I'll certainly be back!
