Okay, I like this place because the cakes are INCREDIBLE.  I've had some type of veggie wrap which was pretty good too. I love the patio and the general vibe of the place on days it's not too crowded.  . . BUT there was this one time I put creamer in my tea and it was all chunky. When I calmly mentioned it to the counter girl she got all hyper and said "WELL, it curdled because you put COLD creamer into HOT tea."  I smiled and gently disagreed with her while suggesting that the creamer was old and moldy due to the heat outside and its placement next to the window.. . Anyway, some tension ensued and finally another counter girl swapped out the creamer and thanked me for telling them.  It was dramatic and I haven't been there since.  I have decided that I will take my crazy actions of putting cold creamer into hot beverages elsewhere.
