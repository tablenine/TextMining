Since moving to Denver, this is probably the restaurant that I miss the most from Chicago. I often ate at the restaurant and also was a regular delivery customer. As far as sushi rolls, the honey roll and the Godzilla roll both get two big thumbs up. I also really enjoyed the spicy tuna salad and could rarely finish it given how much tuna was always piled on it. If you do happen to eat in at the restaurant, I love that they have remained BYOB. I have been here for small, more intimate dinners and big group events and have enjoyed myself every time. I am only giving them 4 stars because I did have a few experiences when the sushi quality wasn't consistent with what I had come to expect.
