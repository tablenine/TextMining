I've come here a few times over the years. The first time was just after they first opened. I heard the original chef had left now, so I wanted to try it again. The food is still excellent. Whoever replaced him is just as good, maybe even a little better. We had the rigatoni with a lamb bolognese to start and the pork chop and steak frites as entrees. all were cooked perfectly. The steak was better than the pork. For dessert was the chocolate coulant, which was also very good and would highly recommend. The reason for only four stars is that the wine selection is not that great, escpecially the selection of wines by the glass.
