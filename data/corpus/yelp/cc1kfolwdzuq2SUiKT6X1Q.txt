Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
A tie with Monk's for the best burger in Chicago!. . It gets five stars vs. Monk's four stars from me because of the can't-be-beat patio and garden.... . Walk in to the dark smoky restaurant, and your first reaction might not be a good one -- it is old school, but not in a charming way. But go out back, and there is lush tree cover, stringed white lights, and picnic tables galore...it's a burger oasis!. . Try the Moody Bleu -- a blue cheese smothered burger -- with onion rings and a pitcher of Miller beer, and you're in heaven.. . A bunch of the guys got together for a bachelor party here to kick off the evening, and we all agreed that it was a great call...baskets of fried stuff, and huge burgers with never-ending beer? Love it.
