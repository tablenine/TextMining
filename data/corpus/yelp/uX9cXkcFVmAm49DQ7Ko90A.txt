Batali, Silverton amazing.. My first trip here was amazing.  All the food was perfect, I actually have no complaints.  I think my favorite was the octopus which was seriously amazing.  Cooked to perfection and a perfect balance of acid and oil.  awesome.  . They have a great wine list and some very tasty cocktails.. I would say to try all their cheeses.  The mozz is perfect and the burrata makes my pants tight.. Actually writing this review is making me contemplate a reservation for Monday...
