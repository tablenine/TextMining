Crab cake benedict. . . That's all you need to remember for brunch here at Cafe 28.  Seriously, it's just delicious.  They prepare perfect poached eggs (and I am a poached egg stickler).  . . Great mimosas, but then again I've never had a bad one ;)  Service is attentive and my coffee was constantly being refilled.  . . I have only had brunch here (three times &amp; counting...) but I'm telling you, it's that crab cake benedict that makes me a happy girl.
