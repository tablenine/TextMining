Pros:  Great food, VERY low prices, great selection. . Cons:  VERY crowded, always has a big line, difficult to get a table. . Great place to get some cheap and tasty food.  Make sure you have some time on your hands though, there's *always* a line, no matter what time of day!. . Their savory items are SO cheap (several things under $1.00!), you may do a double-take the first time you look at your bill!  The sweet stuff is a bit more (around $2.50), but still a lot lower than other places I've seen.. . The selection of the sweet items is virtually endless so one of the biggest challenges is deciding what to get!  It is also the reason people are always seen leaving Portos with massive bags! ;-). . I specially like the fact that they have items that are not super-sweet.. . The selection of sandwiches is good but some of them are a bit dry, such as the chicken and the steak.. . They open really early (6:30 AM) and have a breakfast-only menu (sandwiches), which makes them a great breakfast destination.. . The staff at the counter always has a smile for you, amid all the insanity they face all day.. . Note that they close fairly early, at 7:30 PM
