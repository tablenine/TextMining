This place has some amazing cookies. Huge and dukable, they go well with their fresh-brewed coffee. Everything here is always fresh. The cafe itself can get really crowded at times, but during the warm weather, there's alway plenty of seating outside. And the outside seating really completes the experience -- great food and great views!
