This place was pretty crowded, but they run things very efficiently here. Sui lung bau had really nice thin skin, but the crab version was not that good. Somehow didn't taste fresh -- perhaps canned crab. The normal pork one was decent. Noodle soups are all good. Especially good are the red bean dumpings for dessert. And they're all a pretty good value for money.
