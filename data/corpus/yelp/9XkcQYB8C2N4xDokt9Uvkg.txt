Anyone who has ever seen me eat a sandwich knows all too well that I DESTROY them.  I shake off the lettuce, move around the tomatoes, scrape off the mayo, etc, etc, etc.  Needless to say, I've never been a member of The Clean Plate Club.  That's why my friends were in shock when our waiter took away a completely empty plate that once held the most delicious sandwich I had ever laid eyes on.  What was it, you might ask?  Why, it was the Stuffed Turkey Sandwich, of course!  It's just like the sandwich you would horde the day after Turkeyday- only better!  If it is at all representative of the other comfort foods here at Silver Cloud, I'll be back in a flash to enjoy the laid back atmosphere and the scrumptious food.
