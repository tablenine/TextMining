You won't be getting in by yourself if you're not a hott girl or if you don't have money to bribe any of the doormen. If you don't know anyone who could get on you a guest list, you might be waiting outside along with the other 40 people for god knows how long.... . I was on a guestlist, because I knew one of the promoters. Also because my dress was a hott little number.. . Inside: Indoor dance floor, balconies, fountain, bars, seating, lounge, outdoor mingle area.... . It's a nice place, and you might meet some interesting people, but it wasn't as fantastic as everybody makes it to be. Although, I'd go again. This time, with more money saved up to buy the expensive drinks, or more pre-partying before arriving.. . Good times.
