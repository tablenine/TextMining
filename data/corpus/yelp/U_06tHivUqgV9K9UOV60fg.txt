On the two occasions I have been to Sepia, I was in the lounge for drinks.  The real beauty of Sepia is not evident until you walk past the bar and enter the dining room and take a glimpse of the private dining room.. . I have to admit, my first experience at Sepia was not satisfying.  I ordered the "You're Welcome" which had veev acai, canton ginger,  cassis, and lime.  I thought the taste was too straight and boring. On top of that, they did not have the "Hot Buttered Rum" which I was looking forward to.   I enjoyed the "Dead of Winter" a little more.  The laphroaig rinse added the extra depth I was hoping for.  . . My second experience was much improved.  I tried the "Jalisco Kiss" and "Very Final Word".  The Jalisco Kiss has tequila, hibiscus syrup, and maraschino.  While the Very Final Word has rye, yellow chartreuse, St. Germaine elderflower, lemon juice.  These drinks definitely smoothed over my first impression of Sepia.  . . They also have a great array of tea.  You can ask for a box holding mini vials of tea which you can sniff before ordering.  After you put in your order, they bring out your selection in a tea pot.  The lychee and tagerine teas were excellent, especially at cost of about $3.50.
