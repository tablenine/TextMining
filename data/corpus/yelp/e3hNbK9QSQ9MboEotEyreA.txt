We haven't been to Hide Sushi for a while.  Both Dr. P and I were craving for sushi on a Friday night.  We decided to get takeout to save some money on tips.  We called around 5:30pm and was told that they were too busy and wouldn't be able to do any takeout order until after 7:30pm.  For good sushi, it was worth the wait.  We went to pick up our anticipated dinner promptly at 7:30pm.. . A box of our favorite sushi.  Salmon Sushi just melt in our mouth.  Fresh sea urchin sushi that tasted creamy and sweet.  My absolutely favorite, ankimo sushi!. . Also got the sashimi dinner.  Some yellowtail and tuna sashimi.  Tuna was good, but the yellowtail was even better. The diner also came with rice.. . 4 different sushi rolls.  California Roll Special was made with real crab meat, not those cheap imitation ones.  Yellowtail &amp; Scallion Roll was my favorite.  I don't know how they season the chopped yellowtail.  It just tasted so good.  Spicy Tuna Roll was good as usual.  Love the giant clam in the Catalina Roll.. . Oh and the Salmon Skin Salad was delicious.  Perfect ending of the meal, hot Miso Soup.. . Delicious Friday night sushi dinner!
