Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm going to go with the consensus; Pink's is a tourist trap, the place everyone thinks they should go at least once just so they can say they went.  But you won't catch me waiting in the hot sun over an hour and a half for subpar-at-best hot dog for a second time.. . My guacamole dog was a decent hot dog on a cheap bun drizzled with runny green goo.  I mean, there's only so much you can do with a hot dog, but if you're going to cover it with foreign ingredients in an attempt to create something unique, you could at least use guacamole that's actually made from avocado.... . Same thing with the chili on the chili dog - it looks like something that was squeeze from a tube of caulk.. . And the cheese - oh, don't get me going.  All I'll say is that I'm convinced there were at least 15 test tubes and 0 cows used in the production of that imitation-cheese-food-product.. . Somehow, Pink has brainwashed the residents and visitors of Los Angeles.  But let's be honest with each other: it's not the first time that's happened.
