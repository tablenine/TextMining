Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
My family has been going to this restaurant for over 25 years. It's grown a little larger over the years - but they were smart to keep this place relatively small in size. Â This means that there's almost always a wait, unless you get there right when it opens. . . My personal favorites are the scallop kaiyaki and the collar - both of which aren't sushi. And honestly, I've had better sushi - but for the price, the service and the consistency, this place can't really be beat.
