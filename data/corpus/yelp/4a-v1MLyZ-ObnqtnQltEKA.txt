It's 4/20, it's raining, and I thought I'd go to Wurstkuche for lunch. See what all the hype's about...... Kind of hard to find but it's the triangle corner building with no signs, across the street from zip fusion sushi, on traction and 3rd.. Since it was raining, I thought there would be no line...... and I was right!. I know I should have tried the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage but I decided to ease my way into the exotics with a meat I've eaten before, DUCK &amp; BACON with jalapeño peppers. Pretty darn good but I really couldn't taste the duck that I'm used to. It just taste like a really good mystery sausage! . But my favorite was the BELGIAN FRIES with WHITE TRUFFLE OIL GLAZE! Awesome thick and brown crispy fries that had coarse sea salt and truffle oil that you could really taste! Damn I love truffles!!!!. The sun-dried tomato mayo dipping sauce was very good with the fries.. I washed it all down with a ST. BERNARDUS ABT 12 Belgium Quad (10.5%)!!!! A strong and slow drinking beer that taste extra good on a rainy day. One of the best beers I've ever had, actually.... For dessert, a TOASTED APPLE PIE ICE-CREAM SANDWICH that has oatmeal raisin cookies for the bread and cinnamon apple ice cream.. I can't wait to go back and I know exactly what I want to order next time!. I'll probably get the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage with onions and sauerkraut, the rabbit/veal/pork sausage with sweet peppers, the truffle fries, blue cheese walnut and bacon dipping sauce, and a Schneider Edel Weisse organic hefeweizen.. I haven't been this excited for food in a while!!!
