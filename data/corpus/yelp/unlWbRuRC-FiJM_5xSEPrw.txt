Outside of Peter Luger in NY, this is the best steak i've had.  I had a huge bone-in rib eye cooked medium rare and it was delicious and the side dishes were just as good.  I was there for a birthday party so i probably tried every side dish on the menu.  If you're a steak lover go to Mastro's, you will not regret it.
