Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Absolutely top notch. . . If you are a carnivore, this is THE spot for you. This is my absolute favorite place to eat. The fist time I went, a couple of years ago now, I was impressed by the service and over all atmosphere of the place. It can be crowded, but still feel intimate. Several visits later, I'm still completely satisfied with the experience. . . The food, is amazing. The gauchos take such pride in their menu, I almost feel bad declining when I'm full, or holding out for more pica√±a. . . I love this place, it is the standard to which all other restaurants must live up to. If I'm going to drive north of the 91 freeway, which people who know me know i hate, it's got to be Fogo De Chao caliber or better.. . They are pricey, but if you go for lunch it's a little more reasonable. Parking is valet only, so bring cash (although the one time I didn't, they ran my credit card for a few bucks extra so I could pay and tip the valet). . Are there less expensive churrascarias? Sure, but you get what you pay for, and at Fogo De Chao, you are paying for pure excellence.
