I took my girlfriend here for her birthday after hearing recommendations.  I made reservations for 7PM to watch the sunset and their great view of the city.  When we get there, there were mandatory valet parking of $8 when they only park your car a few yards down.  We were seated in the "Sunset Room", which is known for they beautiful view of the city.  Instead we had the blinding sun in our eyes and a view of a line of parked cars.  . . We ordered the Asian carnitas for an appetizer which was too salty.  My girlfriend had the spicy miso soup which was decent but overpriced at $12.  I ordered the Asian baby back ribs which was dried and too sweet.  It's honestly comparable to the Jack Daniel's ribs at TGIF, which I think TGIF is better and can be had for half the pirce.  My girl ordered the Black cod which was good but heavily priced for what it is.  Our waitress only came by a few times the whole night, granted we were their nearly 2 hours.
