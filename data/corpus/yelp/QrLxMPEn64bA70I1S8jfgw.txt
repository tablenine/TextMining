Except for the beautiful building and their fried mushrooms, there was nothing great about this joint.  I went with my co-workers for lunch yesterday.  The place was packed and loud, which was fun.  . . Our server was polite but slow and a bit arrogant (what is there to be arrogant about salad dressing??).   He tried to give me a lesson on proper Italian cusine - I asked for extra vinegarrete.  He said, "That's not how it's eaten in Italy.". . I ordered bolognese, arugula salad, chicken milanese, and calamari.. My coworkers ordered margarita pizza, calamari and fried mushrooms.  NOTHING worth eating except for the fried mushrooms.  What I ordered came out to $60.  I could've had a better meal at the Olive Garden.  Sad....
