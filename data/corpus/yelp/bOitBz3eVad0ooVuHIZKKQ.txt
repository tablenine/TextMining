ELVIS HAS DEFINITELY LEFT THE BUILDING, AND SO SHOULD YOU!. . Cold and rainy, unusual for Hollywood.  On a late night, ducked in to have a meal.  Just the four of us, family.. . I had such a case of indigestion, both directions....just from the bad sevice.  Why should we pay for such service.  If you don't like what you do, then do something else.. . Even the food is mediocre, I don't need to explain why we ordered what we ordered, it's on the menu.. . And honestly, it has to be something more than the bad service, to make my insides explode.. . BTW, Elvis was a no show.  And you might consider the same.  Enter at your own risk.
