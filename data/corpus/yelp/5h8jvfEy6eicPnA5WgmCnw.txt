Be still, my beating, crab-hungry heart!. . I've been a fan of Thanh Long and Crustacean in SF for a long time now, and their LA cousin is definitely on par. There's this weird trend of neighborhood SF restaurants setting up in Beverly Hills and getting all glitzed out. While I miss the more homey feel of Thanh Long, the food at Crustacean is still amazing. . . Order: crispy rice paper rolls, jumbo prawn wontons, garlic noodles (pre-crab), 0.5 - 1 roast crab per person (Dungeness crab roasted in a garlic butter sauce). . This place is pricey but so worth it.
