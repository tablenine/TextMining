Whenever I'm in LA, I always make it a point to go here. But what more can I say that hasn't been said? Hmmm. I know! I'll review the reviewers. Everybody has the right to express their opinion . . . now it's my turn. . . Fortunately most of the reviewers base their ratings on well documented observations with priorities in check . . . food, service, ambiance and view in that order. Some of these folks have even done some homework and researched this type of Japanese cuisine (which originated out of Mongolia centuries ago). Well done.. . Others base their ratings on how terribly thin the beef is sliced . . . huh? They might even complain about the sauces . . . huh?? This wouldn't be shabu shabu if the meat was thicker, and the ponzu sauce is arguably as good as any you'd find in Japan. I can't believe I just said that, but it's true.. . And for those who bag on the service or method for moving customers through the process . . . these people complain about waiting to be seated and watching others eat. When seated they complain about others watching them eat and feeling rushed. Perhaps it's not ideal for everyone, but unfortunately there aren't enough seats to accommodate the hoards of mouth watering fans all at once. So if you don't think the food is worth the wait, then don't go. That'll shorten the line for me and my koo-koo for shabu shabu friends.. . I would like the interested readers who have never stepped foot on Japanese soil to know that the food here is as authentic as it can be for cheap. If you would like to know the primary differences between this place and shabu shabu restaurants in Japan, I'll be happy to explain. . . 5 Stars for all the customers who got their priorities straight (in favor of the restaurant).
