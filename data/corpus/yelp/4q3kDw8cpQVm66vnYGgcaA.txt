As a meat eater, I must admit I was a little skeptical about eating at a vegan restaurant.  Now I have recommended it to all of my meat eating friends!  I had the Caesar wrap and potato salad and both were fantastic.  My friend laughed when I commented that it was like 'real' potato salad.  The atmosphere is friendly and  service is better than many places.. Overall I highly recommend this place for lunch.  I did not see the dinner menu.
