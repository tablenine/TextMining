I ordered the rio rancho tacos and they were so ehh, not even really worth mentioning here, except to say, don't get it!. . On the other hand, that was the best shrimp and grits I ever tried, and this girl does not touch grits.. It was like a fried block of cheesy goodness under the shrimps and it was pretty mind-blowing.. . The fried chicken was eh, and my other friends really loved the special of the night, a 6oz steak. My friend ordered from the veg menu and said it was amazing.. . Oh yeah, and the margaritas really are good.. . The prices are pretty good for the meal as well. The special was only $19 which is not bad at all.. . I'd go again just for the shrimp and grits, and maybe a margarita. :)
