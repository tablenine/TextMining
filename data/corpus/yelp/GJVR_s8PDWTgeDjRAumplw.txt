Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I'm not as rhapsodically in love with the Apple Pan as so many are (and not a hater either-- you know who you are). I don't go here that often, but when I do, I get exactly what I came for-- a solid burger; crispy, well-cooked fries and coffee that comes with real cream. I've only gotten the pie -- excellent, ice-cold banana cream -- once because after i've put down a steakburger with cheese and a side of fries, it feels like I've eaten a satchel of lead shot. . . I really like the counter staff too-- old-school, efficient, no-nonsense, much like the Apple Pan itself.
