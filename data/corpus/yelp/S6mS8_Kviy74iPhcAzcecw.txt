Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Who would have known that such delicious food can come from such a shitty neighborhood? . . So I get out of my car and double check that my car is locked and the alarm is activated. Then I RUN into friendship Chinese Restaurant. It was like I stepped into some kind of portal that took me to a wonderful place. Then a wall adorned with golden heads of some Buddhist person. Its scary and cool at the same time. We were seated in a timely manner. The lady did not offer us any drinks. Then I remembered reading my friend Nona's review and salivating at the same time. Me being a honey walnut shrimp aficionado and reading a great review on it, I went for it. That was some orgasmic...ewwww...GREAT shrimp. It tasted simple and flavorful without being attacked by MSG or any other additives. I loved it. I wish the portions were bigger for the GIGANTIC prices. . . I will be back to try some more of that wonderful honey walnut shrimp. Maybe my server will do her job and offer me something to drink.
