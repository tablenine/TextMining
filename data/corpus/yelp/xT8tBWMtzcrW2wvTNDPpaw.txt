Top three reasons I make the trek to the South Loop for the Diner:. . 1. The mac and cheese with chunks of ham.  The smooth creaminess of the cheese with the little bit of salt from the ham is a fabulous combination.. . 2. The corned beef hash, which is easily the tastiest meat I have ever had in a hash dish.. . 3. They fly their cheesecake in from Junior's in Brooklyn.  Sweet, sweet Junior's.  How I miss thee.
