First time coming here was with a party of around 10. We all ordered the dinner special which came with a few courses including tender beef cuts and other attractive looking dishes which were all good. We managed to rack up a couple thousand dollars on our tab at the end of the night.. . The second time I came here was completely different. The food didn't taste the same and some of it was cold. One thing that I do like a lot about this place are the great desserts.
