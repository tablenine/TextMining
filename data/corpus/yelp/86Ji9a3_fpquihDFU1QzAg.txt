This is my favorite sushi place ever.  They have the most amazing rolls which are consistently good.  It's a little pricy but worth the money.  The only downside is the noise level upstairs.  The ambiance upstairs is much better than downstairs but it's so loud that it's very difficult to converse with your friends.  If you stick to week nights it's much better.
