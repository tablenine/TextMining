Came here with a group of 8 and we all enjoyed our experience. The southwestern motif is nicely done. Several dishes were ordered and since I wasn't eating meat, unfortunately didn't get to try most. However, I did enjoy the sonoma jack cheese fritters with toasted pecans and mesa verde shrimp "tamale" with sweet yellow corn. Both were very good. For my entree, I ordered the red chile seared diver scallops w/smoked tomato grits. This dish was superb - great blend of spices. I'm not much into "hot spicy" so was very pleased that I was able to enjoy this dish without drinking multiple glasses of water! I also tried the roasted red pepper polenta fries. They were blah, not a side I would order again. I was told the mac and cheese was really good and it looked it, but it had bacon in it so I couldn't indulge. . . Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. . . Will plan to come here again when they open up the outside bar and patio.
