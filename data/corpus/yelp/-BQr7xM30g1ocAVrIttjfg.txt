I have had two trips to Bluepointe. The first one was great fun. I think I was swept up by the trendy surroundings and trendier crowd (it was Tuesday night Martini nights). My friends and I shared a variety of appetizers, entrees and desserts over what seemed like endless peach martinis. It was a lot of fun. . . I'm now a few years older and a few years wiser. I returned this year for a Valentine's date (though we chose to go the day after V-Day). It wasn't quite as posh as I remember. The decor looked a little dated. The tables were so close together that it was uncomfortable. . . The food was still pretty great - we had ahi tuna, I had a peanut crusted grouper that was a bit overpowering, but just right once I knocked off some of the coating, and they felt our entrees were too slow so they brought two free desserts - so that says a lot for the service. . . Overall, it was a yummy meal, but we both felt that we'd have a better time at somewhere a little less uppity where we could have an intimate dinner and some privacy. Â I'm so over Buckhead.
