Ate here last week.. . After some debate on which neighborhood place to go to for dinner, my boyfriend and i read a Yelp review about the prix-fix deal for Thursday nights and, being Thursday, Â we decided to check it out. This wasn't our first visit to Buona Terra, but it had been about two years since we last ate there, and for roughly $22, the prix fix price sounded perfect.. . We called at 5:30 and were able to make a reservation for 7:30 that evening. When we arrived, the host took our names and was able to seat us within about 15 minutes. That might sound like a long wait to some people since we had reservations, but I generally expect to wait up to 15 minutes with a reservation if it's on a busy night (fridays, saturdays or promo nights) and with the obvious popularity of the prix fix arrangement and at prime dinner time hours, it seemed fair enough. . . The prix fix meal give you an option of soup, salad or appetizer as a first course, then your entree, followed by dessert...all for $22. Really one of the best deals in the city.. . My bf and I each ordered a glass of wine and I chose the grilled calamari, while he ordered the baby octopus. Both were nice app-size portions for 1-2 servings and both were grilled to perfection. I had a grilled salmon entree, served with capers and white wine sauce, potatoes and broccoli (this was one of the daily specials). The salmon was the perfect temperature, and while the potatoes could have used a little extra seasoning, this dish tasted great. . . The best part? Dessert. I ordered a chocolate pecan tart topped with fresh berries and my boyfriend had the pistachio ice cream. So, so good.. . The service was prompt, the food was great, the value was worth it and we'll definitely be back sometime soon.
