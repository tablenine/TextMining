If you are visiting Los Angeles or live in Los Angeles and never been here and are near downtown LA, you have to at least stop here for a french dip sliced beef sandwich.  This place is full of history...and their sandwiches have a unique taste.....a taste  I have never tasted anywhere else before.  The benches....the sawdust on the floor...when coffee was 5 cents....you will feel transported back before WWII.......Also having that sandwich with Chinese hot mustard....puts it in a league of its own.
