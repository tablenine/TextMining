Best hamburger place in LA bar none.  The garlic aioli is incredible.  cool atmosphere and prides itself for being "slow fast food".  have a bunch of beer on tap and miller lite pitchers are $10 a lot of times.  Also serve rotisserie chicken which is great with the aioli, as well as a bunch of other  sandwiches.
