What a fun place.  I've been here a couple times and I can honestly say I always enjoy myself here.  The meals are always good and the mojitos are awesome.. . I forget what sangria we ordered.. but I didn't like it at all.  It was orange.. maybe it was passion fruit.  Whatever it was... it was way too sweet.  . . Other than that.. it's great date place/friends night out place.
