Outside of the (sometimes) absurd waiting times, I have always had a good experience with the place.  The menu is decent, and the service has always been good.  There are plenty of TVs to satisfy any fan, and the crowd has never been a problem.  I have eaten here at least 10 times, and would definitely recommend it.
