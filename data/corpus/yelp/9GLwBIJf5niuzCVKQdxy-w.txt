I enjoy going here but it is a little pricey and a little attitude-y.  The first time we ever went, we were at the back bar when the bartender broke a glass and started bleeding profusely...that could have impacted my general opinion.  We also ordered takeout from there and it is always tastes good...the calamari is good but is always sooo much more than I think it should be.  The rolls are ok.  They were popping open the last time we went (they shouldn't) and the half off select makis (dine in only) shows how much they are marking up.  So, will go back, perfectly acceptable sushi, a nice location and ambiance - just have issues with the price and slight attitude.
