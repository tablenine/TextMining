Really great food! I have only had the pleasure of ordering take-out but the restaurant interior looks very warm and welcoming so I hope to dine-in sooner than later, especially now that I find myself craving the Angelotti Zuca (butternut squash ravioli) which is absolutely incredible. You must try it!. . I am so happy this place is located in my hood.
