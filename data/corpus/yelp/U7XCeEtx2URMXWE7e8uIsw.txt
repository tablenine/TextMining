Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I just opened up all my reviews for other Mexican restaurants and dropped them by one star.. . I split a Hollenbeck, two other burritos, and an order of taquitos, and I can't get over how good the meats are.  Tender, delicious, and fresh.  Guacamole made from scratch, fresh vegetables, generous portions, and a lot of attention to flavors.  It's everything you could want in Mexican food.. . The other reviews commenting on the cleanliness aren't an exaggeration, but it doesn't bother me.
