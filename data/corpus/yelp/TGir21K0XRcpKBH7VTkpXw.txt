In short- overrated.. I heard much about this place from different people.  Since I was off today I took a trip over to try it out.. Well, I was disappointed in the food.  I ordered the hot cakes- just pan cakes but with burn taste.  5.50 for the roast beef small sandwich and 6 somthing for the roast lamb sandwich, I'm not sure it's worth the wait.  The beef didnt have much flavor and the lamb has strong taste.  Worst of all, they didn't give me my full order- missing my apple pie!!!  I suppose it's my own fault and maybe I feel cheated over $2 apple pie.  I only suggest you not to keep high hope if u never been there b4. . Friendly staff and own parking lots around the place tho.
