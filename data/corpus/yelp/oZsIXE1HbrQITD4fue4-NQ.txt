Our waiter Chris provided our group with OUTSTANDING SERVICE. This is one of very few places that offered our group a separate food/drink check for each person in our party -- that deserves 10 stars. . . This is one of a very few places that offered our group a separate food/drink check for each person in our party. Yard House didn't allow us to put our name down to be seated although we arrive one hour prior to our meetup time. Since our group came for an early dinner (5pm), we were seated within minutes at a booth that could seat up to 10 people. The restaurant also serves as a bar so the background music made it somewhat difficult to hear if another person was carrying on a conversation at the other end of the table. There are several flat screen TVs showing sports throughout.. . Again, Chris was very courteous, indulged our requests for separate checks which made mine and another guest's tasks so much easier since we didn't have to keep track of what everyone ordered, we were able to enjoy the group's company
