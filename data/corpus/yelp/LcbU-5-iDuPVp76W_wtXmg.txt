Excellent chai.  I've only eaten a few things here, but just about anything on the breakfast menu is good (except pancakes.  If you neeeeeed pancakes, you can find better ones elsewhere).  If you get a sandwich, ask for the bread sliced thin or else you'll get 2 inches of bread... on each slice.  The smoothies are awesome, all real fresh fruit.  Long lines at peak hours, but by the time you order your food, a table is usually available.
