This was my second foray to Adobo (the first was at the Division location), and enjoyed myself both times.  The guacamole lives up to what everyone says about it, it is quite good.  This most recent time was for more of a drinks/snack type of outing.  I had their margarita and the empanada appetizer, along with some shared cerviche.  Everything tasted quite good, but was on the pricey side.
