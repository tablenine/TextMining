The wife and I drove past Oinksters while heading to a Yelp event. We saw this huge crowd and decided that we just had to give it a try. . . I've seen a ton of reviews on this place before so I was pretty excited about trying their food. We had the Oinkster Pastrami, BBQ pulled pork sandwich, and fries. . . I gotta say, the pastrami was one of the best ive had in a long time. I was skeptical about the red cabbage but it worked. So juicy, lean yet had enough fat to make my lips glisten. Mmmm, lard on lips.... . The pull pork wasn't that great. Sure it was tender, but the flavor was lacking. There was nothing BBQ about it.. . The fries were just pure awesomeness. I didnt like the aoili sauce much though. I rather just have straight up garlic fries. Prices are higher than normal but shoot, if i had a crowd like that everyday, I'd stick it to them too. . . Just like Pink's in LA, check it out, wait in line, try the food, say you've been there.
