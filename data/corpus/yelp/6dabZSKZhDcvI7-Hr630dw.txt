is it worth the wait?....in my opinion...that's a negative...a no....it's okay beef shabu-shabu (thin slices of beef and veggies dipped into boiling water and eaten with a sauce)...it's decent....but when i see a line going out the door..and people standing around to get in to this little establishment....i rather just walk on over for some curry, ramen or bento in the near by eateries surrounding the area....
