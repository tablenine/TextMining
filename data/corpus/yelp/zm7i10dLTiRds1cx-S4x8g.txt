I am only a fan of Cafe Selmarie's lemon bars.  It perfectly decadent, lemon-y, sweet, a good-portioned size bar that is powdered with powdered sugar.  It is a little pricey, but I always make it my mission to get at least 4-6 pieces to go.  I love it, and I haven't tasted great lemon bars like these anywhere else.  Yum!
