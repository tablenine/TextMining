Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
I went for a dinner here recently for a colleague's birthday and had a great time. There weren't too many vegetarian options for me, but whatever I ate - yuca, plantians, rice and beans - was damn tasty. I loved the ambience and even talked to the owner later about his love for Cuban home cooking and street food. My favorite thing about Las Palmeras is that it is located inside a residential neighborhood in Midtown. Epic win.
