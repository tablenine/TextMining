Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
I live right around the corner from El Cid and end up here a few times a month. Everything (food, service, atmosphere) is good, nearly great. Service is a little slow once in a while, but nothing to freak out about. My favorite part of El Cid is during the summer months when the back patio is open and they have the mariacci band out there (I think they're there only a few times a week). Warm night, margarita in hand, band playing, and all the lights up around you and it almost feels like you're deep in Mexico. Awesome.
