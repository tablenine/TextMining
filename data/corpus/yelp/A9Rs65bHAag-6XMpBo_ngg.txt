Category: Pizza
The buttercrust is totally necessary.  Keep the pizza simple ... with a pound of cheese a lot of toppings can be overpowering.  And, for God's sake, order the chocolate chip cookie pizza.  I dream of this cookie (and I don't really like desserts)...when I eat it, I feel like I'm in one of those many commercials that show an oooey gooey irresistible cookie.. . I like this place for out of town guests and evening with friends...its off the beaten path in the quiet part of river north but still not far from the center of transit and tourists.
