Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Checked out Pink's on Saturday night around 9:30pm and the line was freakin long!  I figured that was a good sign, it must be decent.. . While standing in line, we grabbed a menu and started looking.  I didn't realize I had such a hard time deciding what kind of hot dog to order.  I figured it can't be that hard, it's just a hot dog!. . Ended up ordering the "Mullholland Drive" (10" w/grilled mushrooms, onions, bacon, nacho cheese and I'm sure I'm missing another ingredient).  That was about $6.  Also ordered a Chicago Polish Dog (I think that's what it was called?)  which was your standard PD w/mustard, ketchup, relish, lettuce and tomatoes.  That was about $4.  I forgot what my friend ordered but, I took a pic of all three.. . I gotta say, they were pretty decent tasting dogs!  Definitely a change from my usual $1.50 Costco Polish Dog.  But mmm...I loved that bacon and nacho cheese on the Mullholland Drive dog!. . Three dogs, two sodas came out to $15.  Not bad for a Saturday night dinner!. . I'm looking forward to going back and taking the s/o there on our next roadtrip to SoCal!. . NOTE:  It's CASH ONLY.  But, if you don't have any cash on you, the Chevron on the corner has an ATM...yes, we learned the hard way...had to give up our place in line dammit! :D. . PS:  I gotta say, I was impressed...this is the first hot dog stand, or I should say, the first fast food to offer "valet parking!"  Well, technically...ya gotta check it out on a (weekend) night to see what I mean! ;)
