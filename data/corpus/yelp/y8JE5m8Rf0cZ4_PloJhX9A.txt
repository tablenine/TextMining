We went here on a Monday evening at around 6:30pm and it was so crowded! Had to wait about 40 minutes for a table. We just took this to mean that it must be good and stuck around... . It did not disappoint. We shared a ramen combo and got the teriyaki eel bowl along with some pork cutlets. I loved the preparation of the eel, and my bf loved the pork cutlets and the salad. it's such a good deal! We got all of that (minus the cutlets) for $12.50 and it was more than enough to fill up the both of us.. . I found the ramen broth a tad salty (so of course the bf loved it) but it was still not bad at all. I do wish they would let us flavor the broth a little more ourselves, but they don't have very many options at the table (only a spicy red pepper shaker if I recall). . At least there are some cute stores nearby to keep you busy while you wait, like the anime place!
