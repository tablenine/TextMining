I almost couldn't walk out of here. We went in for a smallish dinner and ended up ordering  waaay too much....and then finished every bite. . . We were greeted by what I assumed to be the owner at the door. He then gave us a rundown on everything Guy Fierri ate when he was there on DDD. After about ten minutes of this, he let us place our order as my wife whispered  "I have no idea what he just said to us." . . We ordered two cemitas, carne asada and the al pasor. I'd go with the carne asada. We also had the taco arabe which was quite tasty. . . Oh, and how do you make a quesadilla even worse for you? Fill it with chicharon. How could we not give these a try? The cheese on all the dishes was actually really good. . . We washed it down with horchata and aqua de jamaica. I honestly can't remember when I was that full..
