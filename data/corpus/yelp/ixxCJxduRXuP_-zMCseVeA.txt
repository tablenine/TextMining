Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
I I had originally given Lala's 4 stars but have dropped it to three. I am a chicken fan and I am sure they just grill their chicken and then put some sauce on top. Lately it has been super bland and the only taste is the sauce, plus somewhat dry. The meal is served less than 10 minutes after you order so it doesn't feel like it is being cooked for you. I like to have a second drink with my meal, and take my time enjoying my night but the meal being pushed out makes it feel rushed. . Overall, I feel the food is going down.
