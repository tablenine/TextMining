Went here on Saturday night for dinner and I was impressed with the variety of food that they have here.  Everyone at my table was happy with their food.  I had the fish sandwich, my friend Nora had the chicken sandwich, and our men had burgers...we were all satisfied.. . Their entrees look as though they are a bit overpriced, but the sandwiches were only $8/9.  They have great sides that come with the sandwiches...I had the roasted veggies which had squash and zucchini in it; different from what I was expecting.  Garlic taters were a little bland and the cabbage and goat cheese side was very different than expected.  Adam was looking for something like a cole slaw and it was a little soggier than that.. . Banana cream pie for dessert was good and there was enough for a couple of people (although my fiance thinks there wasn't enough, he often thinks that when it comes to dessert!).  . . Decent wine list, good beer choices, great service, and nice decor.  I don't think I will go to Logan Square just to go to this place, but if I am in the hood again I might try it again.
