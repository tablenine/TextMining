Mitch Mitch Mitch . . . . what can you say? amazing food, incredible conversation . . . too packed on a weekend now that everyone's discovered sushi (has anyone else noticed that? it's like the year of the dog, the year of the horse - oh wait 2006 is the year of the raw fish!) - but this is the best, freshest sushi around. And with Mitch behind the sushi counter nothing could be better.
