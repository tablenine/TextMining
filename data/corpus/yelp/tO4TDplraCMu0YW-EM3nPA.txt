I was spoiled with good pho joints in Minneapolis, and when I came to Chicago It took me a while to find a place where I wasn't completely grossed out.  I found this place, and it's the only one I will eat at anymore.  The pho is decent and the spring rolls are fine.   It is unique in the fact the servers wear camo shirts and bump hip-hop, but I just roll with it and eat my better than average pho.
