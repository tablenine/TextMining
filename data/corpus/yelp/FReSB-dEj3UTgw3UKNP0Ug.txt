I have to agree with previous commenters: the patio view of the Atlanta skyline is fantastic and makes up for the above-average food.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good.  But I wasn't blown away.  Still, the price was fair for a sit down dinner.. . If you're in the mood for some seafood on a cool evening, I'd highly suggest dining upstairs at Six Feet Under.
