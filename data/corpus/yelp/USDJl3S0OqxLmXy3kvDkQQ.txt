I have walked by this place so many times and thought it looked interesting I recently stopped by when my friend was visiting from Spain. We chose the restaurant/menu on the first floor. Since we were there for lunch we both enjoyed a half portion of pasta and it was more than enough (and almost half the price!). . . My friend really enjoyed the atmosphere and was pleasantly surprised when both the server and host spoke Spanish (she speaks fluent English, but has spent the last two years in Spain and was happy to rely on her native language). Overall the food was great and very well-priced for the area. Perfect portions!
