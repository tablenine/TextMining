Wow, reading my review from two years ago is like looking in a mirror since my feelings for this place are totally different.  . . The soup: Very good this time.  It doesn't have a WOW factor but it definitely tasted like broth and not MSG water.  It's very good.  . . The noodles: Good.. . The pork: Bits of the pork were very, very good.  I think the pieces I received were much fattier than last time and that made all the difference.  The pork here is second only to Santouka.  . . The egg: Here's where the big difference is.  I received a semi-soft boiled egg of golden orange perfection.  It really is quite the difference maker.  My original bowl must have gotten screwed up but this egg definitely makes the bowl completely unique and completely worth tasting.  . . The fried rice: Average - will never order this again.  Rice was soggy.  . . All in all, my opinion has changed.  I see why there's a line.  It's just a plain good bowl of ramen.
