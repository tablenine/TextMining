Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
who: porto's bakery . . what: CHEESE ROLLS!. . where: burbank location- only visited once, and it was packed, long lines but there's a reason. i liked the decor and set up. and everyone eating there had good looking food on their tables.. . when: latest fix-home delivery courtesy of my dear cousin on 02.28.09, travel from burbank to san diego, still tasty.. and even a day old, they're still tasty.. . why: i've only had the cheese rolls. actually i think i tasted one guava roll once too, which was heaven as well. but have to thank the sis-in-law who introduced them to us, whenever boxes of cheese rolls are brought to family parties down here in SD, a box gets hidden inside away from the crowd. so they have to be that good, since i am the sharing is caring type of person.. . how: next time i head up to the LA area, i'll definitely have to get a meal and dine-in to try the potato balls &amp; other items. and pick up my pre-order boxes of cheese rolls to share with folks back home or stocked for consumption at home.
