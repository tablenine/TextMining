What else is there to add after 555 reviews? Well, I gotta just say that after trying the duck, bacon, and jalapeno sausage and the buffalo sausage ... the definite winner was the buffalo. Give that a try, you won't be disappointed. It's smoky with a hint of spicy. Pair that with the cider and it is a perfect match. The atmosphere is modern and casual. DJ spinning music all night and people co-mingling on large family style table.  Great time!
