I went here last night with a few friends. The setting was warm and inviting as was the staff. . . They started us off right away with bread and we had a pate going around as well that was very good. We also had a cesare salad with the sauce having a strong anchovy kick to it. I had the brisket for the entree and was also able to taste one of their lamb sausages. The brisket was excellent and very tender. The lamb sausage was delicious and was a bit spicy. We then had an assortment of bread puddings and brownies for dessert. I had some of a brownie that was awesome. . It was a real great time and I will certainly go back again
