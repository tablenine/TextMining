Category: Tapas Bars
Dear all LA places aspiring to be more than they really are,. . Do not format your menu with tapas unless you can pull it off even half as well as Cobras.  Reason they do so is because tapas are true to Spanish cuisine.  Grab a bottle of wine next door and enjoy your time there.
