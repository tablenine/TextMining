Restaurant: Bacchanalia
Category: American (New)
How do you give 1/2 stars on yelp???? I say Bacchanalia is a 41/2.  It's fine dining, but not mouth-watering, knock me off my chair amazing.  Although the dessert "gifts" from the chef could be considered that.  I can't remember what I had, but I do know I ordered stuff I never thought I'd eat -and liked.  Don't be disappointed with the small portions, the artistry in the display is worth it.  And I found myself eating slower, and thus getting surprisingly full.  The service, of course, is stellar. I  am surprised, though, that  they didn't offer me a black linen napkin instead of the white one.  Even Seasons 52 does that.  I was wearing a black dress, so you would think it was automatic. Attention to detail, people.  I've also never seen a fine-dining restaurant with a gift shop and the Abbattour ( I call it a butcher shop.)  I am all for supporting local foods, wines, and products, but it takes away from the elegance.
