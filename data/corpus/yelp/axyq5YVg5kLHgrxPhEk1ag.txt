This is my favorite restaurant. . . Stuff i order here consists of Sausage Rice, Oyster Pancake, Chicken Leg Rice, and of course the shaved ice. . . Everything is so good, maybe cause I love Taiwanese food. I highly recommend it to anybody, but go during the week, when there's less people. Friday night... busy busy
