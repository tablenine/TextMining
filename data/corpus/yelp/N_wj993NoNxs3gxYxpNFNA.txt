GARLIC NOODLES &amp; CRAB...are the MUST HAVES!   . . I've learned to replicate the dungeness crab recipe so my jew ass will never pay $38+ for it again unless I'm with some good company  but the secret to the noodles is that the garlic is made within the noodle itself.   Oops the secrets out!    . . Ambiance is nice but decor is getting tired...We only dine there on weekdays so we always end up sitting next to A-list celebrities which is pretty cool I guess.  Btw, if you are on a budget, save this place for a special occasion.  I'm stupid rich so I go whenever I want.  haha j/k. . With regards to the service other reviewers are getting...the servers make a killing with their tips so their fangs are out for big spenders...
