The food here is great.  I've been on sort of a Thai food binge including a Thai temple and a Thai vegetarian restaurant.  If I were raised Thai, I think I would have enjoyed the food more.  Their idea of "medium" incapacitated my taste buds for brief periods.  Sips of their tasty Thai iced coffee between bites temporarily fixed that.  I had the curry noodles.  The coconut curry broth the noodles were bathing in was super tasty and spicy to boot.  The stewed beef was a bit on the tough side, but flavor made me forget that issue.  The Tom Yum soup broth was delicious and they were pretty generous with the various seafood.  The glass noodles were incredibly tasty.  Being Filipino, I really enjoyed the citrus flavor, which reminded me of mom's pancit.  I think the Pad see ew and Larb were good, but my tongue wasn't responding at the time.  The papaya salad was just as good as what I had at the Thai temple, complete with blue crab (I'm really drooling now as I type this).. . The only thing, besides my inability to consume molten lava, that I can think of as a negative is the parking.  Valet-only, three bucks to have them drive my car 5 feet?  But to think of it, they have no control over those things, so kudos to Ruen Pair for being worth it.  Oh!  Don't forget to go across the parking lot and pick up some yummy Thai baked goods before you leave!. . When you visit, just make sure that if you don't have a tongue made of Asbestos, order MILD!  You'll thank me.... You're welcome.
