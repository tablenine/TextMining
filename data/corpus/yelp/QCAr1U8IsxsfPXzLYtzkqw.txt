wowzers.  i love this place.  the bf and a friend were in town and wanted to out for some yummy dining.  they'd heard about this spot, so we decided to make a go for it.  we were able to get reservations for later on that night...it was a monday and the earliest we could score reservations was at 9:30pm.  we were a bit early, but they seated us right on time.  . . the place was paaacked.  we talked w/ the servers and they said it's like that every night.  so amazing.  there were four of us, so we decided to do our regular thing and order almost everything.  we were able to split everything so it was all good.  we didn't order everything, but we did get a good amount.. . a few that really stuck out were the ravioli, which had an egg cooked into it.  the tagliatta was also really good.  the burrata w/ bacon was also super tasty.  we also got the tripe, octopus, trotters, little gem, sweetbreads and the burri artichoke.  i'm not the biggest experimenter, but the octopus and the sweetbreads were really really good.  flavors were delicious.  . . it was definitely a good amount of food.  we had a couple cocktails...i got the sugar plum.  it was a good...a bit sweet, but good.  everything came out w/ perfect timing.  nothing was overcooked...had good flavors that popped.  nothing was too much.  i also liked the selection of breads that they offer.  the place definitely had their shit down.  plus...the boys really liked it and they're pretty hardcore.  . . we finished off our meal w/ the pumpkin torta, the bombolini and some coffees.  definitely really great food.  i'm interested to try the pizzeria and to-go spot just to see what it's like.. . i definitely think this is a great place to go if you're looking for something special and tasty.  it is on the pricey side, so make sure you like who you're going with.
