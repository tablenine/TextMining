Old fashioned atmosphere. Great selection of foods. The gnocci and lamb shank were good as well as the rabbit, for something a bit unusual for LA. The wines are very good. The service is somewhat quick for being busy. Nice place to check out even once. However, if you are not a fan of garlic, this is not your place. Everything I've tried here has been very good. And I love me some garlic. Their prices are moderate as well so it won't break the bank. They do a very nice job incorporating garlic into most of their dishes and the wine selection is pretty decent.
