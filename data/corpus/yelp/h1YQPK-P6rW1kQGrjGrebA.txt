Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Overall, I felt really comfortable at Parker's.  The decor was lovely, the hostess was friendly, we were seated quickly, and our food arrived right when I wanted it.  The Black Truffle Mac and Cheese made a lasting impression on me, more so than the Sesame-seared Tuna, which was still very good.  My dinner companion was pleased with his steak.  I appreciated having one of the owners check in on us.  I do think our server hovered just a little too much, but I would prefer that to having to track someone down.
