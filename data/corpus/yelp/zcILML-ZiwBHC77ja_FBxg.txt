Delicious inexpensive meal.  Though the Roasted Garlic Chicken is the most popular dish and certainly a good one, my favorite is the Oxtail Stew...#14 on the menu! Always tender and comes with plantaines, black beans(!) and rice. Meals come with garlic bread.  Sangria is on the menu as well. YUM! . . Note: If you order the Roasted Garlic Chicken for the first time, make sure you love garlic, onions and tangy sauce.  I'd say... to play it safe, get the sauce on the side just in case it's too strong for you and you'd rather have less garlic breath. . . Prepare yourself for a big heavy meal or getting a doggy bag.  The portions are huge!
