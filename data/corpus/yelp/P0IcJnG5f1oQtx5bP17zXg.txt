Ambience is a four and "old-schoolness" is a 4/5. burger was a 4/4.5 fries 2.5/3, appetizers 2.5 (just ordinary). . Basically, Its one of those places you just should go to.  The burger was great....had a couple beers too.  Nibbled on the other stuff, couldnt get a four in my book.  But let me put it this way, I am going back again and eating a burger again.  debating whether to make it a four just to make sure out-of-towners like me go there...we will see.. . didnt have the steak which i guess would be a big factor for a steakhouse.
