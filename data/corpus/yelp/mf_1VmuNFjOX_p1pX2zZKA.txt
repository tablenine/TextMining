Incredible staff, wonderful food, and BYOB!  what more could you want?  My husband I started eating here a few years ago and at that time you could show up and get a table anytime.  Now, make sure you call ahead!  But it is well worth the wait--and the staff makes you feel very comfortable trying new things as they'll explain in detail what each dish is.. . Don't mix this up with Indian food--many of the spices are the same, but milder flavors.
