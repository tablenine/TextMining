Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. This place makes me happy. Great margaritas, and the tacos are just out of this world. I love that you can just order a bunch of them and they're reasonably priced so when you're hungry you don't need to order 2 meals. And you should go hungry, cause you'll want to try all their different types. Which is a really cool thing about this place- they don't just do traditional tacos, they play around with different flavors. Also, they have an appetizer which offers 3 different salsas/dipping sauces and all 3 are very tasty.
