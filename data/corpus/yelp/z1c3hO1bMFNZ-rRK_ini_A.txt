(This review is for the Little 5 Points location at Moreland). . Let's not get it twisted; the pizzas at Savage Pizza are excellent and better than most other so-called "experts" in town but one thing that sets Savage Pizza apart is the awesome atmostphere and decor.  All the walls are adorned with silver and modern age comics pages and covers (even the bathroom walls or at least the men's room walls).  There are action figures and statues all over the restaurant that'll keep the geeks and fanboys and fangirls hyped till the delish pizzas (and other goodies get there).  The pizzas are the real stars, though.  You have plenty of sauces to choose from such as red tomato sauce, garlic tomato sauce, garlic white sauce, salsa fresca with cilantro, red wine marinara, and spicy red pepper sauce.  I know the pizza snobs don't like these innovations and they can go and ...well, to each their own, I guess :)  I'm not even going to talk about the toppings except to say that there are 3 differently priced categories for a grand total of about 45 options!. . Highly recommended!
