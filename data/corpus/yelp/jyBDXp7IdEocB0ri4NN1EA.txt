A hipster biergarten. I'm not sure how you say 'ugh' in German, but Oy Vey comes close. On the very bright side I had a pretty terrific hot Italian sausage and some very good fries. I wasn't so fond of the dipping sauces - just give me some malt vinegar. Good selection of tap and bottled brews. Loved my Chimay white. So the food and beer are good, but the crowd is just... well... you know... phoney. I sound like Holden Caufield suddenly, but seriously everybody seemed like a faux artist, a faux bohemian... in other words...phonies. The place was OK though, the staff was really nice and maybe in time when there's some good ol' grit and grime on the floor and real folks hanging out it'll get better. It has potential.. . Wheelchair access: Excellent. Easy in, good bathroom and communal tables provide good seating for a chair at the ends.
