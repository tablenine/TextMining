At $2 a taco and 5$ a burrito.  . The spicy pork taco is my fave.  (aka dehji bulgogi taco) its not spicy but the most flavorful out of the bunch.. . The galbi taco is kinda bland.  I think it needs to be marinated for longer because you can barely taste the flavor.  I like my galbi on the sweet side.  . . The chicken taco was ok, nothing special.  . And the tofu taco was good for tofu.  . . the tacos come garnished with romaine, julienned napa cabbage, onions, green onions on corn tortilla.  They have sriracha, hot sauce, and kimchi stationed where u order and pick up food.  . . They should have shik hae.  which would be the ideal drink to wash down your korean taco. . They use Styrofoam which is a bad thing.
