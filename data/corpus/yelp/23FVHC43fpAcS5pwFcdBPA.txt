Charming, loud, and good for a solid dining experience. Although I enjoy the diversity of the menu and they do have quite an array of interesting options nothing about the food really jumped out at me. . . But, given the locations proximity to relevent DT spots, and the amount of energy that results from having a busy resturant with no carpeting and thus nothing to dampen the sounds of conversations it really feels alive. It definitely brought back memories of a little pizza joint in naples - that alone makes it for me.
