I've been meaning to try this place for a while, and I was not disappointed.  I went for lunch and got the chicken sandwich, which was pretty damn good.  But of course the best part... ice cream!  They have home-made ice cream sandwiches, ice cream bars and of course, plain old ice cream cones.  They also have a nice looking selection of cakes and cookies if you are less lactose inclined.  I got the strawberry shortcake ice cream bar and it was deeee-lish.  . . The prices were a bit high, but probably worth it.  I must say though, it will never replace Diddy Riese in my heart.
