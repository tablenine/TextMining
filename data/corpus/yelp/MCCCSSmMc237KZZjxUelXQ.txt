Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Not my kind of steak place. Ideal for family dinners and maybe a big group function, but definitley not for dates or corporate dinners. Upon entering the restaurant, I feel like I've gone back in time - at least two decades. The waitresses throw me off with the maid uniforms and the carving stations make me think of Vegas buffets. . . This place must have some great history to always be so popular, but I am definitely not feeling it one bit. I'd rather go down the street and try out some other restaurants off La Cienega.
