I stopped going to this place several months ago.  It wasn't the food, the food is awesome; rather the service.  I used to eat here once a week with my coworkers.  One day the asian lady working the counter thought it would be wise to train a new employee how to work the register during the lunch hour.  (Note to restuarant owners:  don't train your new employees during the lunch hour.  It's the busiest time and a lot of your customers are probably on their lunch break from work and therefore don't have unlimited time.)  We waited in line for 15-minutes before they took our order (we were only 3rd in line).  Then we waited another 20-minutes for our food and it still hadn't arrived.  I went to the counter to make our order "To Go" as we usually only take an hour for lunch (plus the outside street parking is only 30-minutes).  Well, after 10 more minutes of waiting we just left.  We didn't ask for a refund becuase god only knows how long that would have taken.  I hope the asian lady kept the money and uses it to get an education because the restuarant business / customer service is truly not her calling.  I should say that the usual Asst. Mgr (guy who wears glasses) wasn't there to stop the nonsense.. . So after a 4-month boycott I decide to give it another try.  The same lady took our order.. . Truly great food, but never again.
