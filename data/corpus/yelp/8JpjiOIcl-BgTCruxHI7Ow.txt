Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Coal Fire is a fairly new pizza place tucked in behind my neighborhood in Riverwest.  It's BYOB, which I happen to love.  My first experience there went something like this.  Wasn't aware prior to going in, but they had been publicized on the radio all day, so it was fairly crowded.  It's a small place anyway, with a limited amount of seating.  So, we were stuck waiting about half an hour.  My only real gripe was that there was no one to take names, and it seemed very disorganized.  I was starving, so I was in no mood to argue over who got the next table.  Eventually someone did come take our name, and we cracked open a few brews while we waited.  There isn't a large waiting area, so people were spilled out the door and onto the sidewalk waiting.  The pizza made it all worthwhile.  You can choose from a nice list of pizzas with various ingredients, or just build your own.  It's more expensive to build your own.  Pizza was absolutely delicious.  It's super thin crust, made fresh in a coal burning oven.  I think.  Anyway, it's really good if you are into super fresh ingredients and super thin crust.  I look forward to another visit soon.  Very cool place.
