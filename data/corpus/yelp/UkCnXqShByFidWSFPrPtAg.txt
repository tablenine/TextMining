After a long period of Devon's withdrawal.  The girls and I decided to pay them a friendly visit last night.  There were several new appetizers on the happy hour specials since our last visit and we decided to order one of each on the menu.  Yes, the six of us girls ate all of the following!. . MUSSELS *  Tonight we tried the mussels with white wine and garlic.  Not bad but I like the scampi style garlic cream (red sauce) much better.  I didn't see it on the menu so I hope it's not discontinued. . SHRIMP SCAMPI * The portion size isn't very big.  A total of 5 jumbo shrimps but they were quite tasty with garlic butter.. CALAMARI *  The calamari has yet to disappoint me here.  I especially love the fried jalapeños in the mix.. GOAT CHEESE BRUSCHETTA * I'm glad we sampled but I probably won't order again.. TUNA TARTARE * I'm a tuna lover.  What can I say? I thoroughly enjoyed the tartare.. CRAB CAKES * I usually like the crab cakes here.  Tonight for some reason, it didn't deliver.. DUCKTRAP SMOKED SALMON * The salmon was alright.  Nothing to rave about.. OYSTERS * Yum, very good.. CHEESEBURGER * I was a tab bit surprised cheeseburger is on a seafood restaurant's menu. Cheeseburgers all taste the same to me.  It does come on a different type of breading similar to focaccia.. LOBSTER * The lobster was scrumptious!!. . The Key Lime Martini used to be our unanimous choice for the best martini at Devon's.  Last night the martinis were too strong and a few of us had even specifically requested to be light on the liquor.  Overall though, we still had a great time!
