I'm sorry Manuel's, I know below I said you were my new favorite place because of your abundance of Ketchup-but Alon's has taken your place. We came here for lunch today and it was perfect! Once you walk inside you feel like you're in a little french bakery with cakes and desserts, sandwiches and salads made fresh for you, and plenty of food to-go. I ordered a pan-ini with mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, arugala, and balsamic. It was the perfect combination and hit the spot. With my sandwich I got salt and vinegar Dirty Chips, which although it may be debate-able, are the best chips around. I took a walk around after and looked at all the amazing desserts and their awesome wine assortment. I can't wait to return to Alon's-this may become a Saturday afternoon tradition.
