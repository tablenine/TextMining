Restaurant: Parish
Category: Cajun/Creole
Went to Parish for the first time a few days ago and overall was very impressed with the food/atmosphere/service. I had the stuffed catfish which was amazing and my date had the Pork Shank which was perfectly cooked.  We had the sweet potatoe banana nut cake for dessert.  I am not normally a sweets kind of guy but this is to die for. The designers did a very good job with keeping some of the original decor of the house while at the same time converting it into a traditional New Orleans style restaurant.  . . The downstairs market/bar/coffee area was a very good touch giving clients the ability to either eat dinner in the dining room and/or shop the market downstairs while having a beer or coffee.
