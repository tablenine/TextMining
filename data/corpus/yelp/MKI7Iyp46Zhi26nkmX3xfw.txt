Wow, we came on a Saturday and man, we waited a LONG time... seriously... I got here early expecting there to be quite a wait, so since my dad hates waiting, I decided to brave it myself, it was after all my father's birthday we were celebrating..Well, after my parents and sister and brother arrived, we continued to wait another 2 HRS!!. . The food is good, messy so never come dressed to the nines!  Come early if you don't want to wait, but those craw daddies are sure good and tasty.  My husband and brother in law absolutely LOVES these!!. . It's a bit small and cramped but fun and lively in the evenings!
