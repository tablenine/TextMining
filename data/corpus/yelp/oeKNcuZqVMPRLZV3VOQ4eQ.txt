Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
OROCHON! The name alone gets one star. Try saying that loud over and over down little tokyo. Â YES I AM A DORK . . Ramen was good, not fabulous but good enough to make me want to go back. I ordered the hyper level with extra green onions. The bamboo plate was good and so was the fried rice. It was more of a fun place. OH and they have Kirin on TAP!!! ALWAYS AlWAYS A PLUS!!! An extra star for having reasonable prices. . P.S i didn't take the number 2 challenge but my bowl was spicy.
