First of all, this review was suppose to be for Ann's Snack Bar.  Screw you Ann for not being open the day after the fourth!  I waited MONTHS to go to your legendary place and waited an hour before it's open AND YOU WERE F*CKIN CLOSED!  Grrrrrrr!!!. . Ok, Since plan A was out of the option.  Thank goodness my friend recommended plan B - Vortex since I totally forgot to try that place.  It was in the area so a quick drive from *clears throat * Ann's Snack Bar, headed over to Vortex immediately. . Was still early in the day, immediately sat down.  What gets you bout this place is the uniqueness, the decor and humor.  A big @$$ skull on the face of the building.  The people are cool (staff and customers).  Of course it's in little five points so it fits the area.  The menu is hilarious, you got to read it!. . I ordered the Blue cheese burger (added swiss).  I was intimidated by other's burgers people were ordering and delivered.  I ordered a big @$$ cup of lemonade, you going to need every drop to follow every bite.  . . My burger came out, it was huge. Immediately removed the onions (no business being on anyone's burgers).  slapped some a1 sauce but literally had to cut that suckah in half.  This burger is too big.  The fries are pretty good.  To give that a comparison's come closes to fries from Wendy's.  My friend had the tater tots.  Looks and tastes like my high school tater tots.  . . The waiter was pretty cool, serviceable.  I'm not a fan of smoking so you have to man up (woman up) because of the environment but i respect the vortex's hustle.  . . Top 3 burger spot in the Atlanta. . Overall grade: A- (because of smoking)
