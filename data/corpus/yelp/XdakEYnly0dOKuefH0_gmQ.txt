Went here last summer and got everything to-go.  Not worth waiting hours to get seated, plus it's more comfortable for me to get down n dirty  with my crawfish at home!!  Anyway the sha-bang seasoning is great and so is the garlic butter.  The crawfish is great, the shrimp is okay.  This place is comparable to Hot N Juicy Crawfish in Vegas if you've been there.  Go and try this place, you won't be disappointed.
