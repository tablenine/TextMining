Best burger in Los Angeles?  Maybe.  Pretty damn good burger?  Definitely.. . People may whine about the hype, but come on, it's a freakin' great burger.  If you don't like the burgers, you're either a complete snob or one of those people who doesn't like to enjoy what everyone else likes, just to be a jerk.. . It's a total classic place.  I'm not sure anything on the inside has changed in the last 40 years or so.  Even the cash register looks like a museum piece.  It's just a cool, old place to eat.. . And for people bitching about them being pushy in making you order ... there's only like 5 things on the menu.  If you're that indecisive, I don't know how you ever get through menus at a regular restaurant.  The waiters weren't pushy with me and my girl.  We sat and talked and ate, and it was a busy lunch hour.  We weren't slow pokin' it or anything, but we weren't being harassed either.  And I'll say about the service, it's quick as hell.  You order and before you know it, the waiter slams it down in front of you.. . You might have to wait to get a seat when it's busy, but it's no different than waiting in line at Titos or any other great LA haunt.. . The steak burger is really good, but the hickory burger is where it's at.  Don't forget to order the apple pie.  You have no excuse to not order it ... unless you're allergic.  If you're allergic, order it anyways.  You'll go to the hospital with a smile on your face.
