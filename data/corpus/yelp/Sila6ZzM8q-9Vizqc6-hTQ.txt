Category: French
The French-Japanese cuisine, at Maison Akira, is established and well known in the neighborhood (LA - Pasadena) I've been here once before (a year ago) for the Chef's dinner menu.  The dinner menu is quite nice and well balanced.  The interior felt like I was transported to a comfortable French home.  The food was delightful.  . . I just went there again for lunch today, I found the lunch to be a little below my standards compared to my dinner experience.  I was served a Lobster Bisque (light and creamy, not too demanding on the palette, but finished with just enough lobster aroma to make you want another serving), Steamed egg with mushrom (average), The Chef's Gourmet Bento Box (4 courses all in one box).  The Bento box come with a caviar lobster salad with vinaigrette sauce, Foie Gras with sour mango and daikon raddish (the temperature was not hot enough which was disappointing. I noticed the seared foie was a bit hard on the edges since it cooled down.), Kobe served with Au Gratin potatoes (the beef was slightly over-cooked), and finally Sea Bass with wild rice and veggies (this I thought could be a nice dish on its own.  I wouldn't mind having it as my entree, but it was very very slightly on the salty side for my taste; generally speaking it was good).
