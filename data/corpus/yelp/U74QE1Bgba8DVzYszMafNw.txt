Mmmmmm go here once a month. Bone in rib eye is my fave but so is the bone in filet. Depends on how hungry but it' hard to finish either one. Had the strip and was not a fan. Chowder is amazing, asparagus, spinach all good but ask for no butter or sauce on side. Mushrooms - great addition with the steak. And drum roll please........turtle pie for dessert with a side of the chocolate and caramel sauce. Talk about heaven - actually my favorite dessert in the world. Need about 8 people to finish but who cares, get it take some bites and be satisfied. . . Love Gibsons. I don't care that its in the viagra triangle or that theres a lot of tourists. If you want go steak cooked right this is the spot.
