I love the ambiance of this restaurant. It has a cool artsy feel to it. It's definitely a cool place to go hang out w/ friends. They have decent food, (although a bit overpriced for what you get.) . . It's a place I'd recommend if you were dressed up, and everything else in downtown was closed or booked.
