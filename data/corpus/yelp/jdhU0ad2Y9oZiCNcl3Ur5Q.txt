i love almost everything i have had here. . there is a massive desert side near one of the entrances . that has incredible eclairs and fruit tarts that  r soooooooo bomb!. . there are also some premade fingerfoods/plates that u can grab 2go. they also have full cofee/tee service at the checkout counter. there is a nice beautiful bar area will full beer and alcohol service. . they bring u free water while u wait for food.. the water has excellent flavor. umm i think they own their own spring. . the dinner meals are excellent, like i said earlier, i have not. had anything here i didnt like.  the service/servers are top notch. all over u wenever u need anything. . i have seen lamar odom here quite too many times. and i hate paparazzi so that contributed to the 4.5 grade,. but theyre human beings too and i guess they must eat also. . being downtown, u know parking is beyond a nitemare.. after 7pm u can park pretty much anywhere.. but the breakfast hours, u cant park nowhere, . so thats kinda inconvenient for hte driving populace.  but wateva.  . . the food is too bom.  get yr ass over here
