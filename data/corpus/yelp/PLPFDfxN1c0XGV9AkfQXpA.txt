One of my all-time favorite spots in downtown.  Not only is a site full of excellent personal memories, but the food is terrific!. . I have had lunches and dinners here and have never been disappointed.  Their ceviche is my favorite in LA so far.  Their Flan is so rich and creamy I have to fight to order it.  I have also had the brie and honey as an appetizer.  I have eaten the sea bass, eggplant, pollo ciudad, all have been phenomenal and well worth the bit of money you have to shell.. . But check out the happy hour... $4 sangria, $4 mojitos (not the hand crushed ones but still good) or $4 margaritas.  Plus after 4, $4 tacos (your choice of white fish - my favorite and no pun intended-, potato, or beef).  They are small but mighty.. . I love the attentive staff, on Thursday nights they sometimes have live music on the patio, and it's just a win win for groups or a date.. . Addendum: As if I haven't had enough good things to say about this place, my department went here for a farewell lunch today.  OH MY FLIPPING LORD!!!!!!!! The Mahi Mahi with mole sauce was impeccable!  The spinach empanades were a tangy delight to my taste buds.  AND the Tres Leches cake we all shared was the best I had ever had!!!  It was the most moist, perfectly accented with a bit of strawberry... and don't take my white-ass word for it, two other co-workers (one Mexican-American and the other Puerto Rican) completely agreed and fought me for the last bite.  They won because I'm too freaking giving.  . . So, not only has this been the site of many a hot lunch or happy hour date for me, but today was a hit with the co-workers.   GO TO CIUDAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
