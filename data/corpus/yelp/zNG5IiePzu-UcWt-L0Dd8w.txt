Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
The food is still fantastic and the service still sucks. What is it with these waiters and waitresses? You serve food and drinks to a small place. You make sure I have refreshments topped off. BAM! That's it! Job done! But this place seems to make it difficult. Their menu seems to have improved a bit. The last time we went I had my same chicken, peanut butter and mango chutney sandwich but I got Sweet Potato Fries as an appetizer and dear mercy were they good! They offer coffee in a French Press which is very cool. Stole my idea! They also had a pretty badass Singer and DJ playing music there. Livened up the place quite nice. Little loud but not terrible. The place to me, seems to struggle to figure out whether they should cater more to their food or their alcoholic drinks or both? I'm not sure. Personally I could give a crap about alcoholic drinks when I'm eating my food.
