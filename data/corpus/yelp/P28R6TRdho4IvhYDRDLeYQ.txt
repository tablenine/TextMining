One of THE best greek places I have ever gone to.  It is THE best greek place for the price.. . I kept hearing about this place and how the seasoning on the meats were phenomenal and so on . . .  it  lived up to the hype.  . . I bought the 2 kebab plate (chicken and beef) and a side order of a rack of lamb.  I'm not too into lamb because I think it is a little "gamey" for me but this is the second best rack of lamb I have ever had compared to Dio Deka's in Los Gatos.  Compare the price? A side order for $6 compared to a $45 full plate of the lamb at Dio Deka?! Both are worth it.. . The seasoning on the beef and chicken were out of this world.  First bite = a flavor explosion similar to that bubble gum commercial.  The potatoes were pretty good and the salad is good as well.  . . The 2 kebab meal is around $16 and is def. worth the price. Honestly, I would've paid a little more for it.  . The only negative about the place is the parking.  They do have free valet.
