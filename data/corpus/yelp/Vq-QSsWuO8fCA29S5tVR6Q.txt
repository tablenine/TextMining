Restaurant: Sun Wah Bar-B-Que
Category: Chinese
If you want any sort of ambience, decor, or atmosphere, Sun Wah is not for you.  This is a hard core basic, no-frills joint- throw some tables &amp; chairs in a room in a haphazard way and call it a day.  No music, no artwork, &amp; almost all of the signs are handwritten on butcher paper or paper plates. There was a fresh coat of paint up in the room we were sat in, but even then, noone bothered to take the light fixtures or switch-plate covers off first and so there was paint all over them.  . . As for the food, it came faster than a virgin on prom night, but I cant say I cared much for the taste. I take that back.  It was just...OK. I ordered the BBQ pork and duck plate, which was a huge amount of rice, bok choy and meats balanced precariously atop a tiny plate.  The duck was scant, and mostly bone, while the pork was tender but without much BBQ flavour.  The rice and vegetable were perfect, so i guess I ended up getting my $4.50 worth.  I have heard from others though that take out is a better way to go with this place so I may have to try something else by that route and amend this review in the future.
