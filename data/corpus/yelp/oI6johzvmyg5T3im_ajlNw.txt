Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Really, Jerry's? Three mistakes on one sandwich? I ordered turkey, cheddar, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo on a pretzel roll. I got turkey, brie, burnt charred bacon, lettuce, tomato, and onion. No mayo, wrong cheese, onions when I didn't order them, and the bacon was burnt.
