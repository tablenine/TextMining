um, UPDATE!  okay, it's confirmed - i LOVEEEEE this place!  yes, the service can be a little shoddy, but the food and the ambiance of this place overshadows all of its minor faults.  . . a couple things that i MUST highlight:  PORTOBELLO FRIES!!!!  so freaking delicious!  there's SO much flavor packed into each bite.  um, A-mazing!  . . also, the affogato is a very delicious way to end your meal at bottega louie.  it's vanilla gelato served with a shot of espresso.  you pour the espresso over the gelato, and you have some heavenly goodness right there.  YUM-o.  . . finally, the bread is perfectly chewy and delicious.  . . it's just A-mazing.  this place i A-mazing.  i love it.  totally one of my favorites now.  :D
