Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Delish. This is pretty authentic Japanese-American cuisine.. . The best part of Orochon is that you can build your own ramen combo - toppings &amp; soup base. Excellent for times when you have that craving for something specific. You can order extra toppings, extra spicy, hold the corn... anything to your pleasure!. . It's not swanky, and it can get stuffy - but would you expect anything else from a ramen place?
