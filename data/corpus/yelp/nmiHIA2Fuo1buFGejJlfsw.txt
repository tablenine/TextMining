Everyone comes here for their Hainan chicken rice.  I always request white meat...and they accommodate.  The rice is better than most other places - but the chicken itself is just chicken.  Nothing special.  . . The baked seafood is decent, but also nothing spectacular.  On several occassions I've also had the filet mignon.  While I'm pretty sure it's not filet mignon, it's not bad (covered in black pepper sauce).  All of their pizzas are pretty good too.  They're definitely big enough for 2 to share.. . Since this restaurant is tiny, the wait is usually pretty long.
