Restaurant: Wishbone
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
1 Star for seating us immediately on a Sunday around 10 am.. 1 Star for having delicious grits &amp; biscuits and gravy (My southern roots were well-fed here). 1 Star for speedy service (although I never saw our server after we placed our order, I did have everything I needed). 1 Star for the warm, happy feeling I had when I left. . There are lots of brunch places still to be tried, but I would have no hesitation to return to Wishbone!
