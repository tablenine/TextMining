Beef Sandwich is ok, I prefer a Baguette from Bolsa. . . I ate lunch here with my coworkers yesterday. I have always heard of Philippe's in that it was the best place to get a french dip or beef sandwich. The sandwich was ok. Here are the details. . . 1. Beef Sandwich was ok. The slice of cheese was extra. The cost was . about five bucks. . 2. Potato Salad was ok. . 3. lemon aid???? I should have just stuck to the can of Pepsi I had . with me in my pocket. . 4. Tapioca Pudding was Yummy!!! Four Stars on the Tapioca Pudding! . 5. Ambiance, especially upstairs, was pretty bad. . 6. The lady who took the money also grabbed a wet pickle with her hand.. . disgusting! . . We were going to eat at homeboy cafe, but decided to come here for a try. The food is good, but I am spoiled and use to more taste. I would prefer a baguette with meat and veggies from bolsa with an ice coffee any old day. I doubt I will come back. I just felt the food was bland. . . We came here around noon and the wait was long. The upstairs was pretty depressing. My coworkers said it reminded them of what they thought jail would be like. . . I would have given my total experience a two star, but the tapioca pudding saved the day! I am lucky I ordered it. . . Last note, the paper plate and tray seemed dirty or old. I do not know which. I think this place is ideal for east coast or Midwestern folks..not for those inclined to prefer spicy or variety of flavors. . . I did not even try to check out the bathroom. I kinda just wanted to get out of there. . . Plenty of parking, price of lunch (about 8 bucks) and the tapioca pudding made this place A-OK.
