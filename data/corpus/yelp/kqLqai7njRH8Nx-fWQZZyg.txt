Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Major disappointment.  Heard it was great when I moved to Eagle Rock, but gotta doubt the people's taste buds who review their pizza as being great.  I originally hail from Chicago, so lets just say I've eaten many different types of pizza, both good and bad, during my 34 yrs.  Bianca's sucks - period.  Ordered reg crust, mushroom, pepperoni and black olive.  Bland crust and tasteless sauce, do these people not know what spices are for?  I had to sponge the grease off with several napkins (yes, cheese and pepperoni will have grease, but if it's quality ingredients, the pizza doesn't swim in it, like this one did).  Then the sin I just can't ever forgive - canned mushrooms.  That may be acceptable if I'm making pizza at home, but at an itallian restaurant?!?  NO WAY!  They didn't even taste cooked.  They were cold and wet like they were thrown on the pizza as an after thought post cooking.  I will not be back, I have no patience for bad food, even if it comes in cute kitchy little restaurants, which I personally love.  Go to Brownstone down the street instead.
