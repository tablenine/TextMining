The ol' high school hang out. We'd skip class to order warm pizza slices or come here after school for fries, shakes and floats! Here's what you need to know:. . Morning:. -fresh squeezed orange juice (you used to be able to squeeze it yourself...I dunno if things have changed). -CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS. -yes! to mexican hot chocolate. . Snackin':. -potato skins are delish. -still upset that they got rid of jalapeno poppers =(. -chicken quesadillas come with a generous amount of sour cream and pico de gallo. -eat a basket o' fries with bbq sauce. . Lunch/Dinner:. -get here around 11-11:30am, it's packed by noon.. -FIDEL'S CHICKEN SOUP. -Ensalata Kimba salad. -their bbq chicken pizza has way too much bbq sauce. overwhelming.. -thin crust personal pizzas are bigger than pan pizzas. take your pick.. . Sweets:. -mexicana shake, orzata and himbeersaft floats all worth your $$. . Extras:. -bring a permanent marker before you eat here - just in case you wanna make your mark on the wall or on a table or chair.. -look around you, u of c profs, grads and undergrads everywhere! (the younger looking ones are either freshmen or labbies). feel smart - or really, really dumb.. -the bathroom got renovated and is nice - this still blows my mind!. -this is the ultimate Hyde Park landmark restaurant. TONS better than Edwardos, better than Caffe Florian.
