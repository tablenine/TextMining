Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
On Sunday, February 28, 2010 I had fried white chicken meat and waffles at Roscoe's for the very first time. The waffles were well cooked and the meat was decent. I should have ordered gravy with the fried chicken.. I have to admit that I am not a fan of grits which was bland with the butter topping. On the positive side, you will get plenty of food for your money.
