I came here and did the S2 challenge since I love spicy food and thought "the 3 wasn't bad, why not try the 2?" Then I was coaxed quite easily into the S2 with the promise of $50 if I finished it in the time span. . . I killed the noodles in about ten or fifteen minutes, however the broth itself was a WHOLE different story. Besides attempting to eat spoonfuls of jalapenos I gave up and suffered later due to the severe spiciness.. . However I would recommend a more "tame" ramen like the 3 or 4 even if I only taste tested those.. . Good luck to anyone willing to try the S2 Challenge!!!
