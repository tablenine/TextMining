Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Kitsch'n and I have an on-again/off-again relationship.  When we're "on," we're inseparable.  But oh . . . when we're off.. . We've been off for a while, mostly because I've gotten sick and tired of waiting for a brunch table for food that didn't really wow me.  I'd rather make my own breakfast burrito these days.  A friend and I stopped by the other day for lunch and some day-drinking and . . . my love and I were reunited.  . . I had the falafel pita sandwich with a side of cucumbers and cucumber sauce.  It was light and refreshing -- just perfect for people watching and vodka lemonade.  Speaking of, the purple haze lemonade is great, but their bloody mary is even better!!  I think I'll start going back to Kitsch'n, but more for lunch than brunch.
