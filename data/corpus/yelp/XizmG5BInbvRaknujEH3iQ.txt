Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I don't get it.  I'm not sure why this place is so popular.  And it takes a lot to turn me off from a place, I'm a pretty generous person when it comes to restaurants.  You gotta go pretty far to push me the wrong way.  That being said, Toast is way overpriced, and the hostess/manager is unprofessional, and kinda racist/homophobic. . I got a little dinky breakfast burrito with chorizo for $11.  It didn't come with potatoes or fruit or anything else, just some eggs, cheese, and beans in a burrito with a tiny bit of chorizo.  flavor wise, it was OK. . My niece got a cheese and tomato sandwich for $9, and the tomatoes were awful.  . Jill, behind the counter, is rude, telling one customer it was "gay" that he shaves his arms, and calling an African American woman "black sugar".  She also came over to chat with us while we ate.  I don't want to chat with staff while I eat, I'm there to talk with my niece and catch up.  Then she walked over and started stroking another customers head, in front of his partner/wife/GF.  . I don't ever need to eat there again, there are a lot of other places in the city that do brunch a whole lot better, both in terms of price, food, and atmosphere.  . Also, if you have more than 4 people, it will be a struggle to get you seated.  Heck, it was a struggle to get two of us seated, until they decided it was busy enough to seat us at the counter.
