Restaurant: The Fifty/50

Fifty/50 is definitely smaller than I expected, even with the 3 levels. My date and I walked in around 7 on a Tuesday and were able to pick a table right away.  Everyone was really friendly, including the staff and other patrons. Our waiter was awesome, super friendly and funny.  No drinking for me since I was doped up on Dayquil, so I can't comment on drinks, although the drink menu looked fun and a little different.  I had a chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun (score!) with cheddar and fries. The sandwich was perfect and the fries were pretty darn good too. My dining companion had barbecue chicken and a huge honkin' plate of asparagus. We both really liked our food. We happened to be there for trivia night.  Didn't play, but had our own competition between us. My date desperately needed the Kansas basketball game to be put on, and Fifty/50 made that happen for him.  They didn't mind when we finished eating and hung around a bit and waters and my diet coke were constantly refilled, definitely a plus in my book!
