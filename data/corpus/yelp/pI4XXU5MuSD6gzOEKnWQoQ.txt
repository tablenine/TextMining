The majority of reviews for Philippe usually start out with, "I had a friend in from out of town..." And my story is no different.. . DK was in town for a quick visit, so prior to his arrival, I sent him an eating agenda. On the list was Philippe, which he had heard of, but had never tried during previous trips to LA.. . We had to be at the Rose Bowl for a soccer game, so we made this a stop along the way (because I don't drive the 110 towards Pasadena unless I HAVE TO.. . I got a double french beef dip, I think he got the same with Swiss cheese, and we shared a mac salad. Since we were too hungry, it was the perfect snack-type meal. I hadn't been there in a couple of years, and it was just as good as I remembered it. He thought the flavor and the bread were perfect. I like the fact that the customers are made up of locals as well as tourists. Always a great stop on the way to/from Downtown LA or Chinatown. And a great place to take out-of-towners for a little bit of LA history.
