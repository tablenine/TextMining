Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
the "Lou" (veggie) pizza is quite possibly one of the best deep dish pizzas i have ever had. . . also the chocolate chip pizza (dessert served with cookie, ice cream, and whipped cream) is quite tasty. . . their thin crust pizzas are good too, but maybe i'm just tired of them because we have them at most of our corporate functions... . . relatively well priced i'd say. this specific location is right under the el so i always opt to sit inside...
