I wish I could give this place three and a half stars.  It doesn't quite make it to a four.. . There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place.  It's actually great and the patio is lovely in the spring and summer.  The ambiance is casual but intimate, and as a first date place you could do way, way worse.  . . It's just that it's one of those places that's good for certain things.  Like, say if you were really craving rosewater grapefruit martinis (which are awesome) or decent sangria or maybe awesome french fries and ropa vieja (slow cooked pork on tortilla chips with jalapeno sour cream- omg) this would be your place.  . . it's a good lunch place, too.  . . I like Cafe di Sol plenty.  We just didn't fall in love, you know?
