I ate many different places while in Atlanta, but the only 2 places I've ever made the return trip to are the flying biscuit, and this place. Seriously though, this place was better than a place I paid over $65 per person to eat at. for some reason, I thought the buns were incredible. made for a great palce to get a hotdog and a coke after visiting the world of coke.
