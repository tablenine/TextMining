Harrison Ford's son! How cool?? He's the chef/owner here! I was curious because I saw him cook these awesome looking sandwiches on some food network show so i decided to try it out.. . it's a bit pricey so i went with a girlfriend for lunch.  i got the fish and chips plate and it came with lots of cool stuff like fried asparagus, onion rings, and chips! those were all good, and the fish was eh.  my friend got the flatbread which was really good! when i go back, i'll have to get it for myself.  it's the best value there.  i also want to try happy hour there.  will update when i try it =)
