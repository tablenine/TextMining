My favorite was the tofu bahn mi---tasty without feeling as heavy as the meat sandwiches. The grilled pork was also great. The meat was well-seasoned, and they give you a decent amount. Not crazy about their house sandwich since I'm not a big fan of liver. Their fresh bread makes the sandwiches taste sooo good, yum!
