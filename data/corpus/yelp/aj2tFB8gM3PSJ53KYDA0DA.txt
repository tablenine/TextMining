Compared to the San Jose location (5 stars) and Garden Grove (Brookhurst) (4 stars) location, Alhambra's location was my least favorite. (3 stars). . We ordered 3 lbs of Whole Shabang shrimp. This is my favorite menu item of course. But it did, actually, disappoint. The shrimp was overcooked every bag we had and the third time wasn't a charm. Shrimp after being peeled was white mostly not so much pink. The Shabang sauce was super oily than normal and I felt like it wasn't as flavored to perfection. It's October and Crawfish aren't in season so they are frozen. We didn't wanna risk it.. . The Cajun flavored Chicken Wings were undercooked...some parts were RED and I'm not talkin about close to the chicken bone red.. . **THE SAN JOSE BOILING CRAB LOCATION stands as THE BEST LOCATION thus far. Never disappoints. Come up to Norcal and see what's good for you.
