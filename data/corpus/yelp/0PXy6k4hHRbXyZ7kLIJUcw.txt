YUMMY RAMEN! Before I fell in love with Hakata Ramen, I used to come here every week. Prices were reasonable, about $10 a bowl, including tax and tip, and the food always tasted great. My usual order would be ramen with a small unagi or oyako don. The noodles were hit or miss, cooked too soft at times, but the soup had a meaty, distinct taste I craved. Also, I loved their marinated egg! One of the best I've had.. . The downside: the wait time!
