Meh. If I'm going to spend an assload of money on dinner, it had better be great.. . Opera was not great. It was slightly better than mediocre. . . We had the golden shrimp and Crab Chopsticks for apps. They were both ok - nothing to write home about. There was a lot of sauce involved in all the appetizers, which was interesting I guess.. . My main course was scallops/peas and mushrooms with polenta in a wine sauce. The texture of the scallops was kind of off putting, to be honest. The polenta Â was incredible. . . We had a black rice pudding for dessert.. . I had really high expectations for this price and I was really let down. My neighborhood thai joints serve better for for under $10.. . Sorry, Opera.
