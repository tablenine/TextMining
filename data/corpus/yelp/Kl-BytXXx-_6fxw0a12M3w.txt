I'm trying to be a brunch connoisseur but lately I have not been hungry enough for all the food I get at these places! I guess that's America for you. Anyway, all the food I could stuff myself with here was great! I got a big ol plate of Brazilian french toast, topped with bananas, strawberries, syrup, coconut shavings that I couldn't taste. I ate until I could eat no more. . I was a bundle of indecision the day I ate at Flo Cafe, but my one good decision of the day was to order the mimosa (I Love Mimosas!) It was worth it, nothing crazy but a lovely little mimosa that perfectly complimented my meal.. The service was really friendly and I really liked the decor...I think there were a bunch of pencils on the wall? Why not. We all got french toast so I didn't get to try other things, but I would like to go back and see what else they have to offer!
