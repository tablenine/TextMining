I'm pretty sure the sign is misspelt. I think it should read P-e-t-i-t-e because these sandwiches are soo small. I think they said that this place has been around for over a hundred years...so maybe people were smaller back then. I could of eaten 10 of their roast-beef sandwiches and still been hungry. It's ridiculous! I'm hungry now. 10 Please!
