Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I like Stella's.  It has a bright cheery decor.  The food is pretty decent and the selection is large.  I have a hard time deciding what to get when I come.  I like that when I come in I'm usually told to take any seat I like.  I haven't had dessert here yet, but they look good.
