Rodan was a strange place. The decor was pretty cool and the staff was friendly, but it seemed like almost no one was there to eat; just to stand around in groups and chat. Then again, maybe it was because the food was only okay. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly outstanding. The Wasabi Fries, although they tasted good, seemed to be frozen fries from a bag, which is a shame. The Edamame Hummus was too garlicky and the Togarashi Burger just tasted like a burger. The Chicken Bahn Mi tasted good, but didn't particularly remind me of a Bahn Mi. For dessert, we shared the Vietnamese Coffee and Beignets. The coffee was good, but the beignets were not. They tasted plain and boring.. . The drink list at Rodan was good, but the drink special they offered ran out after only having one, which was weird because we arrived only about a half hour after they opened. There were one or two more things I tried to order that they were also out of. All in all, Rodan was only okay. If I lived right by it, I would probably go back, but since I don't, I doubt that I ever will.
