ITALIAN FOOD THAT WILL MAKE YOU LICK YOUR PLATE. . Delicious has a new name.  This place may be pricey (~125$ with wine, appetizer, meals, desert for 2), but I would eat mac &amp; cheese for three months to save the cash to go.  Mozza is a must try for any los angelino who wants to try the best local spots.. . PS - The Rum Chocolate Cake only so so (too rummy), try something else and let us know how it went.
