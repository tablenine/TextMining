Pros. Great atmosphere, well designed, beautiful outdoor seating.. Full Bar. Food is delicious and priced nicely. The staff is attractive. Great place to bring a date. . Cons. The food isn't amazing. If you eat there for dinner, bring night vision goggles. The staff, although they are nice on the eyes, are not very nice. . . Overall, I think they have got a good thing going on.
