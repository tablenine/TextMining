This is my standard bar and grill that I turn to if I just want a low-key atmosphere to chill and have some decent bar food. Went here for lunch today and had a nice time with an old friend. Got a portobello mushroom sandwich, which was pretty tasty. And of course, they have good fries. When you sometimes just want regular food and don't want to think about where to go too hard, the Daily Grill is a good choice!
