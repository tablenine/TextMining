Forget the sandwiches, forget the silver chocolates, the salads, the homemade honey with real honeycombs in the jar...it's all about the LEEK AND SPINACH DIP. It's in their take out section on the left side when you first enter, next to the homemade hummus and roasted red pepper dip. Pick up some pita chips to-go and I swear you won't be able to put down that container until it's empty. Also good with slices of toasted french baguette.. . ***Edit 1/27/08. Holy crap they've expanded to more than double their original size!! Which makes it just that much more amazing. We sat down for Sunday brunch--grilled vegetable and goat cheese sandwich, asparagus soup..mmm. So much selection and so many people and so much commotion, it was a little stressful but so worth it. Next time we'll check out the numerous cheese selections and jams and cakes.
