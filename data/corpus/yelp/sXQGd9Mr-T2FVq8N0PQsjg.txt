What a great lunch place.  Prices are a bit high but at least the food was good.  Brisket sandwich was yummy but the coleslaw was a bit soggy.  Vanilla fountain coke was good.  Burger with crunchy onions was delish. However, we were not crazy about the red velvet cake; it was a bit dry and lacked flavor. It was a fun place to go for a change of pace and scenery in the south loop area.  Will go back to sample more food and for drinks!
