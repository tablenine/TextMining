This place definitely has that casual, neighborhood feel, and you get the impression that if you came to eat more than once or twice, the staff would begin to greet you by name. They back up that comfortable feel with excellent cuisine. The burgers are, quite simply put, scrumptious. And their assortment of drinks (including a selection of root beers) is quite fun. The $2 fries that you can count to nine? Really tasty -- crisp on the outside and soft inside, and just the right thickness and saltiness. But $2 worth of tastiness? Probably not. The $3 spattering of sweet potato chips is no improvement (although they have a nice crunch and cinnamony burst to them). Does that mean you should miss out on one of the best burgers in town? Heck no! Indulge in a burger and wash it down with a beverage -- you didn't need those fried sides anyway.
