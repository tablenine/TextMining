I love this place, it's always really busy but the line is better on the weekdays.  Try to get there right before 7pm because that's when Thai Elvis usually gets on stage to perform.  The roasted duck curry is so so good!!!  You gotta try it.  Also, there's a little dessert place next door that has the most amazing little fried treats to go...
