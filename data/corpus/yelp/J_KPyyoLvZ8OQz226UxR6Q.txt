Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
My favorite cheap Italian in the city. The only thing I miss about living in Lincoln Park is being within walking distance of The Pasta Bowl. Seriously, that's the only thing. Walking to dinner at The Pasta Bowl and a movie at Century on Clark. It was the perfect way to spend a night out. . The fried ravioli is my favorite appetizer (not available for delivery). I usually order the pesto pasta with chicken, but the "gnocci aurora" and alfredo have gotten some great reviews by friends. The wine list leaves a lot to be desired (read: it sucks, the wine tastes cheap, and I can't wait till someone does something about it). . . There are so many reasons this is the ideal place to take a first date. One: The food is cheap, but it tastes like a more expensive Italian restaurant made it. Two: Sitting at the bar area watching the cooks work is fun for conversation. Three: There is a cupcake dessert place two doors down where you can sit on swings and feed each other mini cupcakes (gagging on the cutesy factor). Â Last and certainly most important: The Pasta Bowl and The Other Side Bar are the same building. Go through a doorway, and you're suddenly in a bar. Oops. You can have dinner, and depending on whether or not you like them, you can liquor your date up at the bar till 2am. All without leaving the restaurant.. . Parking is a nightmare, and if I had to travel down from Lincoln Square now, I would probably take the brown line to Belmont and take the Clark bus all the way there.
