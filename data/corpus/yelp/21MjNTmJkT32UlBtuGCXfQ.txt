You just can't go wrong with anything you order here. I had Prawns with their famous Garlic noodles. The prawns were okay (not ver flavorful) BUT noodles sooo made up for it. Super yummy noodles &amp; I've never tasted anything like it. My friends had the crab....highly recommend you choose that. Someone else had the Salmon...looked yummy. Desserts were sooo good. Try the coconut cake, bread pudding or lava cake...you can't go wrong. Service is great &amp; so is the atmosphere!!!
