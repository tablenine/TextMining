Great burger, HORRIBLE ATTITUDE and SERVICE.  It's just a bar with decent bar food - no excuse for the arrogant, crappy service.  They make you feel like you're lucky to be there - yet it's very $$$ and you have to order at the counter.  . . Too pricey for snotty atmosphere.  Not fun.  No way I'd go back.
