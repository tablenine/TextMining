Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I have been going to Lawrys for more or less a decade. I remember I first went here, I thought it was such a nice restaurant, and only rich people eat here. Over the course of time, this place has become more relaxed and lost its sheen.. . I recently dined here for my bfs birthday dinner with a group of 11. We were a bit early because my bf wanted to eat the meatballs. We were seated at a long table. When we got our salad (one of my favorites at Lawrys) someone had pointed out that they did not add the tomatoes nor the eggs. What kind of Lawrys salad is it without those ingredients? From that point I was a bit irritated. . My friend ordered the Lawrys cut but the chef was feeling generous and hooked her up with size comparable to the bowl cut. I always order the california cut and it was pretty medicore and bland. I felt like the food had no flavor. We had a late dinner and needed to be out of there no later than 11. I felt like the wait staff knew because they were so quick with serving everything out (not in a good way). Things seemed to be rushed out.. Overall, my dining experience at Lawrys is not what it was, say 10 years ago. At least I can say their creamed corn is still amazingly delish!
