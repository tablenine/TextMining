A L.A. staple. The food at Bossa Nova is always good and their menu is HUGE! It always gets lined up around dinner time but it's always well worth the wait. Lot's of hollywood d-bag spotting. The bread is amazing and they also deliver until 4am. Give all the dishes a shot they won't disappoint. Mmmmm!
