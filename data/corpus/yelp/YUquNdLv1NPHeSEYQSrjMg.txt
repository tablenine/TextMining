One of the best meals I've had in Chicago for 3 reasons. . 1) The food was outstanding ... We ordered several different appetizers ... Naan (the cream cheese and mushroom were the best), Samosas, Peppers and 3 different entrees ... all of it was delicious, but I think the Samosas and Chicken Tikka Masala are a must!  Also, the mini poppadoms were great!  I am very choosey about Indian cuisine, and I really found the traditional stuff to be spot on ... the the dishes with a dash of American fusion were surprising and nice improvements on recipes can often be a little flat ... very well executed too. . . 2) The atmosphere is very pleasing ... visually simple and beautiful ... we were there for well over two hours, as were a number of the patrons around us, and the aesthetics were definitely part of the reason ... very comfortable dining experience.. . 3) The service was outstanding ... we were really well looked after from the moment we walked in.  I was celebrating a birthday, and the owner made our drinks and sent out complimentary appetizers while we waited for our reserved table, which has been hijacked by two women who were obviously considering a sleep-over in the dining room.  The owner turned what normally would have been an annoying situation into a really special night for us!  Also, the staff really seemed knowledgeable about the menu, which is really important in a place like Veerasway.. . All in all, I give them a full 5 stars and I plan to dine there again very soon ... I highly recommend you do the same!  And when you do, don't forget to order a couple of rounds of "Bollywood Rehab" cocktails before you even think about looking at the menu ... you'll thank me.
