I absolutely love Parish! Great ambiance, farm to table ingredients and good southern comfort food without everything being fried. Love their new take on the classic TV Dinner (new one each week) and have enjoyed both dinner and brunch there. I always try to hit Parish when going to a Dad's Garage show or when I want to impress family or friends with a good, upscale brunch without the upscale price.
