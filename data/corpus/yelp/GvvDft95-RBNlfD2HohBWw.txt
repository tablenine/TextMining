Alright, so I was hungry on campus AGAIN, broke down and went back to this place.  I had the basil fried rice w/ tofu.  This place only gets 2 stars because it didn't make me sick the second time.  . . The basil fried rice was nothing special - just regular fried rice with a few large basil leaves and jalapeno pieces thrown in the mix. I got hardly any tofu in the dish.  Now I can be done with this place.
