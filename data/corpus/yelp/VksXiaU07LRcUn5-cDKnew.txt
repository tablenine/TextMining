I definitely need to go back again to really get a feel for this place, my first experience was great. 4 ppl Friday Night. Pre-dinner drinks and appetizer.Asked server to recommend a dry white wine and she nailed it. Ordered the Piccolo Affettati Â  $20 Fantastic, Fresh and Plenty for 4 ppl! Love the space, well designed, intimate and cozy!
