To answer the debate NY style or Chicago deep dish, I am going to go w/ NY.  But if you ever want to try Chicago deep dish, definitely check this place out.  Stupid BJ's brewery and Pizza Hut gave me the impression deep dish pizza was a very bready pizza.  Real Chicago deep dish is layers of cheese and toppings and sauce.  This is a very heavy meal.  I can eat, and eating three slices for me was a task.  Listen to the menu when it says serves 2 or 3 and so forth.  Unless you're kobayashi or joey chestnut.. . I would definitely want to eat this again.  The anchovies are good too!
