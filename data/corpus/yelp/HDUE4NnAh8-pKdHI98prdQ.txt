Went to Spring tonight after reading the many good Yelp reviews of this place. Â The oysters were good, however everything else was WAY OVERPRICED and not great. At all. . Here's the rundown.. . Yellowtail roll: I think it was like over twelve bucks for this sushi roll that I'd have maybe paid $5 for...tasty, but nothing to write home about.. . White bean puree: it came with the bread, tasted out of place -they could have kept that. Was that bread from Trader Joe's? really?. . Skatewing: The skatewing was pan fried nicely...but they serve it on some "buttery grease stuff" with apples and sunflower seeds. FAIL.. . Bouillabaisse: Tasted like it was microwaved from frozen, Olive garden wouldn't have served that. :-(. . Foie gras: it was foie gras wrapped in potsticker dough, what a waste...all grease, no sweetness or richness to speak of.. . After all this we decided against dessert after seeing "curried chocolate" on the menu.. . There is nothing wrong at all with spending an arm and a leg for good food and service, this place is not horrible, but try not to go anyway.. . Save your money.
