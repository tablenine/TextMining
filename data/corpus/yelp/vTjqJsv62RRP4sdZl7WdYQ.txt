Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Instructions for RCW:. . 1) Don't eat a thing twenty four hours before visiting Roscoe's -- you will need all that space in your belly.. . 2) Don't be a wuss! Order that crispy sweet waffle with some good, flaky, greasy southern fried chicken on top and pour gravy/syrup/whatever turns you on over it all.  . . 3) Go home and take an "itis" nap.  Nothing better than a great meal and with a nap following and after eating this glorious-who-would've-thunk-it-only-in-LA combination you will want to lay down and dream of the next time chicken and waffles come together in your mouth.
