Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Stella's is a really cute diner with good food and a large menu. I came in for brunch and had the vegetarian skillet smothered with cheese and fresh squeezed OJ, which were pretty good. The coffee was just eh, but I would say that the food is above average for a diner. Service was quick, the bill was cheap, the restaurant was clean and fresh. All lovely things to find in a diner! I will definitely come back to Stella's, at least for brunch. I still want to try the milkshakes and chocolate cake!
