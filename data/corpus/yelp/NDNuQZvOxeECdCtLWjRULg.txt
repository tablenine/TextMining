Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
What a wonderful sushi/thai place. I must admit that when I walked in on a cold Wednesday night and saw how packed it was, I was a little turned off by the wait. However, the wait and this restaurant's popularity is definitely justified.. The fact that Butterfly is BYOB was the main reason we came but that feature is really just the icing on the cake.  To start with, our server was super attentive and very friendly. Once we ordered, our food came pretty fast.  I had some the spicy panang curry with tofu and it was divine.  I've never had a noodle curry dish and I was really thrilled by how it turned out. The super flat and wide noodles had a nice rice flavor and tasted really fresh.  The tofu had a wonderful consistency and the basil and broccoli were tasty.  For sushi, I tried the avocado roll and the sweet potato tempura roll.  The avocado was just how I like it - fresh, soft and flavorful. The sweet potato roll was amazing and is something I'll have to get each and every time.. The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere but it is tiny and cramped. There wasn't an area to wait in without being in the way which on a cold and snowy night wasn't ideal.  The tables are very close to eachother and everyone seemed like they were screaming to be heard by their companions.  So it was loud and squished but still very fun.  . All in all, it is my favorite sushi place in the city right now and i'll be back - but probably at off-peak times (if they exist!).
