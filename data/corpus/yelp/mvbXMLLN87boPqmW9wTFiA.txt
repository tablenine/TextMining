My experience at HB was wonderful. I went with a group of girlfriends for a birthday celebration and couldn't have asked for a better meal. As soon as we walked in the door, the owner greeted us and led us to our table. He was welcoming and warm. He even pointed himself out in the pictures on the wall. . . The service was flawless (I wish I could remember our server's name because she definitely deserves a shout-out...yeah, I said shout-out). Â She was super helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations. We were all a little embarassed not to know much about pork belly, but when we asked about it our server didn't judge us in the slightest. In fact, she said it was an excellent question because pork belly is always prepared differently so it's good to inquire whenever you see it on the menu. She didn't even judge my friend for her terrible taste in wine (white zin). . . We ordered several appetizers, but one that really stands out is the rabbit risotto. Who knew rabbit tasted so good? For dinner, I ordered the brisket and it was phenomenal. Cooked to perfection, truly. In fact, every single one of us loved our meals. Dessert was, of course, incredible also. My favorite? The bread pudding. Definitely not something that I wanted to share with the rest of the table.. . I would return in a heartbeat.
