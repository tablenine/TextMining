best ramen I've had.  always get the soy sauce #2. never want anything else. extras can get expensive, as well as their overpriced drinks, but I've learned to love the 7$ huge bowl alone. the staff is super cool and nice as well.  sometimes the green onions come out a little undercooked but otherwise, it's superb.
