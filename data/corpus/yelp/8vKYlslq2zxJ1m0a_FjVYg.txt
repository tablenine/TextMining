I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for breakfast. The double dip beef sandwich was pretty double darn good and their french toast is amazing! The hot mustard is also awesome, especially with the sandwich; the mustard will make your nostrils explode and your eyes will glossify. I wasn't too impressed by the sides, although the cole slaw went well with everything else. . . Both times I went weren't so crowded, but I heard it gets crazy in there.
