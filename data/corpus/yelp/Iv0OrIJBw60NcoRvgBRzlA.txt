The atmosphere is great, and the wait staff never left us scratching our heads, looking for a waiter or waitress--drink refills were prompt, and they were great about explaining any questions we had about the menu.. . My biggest complaint is that we were a largish group--I guess 16 or 17 people. Because we were socializing, none of us thought to tell the waitress to split the bill, and, unfortunately, she didn't ask if that's what we wanted. So waiting on the bill took a while, and then waiting on the bill to processed with all of our cash, cards, etc., took an eternity. . . I thought the food was good, but not outstanding, Â worth the $7/dish though.. . It was good for atmoshere and pretty good food. I'll go back again, but not before I check out the other tapas restaurants in town first. All-in-all I thought it was good, though not exceptional or exciting.
