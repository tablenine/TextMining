I don't know if it gets better dining in, but as far as delivery, it's one of the worst I've had, and I know pizza, it's my favorite food. We ordered 3 cheese pizzas, nothing fancy and they arrived almost cold, not to mention the quality was not even good enough to consume... . Whoever wrote a good review about this place, didn't order delivery or don't know pizzas.. The service was okay though..
