Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
My girlfriend heard about this place from TV Food Network and when she lived a couple of blocks from this place, would always get the menus at her front door.  She never thought of checking out this place until recently.  It seems the place has gotten a lot of attention due to Guy (Fieri) and TV Food Network visiting earlier this year.  Overall, it's a quaint and small restaurant.  Not very much parking.  Gloria still runs the place and saw her when we got take out the other night.  The food...was okay.  . . I ordered the chicken steak and my gf ordered the fish tacos.  The chicken steak was well seasoned but seemed on the dry side.  The beans were good but the rice lacked flavor; the salsa seemed bland at first but I caught a hint of spiciness afterwards.  The fish tacos were bland; I've had better and cheaper too.  Anytime a restaurant has "specials" I'll order something off that section and see if its any good.. . I'm thinking of ordering the carnitas adobada and maybe a seafood dish with camarones on my next visit.  I'm not necessarily a fan of El Salvadorean food but may give this a shot from that section of the menu.  Price-wise, I thought it was slightly higher than food in this range and type - especially the specials.
