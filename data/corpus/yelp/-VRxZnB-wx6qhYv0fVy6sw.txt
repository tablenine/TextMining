really. my second, third, fourth and fifth experience at this once brilliant establishment is in the dumps. i mean, it's really not a two star place, but, considering how 5 star it once was, it makes the 2 stars all that much more worth it. the quality is down. the meats are not as good. the fries weren't very fresh. and even the beer didn't have the same kick. it's too soon oinkster, it's too soon to fall from the top. pick ur shiz up.
