Restaurant: Sushi Go 55
Category: Sushi Bars
ATTENTION WHITE PEOPLE: You have rarely been spotted at Sushi Go 55, and I love that.  Stay out of this restaurant.  It's where Japanese people go to eat sushi.  . . I'm totally kidding, but this is a real sushi spot.  I usually have no idea what I'm ordering when I sit at the sushi bar.  I just let the chef do his thing and I've never been disappointed.  In an otherwise desolate mall, this place is a treat.
