Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
I was on a very short trip to Chicago for business and dropped into Hugo's with some colleagues for a work dinner.  Hugo's was a great choice.  The service was good.  My steak was very good.  The ambience was exactly what I was looking for and the price for 5 including a bottle of wine was only just over $200.  A few of us even tried frog legs for the first time.
