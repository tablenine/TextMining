We've been here a few times, and the sushi is always fantastic. Some of the most unique rolls I've ever had and the prices are actually very reasonable. Mitch is fantastic, and can always be depended on to introduce you to something new. Its definitely worth sitting at the bar just for that.. . The one downfall is the service. I've been on multiple Friday nights, and they take your phone number so you can go somewhere else and come back. Last time we were there, what we were told would be a 45 minute wait turned into an hour 15 because people wouldn't come back when they were called. The wait is worth it though, you just have to be prepared for a long one.
