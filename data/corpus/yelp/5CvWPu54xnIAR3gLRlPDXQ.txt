I used to like this place, but ever since they remodeled it's not really been the same. The prices have also gone up, which would be ok if the food was still good. The last two times the food was just not good...I used to get the pancakes and they were SO GOOD. Not so much anymore. Dry and not tasty at all. Service is kind of slow too and they always seem to forget to bring me everything I ordered. Someone I was with innocently asked our server his opinion on an item and he gave us an attitude. Sorry bro, I didn't know it was a pain in the ass to answer a simple question.. . It pains me to give a bad review here, but it's just not good anymore. Well, the fries are decent still!
