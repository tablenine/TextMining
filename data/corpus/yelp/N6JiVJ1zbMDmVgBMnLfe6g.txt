You cannot go to Arcadia and not eat here. . . My dad is the king of making xiao long bao, and this is one place he'll wake up ridiculously early (and wake us all up...) to get to, so yes it is very good!. . We got here a few minutes before 10:30am when it opens and we were seated immediately. A few minutes into sitting down, the waiting area was filled with people so be sure to go early!. . My parents did all of the ordering and chose some specials that are not on the menu (which were quite pricey!). But, lucky for me, I got to pick a lot of sweets! The noodle and meat plates are quite small, so I would say skip it and just order a lot of dumplings. We had tons and tons of steamed trays coming to our table, and their dumplings here are seriously good! The perfect amount of heat, "soup", and the skin isn't too thick. YUM!. . My dad ordered a rice cake with red beans and I chose a bun with black sesame inside - all were SO GOOD!. . I was really happy with our meal here. The restaurant is VERY clean (so are their bathrooms) and the service is amazing. They all work as a team here and pick up your trays as soon as you are picking up the last piece. Your water is constantly filled and they come by regularly to ask how you are doing. . . This place lives up to the hype!
