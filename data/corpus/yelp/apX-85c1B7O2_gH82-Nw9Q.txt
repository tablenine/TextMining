"Comfort Food For The Soul". . I've eaten at Roscoe's plenty of times but last night was the first time in such a long time. I was reminded again of how GREAT it was, I just had to Yelp about it the next day. We had just come from a Dodger game, hungry as hell, and was hoping to find something that would hit the spot. Roscoe's came to mind and luckily we made it before closing time. It was a little after 11pm and surprisingly, it wasn't that busy. Roscoe's is usually packed with hungry late night party-goers on Saturday nights. I ordered my usual, the Carol C. Special, which is "one succulent breast and one delicious waffle", according to their menu, and of course a side of Mac 'N Cheese. That, is the ultimate combo right there, no joke. Whoever came up with this sinful but yummy combination is pure genius. I took that first bite, savored every flavor and every texture, and thought to myself, "Wow, I'm in Soul Food heaven right now." After that, I hoovered my plate instantly and immediately fell into a food coma. So NOT healthy but so DAMN good!!!! Next time I'll come prepared in my stretch pants. I love Roscoe's!
