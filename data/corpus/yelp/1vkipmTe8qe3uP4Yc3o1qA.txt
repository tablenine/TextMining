This is definitely a popular brunch spot on the weekends, so if you don't want to wait 45 minutes to an hour for a table, drop in on a weekday. I have had so many awesome lunches here! There are very few things on the menu that aren't terrific, and if you know your own palate well enough, the menu descriptions won't trick you into ordering something you don't like. Heaping sides of steak fries if you want them. Really yummy salads (try the spicy ranch dressing!). And the Poached Y Papas is hands-down the most decadent benedict I've ever had. I order it with bacon instead of the ham steak, but it's great both ways. The opposite of heart-healthy...but great!
