I absolutely love this place. I love the wings and the fish, and the spinach bacon. YUM! I love the decor too. Very Japanese. It gets very crowded. There is a bar area, a seating area...can be tight, and an area where you sit on the floor with the low table.. . Price is good, but it adds up because we usually order seconds..haha
