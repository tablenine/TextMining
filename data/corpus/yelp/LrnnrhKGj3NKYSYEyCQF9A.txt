My friends and I came here for a birthday celebration and had a wonderful time as a whole.  Service was courtesy and prompt, the clientele skews more towards sophisticated young professionals.  I liked the dimly lit ambience though the bathrooms were a pain to get to (think downstairs down a long / steep set of stairs).  Downstairs is the loud nightclub with reserved seating, raucous people, and drunk guys in blazers who have no problem bumping / knocking over girls.  The mixed drinks are noticeably weaker when ordering carafes and some of the servers are more service oriented than others.  As a whole, it was a pricey evening but more precious because it was a celebration of great friends in the city.  I would come back here for dinner on the first floor but would skip the downstairs altogether.
