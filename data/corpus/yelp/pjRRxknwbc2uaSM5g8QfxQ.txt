Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
You go here for the pizza and that's it. I ordered the pasta once and it was totally forgettable. . . They have hand-tossed crust that it the perfect amount of crispness. There are some interesting toppings...mine are eggplant cutlet with garlic, which is to die for! The mushrooms are canned, which are the only things that aren't fresh. But there's something intriguing about canned mushrooms. They work perfectly on their pies. . . Over the years, I've probably eaten here a dozen or more times and gotten take-out as much, if not more. The secret to not sitting in a ridiculously long line is to get there when they open for dinner. If you're ordering to pick up a pizza, call 45 minutes to an hour before you're going to be ready to eat it. If you're already hungry when you get there or when you call, you're going to be pretty pissed off by the time you finally get your food. They're popular and they cook to order, they can't do anything about that. . . If you are going to go there to eat, relax, maybe order a glass of wine to sip either in their chairs outside or inside the waiting area, and chitchat about all the random celebrity photos on their walls. There are some doozys.. . Guys get and added bonus because the high school waitresses all wear short denim skirts.
