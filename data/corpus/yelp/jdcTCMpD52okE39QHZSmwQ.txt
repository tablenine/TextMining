Restaurant: Mirai
Category: Sushi Bars
While a bit on the pricy said, Mirai is a wonderful restaurant in an area where I honestly didn't expect much great sushi restaurants to be.  With character and a great deal of style, the sushi restaurant offers a wide array of great maki and other rolls that will really surprise you! The service was extraordinary and very attentive.  They were more than will to accomodate our every need.  Not quite the family sushi restaurant, but a very intimate ambiance offers a great place to take a date.  The downstairs can be a bit crowded and have the feeling of congestion, but if you do end up checking out this great restaurant - definitely take a glance upstairs and i promise you will not regret it - specifically ask for seating upstairs your first time there!!
