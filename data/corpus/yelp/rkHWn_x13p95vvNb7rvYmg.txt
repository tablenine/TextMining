My friend took me here. We arrived at 11:05am and there was already a line. I believe it was opened at 11:15 and we promptly were ushered in. Somewhere behind us the line was cut off and the people were told to wait a while since the restaurant was at capacity. . . We both ordered the sashimi plate and I soon realized that almost everybody was ordering the same thing. It came not even 5 minutes after we ordered. Boy, the chefs must have anticipated the sashimi plate order rush and armed themselves before opening the doors to us. . . What makes this place so famous for its sashimi plate? Well, it could be the very fresh pieces of fish, it could be the generous thick slices, it could be the colorful variety or it could be the sweetly smoked tuna, which I totally love. I should bring my husband here. He'd thank me so much. LOL
