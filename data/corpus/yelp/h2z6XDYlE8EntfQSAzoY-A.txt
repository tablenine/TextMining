I'm not really sure why this place has such low ratings. It's a tad bit overpriced, and I probably would *NEVER* go here on a night when it's fully priced (every other night than Monday), but I wouldn't hate on the food because of it.. . I think the lamb is fantastic. It's moist, crisp on the edges, and absolutely mouth watering. The tuna tartar was SOOO delish! For ANY tuna lovers out there, absolutely get this!. . The martini is pretty strong (that's a good thing, I think)...and for $12ish for one it should be.. . I definitely recommend anyone who wants to do fine dining for the fraction of the price to go here (only on Mondays!). It's worth it :)
