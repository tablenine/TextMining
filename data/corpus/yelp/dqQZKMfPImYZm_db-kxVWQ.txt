Sorry, I know there's already gazillion reviews of this place but I stinkin love it and had to be the gazillion +1. . . Best Ramen place I've had so far! Love the broth. Great for hangovers. Only bad thing is that there's always a line. BUT well worth it! . . And you can walk over and get some yogurtland for dessert. :)
