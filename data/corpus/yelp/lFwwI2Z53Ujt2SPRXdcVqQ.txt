Been meaning to write a review for ages as I have visited about 10 times, LOVE the cranberry margaritas (thanks to the lovely Gretchen O's recommendation) and their regular and spinach queso options are excellent. . . Chips are also hot, fresh, salty and plentiful. All in all this makes for a thirsty and happy Ali who is craving one of those aforementioned cranberry margaritas out on their lovely shaded patio...right about now! . . They specialize in soft tacos which are offered a la carte at a very reasonable price $2-3 so you can build your own plate as desired. Chicken ones are superior to the beef in my experience.... . The major downside is the ATROCIOUS parking situation- no valet, minimal "legal" parking in their lot and strong threats of being 'booted' in the neighboring (Blockbuster) strip mall lot. ugh. . . Walk if possible so you can stumble home or carpool with a designated driver as a back up plan and enjoy some fabulous. creative margaritas and queso in a crowded but not overly pretentious atmosphere. Friendly, efficient bartenders too! :)
