Restaurant: Ri Ra Irish Pub
Category: Irish
In the midst of all the clubs and restaurants sits the Irish pub known as Ri Ra. I, for one- am very pleased a place like this opened up in Midtown to provide a place of variety for a nice cold drink after work.. . I've been to this place a few times and the staff is extremely nice and attentive even though the place always seemed packed during the week. Can't really mess up the beer, so that will be untouched. I found the food to be typical of Irish fare but found my Shephard's pie to be lacking in flavor.. . Overall, great atmosphere to just go, relax and hang out with friends! Live music is also always a treat.
