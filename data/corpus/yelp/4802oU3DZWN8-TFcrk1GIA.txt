Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Indie hands down cooks up the the best green and panang curry in the city. The sushi is not too shabby either but the real reason to go is for the curry.. . I lived in the neighborhood and my wife and I would eat and indie once a week. It's very affordable, BYOB, great service and they deliver too if you don't feel like leaving the house!
