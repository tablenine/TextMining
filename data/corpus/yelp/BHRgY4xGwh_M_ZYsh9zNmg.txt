Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Have you ever wanted to know what it was like to eat leftover pancakes for 3 days straight?. . Yeah, that's what you get when you order one from the Griddle Cafe. The pancakes are so ginormous that you have to take it home and finish it off over the course of the week. SO DELICIOUS.. . The wait totally blows though.. . So does using the word "ginormous" make me a douche? That's so sad. It used to be such a cool word. Like 3 years ago.
