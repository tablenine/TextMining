this is the best place downtown hands down. it has great outdoor seating in the summer (in fact that's really all i've partaken in so far) and a good crowd. you can watch the dog parade outside too--always a number of cute dogs passing by or stopping to say hello. they used to have franziskaner on thier list, but they've recently gone back to another weiss beer that's equally delicious. the fish and chips is great, awesome burgers and the wedge salad is to die for. it's typical bar food done well and then some atypical veggie options which are always nice. potato tacos is one that leaps to mind as well as a good quesidilla.
