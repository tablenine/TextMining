We had breakfast at Bottega Louie and it was delicious.  I had the ham and cheese Fritta and it was cooked perfectly.  Excellent non-fat cappuccino .  I expected prices to be much more expensive and was pleasantly surprised.  Couldn't leave without some of their scrumptous pastires and outstanding bread.  Their bread selection is great and now I wished I would have brought home one of their chocolate baguettes.  Hmmmm....my daughter lives two blocks away maybe I could have have her express mail me a couple!  Will be returning the next time we are vising Jen and George!
