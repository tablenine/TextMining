Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
when anyone asks me what restaurant they should visit while they're in la, i always mention bottega louie.. . i keep my bottega louie card endearingly in my wallet to make sure i can conveniently EXHIBIT how amazing this place is. the card exudes classiness and quality food.. . and if there's one thing that has me attached to this restaurant and makes me dream of constantly - it's the chocolate souffle. completely worth the wait.. . when anyone asks me what my favorite dish is - bottega louie chocolate souffle, hands down.
