Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
This place was amazing and I'm not even vegetarian. The place was unbelievably packed on a Saturday afternoon. They have outdoor seating though just in case. The strawberry lemonade is yummy and their sweet potatoe fries are so good as well. Didn't think veggie plates could taste this good, definitely a keeper.
