Been coming here since it was Jim's Burger when the pastrami was leaner and much cheaper...$6.99 to $10+. But I love this uber-diner joint's selection: fresh brewed beer on tap, burgers with guyere cheese and belgian fries.  This is my first choice for cheeseburgers, cuz it's a grownup's version. Compliments on the condiments: even the ketchup has style with a bit of a burn. Unfortunately, Da Oink's getting so popular that we need more indoor seating, especially in the chillier weather.  Love the big windows and the xeriscaped foliage on the patio. Kudos to Andre for a classy addition to Eagle Rock! But I must admit that I am a bit of a pastrami fuss-budget...while well-seasoned and falling apart moist and warm, there are too many strings and lines o' fat. Take me to Langers or Canters where I won't kvetch, but Oinkster can't be beat for hanging with yer homies over burgers &amp; brew.
