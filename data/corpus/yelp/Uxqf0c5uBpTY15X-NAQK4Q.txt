I like all the food that I've eaten here.  It's a place that serves truly delicious food in a small/hip bar.  My favorites are the rice noodles and pumpkin ravioli.  Also a great place to go with vegetarian friends, we went with veggie friends on our second trip and they really liked it.  A very eclectic menu and the waitstaff left me a bit puzzled but worth going and going with friends so you can share a bunch of plates.
