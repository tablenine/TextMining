I've been here a couple of times now -- once for dinner and today for lunch.  The dinner was more impressive than the lunch experience, and all I remember was that I was pleased with my monk fish dish.  Both times I have not been blown away by the food -- it's OK, but I don't think it justifies the price.. . For lunch today I had the pain bagnet sandwich with a mixed green salad.  The sandwich was decent, though I have had better, many of which I have made myself, and the mixed green salad seemed to be overloaded with lemon zest.  Each time I would take a forkful of salad I would pucker up from sourness.  Next time I am getting the dressing on the side.. . Service was prompt and attentive.  We weren't able to switch to another table initially as we were told by the hostess that the table was reserved, but that table sat empty until we pretty much finished our meal.  Hmmm.. . Also, and thankfully I caught this before eating anything, there was a HAIR on my bread plate.  Obviously, this was taken care of immediately, but it was not a great way to start a dining experience.
