it's good, but overrated as others said. The long waiting line alone doesn't justify, where there are equally good dumpling on Valley Blvd (cross street between Del Mar and Prospect). Yi Tiau Loong (One Dragon) and Kum Gong (Jin Kong in Mandarin if i put it correctly) are both hosted in the same plaza located kitty-corner from the 99 Ranch mall or direct opposite from the new Fisherman Wharf and Captain Crab / Boiling-Crab-rip-off.
