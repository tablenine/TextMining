Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
This location is a litte "newer" looking, probably because it is the newest addition to the Porto's.  The original being in Glendale.  Still packs them in though.. . Tasty, tasty, tasty...tortas and MORE empanadas, and yummy breads!. . And oh yeah, still ridiculously cheap.  . . Thank you for opening this location.  Now before I catch a flight at Burbank airport and head back for home, mom always swings by to grab lunch before I leave, AND send me home with my own little Porto's box to go.  But not before she says:. . Are you really going to eat all those things?  I'll pay for it as long as you eat it!. . Me:  Mom, I will!. . Ok, but they'll spoil soon so you have to eat them quick!. . (No prob...)
