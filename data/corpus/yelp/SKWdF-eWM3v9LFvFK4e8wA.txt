My Rating: 3.5 Stars, not including the Star Celebrity sighting: Mr. Kanye West. . Maybe Kanye got it right by lunching it at Jean George's American Noveau hot spot in the middle of bustling Soho. . . The cool industrial interior was a nice getaway from the torching outside temperatures. The downstairs dining room was dark and a lot smaller than I had originally thought, but the A/C worked so I was elated. . . Our group was seated right by the kitchen with the long wooden tables, which provided us a perfect view of the chefs. Each person was given a roll and then a little bowl of fresh olive oil is placed on the table. The olive oil was pretty spectacular and you could even taste the fruitiness of the olives. Salt and pepper wasn't necessary. . . For entrees, we ordered the Steamed Shrimp salad with avocados, tomatoes tossed with a champagne vinaigrette and the Chicken BLT sandwich. Both were delicious entrees, but I wasn't surprised or amazed by anything. All were flavors I've tasted before, but I could tell that they only used the freshest ingredients with the best quality. The mayonnaise on my sandwich was freshly made in house with a kick of cayenne pepper. The potato chips were fried shortly after my order has been placed and the herb chicken was succulent. . . For a Jean George restaurant, the prices were fair, but I feel like I could have found any of these entrees at Olive's, down a few blocks from Mercer Kitchen. I wish my taste buds were blown away by some kind of food awesomeness (Kanye doesn't count), but they were satisfied nonetheless.
