let's be real here for a sec, cause i don't think anyone wants any body's "worst coochie", but i can see how the phallic shape might inspire the mind to revert to giving things silly names.. . if you want to learn the real way to pronounce the name go to this website:. . http://dict.leo.org/?l.... . search the words "Wurst" and "Küche" separately and click on the yellow speaker icons to hear a pronunciation of each, meaning "sausage kitchen" when combined.  . . otherwise there is a german guy who works there and another guy who speaks german.  they will gladly help give you a free german lesson for the day.
