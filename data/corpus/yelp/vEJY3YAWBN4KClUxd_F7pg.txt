Seems like every time I come here I get this dude that looks like Mr. Show as my waiter, and he's terrible.  He's nice and friendly, just forgets about his tables and BSes with the staff way too much.  I also don't like how he jams the bill down his pants - he jams that thing down there a little too far.  If you get Mr. Show, don't sit around waiting for him to bring the check, you might have to get up and grab him.  . . I always forget that this place is an acceptable option - I guess it just doesn't make that much of an impression.  The food menu is as limited as the wine/drink list is unlimited if that makes any sense.  I think there's only like 6 entrees and 3 pizzas to choose from.  But the entrees are done well, I've never had a problem with the food.  So despite Mr. Show, I'll probably be back sometime.
