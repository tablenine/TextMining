Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I've never seen this place WITHOUT a line going out the door....for what, I'm not so sure. I tried the classic taco and a bean &amp; cheese burrito (the menu isn't very extensive, which is fine) and it was all pretty average. Lots of shredded neon orange cheese, flavor-less iceberg lettuce and shredded beef are all that a taco includes, but the extra side of watery salsa made it slightly more flavorful. It's cheap and tastes good, but I would imagine that the thousand other Mexican joints around it-and around the rest of LA-serve up the same (or better) corn tortillas with meat, beans and cheese. Nice try though, Tito.
