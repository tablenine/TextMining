Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
Burrata Puglia = *Heaven in a Bowl*. Best Mozzarella I've ever had!. Osteria Mozza is a Batali restaurant and definitely lives up to the hype. . Summary:. - Burrata Puglia: Flown in weekly from Puglia, simple, pure mozzarella at its best. Tasted like Clouds lightly swished in olive oil. Light but creamy. Amazing when spread on the grilled bread. - Burrata with honeyed walnut and roasted rosemary on crostini. YUM!. - Burrata grilled with bacon served like grilled cheese. Probably not my fave of the Mozza trio, but quite tasty. - Grilled Octopus: Wow. Best Octopus I've ever had. It was such a simple dish but grilled to perfection, tasted lightly of the ocean, perfect grilled marks. - Squid Ink Chitarra Freddi with Dungeness Crab, Sea Urchin &amp; Jalapeno, served Cooled: Very interesting and Perfect for Summer! The portion was fairly small, but tasty. The sea urchin was FRESH and creamy and the pasta was light and subtle. Tasted like the sea...MmMMMm. - Vongole: I had half of my friend's plate of vongole! I'll have to say...my 2nd fave vongole i've ever tasted! (1st being PO in NYC...incidentally, used to be a Batali restaurant!). The al dente pasta was coated in a very lightly creamy butter and bacon and the dish had chunks of bacon (i prefer smaller pieces) and large clams. Awesome. - Carbonara: My friend's carbonara was very tasty. It was a little diff from trad carbonara, but in a good way. Finished Tableside. . I'd come back just for the Mozzarella...and probably the vongole too! . *LOVE*
