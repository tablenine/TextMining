Restaurant: Koronet Pizza
Category: Pizza
Pizza Place near Columbia Univ. . . Take Number 1 to 110, its right in front of you when you leave the North exit of 110 street (Uptown). . Regular cheese slice with no toping is like 2.75, used to be 50 cents once upon a time. . The only point worth mentioning is the size. its larger than your HEAD. . The pizza used to be better but they put too little cheese and too little sauce, basically its getting fucked up day by day. . . well anyways worth an experience to eat a slice of cheese pizza thats bigger than your head.. . 1 star for the ingenuity.
