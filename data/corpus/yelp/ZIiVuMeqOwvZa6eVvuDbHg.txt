I once wrestled a bear for two tickets inside Magic Castle, but unfortunately he won.  From there I continued plotting ways to get inside this enchanted kingdom of sleight of hand.  I sold my left kidney to a man named "Little Bill" in West Hollywood, I waxed all my body hair including my eye brows, and gave away my entire collection of micro machines, but still had no luck with tickets.  Actually I'm not sure why I did any of that stuff.  No one offered me tickets for any of it.  God, sometimes I'm so stupid.  . . Little did I know all you really have todo is call them up and politely ask how to get tickets.  If you catch the right person on the phone and it's not a busy day, usually they'll tell you to come on down.  If you get the chance, don't miss it.  Here's a tip, go for the magic and not the food.  It's bland.  But the magic is great.  And they have three different bars inside.
