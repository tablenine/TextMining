Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I've always heard that Orochon's ramen wasn't that great because Daikokuya was just down the street and Daikokuya's ramen is better. I beg to differ. I think Orochon's ramen is pretty good. There's about 7 or 8 levels of spiciness, the spiciest one even lets you take a picture to put on the wall. If you finish it all.. . Both the broth and the noodles here is decent and the portions are huge. There are plenty of seats but they're a little squished together since the shop isnt' very big. Even if you have to wait, the turn-over is pretty fast so you wouldn't have to wait for long.. . I don't like waiting in lines for my food so Orochon is definitely my go-to for ramen.
