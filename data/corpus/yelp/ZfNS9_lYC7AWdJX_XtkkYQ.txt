When the concierge couldn't get us reservations 'til after 10pm at the earliest on a Thursday night, we new we must be in for a treat.  . . The ambiance was perfect- dimly lit, yet bustling and full of good looking people and tasty plates of food passing by.  I instantly felt comfortable yet classy.. . I was daunted by the menu, because I couldn't understand a word of it, but began to relax when the hearty glass of cab started to warm my belly.  . . The waiter brought a delicious amuse bushe  of goat cheese and basil on a crostini, and lots of bread with extra soft butter and O &amp; V.. . We started with a salad that contained peas, asparagus cheese and other toppings. Not even exaggerating...It was one of the best i've ever had!. . I decided to just let my party do the ordering...(I've been trying to go with the flow lately at restaurants) and just sit back and take it all in.. . We ordered the ravioli which melted in your mouth it was so tender and the pasta was crafted so thinly you could taste the delicious meat tucked neatly inside.. . We also got the linguini with clams,  pancetta and chili's .  Served al dente with whole huge steaming clams and the largest chunks of pancetta i've ever seen. . . The 2nd course was Grilled Quail wrapped in pancetta with sage &amp; honey...This one just blew my mind...I can't describe to you how vivid this food gasm was because I was temporarily out of this world.. . To wrap it up we had an apricot pie with ice cream and a strawberry something....to be honest dessert was a blur...too many glasses of wine.. . All in all, the experience was incredible and I would do it again gladly.. . PS...this place is really expensive, so make sure you bring someone with a big wallet.
