Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm giving them 4 stars for their variety. I mean really you can't have dogs like this anywhere else....of course if you got a hold of their menu, you can do it yourself.. . This place is for the experience, you wait 30 minutes to and hour to order. when you get your dogs you wonder why you paid that much for a hot dog that small...it's all about the hype and TOPPINGS. my girlfriend and I got like 10 hotdogs just to try all the variety. That was the only time I went 2 years ago. It's not that the food was bad that I didn't go back, the wait was just way too long.
