Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
WOW. if you want your tastebuds stimulated in every way possible... Father's Office is the place to do it. I have never, in my many years of taking food seriously, have had my mouth salivate, nor my breathing regulated by flavor and variety. . . Our group started off with the sweet potato fries, shoe string fries accompanied with special dipping sauces which compliment each type of fry.. . The house famous burgers cooked medium, and boy did they get that right. All the juices were where they were supposed to be... IN THE BURGER!. . We also had the the grilled eggplant and figs which drip and coat flavor throughout your eating cavity. Along with the soft shell crab...Fried...AMAZING. not over cooked not under cooked. It literally falls apart in your mouth. . . Father's Office I applaud you and your staff. I will be returning again very very soon. . . Did I mention the WALL-O-BEER... FANTASTICO.
