Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Came here for a friends bday and traffic was horrenous due to the AIDS walk...so I would think that since the restaurant knew that was going to happen, they'd be calling their guests who made prior reservations to let them know that 99.9% of all the roads were pretty much blocked, esp Melrose.. . The decor was nice, open space, great for a beautiful sunny day. They have outdoor and indoor seating (within view if you want to watch). Service staff was very attentive and very accomodating to our large group.. . However going on, we had a larger group of about 14 people, so there was a prix fix which consisted of the following:. . chicken cannelloni. Sweet Crêpes, Cremini Mushroom Marsala Sauce,. White Cheddar Cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese,. Broccolini, Sautéed Cherry Tomatoes. . chopped sabrosa salad. Romaine Lettuce, Chicken Breast, Roasted Corn, Tomatoes,. Black Beans, White Cheddar Cheese, Jicama, Cilantro,. Avocado, Red Onion, Honey-Jalapeno Vinaigrette. . taste club. Chicken Breast, Apple wood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Chipotle Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato,. Country White or Whole Wheat, Pommes Frites or Mixed Greens. . The chicken cannelloni and taste club were really really good, people couldn't stop eating them, however the salad was...a salad.. . I've read about their other amazin food, but I can't review anything better than a 3.5 star since this was based on my experience here. However, one fantastic fact that I learned about this place is that their happy hour extends to the weekends from 4pm -6pm so if you're looking for a happy hour place in melrose on sat and sun...go to Taste!
