We showed up at 7pm on a Tuesday and waited about 35 minutes to get one of the precious seats that throws in a free steam facial before you calm the water with your dinner. Â Alright, so the owner sat a party of 5 right before us despite having shown up at least 5 minutes earlier, so the bf was starting to get cranky at the wait after that and hinted that this better be really good, after all was said and done we both walked out with extremely full bellies and very happy with the meal. I just used the extra waiting time to watch what everyone else was doing, cuz I surely didn't have a clue beforehand.. . Thankfully, the owner gave us a lesson when we sat-making our sauce and adding onions to the water for us naive newbies to shabu shabu dining. I got the 10 piece order and was seriously stuffed with 2 pieces of the thinly sliced beef left. I got my meat lean but still had lots of fatty bits to tear off once the meat cooked. The meat was so tender and thin however, that this was very easy. I suppose if you ignore the veggies you can eat all the cow parts without trouble but the veggies are such good vehicles for that delicious orange sauce. Mmmm, sauce. . . I'd for sure come back, I didn't feel any pressure to eat quick and get out, and besides, after waiting just to sit I wasn't about to give myself a tummy ache shoveling the food down. It was fun cooking my own food ("Huh? What's that about?" Yeah, I don't cook much that isn't prefrozen....), I just need to make sure I don't eat anything for 6 hours prior so I don't feel quite so full waddling out.
