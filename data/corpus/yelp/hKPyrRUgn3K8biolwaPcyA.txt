Like some other reviewers, I agree that the food is not as strong as it could be, but we're talking about very inexpensive, diner-type fare. You get what you'd expect. I've had the falafel wrap (a little dry), cheese fries (goopey and standard), the New Yorker scramble (quite delicious) and a salad or two.. . I've got a massive sweet tooth and am a dessert connoisseur, so when my friend told me I absolutely had to get a vegan milkshake, I was moody and suspicious from the get-go. But then my life changed for the better. This place would be a 3-star joint were it not for the most amazing milkshakes I've ever had in my life. Its an extra buck when you ask for the vegan ice cream, but its so worth it. Its adorable when the server gently tries to remind me that the cheesy goodness in my meal is not vegan, but I let her know that I'm just in it for the milkshakes. Thank you, Pick Me Up, for being open late so I can get this fix anytime I want.
