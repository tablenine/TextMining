Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
I was here last night and realized I had been here before. When I first saw the menu, my immediate reaction was WTF is all this shit#$#$#? Duck Taquitos, Kobe cheek, etc, etc. I realized they had given fancy names to a bunch of normal food. I got a burger and two glasses of wine.  . . If you are really ambitious they actually have a whole pig( no joke) on the menu. But you have to call 8-10 days in advance. I would imagine no Indian person is making plans to eat an entire pig. I really started to wonder what it might be like to call them about that pig. . . Potential Customer: Hello, 10 days from now I want to eat an entire pig. What needs to happen? . . Ford's: Good thing you called us now. Are you going to eat it yourself? . . Potential Customer: I haven't thought about it, but sure, why not? . . Ford's: are you sure. . Potential Customer: If I wasn't sure, why the hell would I be making this plan to eat an entire pig 10 days in advance.. . Actually, it turns out that people order this all the time according to the bartender.  I just though it was a funny way to put something on the menu.
