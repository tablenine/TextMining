Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
Decided to venture out for a little pizza...I love pizza. I'm from NJ so crust, cheese, and sauce are in my veins!!!. . I decided to try Antico Pizza, I first called to see what time they closed and they told me....."when we run out of dough miss." We tried the Margarita pizza, I went with a New Yorker so I think we were already a bit  testy, lol. My verdict...it is truly authentic and super fresh! I will try it again, the New Yorker will pass, it wasn't his fav. . . Remember there is no bar, or soda. You have  your pick of waters, peach tea, and other Italian beverages. I did see people with wine, but not sure if it was BYOB!!! lol
