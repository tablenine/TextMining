I happened upon a revelation one day about a month back: I need more taco truck in my life. Here I am, in LA and sure enough, the go-to taco truck informs us on Twitter that they are a couple of blocks away. No time was wasted in pursuit from that point.. . And who would have thought, the delicious taco truck of my dreams was not run by Mexicans, but Koreans! You can't go wrong with exquisite fare like Short Rib Burritos and Kimchi Sliders.. . It's Korean BBQ wrapped in tortillas and served from a truck. Go before the line gets too long!
