We had our company holiday party here last year (2007). Â I was not very impressed. We have about 250 employees in our company and the place was uncomfortably PACKED. Seating was very limited.. . We were served buffet style and there is no real way to line up for their set up. We had a line going downstairs towards the coat check and the weird smoking room (which probably is no longer a smoking room) downstairs that smells like hell. The food was nothing to write home about either. The salad was just as good as what you can get anywhere else. The beef from the carving station was decent. There were also pizza appetizers that were being passed around that were okay. Food seemed nothing to write home about.. . "Hang the DJ" is appropriate for this place. I don't know what the deal is when you book an event here but the music was that of what you could hear at the Pizza Hut jukebox circa 1997.. . The pictures on their website are definitely more flattering than the place itself. This place is for the folks that want to be seen and like being a yuppie.
