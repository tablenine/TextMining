great great GREAT place. . From the moment you walk in you feel very New York...very "Sex in The City"....lol. . had lunch there today with the office for one of my co-workers birthday.. . I wasn't super hungry...so I have the Veggie Lentil soup but everything else look amazing. Especially the PIZZA!!! . . Made me wish I was hungrier today, def going back very soon to try more :)
