Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
let me just say I never knew the area where this restaurant is located was SO HAPPENING! so many people eating out at so many hip restaurants on this row! lucky to have found parking in a free 2 hour parking structure behind even though it said "lot full"!!. . honestly i think the portions here are GREAT.. makes me feel healthy and unAMERICAN. . . however TASTE-wise.. tender greens did not sell it to me.. the tuna salad was very sour and acidic w/ capers and olives but the tuna was good!. . the chinese chicken salad which is suppose to be one of their best.. lacked flavor in my opinion.. . . but the steak was yummy!.. but mash potatoes were bland. . ALL INGREDIENTS WERE FRESH AND DELICIOUS LOOKIN. . however for 10.50 a plate... don't get me wrong.. i'm not complaining about the amount of food, that was fine!.. but taste wise.. i'd rather go elsewhere. . how it works btw.. order at the front... pay for it at the register.. TRY TO FIND SEATING YOURSELF!
