Excellent food, service and most importantly, attention to detail. I've been here maybe 5 times, it's consistent, pleasant and most of all, the service is impeccable. Every time we've been here, the dapper GM has gone out of his way to come over and talk to us. Very classy service and impressive that they log your name each time they seat you and remember you when you return.. . Everything I've eaten here has been exceptional, with only one exception- I had a bowl of lentil soup last night that tasted weird. Not bad, not good, just odd. The GM whisked it away and replaced it with a tomato soup that was delicious, as always. A nice touch.. . Some standout items- the Modena salad is fantastic. The beets with goat cheese and arugula, the burrata, tomato soup and the pizzas are so delicious. They even use very high quality arugula, which is key. And the chocolate souffle- worth the 25 minute wait, but share it. It's rich!!. . I'll keep going back. The only teeny thing I do not like about it is the cafeteria acoustics. It gets crazily loud. I know they want that barren/clean look but they make acoustic material that would be essentially invisible and cut the noise by a huge amount. It would be better, more brasserie, less high school cafeteria (on the noise level). Of course, I can live with it, but it would be more of a romantic spot with less chatter.
