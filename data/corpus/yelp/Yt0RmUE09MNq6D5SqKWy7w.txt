So this will be the 311th review for Alcove.  Is this necessary?  Nope.  Who cares.. . I've been here twice and had the same thing twice, despite poring over the menu and vacillating between a bevy of delicious choices.  The way I see it?  I hit the jackpot the first time, I feel no need to deviate.  Maybe ever.. . The jackpot?  Turkey burger.  No cheese.  Apple slaw.  Thank me later.
