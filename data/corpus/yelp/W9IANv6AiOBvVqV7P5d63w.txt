I will fair.....usually Italian food is last on my list for lunch or dinner or any other meals in between.  There are certain dishes that I love, and certain I would rather not.  . . Maggianos is one of those places where I can't seem to love or really even like anything.  I went last Sunday and ordered three dishes and shared it.  The lobster ravioli was so dry and crunchy.....isn't it supposed to be creamy and smooth?  It seems like they stuck the plate in the oven and pulled it out when the ravioli looked nice and dry.  The chicken caccitore was so stewy that you couldn't get a real italian flavor and the chicken piccatta came out on a bed of spinach (tasted like frozen spinach) and the chicken breast was chewy and had a lot of fatty parts that were not taken out.  I was so disappointed!  The only thing that was amazing there was their tiramisu.  The place was packed for a Sunday night, so they must be doing something right.  Two stars because the tiramisu was the only thing I enjoyed and the service was pretty good.
