Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
And for my next TRICK...i'll be reviewing the MAGIC CASTLE. . Hollywood is known for its lavish style and old time glamor. What better way to show that in this turn of the century castle. Off Franklin avenue, you'll find a baroque exterior and subtle waterfalls as you drive up the curvaceous driveway. The affable clean-cut valet will open your door to a world of mystery and magic.. . OPEN SESAME!!!!. . Inside you'll find a magic club that is reminiscent of a secret hangout during the prohibition years. The restaurant upstairs offers prompt and professional service. This is to be expect as the price is relevant of its high quality service. Steaks and seafood fill their hefty menu with a few alternative choices for the picky eater in you. Generous portions will make your taste buds fall deeply in love with each groan of satisfaction.. . Be Sure to book your party early as the shows typically run early. Also make note that there is absolutely NO standing or saving seats for their first come, first Serve magic shows.. . I have been fortunate enough to have attended this magic club a handful of times during my life. I have always been impressed with the club's devotion to perfecting the art of magic. You will come across many tricks that you have seen before as a child but with an entirely different twist and style that will live you in awe and wonder.. . There are plenty of the magicians waiting around the bar and lounge areas to perform close-up tricks to give your visit a more personal touch. Just about all of their performers dazzle you with quick-witted humor and mind-blowing illusions.. . If you ever get the chance to visit the magic castle, make sure you visit IRMA, the piano ghost to amuse with an encyclopedia of music on her grand piano. Leaving the castle will cause you perplexed yet captivated by your experience.
