Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
Pick Me Up Cafe is a nice, cheap place to go. They have an innovative menu that surpasses the fares of traditional diner-like establishments. The prices are very reasonable and you certainly get your money's worth.. . They have an amazing breakfast selection. The french toast is delicious. The lunch and dinner menus are also great. I recently had the grilled cheese with a heaping portion of french fries and Diet Coke for less than $10.. . The service is also decent.
