This place is amazing!  I love coming here whenever I have the chance.  The desserts and sandwiches are beyond heavenly!  Also, the prices are very reasonable.  I like the fact that they have traditional Cuban food along with non-Cuban desserts and food.  My favorite things to order are the potato balls, medianoche, triple chocolate mousse, fruit tart, and of course, the cheese rolls.  Try to avoid coming here during the weekends or during the lunch craze because parking can be difficult and the crowd is almost unbearable.. . You should definitely come here if you haven't yet.  You won't be disappointed if you like sandwiches and desserts.
