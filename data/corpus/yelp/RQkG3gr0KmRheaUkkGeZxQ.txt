Love this place.  I am the 159th review... but I had such a great lunch here that I just have to report... . . We had a long lazy sneak-out-of-work lunch.  Chop salad and fish tacos. You can't really mess up chop salad, but the fish taco was surprisingly good.  Lightly battered tilapia, with diced sweet potatoes and a creamy sauce.  . . Others have said it: this place has a great vibe, varied menu, and it induces conversation.  Seriously.
