My absolute favorite thai place.  I love love love the green curry.  The tom ka soup is pretty amazing.  I know it's pretty basic, but they also make the most perfect fried tofu appetizer.  We usually call in our order and get it to go.  I usually order more than we'll eat because i love leftovers for the next day.  I try to eat here everytime i'm in the LA area.
