Sweet Lord. The food here was amazing (I had the pork and string beans and my friend had the sesame scallops) and I didn't even care that our fortune cookies were served on a likely unsanitary ping pong paddle that may have been housed with the Brady's by the looks of it, because said cookies were dipped in chocolate. It's the little things.. . However, unfortunately, I was not wearing my shiny shirt and booty shorts, which would've been more appropriate for this club type atmosphere. While the music in the restaurant forced me to beller at my dinner companion (and no,I was not angry), the volume in the bathroom could've made my ears bleed if I needed to stay in there long enough to touch up my makeup. I escaped as quickly as possible. Seriously, folks, Jupiter does not need to hear Madonna's new song. Even if it is a cool ass techno mix.. . In sum, I'm not sure I'll go back here because my favorite part of a nice dinner is the conversation. And frankly, I left with a sore throat after all that yelling.
