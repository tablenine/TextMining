How can you NOT love the concept of great food, strong alcohol which you can take everywhere in the mansion, and great fun entertainment all rolled in one?  Not to mention you get to dress up.  Classy!. . It feels like going to a party at someone's home with lots of alcohol.  There is a restaurant upstairs, and the food, surprisingly, was very good.  The magic acts (yes, that's the main purpose) are fun.  We didn't see any BIG acts (ie saw people in half, make my  money disappear), but the close-up ones are tons of fun, especially after couple of strong drinks. ;)  One older guy (sorry I forgot his name) messed up his card trick and we all felt bad for him.  Hopefully that night was not his try-out with the boss!. . Highly recommended for special occasions!
