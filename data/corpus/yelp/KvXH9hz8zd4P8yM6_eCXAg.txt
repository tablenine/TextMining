Love Love Love Milk! My bf and I go here at least once a month or whenever we're in the area.  The best thing is their macaroon ice cream sandwiches ... the best ice cream sandwiches I've ever had.  They also have a salted caramel milk shake that's so yummy! The affogato is also a great way to go, but you must add the brownie! I think i've eaten every dessert they have there.  The food is also good, but def not as memorable as the dessert.  Love this place!
