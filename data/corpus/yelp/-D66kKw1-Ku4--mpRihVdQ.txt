Meh... it wasn't my favorite place in the world, but I was craving something besides breakfast food at 11 am on a Sunday. The host was really nice. My sister and I strolled in hungover (morning after St. Patties) in our sweats (you don't need to dress up to eat here... but we definitely felt out of place) and my sister apologized for our appearances and the host said "what are you talking about? You look beautiful!" It was a lie... but he earned some brownie points. . . We started out with table side guacamole. It was pretty good. I'm one of those people who doesn't like a lot in their guac though. I usually just like garlic, salt, onion, and chunky avocado. Â My sister loved it though and said it was on the top 5 best she's ever had.. . Then we ordered the "Las Cazuelas" which were okay. The chorizo one was bomb... but I have a huge fucking crush on chorizo. The plantain was was decent... better at first and then just became dull, and then the mushroom one was good. . . Last, we split the corn- plantain pancakes. That was pretty good... different. I immediately placed one of the eggs over the top of the pancake and used the yolk as syrup and then sprinkled the chorizo and the agave syrup over it. I like to make a "sandwich" out of any meal.. . Next time I came here it would probably be for drinks and chips w/ gauc. Service was really good and so was atmosphere.
