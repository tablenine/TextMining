It is a rare day that I admit to being wrong. . . Mirai, I was wrong - wrong to accuse you of going downhill - wrong to avoid you. . . I think you were in fact going downhill, but you picked yourself up by the boot straps and you whipped yourself back into shape...back into mighty fine shape.. . Your hostess is amazing - polite, professional, and gives just the right dose of recognition. . . Your waitstaff - some are phenomenal, some are alright. But, overall no real complaints in that area. . . And your food...it's back. . . In fact, my attitude has changed so drastically about you, Mirai, that I often remark that while I'd like to find some other sushi restaurants, it always ends up being a waste of time since they are never as good as you. . . Sorry Mirai, I should have updated this review sooner. . . See you soon!!
