This place was great. Came with my sister and we got here a little before it opened for dinner so we sat at the bar. Friendly bartender, knew his stuff. Then we went into the dining room and throughout the whole meal the staff checked on us to make sure we were happy with everything. My steak was excellent and so was their signature dessert. My sister ordered a side of potatoes and they looked so good the table next us decided to order some.
