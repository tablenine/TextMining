My co-worker and I went here for his birthday lunch. Never heard about it, but when we passed by it I was like, "This is it?" I would have never known it was a restaurant. I drive by the place all the time on the way to work.. . Place is cool! All so very white, spacious, and full of energy! Hostess asked us if we had a reservation, though I didn't think we needed one since it was lunch, and she sat us down with ease regardless.. . My co-worker had the Penne Gamber and I had the eggplant parmesan. My dish was classic at best but the penne gamber is really delicious. I even took home the menu so I can try to cook some of the dishes at home. Which is what I did. I went to fresh and easy and made penne gamber at home! Instead of broccolini i used asparagus and it turned out just as good. Very light and perfect summer dish!. . The deli looks amazing! The macaroons looked sexy. But what caught my eye was the mini pineapple that they were selling in the deli for $0.50. They were so cute sitting in the palm of my hand.. . Anyways, good for lunch and dinner - no strict dress codes even though the place looks fancy - but its loud from all the chatter.
