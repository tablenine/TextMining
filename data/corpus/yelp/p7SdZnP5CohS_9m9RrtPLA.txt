Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Imagine a pouch of succulent pork with all of the juices contained.  That's what Din Tai Fung serves.  I want to know how they do it?  How do they keep the pork juices contained in the dough?  Anyway, a couple things to know about this place.  Come early - the wait is always long!  Their pork dumplings are to die for..they are a must order!  Food is not cheap and service is not personable.   . . We decided to come for Sunday brunch.  We arrived 10 minutes to 12 noon and waited about 35 minutes to be seated.  Not bad.  Usually the wait is atleast 45 minutes.  (The place is so popular they opened another one around the corner)  So amongst five of us, we ordered:. -Pork dumplings. -Pork &amp; crab dumplings. -Meat sauce noodle. -Spicy beef noodle soup. -Shrimp dumpling noodle soup. -Pork chop noodle soup soup. -Red bean dumplings. . Their noodle soups are good but the serving is only enough for one person.  Many of them are steamed so it's very healthy tasting but I still don't think they are a good value.  Regarding the dumplings, each order comes with ten pieces and runs about $8-$10 depending on which you order.  It's pricey but I'm willing to pay and obviously so are many others which is probably what justifies the prices.  The dumplings go well with the vinegar and ginger they serve.  I leave them soaking until I'm ready to devour.  So yum!  Our total for 5 people, about $60.  I hope they open a DTF in the Bay Area so I don't have to keep flying down to So Cal for brunch.
