Pinball earned the Highlander it's fifth star. Pinball is almost a thing of the past, the last manufacture of games is stern and the Highlander have three! Elvis is cranked a bit high and Nascar I can pass on but a perfectly working Pirates of the Caribbean, now that's just replay after replay. Stiff drinks, spicy Bloody Marys, and a nice beer selection. The Highlander has tons of space. Two large rooms inside and one covered heated outdoor space not to mention another entirely outdoor space. Pool tables, Air hockey, and Silver strike. Overall the Highlander is a wonderful dive where everyone can feel welcome.
