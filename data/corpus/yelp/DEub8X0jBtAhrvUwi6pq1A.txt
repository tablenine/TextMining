My first review for 2010 had to be left for here. Went here on Tuesday and had just an amazing dining experience. From the start to finish service was impeccable. I like a place that has the server come by and keep asking if you want bread. Starch fanatic, couldn't resist the flat bread and sour dough. Â My tuna sashimi just melted in my mouth. But, the best part was my truffle pizza. Let me tell you, it is NOT on the menu and I so happened to pass by another table and saw this delicious pizza, the waiter said it was the Truffle pizza. I didn't hesitate and said, " I'll have one of those" Alright... I didn't bother to ask how much either. In any case, all my friends loved the place and was so pleased that I picked this place. I always loved eating at Wolfgang pucks restaurants, from Cut and Seven. And have wanted to try this place for years. It was well worth the wait. The cool thing was Chef Puck stopped by our table, which he didn't have to, but it really makes a difference.( look I'm writing it in my review) Very friendly and he stopped by EVERY table. It was insanely crowded. This by far was the most expensive pizza I ever ate $145.00. And, I made sure to take home my last slice and write with a black sharpie for my son " DO NOT EAT OR ELSE" he wouldn't appreciate it :}
