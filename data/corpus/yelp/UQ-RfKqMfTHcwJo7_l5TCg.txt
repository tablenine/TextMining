Category: Mexican
I agree with fellow Yelpers: The wait was awful and very long 45 min-1hr.. . But, after sampling the taste bud glory of the Hollenbeck Burrito, I am completely satisfied. I couldn't even dent this thing, and I mean it's huge; People aren't exaggerating that it won't fit on a plate (it takes 2).. . The flavors explode in your mouth, the meat is tender and juicy, the beans and cheese ooze from the tortilla - it's just sloppy perfection.. . If you haven;t been there - GO, if you we're told it's not good - GO, if you are skeptical - GO!
