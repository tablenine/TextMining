I love this place!  The whole ambiance of this historical place is very interesting.  From the sawdust covered floors to the wooden furniture.  I even heard that this was once a brothel...but, who knows, the food is still terrific!  The french dip is out of this world and pretty inexpensive and being a coffee freak, I CANNOT believe that a cup of coffee is a DIME when comparing to other places!!!  Get here early and be prepared to stand in long lines but, worth the wait!
