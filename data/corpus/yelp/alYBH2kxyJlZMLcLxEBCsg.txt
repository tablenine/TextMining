I went to First Friday at Abbot Kinney last week.....pushing and pulling through the crowds of people waiting for clubs, food trucks, clothing stores and art galleries. I'm going to be honest with you reader....there were lines at almost all of the trucks on Abbot Kinney (especially all the trucks parked at the Brig), however the Kogi truck's line was by far the longest. Easily, 50 people in line when I walked up. I waited in line, yes I did. I WAITED IN THAT CRAZY LONG LINE! About 45 minutes to an hour later, finally ordered the beef tacos that everyone talks about. . . Were they good? Yes. . Would I wait in line again? Yes.. Did they live up to expectations? Absolutely. . . The tacos lived up to the hype....in my opinion. I would definitely get them again. Best advice - be ready to wait in line for them and order more than one taco.
