I generally have a weekly dinner with ex-yelper, Mesum, and this time we decided why not try the sushi place around the corner.  We walked over and it was a beautiful day and I would've eaten outside if I was having something other than sushi (heat and sushi never mix).  We walked in and the restaurant was completely packed and rather loud.  We put our name in and it took 10 or so minutes, no big deal.  . . The hostess seated us and it was all fine, except I felt uncomfortably close to the table next to us.  I ordered seaweed salad to start and I was very impressed by the amount they gave me.  I ordered two rolls, my regular spicy tuna and one of their specialties.  I don't know if I'll order the specialty rolls, only because I love my standbys.  The spicy tuna roll was good, I've had better, but I wouldn't turn it down in the future.  . . This wont be my go-to sushi place, but it's definitely a place I would go to again if asked to.
