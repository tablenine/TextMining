Reza's is good. But nothing to write home about, I guess.. . I'd have to say that I have no complaints about the ambience or the staff. But like I said, nothing about the food made me go ga-ga. The lentil soup was your average fare, and the veggie platter was 'Umm, Ok'. And all my other friends in the group that tried the non-veg fare didn't really start jumping up and down about it either!
