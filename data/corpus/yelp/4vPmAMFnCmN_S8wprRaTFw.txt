Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Porto's is half bakery half amazing. I love tons of stuff from here, try anything with guava in it, especially their guava and feta cheese, very delicious. Their fruit darts are always a amazing too.. . Every time I come here I have to get potato balls, they are like a ball of heaven, fried mashed potatoes with seasoned ground beef, who could think of something so amazing. As far as sandwiches go get their turkey crossant or their Â steak fajita sandwich, you will take me.. . What does suck about this place is parking, they have limited parking in front and that back lot is usually full. Also there is always a huge line for the bakery section.
