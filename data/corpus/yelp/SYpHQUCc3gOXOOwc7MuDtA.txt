I went here on a date once. And only once. Because it is quite pricey and there are only so many times you can reward dinners with sex without feeling like a hooker. It was many months ago I went here and I still remember what I ordered. I had about 5 pimlicos. One of the best cocktails you will ever have in your life! (Yes, I feel emphasizing "in your life" in my reviews as it will make you feel like you are going to die soon and should visit these places.) We had some oysters, some seared tuna, prawns, and even dessert. The dessert was a chocolate bread budding and it was so good I wished everything in my mouth was that mouth watering and tasty. But that wish was quickly apprehended, when dinner was over and it was time for me to pay my dues.
