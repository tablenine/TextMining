Restaurant: SIP The Experience
Category: Coffee & Tea
Ever since a friend pointed out that their logo looks like a coffee cup is peeing, that's the first thing to come to mind when I think of this place!. . Looking past the absurdly pretentious name, I do like this place. It's the only coffee shop that I've found comfortable enough to hang out for a while and do some work. Other places, I just end up forcing myself to stay  as soon as my drink is gone.. . The food is pretty good, but overpriced. For drinks, I've only ever gotten iced chai, except for one foray into lavender hot chocolate (a-mazing -- so delicate and light).. . Sometimes the music, usually techno, can be too much, too loud. For that reason, this is is a  place where I usually prefer to bring an iPod rather than a friend.
