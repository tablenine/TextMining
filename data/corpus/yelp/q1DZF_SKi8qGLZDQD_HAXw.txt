uh.... I really don't get it.. Okay Okay.. I didn't have the " fried chicken " But.. ......... still. I had a damn waffle.. and as my friend said it . " IHOP is wAYYY better ". . Anyway.. So. we get there around 3.. theres absolutely no one there.. naturally... since its not lunch? nor dinner.. or is this a sign?? stayy away? stay far away? . but whatever.. we order.. My friend orders a chicken burger.. and I get the Big Momma something? Eggs.. with cheese and onions.. and potatoes and gravy. .. so .. 10 minutes later we;re wondering why our food hasn't arrived.. since we're the only customers? Another 10 minutes go by.. and my friends chicken burger arrives.. he takes a bite and gives it a " mehhh... I'd rather be eating Jack in the box " .. the waitress explains that the Chef made a mistake and made a Liver Omlette? ( WTF ) instead of my eggs.. so its going to take some time... . . It comes.....and the eggs were pretty good. the potatoes and gravyy.. mehhh.. the waffle. Yuck. it was all soggy.. and like.. not special?. . I enjoyed my diet coke though......
