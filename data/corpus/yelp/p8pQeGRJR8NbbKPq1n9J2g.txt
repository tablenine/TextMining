I am giving this place 2 stars because 1) They have parking that is free and 2) they have outdoor covered seating.. . I went on a Tuesday night...the slowest of nights for most restaurants.  I did not expect the service to be THAT slow also.  Our server obviously needed training.  We ordered a beer sampler and she brought it out in brandy sifters.  She did not have a list of the beers and their flavors and it was made clear that they were not in order.  . We orders two appetizers - Edemame and a bowl of beer cheddar soup.  For dinner we ordered mussels and scallops.. We made it VERY VERYclear that we wanted out apps first.  I could not understand why it was taking 20 minutes for it, but then a man in a white teeshirt comes out with ALL of our food.  I told him that we wanted our apps first and to bring the other food back to the kitchen.  He gave me a nasty look.  I told him to ask the server.  The edemame were fine- I do not know how you can screw those up.  The soup on the otherhand, tasted like it had been old and reheated and had so much spice in it, that all you could taste was heat.  I have had better.  The entrees were good.  No complaints EXCEPT the server cleared my plate before my friend was done with her food.. . It is a shame that such lousy service come out of that establishment.
