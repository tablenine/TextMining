Came here one night for happy hour with some coworkers. The place was crowded, but there were definitely room for a group of us. There was a good selection for happy hour and only $5- that's pretty awesome. I got the spinach artichoke dip and it was very cheesy. It tasted good. I definitely want to come back for happy hour and order their crostini sandwich with pulled pork because it looked really tasty- my coworker ordered that and she confirmed it. Our waitress was very nice. She even split the tab for all of us- not a lot of places do that for the whole table. The busers cleared the table pretty fast after we each finished our plate. I'm lookin forward to coming back.
