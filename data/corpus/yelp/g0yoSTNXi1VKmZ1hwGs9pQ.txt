Even the overly cacophonous Buckhead ladies celebrating next to us at the communal table couldn't diminish my love for Holeman &amp; Finch.. . We began with cocktails which were just the sort of refreshment this evening called for! Jumping right in, we ordered the pimento cheese, griddled Hen of the Woods mushrooms, deviled eggs three ways and the house cured plate.. . The pimento cheese was so tasty it made me sad to think I lived more than 25 years without knowing of this Southern delicacy. I made up for lost time at Holeman &amp; Finch by gobbling up the blend of cheese, mayo and sweet peppers on crispy crackers. It was difficult to stop.. . But I had to save room for the house cured plate which arrived with meat, meat and more meat! Charcuterie lovers, take note!. . The griddled Hen of the Woods mushrooms came atop Anson Mills polenta. The maitakes were rich and meaty; the polenta served to balance them with its creaminess and a bit of aged Parmesan took this dish to another level.. . As for the deviled eggs three way - now why didn't I think of adding bacon to deviled eggs?!. . There's so much on the menu I didn't get to try (including a Coca Cola and Fernet Branca ice cream float!), but you can be sure I'll be clamoring to return to Holeman &amp; Finch on my next visit to Atlanta to cample more widely!
