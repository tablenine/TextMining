Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
The Pride of East Los Eateries!. . From Chorizo and Eggs in the morning before work to a Hamburger Steak with Grilled Onions for dinner.  El Tepeyac has much more to offer than just Burritos and Tacos- and never disappoints.  How they turn out all of that great food from that tiny kitchen with lightening quick speed is beyond me.  Keep up the good work Manuel, We Love You!
