Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I have been to Bottega Louie twice. The first time was for an Alicia Keys concert, the second for a "girlfriend" gathering. So for both situations, each of the guests that were in my party were very satisfied. Located in DTLA, with high ceilings and a dessert/ cheese bakery as you enter the restaurant. Seating can be difficult if you come at prime time, but if you get there mid day, or make a reservation it would make your experience more pleasant. . . As your seated there are paper settings and they offer sparkling water/ or still water for free. Their menu is very straight forward and grouped specifically with a general price for each group.. . Gathering two experiences here are the foods:. Calamari: nothing special, small pieces that are crunchy with marinara sauce.. Portobello fries: Mushrooms that are deep fried and VERY tasty, the sauce is delicious.. Mussels with clams: delicious with a garlic taste and not fishy.(MmMmm!!!! Usually I really dont like mussels ). Louie salad: bland just lettuce and some toppings very boring. Modena salad: very flavorful with walnut, goat cheese, herbs, and balsamic vinaigrette. French Onion Cheese soup: i would pass, the bread swells fast so it gets mushy if not eaten immediately and the cheese is stacked on and gets hard fast.. Pizza: half sausage half bianco... Really yummy!!!!. Shrimp scampi: 3 pieces, jumbo size, tasty but maybe not worth $25.. . Dessert we had macaroons which were mediocre, and something similar to a flan with shaved almonds which was DELiSH highly recommend if you can find it! We also had some ice cream shaped as a cone ( Coffee &amp; Neapolitan) that was OK.. . We ordered a bottle of wine, and then enjoyed the environment of echo's of a million different conversations. I love this place for dates and lady's night ^_____^
