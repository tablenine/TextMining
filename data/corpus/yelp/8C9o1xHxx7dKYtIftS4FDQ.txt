Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So I went here with some friends the other day since I always wanted to see what's the big hype about this damn hot dog place. Like seriously, what was so great about just hot dogs?!. . Boy, was I wrong. It's actually really delicious, well the Mulholland Drive Dog I got was legit. The hot dog was juicy, and they HELLLLLLLLLA stuff your dog like no other. I guess you can say they don't like to waste space in their hot dogs cause they tend to overstuff it with goodies-- well, at least for the speciality dogs.. . The only reason(s) I rated this place and gave it a 4/5 stars was because of the LONG WAIT-- the wait was absolutely ridiculous and I don't think there's any way to avoid it unless you come like when it opens, lol. The wait is usually an hour, or perhaps more.. . Oh, and CASH only-- there aren't even ATMS at Pink's. Lame right?. . Parking is the biggest bitch ever too-- and don't park in the small street next to Pinkberry unless you have a permit cause I was really close to ticket by the parking enforcement people, but luckily I didn't cause I came on time.. . Other than that, Pink's is awesome and I can't wait to go again!
