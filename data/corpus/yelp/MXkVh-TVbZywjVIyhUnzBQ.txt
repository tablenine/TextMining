Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Dunlays in Logan Square is a bright spot in an otherwise "thin" selection of restaurants in that particular area.  . . Logan Square is a lovely place, but the physical layout of this part of town harks back to the early 1900s where large streets, huge house were the norm.  Unfortunately for modern times this makes for finding a set of eateries in the area a challenge as you have to walk many blocks to cover all the selections.. . But Dunlays is clean, new (at it appears new looking to me) establishment that has plenty of booth space (I love me some booth) and a long bar that can accommodate any number of folks.  I ate their last night and by 7:30pm, the places was already filling up. . . They have a good beer selection and I partaked of the Chips w/guacamole dip (which the chips came out warm w which really makes eating this sort of thing a step above the rest) and a pizza which both were quite good.. . Two fat tire beers and the dinner was perfect.  Wait staff was really on the ball and food was served very quickly.. . If you find yourself in Logan Square, I'd recommend this place for dinner.. . UPDATE:  I realize there are few places close by..but the diner isn't something I consider seriously....their are several places down on Fullerton, but 3 blocks is closing in on half a mile in this city, so the selection is spread out compared to other parts of town.
