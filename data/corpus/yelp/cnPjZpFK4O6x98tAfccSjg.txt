Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I like to think that I have some friendships that will last forever.  However, if I ever move from Chicago, and those friends don't send me Lou's every year on my birthday, I will dump them girls so fast.... . That's how much I love this pizza.. . Also, for those of you with a social conscience, Malnati's opened up a restaurant in North Lawndale (when no one else would)  where they employed ex-offenders who were trying to stay out of jail (which no one else would) and donated a percentage of restaurant profits back to the community (which...you get the idea).  Pizza that eases my middle-class liberal guilt?  Awesome.
