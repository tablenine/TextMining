Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I'd give it a 2 1/2 stars if I could.. Went to eat there on 3/10/07, yesterday. I came all the way from Northern California with great expectations.. The wait was 35 minutes and when I got in the waiter and hostesses was nice. Very friendly. . The food however was not as pleasant as the wait staff.. I think all the reviews before me were overrated. The waffles were soggy even though I ordered it well done. I wasn't bothered by that but the waffle batter wasn't anything near good. . . The chicken was plain.. No spices or anything. Just fried.. Nothing special. KFC makes better chicken.. Maybe I'm spoiled in Northern California but Home of Chicken and Waffles in Oakland  is soo much better.. . Overall for 10 bucks a plate I would not come back. The portions were very  small for what they charge you. 4 bucks for an extra waffle??. The plates used to serve customers  were the kind you would see in a nursing home. Plastic cheap tan plates.. . I don't expect ambiance or anything but for ten bucks a plate at least give me a real plate.. . I'm sure Roscoe's was much better back in the day but it seems that the original owner sold the business to people who don't know how to run the business and are stingy and uptight.  Definitely not  a place I would recommend for soul food.
