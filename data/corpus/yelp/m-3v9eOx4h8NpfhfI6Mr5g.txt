Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I am a fan because I grew up on this place. More importantly, although its not the best mexican food, it has a signature to it - their salsa is a bit watery - but thats their style. Their chips are greasy - again, That's their style. The cheese and fried tacos that are always so crunchy and yummy ( if you like fried tacos) and greasy again! Their burrittos are yummi. We grew up on the all meat ones until I grew up and realized you can add to your burrito. Historical Mexican Place in Culver City. LOOONG LIIINES, but it moves quick. All the people wear hairnets, thats always a plus :) "I love Titos Tacos, You love Titos Too! Great Marketing Song." Hehe. THE END!
