The waiter drew a strange math related-food-equation on the outside of my to go box. . . something representing the food inside. I didn't get it. But I for sure did the 'smile and nod' anyways. A connection between pi &amp; the quiche that was inside the box. Thank goodness my coworker I was eating with didn't get it either. But, of course, being the fine gentleman he is, he likewise did the smile and nod. . . I had been outside of FAB before, but this was my first trip inside and it was way more grandiose than what I was expecting. I did indeed want to bust out some of my 11th grade 'Bonjours' from French class and snap my fingers to ask for more Perrier. But I held back. Can't have my coworker on his first visit to Atlanta thinking I'm all crazy. . . We had the Ahi tuna carpaccio and Soy Marinated Lamb Tenderloin to start. Tres magnifique! "Oui! Oui!" says my palate! And as entree, I went with the Quiche Lorraine, and was a less hungry person for it. Also veerrryy good. . . You can sit in many, many areas. . there's a rooftop (only open at certain times from what it looks like), a patio, a main dining room, another dining room up the stairs and what looks to be a room used for private dining. They are also open for lunch, so makes a good call if you work downtown or have meetings in the area. Light entrees and sandwiches run about $8.50 - $12, with the other entrees running from $14 - $30. For sure a reason to head downtown to try out your Francais!
