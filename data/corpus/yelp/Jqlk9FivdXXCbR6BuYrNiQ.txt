Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
For the price, their food (salad, brie, snacks, fruit, desserts) are just okay.  They're not bad, but they're not extraordinary.. . However, I will say that this is one of my favorite places to hang out.  The atmosphere is rather chill and it's a great place for friends to catch up.  The variety of food they have pairs very well with an occasion of casual gathering.. . I would have just rated 3 stars if it wasn't for their wine.  A cafe &amp; bakery that serves wine too?  Unheard of.  Bonus star!  I wished Alcove was down the street from me =(. . Parking is super difficult.
