Hands down one of the best breakfast places I've been to in LA. They have so many different kinds of pancakes, omlettes, waffles, etc that you will have the hardest time choosing. The problem is you can't get a few dishes and split with a friend (unless you have a huge group) because the portions are INSANE, and frankly, quite wasteful. My friend and I opted for something sweet and savory so we ordered blueberry pancakes and a mexican-food style omlette that was stuffed with avocado, salsa, and chicken sausage. I was about to explode and we both only had less than half of each dish (maybe only a little over a quarter of the pancakes). They have french-pressed coffee which is delicious, and you can take it to go after your meal. . . Only problem is this places can get packed. Servers are attractive and snooty but that's to be expected of a well-known Hollywood restaurant.
