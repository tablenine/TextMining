Expensive drinks, the food is just decent. I'm a fan of the blue cheese chips(I usually don't care for anything involving blue-veined cheese). The atmosphere is nice. My boyfriend and I made up a drink with the help of one of the bartenders. It's called an "IED" and it's drank like a car bomb. tetley's draft, jameson, and frangelico. Now we order it every time we go to Hand in Hand.
