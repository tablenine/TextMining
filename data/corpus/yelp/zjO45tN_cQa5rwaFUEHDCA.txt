This is the spot to go if you are a seafood lover. They have exotic seafood such as skate which is cooked to perfection. If they can get that right I think everything else on the menu is bound to be great. I had the Mahi Mahi which was very good as well. Reasonably priced go here for some truly delicious seafood entrees. Â Recently, I went back and was a little disappointed but, that might have been a fluke.
