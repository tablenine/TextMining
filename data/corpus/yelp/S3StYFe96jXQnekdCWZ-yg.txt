Came here way back and beat the crowd so we grabbed a free spot. . The server was a cool old veterano looking guy who was really friendly and was funny when he told some lady, " there's an ATM across the street, Cash only".. I think I had the hickory burger and when I was almost done with my fries, the guy threw em away by mistake and when i noticed he gladly brought me a fresh batch. The pie was okay.. It was okay to try this place out, but i can make a similar burger at home, where there is rarely a line to get a seat.
