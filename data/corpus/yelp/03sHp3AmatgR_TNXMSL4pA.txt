I LOVE this place. It's got a great vibe, nice people (not pretentious at all) , good drinks and good food. My husband and I were looking (very last minute) for a place to meet friends and family the night before our wedding day. We stopped by unannounced and met a very nice waiter and the general manager (Rodman Cruse). They took us on a tour of the place and showed us a private room that we would be able to use if our group got too big for the general bar area. There was no ridiculous charge like most places would have, especially once you mention the word 'wedding'. We arrived there later that week and ended up using that extra room. It was so perfect, we had our own bartender who was super nice and had delicious drink after delicious drink! They were so accommodating and friendly and totally made our wedding weekend that much more fun and special (and affordable). I can't say enough good things. Thank you!
