Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Despite the interior being absolutely gorgeous and nightclub-y, Geisha House's food disappoints. Though I admit that this restaurant is a great place to have some drinks and a fashionable dinner prior to bar hopping, I wish their sushi was better quality! Their food is bland and hastily prepared. I'm giving 3 stars only because their drinks are strong.
