Probably one of my top dining experience yet in regards to the menu.  I don't know where to begin.  Kumamoto Oysters rocked the half shell and my glass of sake went perfectly with them.  I had the Lobster Bolognese with orrichete pasta that was slighty baked with broccoli rabe and bread crumbs .  My friends had the Chorizo Stuffed Squid and the Alaskan Halibut with Chantrelle Mushrooms, Crab Pierogi, celery root and crab sauce.  Out of this freaking world!  The chocolate bread and butter pudding was heavenly.  We didn't leave hungry, that is for sure.  I was pretty much blown away like the first time I heard Mickey Avalon's Jane Fonda.. . The fruit drinks were good but a bit much.  I had the Kyoto.  It was pretty to look at but too much going on.  Perhaps a little too fruity but the food was just sublime.
