Restaurant: Tia Pol
Category: Tapas Bars
Tia poll may be one of the best bar dining experiences around (Small, intimate).  On a nice sunny day, Tia poll will probably have their massive inviting doors wide open to welcome you to come on in and have some well prepared, tasty  tapas.. . My personal favorite was the squid in ink, and the lamb kabobs were also quite good. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the potatoes, but i found the mayo based sauce to be a little bit too heavy.  The shrimp was good... served whole with shell and head.  I'd personally prefer it sans shell.. . The pitcher of sangria was very good.  Didn't get a chance to try any of their Spanish wines, but I'd be willing to bet that they'd have some good ones.. . Pretty small location, so not good for groups, but seems like it would be a great date spot.
