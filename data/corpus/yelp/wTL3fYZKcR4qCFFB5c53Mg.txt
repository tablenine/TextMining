Really..garlic? Oh man this place was so good. From the garlic mashed potatoes, cocktails, prime rib, and the garlic ice cream.. whoa!! Its in BH so expect some buuhgey people around you. The decor was very cool and a cool topic to talk about. If we lived closer we would have made this place our anniversary spot..
