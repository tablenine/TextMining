Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I was meeting a friend from out of town, and his Chicago friend who was joining us recommended the Bourgeois Pig. I'd heard about them from a few friends, and they stood up to their reputation.. . I had the Tale of Two Turkeys (I love my poultry), my friend had the muffaletta, and his friends had "The Sun Also Rises" and "The Great Gatsby". All were quite tasty. Like some other reviewers, I wish they had more in terms of sides, but it seems like they've established themselves as a coffeehouse that also serves darn good sandwiches and not a sandwich shop.. . We went on a Saturday night and they weren't too crowded, though I could certainly see it being packed for lunch. We got to sit on the patio and enjoy the first ladybugs of the season landing on our table, which was lovely. My only real gripe is that the staff were pretty surly. I would understand grumpy service if they were packed, but I don't think there were much more than a dozen people there, including us. Ah well, I'll still be coming back.
