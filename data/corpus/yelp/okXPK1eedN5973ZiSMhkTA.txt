Restaurant: Fritti
Category: Italian
I've eaten at Fritti a number of times for their excellent selection of pizzas (I especially love the Carciofi e Olive and the Vegetariana pizza with the yummy grilled vegetables) and especially because of their appetizer Funghi Fritti (Crimini &amp; Portobellos fried with truffle oil). The food is somewhat pricer than I'd like it to be, but because of the good food/ nice bar factor we decided it might also be a good spot to celebrate a friend's birthday. While the food continues to be delicious, the often unfriendly/ rushed waitstaff make the restaurant not an ideal place for celebratory events. Also remember: seating outside is much more comfortable than inside. More space, less noise!
