Decent place, but I wouldn't rush to go back.. . Met friends here for drinks on a saturday night.  It's a MAD HOUSE.  Bursting at the seems with people, loud, but not unnecessarily so.  The tables by the bar are first come, first serve, so swoop in whenever you can. Looks like a crazy pick up joint; slick haired men and bottle blonde cougars as far as the eye can see.  Bartenders mix a decent drink, no complaints there!. . Highlights and Lowlights: We ended up sitting down at a table for some actual food.  Busboys/back waiters- these guys really deserve a great tip, so accommodating and efficient.  Also, the Ahi Tuna Poke, phenomenal, come just to eat this.  Other than that, the menu is super schizo - burgers, sushi, and tex mex?  Oh my!. . Our waitress was poorly trained, therefore, provided poor service.  On top of being rude and snippy, she was a bit dim and kept insisting that our table had shorted her $16 when in fact, we had left her $16 OVER the standard 18% tacked-on tip (what can i say, we were drunk).  It took her 20 mins and at least 2 other staff to figure this out.  After that, OF COURSE she was sweet.  Managers, train your staff!. . There's Sub 51 downstairs.  Snarf.  The name tells you everything you need to know.
