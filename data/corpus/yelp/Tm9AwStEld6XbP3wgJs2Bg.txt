ive only been twice but ill definitely be back for brunch to try more things from the menu. a great OPEN space with prompt service and a healthy, energetic bustle.. one of my favorite spots in downtown LA to go for brunch/lunch. everything from the sandwiches, meatballs, to eggs benedict were really tasty. plus there is a large parking lot right next door. can't wait to get back here.
