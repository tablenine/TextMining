Great Steaks, but not exactly what I ordered. I like it rare so it's really bloody, doesn't everyone? They wouldn't make it rare as I wanted it. Medium rare is the best they would do and that seemed more medium then anything else. It's definately a place to be seen, if you're into that. Not.. . Saw Tom n Kate. Loved Kate's haircut btw. I'm giving an extra star becuase of Kate's haircut!
