Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Take the same delicious fried chicken with smothered gravy and serve it in a spacious family friendly Denny's style restaurant, you get this place.. . The one in Hollywood is a landmark but it is way too crowded. It takes forever to get a table there. Here, it's a snap. I love it. You walk in, sit down, and get your meal. Â . . Thank you for expanding!
