shabu shabu house is great and all, but now that Fiore is five seconds away, I always go there first Â to cure my hunger pains...but subsequently end up not being able to finish my shabu shabu.. . thus, for those who cant' wait, go to Shaab in pasadena. i think both places are equally delicious and at shaab, you dont have to wait for 90 minutes.. . that being said, i do appreciate shabu shabu house for being a relatively fun, fast and furious place to go to when i have nothing better to do with my friends than wait.
