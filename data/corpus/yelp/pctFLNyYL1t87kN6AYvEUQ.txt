Category: Thai
summary: i ended up retching progressing to vomiting approx 1.5 hours status post meal. until that point i felt really bloated.. . we had yellow curry with chicken and pad kee mao with chicken. since the pad kee mao was supposed to be beef (what we ordered) we had them change it after they messed up the order. they brought it out in like 5 min. . . the rice or the curry or maybe both tasted something like plastic, like the rice i cook and store in my tupperware, anyone else notice?. . the waitress was cold until she realized her mistake then she smiled. elvis was eh. this place has ambience like hawaii. no one really paid much attention to elvis, aside from taking pictures of him. probably wont come back. maybe one more time to make sure.
