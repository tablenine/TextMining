How come no one is mentioning the truffle burger here??. . Let me try and describe the first bite of this wonderful beast of a burger as best as possible: Â Each flavor hit at a different time. First was the soft, yet perfectly toasted and slightly sweet bun, then was the charred outer crust of the burger itself, smoky with charcoal, then the saltiness of the truffle oil and truffle cheese somewhere in there and an intangible garlickiness that suffused the entire bite. Wait, wait what was that? ... A flavor orgasm? Oh my, oh yes (shudder, shudder) I think that's what that was. . . Perfectly seasoned, soft and pink and juicy and just so gosh-damn tasty .... . Put up with the parking and the crowds and the spotty service and the high prices and ridiculous corkage fee ... Believe the hype. Just go to Umami and take a bite, even just one, of their burgers. You WILL savor the experience, I promise.
