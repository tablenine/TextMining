Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I went to Gingergrass yesterday with a friend of mine to talk about nutrition and how to eat better foods... I thought it was a strange choice of restaurants till we got the food! Awesome... I had the "gingergrass" fresh rolls and beef noodle bowl, both were fresh, tasty, and good for me (says the nutritionist I was eating with!). . . Two thumbs up for the ginger basil elixir, too, and their creme bulee (way not on my diet, but worth it).
