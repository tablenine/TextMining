Had dinner here once with friends and it was filling, very, but excellent. Would do dinner again.. . I have been many more times for drinks either in the indoor bar and mostly on the rooftop bar when its open. It does get very crowded and they only allow up about 90 people at one time. . . We did have a bartender one night that was dealing with some rude individuals and we chatted with him most of the night. He gave us at least 50% off of our bill, probably more, he was great. . . Drinks are $12-15 for specialties and beers are around $4-5+ for domestics. Great place to enjoy Chicago scenery at.
