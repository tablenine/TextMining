I am from Texas, as yall know and I have been searching for the best Mexican Resturant in town and Casa Vega is the best.  Thank Goodness I finally found Mexican Food close to my Texas Heart.. . Its a bit dark inside and your eyes have to adjust if you go inside during the day.  The bar is in the front which is fun to watch while you eat.  We met all nice people there and one lady drug me out to meet her daughter because she said I looked Italian, she was nice too.. . The salsa was good, the chips were good and they will give you green salsa for an extra dollar fifty.  They have chili con Queso that I have been unable to find at many of the the Mexican Resturants here in Los Angeles.  I loved the Tostada, the Mexican Salad, the Tamale, Enchiladas were great and even the rice and beans were good.  Finally I found good Mexican Food, I thought I was going to die with out it.  Now, I drive down 101, over the hill take a left to Ventura Blvd and its actually easier to drive than some places in town.  So, now Ventura is my new favorite place.  . . Does anyone have any good places to recomend near Casa Vega ??. . What about Sunday Brunch ???  Casa Vega Rock's !!!!
