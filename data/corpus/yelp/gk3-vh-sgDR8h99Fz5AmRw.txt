I was on vacation with my girlfriend for 10 days in LA... we ate here twice.  It was that good we just *had* to come back again.  Both times were phenomenal.  Coming from Hawaii where I eat sushi and fresh seafood on a weekly basis I was surprised by just how fresh Katsu-ya was both times. . . They win on consistency, great selection... amazing specials.  We had the baracuda since it sounded fun, turned out to be fun and great tasting.  . . The spicy tuna on crunchy rice is one of our favorites, I also loved their spicy yellowtail (hamachi) which I had as a cut roll... twice.  We didn't have a bad dish either time we ate and we probably had 12 items each time.  That's pretty hard to beat, even here in Hawaii I don't get that lucky.. . I didn't want to take a chance trying the other locations... and you shouldn't either.  Make the drive and you won't be disappointed.  Heck, I'll fly 2500 miles just to eat here again.
