Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
You know this is a French restaurant because there are beautiful skinny pregnant women drinking scotch at the bar and smoking cigarettes. So if you're in the mood for fashionably low birth weight babies, you've come to the right place! The Little Door is one of L.A.'s most romantic date locations; if your idea of romance is dining inside the latest Anthropologie catalog. The food was exceptional, the lamb tender and full of savory flavor and the fish fresh and perfectly cooked. They would not take our reservation without a credit card and the stipulation that if we did not honor our reservation they would charge us $25 per person. The day I accept New York style audacity from a Los Angeles restaurant is the day I am run over by an MTA train, halved from the balls below, and am forced to dine exclusively at places that excuse my leaking colostomy bag because I pay them exorbitant sums derived from my insurance settlement.
