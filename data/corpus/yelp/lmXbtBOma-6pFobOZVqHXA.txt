Category: American (Traditional)
Can I get a hell yeah for Bonnie's? This place has a great vibe, is cute (my main squeeze Elvis is adorned on all of the walls...nice!) and above all has tasty food! Imagine that!. . We were able to get a spot at the counter at 8 without having to wait (although the people behind us were not so lucky). We had come in pursuit of the perfect wings so we promptly ordered twenty and a couple of cans of ice cold PBR's. Mmmmm. From where we sat we could perfectly see the grill and the army of gigantic tasty looking burgers that were being produced. They looked mouth wateringly delicious... And I don't even eat red meat!. . When are wings came they were pretty tasty, we ordered the 'hot' but i would say they were more on the mild side. I thought they were quite tasty but my dining companion wishes they had more sauce... I do suppose it is a matter of preference.. . Either way Bonnie's was an overall fantatic experience and I plan on going back. Also, as a heads up...if you are going as a group of four or more I would be prepared to wait. There were two groups in the door that Â were waiting for the entire duration of our meal... So be prepared... But trust me... Its worth it!
