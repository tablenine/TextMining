T.T.F.. . Despite my recent visit to Skylark - it doesn't mean Tater Tots Forever..... . And despite the Yelp chickpea craze - it isn't a code for Terrific Tasting Falafel either.. . Taro. Tapioca. Freeze. . That's the way to go guys.. It doesn't taste like anything else. . It's just purple perfection in a plastic cup with yummy Â little black balls.. . End of story.
