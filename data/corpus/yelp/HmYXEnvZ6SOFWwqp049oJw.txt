I had no idea this place even existed until last Sunday when we met some friends for brunch.  Down the street from Fox Bros - I was expecting to find a hidden gem in this place and my expectations were on point.. . I splurged and had the southern eggs benedict from the specials menu and it was mouthwatering.  I don't usually like sausage, but it added a nice spice to the hollandaise flavor.  Definitely too rich to finish the whole plate, but that's what boys are for, right?. . Great find and can't wait to go back for more!
