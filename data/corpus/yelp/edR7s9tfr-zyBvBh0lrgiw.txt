Three weeks into dating him, he sends me an email.. . "Don't laugh but I like magic.  Do you want to come with me to the Magic Castle?". . Of course I laughed but I didn't tell him I laughed.   I thought it was kinda cute that he was dorky like that.  ;). . I had never heard of the Magic Castle before this and was more excited about getting dressed up (men in suits, ladies in cocktail wear - dress code strictly enforced) than the actual magic.  And to be honest I was a little worried that it would all be horribly cheesy and I would come away from it thinking, "omg, he's such a dork!" and NOT in a cute way.  . . Thank goodness I was wrong!  :)  . . Everything was a pleasant surprise.  Maybe because we went with D-, who is a magician member, and was a fantastic host.  Maybe because that was our first outing as a couple in a group.  Maybe because we saw Johnny Ace Palmer, one of the world's best magicians.  Whatever the reason, it was a fabulous night.. . After that first night we started frequenting the Castle with our magician friend, D-.  We've been in small groups, big groups, with dinner, without dinner...everytime we've had a blast.  The food there is pricey but everything I tried was pretty good.  Steaks are their specialty.  . . Visiting the Castle with my date (and now hubby) and our fabulous host D- is one of the things I miss most about living in LA.
