Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
You know how we tend to be extra critical of places that get over-hyped like Father's Office? Over-hyped as in, in my 2.5 days in Los Angeles, talk of the burgers and sweet potato fries comprised 30% of conversation. . . 30 minute wait in line. 30 minute wait for fries. The nut brown ale? Yum. The sweet potato fries a la carte (cheeky!)? Absolutely worth EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of the wait. . . Our conversation as we left the place? How my friends planned to come back for lunch tomorrow.
