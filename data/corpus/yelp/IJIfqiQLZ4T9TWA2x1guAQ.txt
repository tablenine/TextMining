Gross!. . I know I will probably offend many here, but dammit, I think 2 stars is being generous and playing it safe. Â If you're rating it 3 or higher, I hope it's on the mood, memories,or that it's one of the few (so sad, Atlanta) 24hr spots, and not on the food.. . I have been here a couple of times and each time ask myself why didn't I go to Waffle House? The food at Waffle is much better considering they use real eggs. It's a cardinal sin not to have real eggs at a diner--dive or not. The fact that it's not a chain and insists on maintaining their quality of food should disappoint instead of. exaltation.. . The dive, drunks, and all the other negative marketed as cool should not excuse the fact the food is far from greasy. Greasy would be a compliment. . . At first I thought I was spoiled, because I have been to some good diners and should go easy on the classic Majestic, but taste buds would not have it. Diners, home of the comfort food, the dress how you came, the loners, stoners, drunks, psychos, the Saturday night to the Sunday best, should be as greasy and heart clogging as any heart attack would tell ya but all the grease at KFC can't save ya if the food lacks.
