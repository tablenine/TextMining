Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Here for an early dinner, ample street parking.  The place was empty when we went but the service still sucked.  As we walked in, the black t-shirted staff standing around looked at us, not saying a word, and mildly surprised.  It reminded me of how one might be greeted at a quick stop oil change place if one pulled up in a Ferrari.  The menu is fairly limited, I finally decided on tuna tar tare appetizer and smoked salmon pizza. The tuna tar tare is so so, it didn't have the flavor a terrific raw dish should have. The smoked salmon pizza, a disappointment, like canned salmon on top of pizza crust.  I asked the waiter about it and he said yeah, he thought it would be like the smoked salmon I was thinking about too, but that's the way they make it. He offered to take it back and so it went back to the kitchen.  . . I also sampled the fried calamari.  The portion is generous, the taste ok, not bad.  We had to request for some bread and it was served with hummus, which were a bit unusual with the rest of the menu. Cushions on the seats around the walls with uncomfortable wooden chairs otherwise. The service really sub par for a place that borders on Beverly Hills. Waiters not service oriented or accommodating, it was more like - you ready to order yet?  Not really what I was expecting from the great reviews and their nice web site.
