i think this place is totally overrated. you have to wait in a line for like two hours, and it just so happens that you'll get hungry and whatever you eat makes you think that its really good. i mean its good like any regular taco truck but not for its price. it says it adds a little bit of korean flair to it... i didn't taste any of it. when i ordered i asked for it to be spicy and the guy told me that it'll have a kick. there was no kick. it was just plain.
