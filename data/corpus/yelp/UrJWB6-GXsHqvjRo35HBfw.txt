What is there to eat in culver city? Growing up in beverly hills, being its neighbor I never really ventured out here except for the frequent visits to in n out. From a reccomendation from a friend I finally got to go here. The ambiance was perfect for the occasion. That was the first thing I noticed, then came the hostess. She was really friendly and professional as well. We got seated promptly, despite how busy the restaraunt was. It soon full house but the restaraunt didnt get too loud. It was loud enough to be entertaininig but not overwhelming. The server was awesome. He reccomended the monkfish and the pasta dishes. Which was fabulous. The flavor was spot on. Nothing was too heavy but all the plates was refreshing. The pastas are all made fresh in house and everything seemed fresh. The assorted cookies was a great way to finish the meal and was spot on to fit the upscale dining scene.
