Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I tried this little hot spot a week ago with my coworker. I love that they have such a simple menu. Fish taco, shrimp taco, drink. That's it. The line moves quick and there is variety of salsas to choose from.. . Try and avoid the lunch hour, cuz you'll be waiting a while. Even though the line moves fast, the rate at which the food comes out is constant.
