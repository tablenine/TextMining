Told a few friends about this special Korean BBQ taco truck. They thought it was cool and decided to come along and try them out. As the wait started to get longer and longer they bailed. Also gave me crap for standing in line for food for two hours.. . The next time the truck rolled around I made sure to get there so early that I would be the first in line. I bought the same friends some tacos and burritos.... . they've fully apologized for their previous claims. =)
