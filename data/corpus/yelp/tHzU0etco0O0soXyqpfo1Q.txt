Restaurant: Fado Irish Pub
Category: Pubs
I gotta say, I liked Fado's from the word go.  The bar has a nice, wide-open feel to it, which makes it hard to feel too crowded.  I also liked the mix of people around - businessmen still in their casual office attire stopped for a drink to the cute hotties hanging around the bar - all attractive, I must say.  . . Oh yeah - and there was food and drink as well.  Not a big wine list, but a few good choices.  I can't really speak to the beer selections as I didn't have any (I know, what was I doing at an Irish Pub, right?) but I have to say the food was a lot nicer than I would expect at a "pub".  The quesadillas were different in a deliciously good way (not a tortilla but a thicker shell made of a light potato pancake) and the cheese dip and wedges were gooey goodness.  The chicken tenders were very tasty and surprisingly light - done tempura with a side of honey mustard.  I also sampled one of the mini cheeseburgers and immediately wished we'd ordered more.  They were cute little thick burgers with cheese, french fried onion strings, pickles and a great sauce.  I had the blue crunch salad, which was big but I ate every last bite.  We had to try the Harvest Bread Pudding with apples, cinnamon and sugar.  It was awesome!  I loved the cinnamon and sugar with the vanilla ice cream on top - yum!!!  . . I'll definitely be back for more before long.  Thanks for taking care of our crazy group, Fado's!
