* Actually very good. Believe the hype.. * Not sure how they pulled off tortillas and Korean food, but it works somehow.. * Get ready to wait in line! The scene's actually kinda fun.. * Go here instead of the knockoffs (Kalbi, et. al.).. * Don't forget to patronize the shops they squat at. Gotta keep that kind of symbiosis going.
