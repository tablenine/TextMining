This ramen was good, but it will not beat Hakata Ramen. Their Gyoza however, it's out of this world, it's so thick, filled with meat and leeks, it's awesome, you gotta have it when you're there. . . The ramen wasn't special cause you can't order any toppings, though they gave you flavored egg without ordering it, but still not enough to beat Hakata Ramen... especially for my taste :)
