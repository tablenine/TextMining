Well this was also my first time here and created a yelp account to express my new found LOVE!  I was here on a Thursday afternoon and sat in the back of the restaurant by the window with a friend.  We had the zen martinis which were awesome! We started with the mac and cheese and the tuna tartare which were both close to the best i ever had. We also shared a lobster roll and the endive salad.  I def be back next time i'm in the soho area. Thank you Delicatessen!
