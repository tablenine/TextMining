I've been here a couple times and always had a GREAT meal. I always get the 35 day aged KC strip and its always been delicious. The wedge salad is great and most of the sides are very tasty as well. The one side I didn't go for was the hash browns. Just didn't care for it. Such is life.Staff is spot on. Beer selection is OK . Vodkas are what you expect...Over all I'd recomend it highly.
