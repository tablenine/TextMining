garlic garlic garlic. . there garlic rolls were the bomb.  everything was pretty good. no compliant.  You get pretty full and its hard to eat more especially desert.  . . Service is very efficient.  First place I ever been to where your order is done through a Handheld PDA.  I'm very impressed.  I wonder where the wireless point is.  . . In my opinion, you don't need reservations.  The place is pretty big and you get seated right away.  Doesn't hurt though =). . Valet parking only unless you want to walk for awhile.
