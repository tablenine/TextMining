This place is awesome! I was in Atlanta visiting a friend for a week and we found this place after deciding on having some Mediterranean food.. . I love that this little eatery is so family oriented and the owner made us feel welcome. My friend and I shared a mezza platter which was deeeelish. I had the chicken kabob and she had the lamb. I'm not a big lamb fan but I did try it and it was pretty tasty. The portions are large as well, which may be good for sharing. In our case though, we cleared our plates. The owner saw that we finished everything and fed us some baklava, which of course was yummy as well.. . Overall, love this place! Now if I can find something similar in San Diego =P
