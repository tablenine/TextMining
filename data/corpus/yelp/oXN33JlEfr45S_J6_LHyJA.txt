I went here for my bday dinner because my brother knows the owners. While waiting I ordered the sangria which took about 20 minutes to get. When I finally did get it it had a huge amount of fruit in it, and hardly any liquor. . . The food was so so. I ordered the fish I can't even remember what kind because it was kind of forgetable. My sister ordered the black and white pasta which was kind of minty which was really unappetizing. . . I am giving this place 3 stars though because the desserst were ahmahzing. I had the banana chocolate phyllo pastery, italian cookies and panna cotta (my bro's friend sent them over). They were all to die for! . . In short I'll come back for dessert but not the food.
