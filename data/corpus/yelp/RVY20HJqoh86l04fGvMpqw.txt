Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
1-hour+ wait in a long-ass line... at 3pm on a Saturday. Who wants a hot dog at 3pm on a Saturday?! Argh.. . Once we made it past the proselytizing cross-bearer preaching to victims held captive in line (evil genius on his part), we ordered:. . - One BACON CHILI CHEESE DOG (topped w/3 strips of bacon, tomatoes &amp; cheese, onions and mustard). . - One BACON BURRITO DOG (Big flour tortilla wrapped around 2 hot dogs, 2 slices of cheese, 3 slices of bacon, chili &amp; onions). . - One Rosie O'Donnell Â LONG ISLAND DOG (10" Stretch Dog, topped with mustard, onions, chili and sauerkraut). . - Two orders of onion rings. . Total = $20 and change. We pumped ourselves a few cups of ketchup and water and sat down to stuff our faces. The chili was ultra-oily (it created an inch-deep pool in the foil the bacon burrito dog was wrapped in), the onion rings were fat and crunchy, and the dogs themselves were pretty good, but... not worth the hype, not worth the line, not worth the $.. . If you get turned on being a super tourist in LA or are craving a $6 hot dog at 3pm on a Saturday and love lines, you should check out Pink's. If not, look for a bacon-wrapped hot dog cart lady elsewhere.. . CASH ONLY &amp; NO ATM (keep this in mind so you don't stand in line for nothing!).
