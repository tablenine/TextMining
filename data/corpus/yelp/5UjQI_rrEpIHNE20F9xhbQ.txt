Literally melt-in-your-mouth sushi and sashimi. Before our visit here, I'd never had salmon so tender that it literally dissolved in my mouth with a couple of chews.. . Very reasonable on the wallet considering the top-notch fish they serve here. Don't forget that it's cash only, but they have an ATM inside just in case. You'll also need a little cash to tip the valet in the back. . . I'm not usually in this part of town very often, but I will definitely make a point of dropping by next time I'm in the area!
