I love Phillipe's! It's an L.A. landmark! I've been coming here since I was a girl! My dad brought us and we put a whole bunch of mustard on our roast beef dipped without knowing that it was HOT!!!!! \. . Get a roast beef, dipped, a pickle, some macaroni or potato salad, or chips on the side! get a beer! or a root beer!! get a coffee!! 10 cents!! buy a pack of gum from the little candy counter! . . always loved the big cafeteria tables and the little stools, the sawdust on the floor and all the old pictures on the wall. Â . . it's really close to downtown, dodgers stadium, chinatown! when i worked in chinatown for like 2 seconds, i walked down here for breakfast once. it was weird being there in the morning, but i reminisced about all the times coming here with my dad and sisters. and now with my daughter and friends. . . it's always packed, but it's worth the wait!! just get in line and enjoy!
