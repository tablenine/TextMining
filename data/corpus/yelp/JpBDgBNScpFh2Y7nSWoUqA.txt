A large space....+1. A good mixed crowd....+1. Decent priced drinks that are strong...+1. One stall bathroom for a large bar...-2...nice girls in the bathroom that I started chatting it up with....+1. The Biznatch who gave me a hard time about me taking a chair that had her purse on it...yea...my purse had a long day too, but you dont see me pulling up a chair for it...it's called sharing your own seat with your purse....-1. kick ass chocolate chip cookes that melt in your hand and are piping hot fresh...+2...took way more than their quoted 15 minutes to bake rule...-1. lucky meter parking that was literally 15 steps away from the bar....+1. good memories and conversation with my friends and family....+2. . In case you can't do the math or aren't asian (har har)=P, the total comes out to be 4...hence the 4 stars.
