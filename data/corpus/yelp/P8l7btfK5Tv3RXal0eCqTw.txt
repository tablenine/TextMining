So I'm hesitant to give this place as awesome review as I'd like because its already getting way too crowded, but I will do you all the honor of speaking the truth. Its nothing fancy, its a regular Buford Highway restaurant. The food though is delicious! I'm a big fan of the grilled pork rolls to start out with, they are wrapped up in rice paper and come with a peanut dipping sauce that I can't find anything else similar to. My two staples are the crispy noodles with chicken which is exactly what it sounds like and the shaken beef. Both are delicious and have never left me anything but extremely satisfied. The waiters take a while to come over once you sit down, but don't fret as soon as they decide its your turn they are extremely friendly and helpful. Â  If you're looking for a good dinner for 2 under $35 this is the place!
