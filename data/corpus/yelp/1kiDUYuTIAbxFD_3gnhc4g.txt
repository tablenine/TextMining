The Lobster is amazing!!!!!!!!!! You must get this when you go here.. The Clams with Basil are very good as well.. If you like a tender white fish get the steamed Tilapia. It comes whole covered in thin slices of ginger and soy sauce. Omg it's lke butter.. . YUMMY!!. . Oh, the avocado drink is going to make me 10 lbs heavier because it's so delicious. I usually get it without Boba.. . All of them remember me and my family and have always been so nice. The Service is excellent but not so much the Venue. They're moving very soon if not already.. . 15-30 minutes wait during Lunch hour especially on weekends.
