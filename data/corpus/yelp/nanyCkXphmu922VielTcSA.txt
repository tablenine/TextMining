Expensive BUT Delicious Mexican Food. . Went here with a friend who has gluten and dairy allergies and they were very accommodating. She could even eat the corn chips!. . I had a Carmelito (Patron XO and Coffee) it was perfect.. . Enchiladas Suizas were good, but I didn't get the beans or rice that were supposed to come with it. I didn't notice until I left, so I guess I didn't need it. hah. . . 3 of 4 people had alcoholic drinks, we got the guac for 4 (which was good, but honestly not as flavorful as I had expected), and the bill was around $160. . . Good service, Nice environment, Good decor.
