Restaurant: Chef Liu
Category: Chinese
i used to go to chef lui, cuz the food was cheap and fast. i stopped going there cuz the food didnt sit too well in my stomach several times. if you look straight up where the flourscent lights are, you will see tiny roaches. this place didnt look too clean. makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is and what grade they got from the health department.
