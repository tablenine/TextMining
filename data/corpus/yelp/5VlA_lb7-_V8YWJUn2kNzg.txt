I've been to this restaurant several times and after each visit, I always leave the place satisfied.  I've been here for dates, a Valentine's Day dinner, fun with friends and even a wedding.   The wedding reception was beautiful and only the wedding party was allowed in the garden area for pictures.  All the tables were situated around the garden area--the dance floor was actually in a separate room from the garden too, it was a little awkward.  The view when you walk out the door is always really pretty especially at night.  I have yet to take my hubby here.
