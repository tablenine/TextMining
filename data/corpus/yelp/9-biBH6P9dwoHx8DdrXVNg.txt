Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
What's so great about this place anyway? Oh yeah, it's because they have rare and expensive beer, a bangin' burger and sweet potato fries served in a gimmicky mini shopping cart. . . To echo some of the reviews below, this place isn't worth it if you want quick service, as it's more a bar than a restaurant. There are no waiters to take your order so you have to go to the bar to order food.. . Still, if you're craving a busy, robust crowd, Father's Office delivers that, and good food on top of their wide selection of beers and ales. Definitely check out the tender burger piled with spicy arugula and smothered in really really caramelized onions on a light French bread-style bun.
