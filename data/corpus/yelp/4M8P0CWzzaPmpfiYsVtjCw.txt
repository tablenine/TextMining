You've heard it once, you'll hear it again. Yes, it's a great L.A. institution. I never knew about this place until I finally decided to go to more L.A. restaurants. The place reminds me of a huge cafeteria where you get in line and order on the front counters are the ladies hustle and bustle to get your order together.. . I ordered mine "double-dipped" and it was quite good, but the it didn't blow my mind or taste buds out of the water. The hot mustard is good, but once again, nothing too original. It was basically really hot McDonald's hot mustard.. . I didn't get any sides, but for what it is, it's OK. A bit on the pricey side since it's just a regular sandwich to me, but good none the less. . . **It looks like a destination Dodger fans go to before games**
