Decent food, bad experience. We got some lunch, then decided to go back for dessert. On the way back to our table, my mom completely wipes out movie-style: arms and legs flying, pecan pie flying through the air. She landed on her back, pie landed on some dude's coat (and boy did he let everyone know that it had). A bunch of men nearby just stared at her, no one tried to help or ask if she was ok (come on Chicago, I know you have a bad rap for being a little crabby, but jesus, I had no idea). Some dumbass employee had put the wet floor sign where no one would ever see it and didn't bother to mop up the wet area (which was a bunch of melted ice from the soda machine). The ASSistant manager came over and was like "the sign. see, the sign? the sign". Aww hell no. I told him get the manager right now if he didn't want to be sued. Anyways, we got free food and shit and my mom's ok. 3 stars only because I ate the best dessert I've ever had in my life - Pumpkin Bread Pudding. Watch yourself by the drink machines - I told them to put some mats down in front of them so no one would sue them - perhaps they heeded my advice? I am thinking not.
