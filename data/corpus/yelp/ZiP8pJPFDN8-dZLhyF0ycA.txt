I wouldn't think to go anywhere else but here for Garlic crab &amp; noodles.  Made reservations for 6:15pm, surprised to find street parking so closeby, so no valet, yay!  Restaurant was already whirring with business.  Ordered a couple very expensive cocktails ($15 each), one was the Enlightenment, that was delicious and the next one I ordered was gross actually, it's the one that has "foam" on it.  ew.  But the garlic crab and the noodles made up for it.  Our service was good too, waiter, Sean, was funny and charming.  We had a Blackboard eats coupon code that he redeemed for us ($27 value) on the chef's appetizer sampler.  Also had dessert, the sorbets, omg, the ginger sorbet/ice cream was to die for when paired with the moscato!  They help you on the menu with the pairings.  Some may say it's overpriced, but wearing bibs in a fancy restaurant and the warm towels after just cannot be matched.  I'd rather go here anyday over a loud chinese restaurant, the crab is still not comparable in my opinion!
