I had high hopes for this place once I received an invite a two weeks ago.  I went with my girlfriend 3 other couples.  We had 9:45pm dinner reservations but we all arrived around 6:30 that evening.  The initial performer was entertaining by using simple rope and rings tricks.  It was noting to brag about but enough to mention.  For some reason it was a packed house, maybe because it was Israel Week or Mother's Day weekend, but either way it seemed like everyone room had a long line to get into and we only got to see one show before dinner.  Dinner was so-so, it was the brightest part of the the evening and that's not saying much. I ordered the Beef Wellington and it was alright.  The puff pastry was a little soggy and the tenderloin was a tad undercooked, but overall the flavors were there.  . . The "grand finale" show was in better terms, PAINFUL...  The opening act seemed like he was preforming a act to a bunch of 5 year olds. His use of balloons was pedestrian and outdated.  The customs were ridiculous and the music was ear piercing.  The second act had a similar ear bleeding music and about this time I had enough, I left halfway through the act, luckily I was in the back and could escape without interrupting the performer.  . . I'm glad I went, but I'll NEVER go back again.  Unless you have an guest invite, you're not missing anything.
