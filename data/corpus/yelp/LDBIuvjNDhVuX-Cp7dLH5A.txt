Hands down, this is some of the best sushi I've had in the city of Chicago.  What stood out to me was the quality of their hand rolls, they were fresh, and well assembled.  Besides that, the nigiri pieces we were given were generous, and all of the fish tasted great.. . The prices are awesome, we ate until we were totally full and each spent about $23.  . . The only downside was the wait.  They are obviously super packed, and if you go at a busy time you might get stuck waiting for quite a bit at the wine bar next door.  Also, it's a tiny restaurant, but the service isn't as prompt as possible... in fact, it's outright slow.  But the servers are gracious, and you can tell that they are hustling.  Which I appreciated, but it was the only quality of the service that kept the restaurant being 5 stars.  . . I'll definitely be back!
