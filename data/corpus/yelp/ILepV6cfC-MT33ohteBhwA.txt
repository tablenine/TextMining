Nice spot for lunch or dinner..... My friend turned me onto this spot...we went for dinner....it was dark....dimly lit with candles..... However now we go A LOT for lunch. Its a really reasonable price. the food is REALLY GOOD. I get the cashew nut stir fry with no cashews...lol and their thai sweet tea. Their drunken noodles are good too..... the place is usually packed at lunchtime. wonderful parking lot. I like the decor. like another yelper said its a safe bet...u know ur gonna get quality food at a decent price!
