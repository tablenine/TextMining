Came here for their special thursday nights where the only serve a set menu with a lot of diverse food! there were tons of leftovers, which was hilarious because all of the staff expected it and brought out styrofoam boxes without us even having to ask for it. great great time for birthdays, etc... there were like 3 other birthdays that night, including the party i went with. . . food is pretty fabulous... BUT i've had better lamb but i've also had much worse lamb. the chicken dish was really good and the humus of course. it's very meat heavy so the vegetarian options were so-so because the greek style falafel patties were way too overfried. . . you know the drill, as other peole have said. food comes out in amazing portions, belly dancer, dessert, and the end to a happy day :)
