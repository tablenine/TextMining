I was treated out here along with a bunch of other USC kids.  I've had Latin food before, but I've never been much of a fan - it's always been too bland, and too mixed up for me to appreciate (I'm thinking of paellas).. . In short, I think I've just never had good Latin food.  The ceviche was AMAZING - I couldn't stop picking at it!  I'd had ceviche from another brand-name well-received restaurant (in Santana Row in Bay Area) before, but then it just tasted like acid.  The ceviche they have here actually has flavor and texture - definitely eye-opening!. . There were many other appetizers that were ordered - dips, flatbread/cracker things, calamari, etc - but the one that really stood out to me was definitely the ceviche.. . Amongst the 10 students who were at dinner, I'd say roughly half ordered the mahi mahi, which I can't speak for them, but I thought it was de-licious!  . . For dessert, I'd recommend that you don't order the cappuccino.  Typically, a cappuccino is one shot espresso, a bit of milk, and a bit of foam to top - so about the size of two shots, MAYBE three if they're being extra generous.  The cappuccinos here were HUGE and ended up keeping me awake all night.  Probably drip coffee or tea would be a better choice.  As for the desserts themselves, I think that there wasn't a single person at the dinner that didn't enjoy his/her dessert - you can't go wrong! :). . Also!  As far as drinks go, try the pomegranate mojito.  The pomegranate margarita is a bit too strong for my taste (it tasted like tequila with a splash of pomegranate), but the mojito was divine!
