Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
Really, yeah, the bubble tea and smoothies are fantastic. Quite frankly, I much prefer the Taiwanese bakeries that litter NYC. Of course, it's kind of beyond me to give something titled a noodle shop an extremely high rating for their beverages. . . The food there is fresh and good. From what I can tell the food does taste really good, but the menu is really dismal at best. . . It seems half of it is fried rice. Fried rice is probably the most boring thing to me because I remember it being nothing but leftovers thrown into a pan with rice so I had something to eat at school. I guess I equate fried rice with PB+J or hot dogs. . . But unlike something like Hot Doug's for instance, where hot dogs aren't just hot dogs, Joy Yee's really is just fried rice. . . It's a large menu with over 50 different fried rice selection and like cheap sushi restaurants, many of the ingredients over lap. Mango + chicken, mango + beef, ginger + chicken, ginger+ beef, or mango+ginger and chicken, or mango + ginger + beef, or add shrimp. Quite a nice simulation of a broad selection. . . And really, this is Chicago, why go to Chinatown to have Thai food? I'd say the vast majority of Chinese take-out places are owned by Thais. It's like going to a Taqueria to order spaghetti. The other half of the menu isn't Chinese food but really safe designer fusion meals ranging from Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, of maybe 30% authenticity and possibly Emeril Lagasse 70% (I can taste a lot of all-purpose salt seasoning). . . And for what you're paying... c'mon. Disneyland. China Disney-world depresses me less.
