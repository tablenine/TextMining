after refusing to eat fake korean food for a good 6 months my bf finally managed to drag me to the truck in torrance. i like to think of myself as the iron chef judge of korean cuisine..im a bit of a snob when it comes to good and healthy korean food. the burrito alone at kogi is worth stalking the truck and waiting in line for 45 mins. if you've been disappointed w kogi's culinary delights you either a. dont like the essential flavors of korean food to begin with or b. your taste in good food is whack..kidding.. for someone who loooves kimchi, i honestly believe kimchi does not belong in a quesadilla alongside grease and cheese. it was not too great. the burrito's full of flavor and it's a good amount of spicy for western taste (i honestly would prefer some kind of habanero salsa or something to give my food a kick to my stomach).. i hope the truck comes back in time for my next burrito fix.
