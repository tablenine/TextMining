Very disappointed in the "Paella Tuesdays". For the price ($29) I would expect a bit more than Â 1/2 cup of over-cooked (and burnt) rice with 2 nickel-sized pieces of Spanish chorizo and 4 clams for what is considered Marisco (Seafood) Paella. Also, not sure why, but the Paella was covered in a Hollandaise Sauce/Garlic Aioli... probably added to mask the burnt rice taste. The appetizer that accompanied the dish was pretty good at least.. . The Happy Hour tapas and drinks were very good. The Carnitas Sliders were my favorite. My wife enjoyed the potato tacos. The wait staff is very friendly.. . Overall, go to Ciudad for the Happy Hour and stay away from the Paella.. . **Shuttle (Limo) service is great if you have a show to attend to after a few drinks**
