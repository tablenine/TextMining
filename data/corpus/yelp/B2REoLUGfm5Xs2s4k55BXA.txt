Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The bottom line is, their Dumplings are good, but that's about it.  Everything else there is simply sub par.  But then again their dumplings are so good that you'll be craving for some once in a while and want to return just for a round of those.  The dumpling skin is simply so thin that is simply amazing.  I prefer the ones with crab meat inside that's got a nice aroma when you bite into it.  . . The bad: everything else besides their signature dumplings aren't good at all... especially the string beans that they ALWAYS under cook... Last time I couldn't even eat it 'cause it's almost raw, and I had to take it home, re-season them, and stir fry it all over...  . . Be warned, this place is always packed... and be very, very careful when you're parking in the lot... you are warned... :)
