BL is down the street from my school-- an excellent change from Ralph's salad bar. Love the both parts of the restaurant. The front is casual grab and go cafe style, while the back is a sit down and be waited on. Great friendly personable staff. The last time I was here I came with a girlfriend and we split two salads- the waiter had them split it in the back for us what we got seemed like 4 salads. :) . Amazing mushroom fries. I have dreams about them.
