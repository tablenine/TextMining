I hit up the bar to try the Elvis burger which is the burger with bacon, fried bananas, and peanut butter. I was really looking forward to checking this out this slightly bizarre combination. I was interested in the novelty and experience of it, but I didn't really think it would be some burger revelation in terms of flavor and taste. I think I was pretty satisfied with that considered. All the components were solid and the flavors were pretty interesting but it wasn't something I'd probably order again. My main issue with the burger was the amount of peanut butter - I think there was WAY too much on there and it overwhelmed a lot of the other flavors. I tried to scrap most of it off but I guess the damage was already done as it still seemed to be too much. Anyway, the burger was a nice medium-rare as requested which was nice. I ordered mine with fries which were decent but not great - I might skip those. . . 4
