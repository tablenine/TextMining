Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I've been here a few times for dinner, lunch, and gelato.  The gelato is amazing, the best I've ever had.  The restaurant is cute, but nothing super fancy.  I like to sit outside, but if it's crowded you might be seated along a glass wall and literally be one inch from the person on the other side of the glass.  I found it really awkward being that close to a stranger so I ended up sitting with my back against the glass.  I'm sure they enjoyed the image back and hair against the wall.  I really had the urge to smash my face against the glass to freak out the guy next to me.  . . The food and wine has always been just okay.  I've never hated anything I ordered here, but I can't say I was ever impressed with it either.
