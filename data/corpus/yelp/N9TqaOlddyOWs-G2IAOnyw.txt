Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
Seafood restaurants in NYC are hard to come by.  Since the. reviews were on the good side I decided to try it.  Wake up people!. Don't you know frozen lobster smeared with mayonaise disguised. in a roll when you eat it?  The food is anything but cuisine.  The. fried oysters were so small they wouldn't have been there if not. for the breading.  The salad tasted like leftovers.  The noise. was so loud that the waitress asked me to repeat my order twice.. How can chefs  rave about this dump?  The food was not even. passable.  The menu was very limited.  Mermaid Inn is more of a. bar and fast food joint.
