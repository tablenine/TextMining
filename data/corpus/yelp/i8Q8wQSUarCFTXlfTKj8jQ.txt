I hosted a bridal shower in "alcove's alcove" (the supercute private house in the back) over the weekend and cannot say enough good things.   They worked with me on developing a custom brunch menu including amazing desserts like miniature ice cream cones. Their table service was impeccable, especially considering this is primarily a counter service spot.  Perfect place for a small event like this.   I heart the alcove!
