Restaurant: Ecco
Category: Modern European
Warm atmosphere, nice people, good feel and late kitchen.  I've always had a good experience with Ecco.  Food is always on point.  Drink list, on point.  Mature, casual crowd there to do their own thing, not pretentious at all.  Table dining or dining at the bar are equally accomodating experiences.
