Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
Why in the world does a restaurant with its own parking lot need to have valet?  Humph.  Ok, aside from the weird parking issues, this place is a mixed bag.  Love some things, don't like others.. . Love. -Great mojitos. -Great patio. -Great steak fajitas . -Chicken tostada. . Don't Like. -Unneeded valet parking. -Beans: none of their three options taste very good. -The sometimes Buckhead clubby vibe that kicks in after hours. -Fish tacos more expensive and not nearly as good as the ones at La Fonda. -Pork tacos and queso more expensive and not as good as the ones at Taqueria del Sol. . I've not tried everything on the menu, but generally nice to have a Mexican option in the area, but is slightly overpriced and you can find  cheaper and better food at comparable restaurants.
