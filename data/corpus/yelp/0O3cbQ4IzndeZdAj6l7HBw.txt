Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The dumplings, taste good. I was starving coming in here. First time there wasn't a line so I took advantage of it. Normally, you put your name in and wait for hours. This place is always packed. The dumplings do taste good but I thought they were kind of small. So I kept ordering because I was still stuffing them in my face. I don't think I ate as much as I would at a Dim Sum place but didn't fork out an arm and a leg. I spent $60 here by myself. I've spent that much at a sushi place but wow!!. I've been here another time with family but that's about it. The lot is full, the restaurant is full, the waiting list is full.
