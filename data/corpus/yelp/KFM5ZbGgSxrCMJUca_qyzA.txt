Consistently floored by the service here. Took my pawpaw out for dinner on a random Tuesday. He was craving chips and had the audacity to ask if they had them They weren't on the menu and upon a recommendation of water crackers as a sub from our server, I told pop to give it up. Said server proceeded to go above and beyond the call of duty. A few mintues later, he brought out a bowl of crispy, salty and delicious chips that the kitchen prepared on the fly. Will the kitchen consistently prepare food at the whim of patrons (i.e. you)? Probably not. But it was a dead-as-hell Tuesday and I like to think we gave the kitchen something to gnaw on. They didn't have to do this. The server didn't have to mention that it might be nice if he could give table #11 just what they were craving. But he did. The kitchen didn't have to make it. But they did. And all was right with the world. That business-minded server earned a heck of tip that night, but more importantly, he earned the Glenwood a repeat customer who'll happily sing their praises.
