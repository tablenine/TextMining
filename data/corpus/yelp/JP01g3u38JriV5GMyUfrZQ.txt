How lucky am I to be one of those people who never has to chase down the truck?  They often park on my street so all I need to do is grab my purse and walk down the block.. . I had a chance to try their new, revamped tofu tacos and they were pretty damned good.  Albeit soggy, but good. . . Now we all know that I have a paranoia about health department ratings, so as I was waiting for my tacos I started looking inside that truck like, "okay what grade do they have??"  . . I've eaten from the gourmet trucks in the past and never thought about the rating until this visit.  Not sure why.  Maybe because it was night and I'm a little afraid of the dark.  . . So anyway I said, "Oh sh*t!  Trucks don't have ratings!"  Am I really going to be able to eat this food?. . I saw one of the guys in the truck eating.  Yuck!  Can you do that on your own time??  And if that wasn't enough, I'm standing on the sidewalk and a guy walks up to the guy standing next to me and nudges him. "Hey dude there's a huge bug by your foot."  . . Eeeeeeekkkkkk!!. . I ran down the street like Electra Woman and Dyna Girl but then remembered my tacos and ran back.  Am I really going to be able to eat this food?. . So yes.  I walked home, sat on the couch and ate those tacos.  I cleared my mind of everything that happened, turned on the Housewives of ATL and let it all go.  (sigh...)  And again, they were pretty damned good.  . . I would normally give Kogi 3 stars, but the concept and experience are so exciting that they call for one additional star.
