Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
This is yet another restaurant that people have raved about from all over the country, but I thought it was just ok. I ordered the most popular menu item, the "Midnight Train" which is a waffle with chicken wings. The waffle was decent, the chicken was extremely greasy and unseasoned. I also ordered the peach cobbler which was doughy and not sweet at all. It's nice to say that I've been to Gladys Knight Chicken and Waffles, but the food was not worth the 15 minute trip. Maybe I just don't have southern taste buds because everything that people down here like is just plain nasty to me. Anyway, there is free parking in the back. The service was good, the prices were pretty low ($9 for my main plate), but this is another place I'm putting on my thumbs down list.
