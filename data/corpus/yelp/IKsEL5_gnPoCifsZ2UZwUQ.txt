perfect for a 2:30am breakfast. I prefer the fred mcmurray sandwich over anything. The sausage is homemade, and the hash browns are perfect. greasy and crispy shredded goodness. Best idea: take out all the cash you'll need for the night (6 drinks=38 or so bucks), then, with the full knowledge that you'll have trouble gettin home (or talking) if you don't, skip the 6th drink. Go to freds, drink coffee/eat grease for the price of that last not-drink, be not-drunk, go home content, then wake up not hungover and go for a ride on your fixie (cause you're a hipster, or you wouldn't be going to freds)
