so, this place was just ok.  i was expecting it to be so much better, but i was a little disappointed!. . i got a 1, which was really spicy for me.  You can choose from miso (7.45), soy sauce (6.95), or salt (6.95) soup base, and you can add other toppings into the ramen like pork, eggs, butter, garlic, etc. for an additional price.  . . i just didnt even think the ramen tasted that good, and there were sooooooo many bean sprouts, i think i had more sprouts than noodles. I didnt even drink the soup because all i could taste was chili powder, not particularly flavorful.  . . If i do come again next time, I will get something less spicy so i can really taste it and see if i like it better.  . . oh and service was so soooo slow.  it took a while to get seated which i understand because it was busy, but the ramen took at least 30 mins to come out and we had to work hard to get their attention to get water and the check.. . and if you park in the parking lot, you can get it validated from orochon for an hour, and then every 15 mins is $1.50, which is insane.
