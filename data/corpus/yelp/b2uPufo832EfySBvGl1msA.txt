I heart Sola.  The best brunch I've had..........  probably ever.. . We went on Saturday - so not too terribly crowded.  Sat inside to begin with - the atmosphere is so-so/fine - and moved outside to the patio for more mimosas after brunch.  My bloody mary was ON POINT, as was the (Mango) mimosa I got after that.  (I got the regular bloody mary but I heard the wasabi one is to die for).  I ordered the Huevos Benedictos, which was amazing.  It was cornbread, topped with poached eggs and crumbled chorizo, and then some fun twist on hollandaise......  put 'em all together and you've got a party in my mouth.  The two friends I was with loved what they got as well (the breakfast wrap and the crab benedict).. . I would go here anyday, anytime, for any meal.  I thought for as good as the food was, it was still fairly reasonable.  Our waitress was SUPER cool but got kind of lazy/unattentive after our food came (and we needed drink refills) which was a smidge annoying, because they weren't busy.  In her defense, we are lushes.  But otherwise the service was great and I am chomping at the bit to go back.
