I should warn that this place definitely isn't a seafood buffet; you could easily spend over $20 here without getting full. The wait time is also no joke; we had to wait well over an hour in an unheated patio.. . The food was served by the pound in, yes, boiled plastic bags, and all seasoned Cajun-style. Some orders like the shrimp seemed to be more generously portioned than the others, but I couldn't say for sure.. . I might recommend the place if you happen to be in the area or are in the mood for something new. But for my money, I'll take the cheap all you can eat sushi and seafood joints over this anytime.
