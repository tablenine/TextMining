Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
hmm... average I mean average food. I don't crave tender greens and I it reminds me of hospital food. I don't know why everyone likes this place so much.  . . The conversation: "Have you been to Tender Greens? I love that place". Me: "I have been there a couple times for lunch. What do you like there?". Them:"Everything". Me: "Really????". . I had  the chicken at  "Tender Greens" it 's meh, it's better at Zankou Chicken. . I had the angus flank steak...again hospital steak or steak you get at buffets. eeh!
