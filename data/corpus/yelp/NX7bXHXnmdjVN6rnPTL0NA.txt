Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
i have yet to find another greek restaurant that is as good as this one... . . papa cristo's has been around for over half a century, and there is definitely a reason for that. . . kefta kabob?  savory.  lamb chops.  delicious.  grilled tomato-feta-eggplant?  amazing. . . and the list goes on... . . their market also has great greek pastries (baklava anyone?), cheeses, oils, olives, etc. . . do not miss this place!
