I ordered the Old World (scrambled eggs w/ mushroom and caramelized onions) and shared a Crepe (w/ peach, white chocolate and strawberries). Both were amazing!  The eggs were not fully cooked and were the perfect amount of "runny," if you know what I mean. The crepe had a perfect amount of sweetness too! . . Highly recommended.
