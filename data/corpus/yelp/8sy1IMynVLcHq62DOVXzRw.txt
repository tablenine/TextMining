Wow... great food &amp; great service. Casual &amp; mostly affordable. What more could you want? :). . As an omnivore, I'm usually pretty open to vegetarian food, but even for folks that normally steer-clear of vegetarian restaurants I think you'd be pleasantly surprised.. . I had a spring roll appetizer that was fine, but the lasagna entree was really delicious. Honestly I have the waiter to thank for that selection---he was both pleasant &amp; helpful, pointing me in the right direction with choices that were a little unfamiliar for me.. . I didn't get the carrot cake (that Â looked *incredible*) because I was overstuffed. Not to worry though---I'm sure I'll make another trip back, and plan my eating accordingly. ;)
