Bite is a good place for breakfast. I've gone for dinner a few times, and didn't like the food as much and thought it too pricey (it's not very expensive, it's just not worth throwing down ten bucks for.) But if you're a bit early for an Empty Bottle show and hungry, Bite is pretty convienant to waste time in, since it's next door.
