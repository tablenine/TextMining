i went here yesterday and i had the tuna salad.  portions were large, vinegarette was tasty, with four slices of tuna. I enjoyed it, very tasty and very light. . the neighborhood has lots of charm and there are other restaurants in the area to choose from if Tender Greens becomes to crowded.  . . We walked to Royal T to check out their gallery and had some tea.  A nice way to spend your sunday afternoon...
