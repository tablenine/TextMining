this is my husband's all-time favorite sushi restaurant, and he's a hard critic when it comes to sushi.  the fish is always very fresh, and the food is very authentic.  it's always crowded when we come here though, so the wait is always very long.  if you find yourself downtown and craving sushi, we definitely recommend this place.  not cheap!!
