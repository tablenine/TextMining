This place is intimidating to me.  I've been here for dinner once on a gift card, and lunch once with my old boss.  This restaurant/club goes out of their way to make you feel unworthy.  You'd need to be bathing in trend and bucks to feel like part of the scenery.. . The food is pretty good.  Their fondue dessert is more delicious than fondue desserts at fondue restaurants.. . My wife and I were given a $100 gift certificate to this restaurant.  Before we left, I commented that having a $100 gift certificate to this restaurant would still leave us spending more on dinner than we would if we paid our own way somewhere else, and I was right.  I think our final bill was $250, with an appetizer, drinks, entrees, and dessert.. . I suppose I recommend this restaurant if you have a lot of coin to drop.  Just don't be sad when the head waiter stops to say hello to everyone but you unless you're mondo important yourself.
