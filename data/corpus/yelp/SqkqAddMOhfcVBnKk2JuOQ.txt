As a vegetarian, I can't review the pastrami, matzo ball soup...or a lot of other things.  I've had the latkes, and they were ok (got a bit of ribbing from the server about putting ketchup on them, I swear I'm not a gentile!), and last night I had the avocado sandwich: avocado, sprouts, tomato, hold the cheese for me.  I was pleased that they loaded on the avocado and didn't give me two inches of sprouts.  It came with fries or chips; I asked if the fries had been prepared in the same oil as animal products; the server told me I didn't want the fries.  Chips then, for me.  The sandwich was what you'd expect, in that it wasn't particularly special, but satisfying.. . I was with a group of 20, which Canter's handled well, and they had us off in the side room next to the Kibbitz Room, where other patrons were shielded from us and we could hear the live music from the bar.  Our food came out quickly and everybody was happy.  I couldn't resist visiting the bakery counter; everything looks so good it was tough, but I ended up with one of those large cookies with a chocolate dollop.  It was ok, I've had better.  Probably won't stop me from picking something ELSE up, though.  I still don't get why some people think Canter's is a mecca.
