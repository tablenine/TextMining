Heaven On Earth. . . What am I picky about? Sushi. I moved to Atlanta from San Diego 5 months ago and have been searching high &amp; low for a respectable joint for my frequent sushi cravings. After reading all the positive reviews about Wasabi on Yelp a group of us went there for my birthday. . . We ordered the Veggie Roll (someone didn't eat fish), Candy Box, Supercrunch, Wabi Sabi, Pink Lady and one other roll that I cannot remember. . . My taste buds died from happiness. Since that evening nothing has tasted as delicious. Pink Lady was my favorite. The fish tasted FRESH. Unbelievable if I compare it to the other places I've visited. You cannot go wrong with any choice on the menu. Even the Veggie Roll was delicious so don't fear, bring your sushi-shy friends here. . . As for the decor and atmosphere, it's small and intimate. Absolutely perfect for a first date, anniversary, "I want to impress you"..... but don't be surprised if you catch me there in my sweat pants grabbing a to go order!. . *edit*. Be careful who your sushi chef is. The second time I went here the lady behind the counter was very blase about the whole process and left the fish out all over the counter. What we got was ok but warm. And the service..... it's like a whole different staff in the day time (we went in the late afternoon).
