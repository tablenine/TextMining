WOW.  An excellent lunch at an excellent price!  It can't get any better than this.  I've heard about Newport Seafood for a long, long time, so we decided to try the place during their lunch hour.  The two of us ordered:. . - Salt and pepper shrimp. . - Fish with basil. . Before you get your main dishes, you get a cup of hot and sour soup.  Both of the dishes we ordered were tasty, fresh seafood and mouth watering.  I can't remember which was $6.25 and which was $6.75, but for the amount of fresh seafood that Newport serves is an excellent value.  . . The interior is decorated very nicely and the service is very quick, efficient and personable.  I enjoyed the restaurant very much and plan on going back for their lunch specials.. . Cheers!
