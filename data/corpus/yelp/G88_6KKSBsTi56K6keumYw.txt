i ordered the apple cinnamon pancakes and my friend got some chicken breast sandwich that actually tasted pretty darn good.  they have decent food here, but the portions are, let's say....humongonormous??. . my triple stack of pancakes was seriously enough to feed a small third world country family for about 2 days.  i have to say that i felt pretty confident walking into this place that i would be able to polish off a good amount of food.  but as i started my journey across apple cinnamon land, the adventure became more and more of a challenge.  when i finally tapped out, fair estimate says that i finished about 1 out of 3 pancakes that was served to me.  when the waitress brought out my pancakes, i couldn't see ANY part of the plate they were sitting on because they were completely covering it.  these are some SERIOUS portions.  . . needless to say, i walked out of the place with my head held low in shame.  next time, i'll definitely have to take some reinforcements with me.. . park in the Rite-Aid lot.
