Restaurant: Highland Bakery
Category: Bakeries
The Highland Bakery is everything I both love and hate about Atlanta eateries.  I love that they serve some of the best tasting food I've ever had.  I  love that the quality of their service is consistently incredible.  I love their neighborhood feel.  I really love this place, and I'm not the only one.... . The biggest downside to the Highland Bakery is that it's fantastic food and consistent quality make this place a favorite among metro Atlantans.  It's got a fairly substantial crowd on weekdays, but on weekends it can get overwhelming.  While it's great that so many people appreciate this Highlands establishment, waiting for 30 min - 1 hour from the time you walk through the doors to the time you get your food can frustrate the hungry.. . That said, if you have a few extra minutes on a random Tuesday morning head over and try the sweet potato pancakes.  They are delicious!
