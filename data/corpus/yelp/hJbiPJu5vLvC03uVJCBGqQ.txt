Category: American (Traditional)
I don't know what it is about this little dump. I always seem to forget about it and go right to Tito's. However, I remembered about Good 'Ole Johnies the other day and I am glad I did. I love the fact that I can smother my pastrami in American Cheese. I know, that is 'prolly a sin/crime/abomination to some folks, but I dig it. I like the bread too. I am not usually a fan of soft, chewy bread, but I like this bread. Maybe because it soaks up the extra grease? Considering I haven't been to Johnies since I was in High School and smoking dope.. my memory was pretty clear! Yep- it still tastes good.. even sober. . . My only complaint is that I can't remember this place being so expensive. When did pastrami become a delicacy? I mean, they have a huge silver vat in the middle of the kitchen choked full of Pastrami. I can't imagine they pay THAT much for their meat. Well, regardless.. I like this pastrami. Â Oh yeah, ask for the spicy mustard.
