After reading a couple reviews claiming "discrimination!" I had to respond and review a lovely local watering hole and restaurant.. . I'm a huge fan of dive bars - and when I go to one, I know there's a point to dressing a certain way, not putting on my shiniest shoes or my sweetest Melrose couture: and since Lola's is *not* a dive bar, I know that grinding in wearing sub-genre fashion is a no-no as well.  If you describe yourself or your friends as "classy", you may not realize that really classy people don't do that and if you've had a problem getting service or entry at Lola's, there's a chance that your attitude and demeanor gave away something about you that neither your wardrobe nor your ethnicity ever would have suggested.  They may discriminate, but it's certainly not on the basis of gender, race or sexual preference.  It's on attitude and appearance, like every other place in LA.  I've seen plenty of diversity here, and while standing outside waiting on friends or just to be polite while on my cell, I've seen every diverse variety of person walk in without interference unless there was a line or they were at capacity and simply weren't letting people in.. . The food is good, if not Michelin, the drinks are usually tasty and generally strong.  Service can go either way but seems to follow the usual pattern: tip well and you'll get good service.  Act like the wait staff is an organic vending machine and you're on your own.. . Oh!  And the patrons are cute, too.  Seriously: excellent crowd.  Attractive and friendly, within the constraints of the venue.
