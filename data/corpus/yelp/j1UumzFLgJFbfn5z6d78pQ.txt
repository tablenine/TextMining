Well they say sometimes things change for the good and this one is gonna hurt. I was really feeling this place, but a recent event with the owner has caused me to now say NO TO SPOON. I entered for lunch one day for a lunch date asking for a table for two. The OWNER asked me to have a seat as she waited for a table. Kool. Another couple enters asks for a table and are sat almost immediately. Confused I asked why I was not sat first. Her answer?? The second part of my party was not with me therefore I had to wait. I told her I have ever have had to wait. She tells me if anyone has sat me against such a rule they would be fired. AND THEN HAD THE NERVE TO POINT OUT THE ONLY BLACK WAITRESS IN THE BUSINESS ASKING ME IF SHE DID IT. (I know the whole staff, so that was STRIKE 1,2,3 WITH ME)Now I have heard of this with a LARGE party but  a Duo?? So I asked what if I were dining by myself am I not allowed to sit at a table. She says "Of course, but we would make sure you order quickly so as not to take up the table for too long"  Those were her exact words. I understand maximizing your lunch dollars..BUT I EAT AT SPOON 4 TIMES A WEEK. WORK RIGHT NEXT DOOR AND REFER TONS OF MY OWN CUSTOMERS. I felt slighted and unappreciated as well as somewhat discriminated against. I love the staff, but that was so rude and so very disrespectful. Thumbs up to all the waiters there, but thumbs down to the Owner. She gives Spoon a bad taste.
