While I am no expert on Vietnamese food, having tried only a handful of places of probably dubious authenticity, I like Pho.  It is fast, fresh, healthy, and cheap.  Some people complain of the wait, though I have never had to wait more than a few minutes.  Plus it's open pretty late.  Only downside is the cash only status.
