Hide Sushi....this place is pretty small inside so you definitely can't hide in it, but you know what does hide??? the salmon skin the salmon skin rolls!!!! Where was the salmon skin anyway??? Those happen to be one of my favorite roll types and my friend Tanya and I searched through our 4 pieces and there was nothing! And in a place full of fish, you would think there would be plenty of salmon skin to be had!!!. . We also go two sushi combo plates and I got some miso. They miso was pretty good, and that always starts me off on the right foot, and the combos were cheap for the number of pieces we got ranging from shrimp to tuna to salmon to tofu balls to octopus. Not all of them were that flavorful and in some pieces the rice didn't stay together that well either....but the shrimp and salmon and tofu balls were the best....the others well they just kinda took up space in my stomach ha.. . Debbie was smart and ordered the veggie roll. Why the veggie roll you ask? well she wore a cute top actually covered in fish since she doesn't really eat fish!!! Yes, a fish shirt in a sushi house! What could be better?? Well her veggie rolls actually were! I wish I had just ordered those here! And she enjoyed her teriyaki chicken also because it wasn't fish ha. . . I wouldn't "hide" from here again, especially at a price of under $40 for three people to eat at a japanese place that has nice decor inside complete with a cherry blossom ceiling, but I wonder what other japanese treasures are "hiding" on sawtelle that may be a little better.
