My friend and I were there last night. Parking was $2.5 with validation at the Honda Plaza just across Office Depot. There was a fairly long line. I heard it wasn't because it's Saturday evening-- this place is busy during the day as well.. . I can't tell whether the food was good or super good. I know it wasn't bad anyway. We ordered the sashimi deluxe for $21. Hot tea was $1.5 per person. . . Our server was friendly and quite efficient but the guy at the front desk was not very attentive and slightly intimidating. Had it not been with my friend, I might have walked away. I do have a tendency to walk away when I think people are rude.
