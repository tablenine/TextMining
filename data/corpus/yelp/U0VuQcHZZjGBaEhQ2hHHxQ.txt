I must say that this is great food for the price.  I had the Sunset Pasta and it was wonderful.. . But...  They lose a star for the service.  Granted, it was a full restaurant, but we had to actually ask the table busser to box our food for us and another server had to get our check for us because ours was AWOL.  On the plus side, the water glasses were never empty, but the credit for that goes again to our busser and not to the server.. . Another star lost for the use of polystyrene foam (called styrofoam by Dow Chemical) takeout containers.  After twenty years of hearing how bad styrofoam is for the environment, I find it inexcusable for a restaurant to continue to use the substance.  And its not just the environment.  Polystyrene contains styrene, which is listed by the EPA as a possible carcinogenic compound and is also a known neurotoxin.. . Verdict:  Great food and the service was tolerable, but I won't eat there again until they switch to more reusable/recyclable solution for their takeout containers.
