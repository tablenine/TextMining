Category: Breakfast & Brunch
came here for the first time. didnt really know what to expect with chicken and waffles. at first i thought it was going to be like a waffle sandwich but thank goodness it wasn't. this place is quite popular when we came on a sunday night. the parking lot was completely full and we had to wait about 15-20 min for a table for two. . . we ordered. - chicken with gravy - the fried chicken was just okay.. the gravy was good though . - mac&amp;cheese side - ok . - jeanne jones omelette - very mediocre. i wouldnt order this again. it was too plain. it just had cheese and chicken. it was made with shredded chicken so that when you tried to eat a piece of the omlette the chicken would just fall out.. . . the only reason why people do come back is for the waffles. that i'll give four stars. it is pretty dang good.
