Restaurant: Craft
Category: American (New)
The best thing about Craft is that it's one of those nice restaurants people expect a lot out of but when you actually go, the staff is welcoming and warm without being pretentious and stiff. The patrons, however, are a different story. But I guess restaurants can't really control who comes to eat their food. . . As for the food, I think that Craft focuses less on mind-blowing innovation and creativity, and more on exquisite execution. Flavors aren't bold, but they do their part to pique your interest in an understated, classy way. That in itself pushes my 3.5 stars to a 4. . . As a whole, I appreciate restaurants that don't try too hard to impress. Craft gave me an experience that didn't ask too much of me in return. I was comfortable and relaxed, and not stiff or out of my element since the environment of the restaurant wasn't overly "fancy" or pretentious.
