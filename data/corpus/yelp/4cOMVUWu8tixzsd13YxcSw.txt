For all of you sausage lovers, if you haven't tried some taiwanese sausage lately, then your missing out...what...wait...that didn't sound right...let me rephrase...If your hungry for taiwanese sausage...hmmm...that's not coming out very well either. Damn, I don't think I will ever get it right...Anyway, if you are hungry and want to try some taiwanese food, this is the place to be. Their specialty is the taiwanese sausage dish, which comes with rice, scrambled eggs, and vegetables. Very popular dish and very delicious. . . On top of that, their noodles aren't too bad either. Their noodle with braised beef is very good, not too much fat and more meat with spicy soup, what more can you ask for on a HOT day? You better believe I was sweating. . . To top things off, we also had the spicy chicken nuggets...hmmmm...nuggets...but these weren't any ordinary nuggets, they blow McDonald's out of the water, or fryer, whatever...but these nuggets are fantastic, gotta try them if not anything. . . Oh and if your thirsty, all of their juices and made with fresh fruit. So, if you are hungry, give this place a try, I guarantee you will be back.
