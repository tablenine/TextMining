Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
The Mecca of Mexican Food, in the opinion of this Chinese-American kid from San Francisco. For less than $2, you can get a meaty crispy taco with cheese. They pack in the meat, the shell is always fresh and crispy, and they add enough cheese so it spills out. Where else can you get something so delicious for so little dough?!? I can usually engulf 4 tacos, but my last visit I decided to go for 3 and one chicken tamale. Tamale was quite excellent too. They give ample chips on the side too. One could easily spend over $10 for meal here, but you leave satisfied and wanting more. . . If you are near LA, GO HERE for some of the best tacos on the planet!
