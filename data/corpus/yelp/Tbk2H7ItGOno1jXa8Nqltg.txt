This is absolutely the BEST place in town for Shabu.Yes you can go to other places and get a nicer place and less of of a wait. But it's not the same! You have to wait for the BEST! The meat is very tender and tasty! You don't have to get the extra lean portion and pay more. The regular portion is very good. The meat cutter filled me in. The sauces are excellent and plentiful. I find that after you go a couple of times and become a regular....they treat you very well and I always receive good service. I have a great tip for people who can't wait.....go to the "Joy Mart" sake bar just across the way and sit outside and have a cold beer or sake while you wait. If you tell the Shabu guy you'll be there, he'll actually come over to get you when it's your time. By far one of my favorite L.A. eateries!
