Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Got Garlic? Like garlic? I mean, really like garlic? Then The Stinking Rose is your place! From garlic bread to garlic ICE CREAM - yes, you read correctly GARLIC ICE CREAM, you can get your garlic fix here. I tried the clam linguine and my friend had the seafood linguine. MMM MMM good. This place is cute and the ambiance was interesting - imagine Old Spaghetti factory on steroids (in a good way). The service was great and my garlic fetish was satisfied.
