Calamari - breading was slightly mushy, calamari was slightly fishy.  Overall, bland.  "Emulsion" sauce (mayo?) also needed seasoing.. . Beef skewers - good charred flavor, good dipping sauce.. . Radish avocado salad - outstanding.. . Short rib - bland, not "melt in your mouth" as described.. . Duck curry - very good.. . Ginger fried rice - good, loved the fried garlic.. . service was a little too contrived, as if she had memorized what she was supposed to say about each item.  But she recommended the avocado radish salad, which was the best dish of the night.. . Also, don't self -park in colony square, they only validate valet.
