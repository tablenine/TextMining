Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
When the singing Thai Elvis was not the highlight of the dinner, then this place must be doing something right.  The thai food here is very very good, not to mention reasonably priced.  I found some of the soup selections to be a little bland, but the grilled items and the curries were highly satisfying.  Thai Elvis, of course, adds to the flair.  I mean, c'mon, how often do we see that in a regular restaurant?
