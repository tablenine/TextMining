Desserts, paninininininis and a most stellar iced tea experience can be found at this cute little place in the middle of hipsterville. It's usually so crowded at brunch that I don't bother, but it does make for an excellent spot to meet up for an afternoon coffee or even a glass of wine after dinner. . . Overall the cove is worth a stop by and while I think that the place and food here is really more of a 4, I once saw a dwarf with a faux hawk having coffee here and that my friends will get you to 5 or even all the way to 11 in my book!
