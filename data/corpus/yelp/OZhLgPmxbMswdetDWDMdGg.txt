This place is great. The owner was a former client of my father's, so we started coming here years back when it first opened. It's the original and best of them all. The fish is great, but the best part are their creations. The salmon caviar is awesome! The baked crab handrolls are out of this world!! If you want great sushi come here, just remember you might have to wait an hour!
