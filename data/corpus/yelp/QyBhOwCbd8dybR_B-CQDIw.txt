Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
I love Joy Yee's because I live Milwaukee, and have actually driven to Chicago, parked my car in some convenient place with a friend, and taken a special trip south on the red line to end at Chinatown. Shoving throught the wall of people to get your name on the list at Joy Yee's, you know you will see the same five or six people running the restaurant. A few extremely friendly Asian guys for waiters and one or two scary mother figures making mad smoothies and taking the money. . . The fabulous food obviously needs little more praise.. but I have rarely had any disappointment there. My meals at Joy Yee's always include the spicy Sichuan green beans, a mango smoothie with the big black tapioca balls, fresh spring rolls and then some chicken or beef dish that changes. The menu is so big and so interesting (you can choose the picture or written description route) that there is always something interesting to try. . . The only drawback is that potentially huge line, so eat a late breakfast, and then head over for an afternoon lunch, and you might get a table. Unlike some reviewers, I have not found this place full of while people. It seems to me usually full of young Asians and the occasional white or hispanic group.
