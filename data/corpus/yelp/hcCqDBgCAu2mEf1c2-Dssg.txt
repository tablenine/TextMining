-Damn you Lea and Calvin. . -Damn you for standing in the long ass Porto's line. . . -Damn you for bringing this Refugiado (guava and cream cheese strudel) and some of this Cuban bread back up to the Bay. . . -Damn you for this strudel being so light and airy. It's HELLA light like filo dough but has a much softer and less brittle consistency. . . -Damn you for this guava jelly being so fresh and delicious. The tropical guava flavor is soothed by the creamy cream cheese and offers the perfect complement. . . -Damn you guys because I know Copenhagen doesn't have anything like this and now I'm feening for another one, two, sixty-four guava strudels. . . Neil N., if you are reading this, bro, seriously pick me up a box next time you head down. Please.
