Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
The first thing to know is that the food is really good! . . The second thing to know is that the primary business of Papa Cristo's is a market, not a restaurant. The food is served "deli-style" - meaning you wait in line in the corner of the store to order all of your food then you find a table on the other side of the store and they bring your food to you. The food was brought to us very quickly, too quickly I thought, but was pleasantly surprised. . . We both got the roasted lamb plate (served with greek salad and greek potatoes) and an order of spanakopita and dolmades. The lamb was very tasty, and extremely tender. I really liked the greek potatoes, which I had never had - SO yummy! Also, the portions are absolutely HUGE. I barely ate half of what was on my plate and took the rest home! The spanakopita was a bit dry, but Ok. The domades had a bit too much lemon for my taste. I will definitely return to try some of the other delicious sounding items on the menu!
