I came here with a friend specifically to try the gelato.. . Their flavors are somewhat limited, but given that it's also a cafe, the variety is not bad.  I will say that the flavor of my blood-orange gelato was really good - refined, fresh, crisp - like blood oranges in gelato-form.  However the gelato is pretty pricy (3.50 for a small scoop) and the cashier was a little impatient with me wanting to sample a couple of flavors, it being my first time there.  Their blood orange and raspberry sorbets were awesome (they tasted like the actual fruits in gelato-form) but the "banana with dulce de leche" was too sweet for me.. . Overall, I prefer SCOOPS for their friendly service, quantity, variety, and prices, even if Milk's gelato is very subtly more refined-tasting.
