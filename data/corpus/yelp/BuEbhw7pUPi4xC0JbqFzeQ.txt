Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm still in love with this place. After a long drive down from SF, this was the first spot we hit. I decided not to go big this time like the last with the Planet Hollywood. The Three Dog Night was sounding pretty tasty, but I ended up just settling for the Chili Cheese Dog with tomatoes and whatever else on it. It wasn't like the biggest hot dog ever, but I still left feeling satisfied. . . ... and this is why I would endure such a long drive for Pink's.
