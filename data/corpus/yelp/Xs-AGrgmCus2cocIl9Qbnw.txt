Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
Cut was both amazing and disappointing if that is possible.. . The ambiance is fabulous, the room is unlike anything I've ever had dinner in. Gorgeous, white, stark, cool, hip, you feel as if you're eating in a architectural masterpiece.. . The service is also great, very friendly server, very helpful, the staff is absolutely first rate. Celebs abound, you never know who you'll be sitting next to. It's a see and be seen place.. . The appetizer I had was the bone marrow and it was very interesting, different, likable. The side dishes were excellent too, awesome potatoes.. . And then there was the steak. At $60 a pop , I expected something superb. What I got was way over-salted, almost to the point of being inedible. I felt a little embarassed about sending something back here, I don't know why. So I did my best to scrape way as much excess salt as I could, but there was just so much of it. Â My friend's steak was good but not great, and we both left feeling very mixed about the experience. Glad we tried it, but not really keen on ever coming back.
