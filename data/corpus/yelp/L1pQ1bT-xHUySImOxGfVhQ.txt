It's as good as every one says. The wait is as long as everyone says. Is it worth it?... yes. . . It's no frills eat at the counter shabu shabu with a fast turn over. You go there to eat so dont linger. Get your food, eat and get out. If you forget that it's a no linger zone just look over at the huge group of people staring you down to get your seat and you will remember in short order. . . In the heart of little Tokyo's Japanese Plaza  so while you wait the hour to get seated you can people watch and count the fashion donts. (there are many) or you can stare at the giant rock in the center plaza.  It wont tell you  your future but on the rare occasion you can see a small child come crashing down off it after climbing to the top.
