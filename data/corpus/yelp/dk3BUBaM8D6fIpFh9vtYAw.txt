This place was pretty darn good.  I came here after flying into Chicago with my sister to grab a bite to eat.  We were seated right away...she ordered an ice tea which was awesome.  Sometimes it's watery and bland but this wasn't.  . . We split the spinach artichoke dip with pita bread...it was excellent, the pita slices were warm and herby...quite delicious!  We also split the buffalo chicken wrap and a salad.  The wrap was excellent, good combo of actually crispy chicken, blue cheese, veggies and the wrap wasn't too doughy or like a tortilla.  The side salad was also excellent, it had romaine lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and sliced green apples...not your typical side salad.  . . All in all it was a good spot to grab a bite to eat.  The decor is also fabulous...a little upscale for a sports bar but I don't own the place so whatever.  . . P.S. They had plenty of women's bathrooms and this very cute lit hallway back to them.  A+!
