So this review has been long in coming. I deem this place as one of the best deli's in Chicago. I always love there corn beef, and always get a matzo ball soup. It opens up your Â inner Jew in you(no offense meant).. I've had many upon many places that say they have a great corn beef but this place sets the standard with its immense proportions as well as the whole grain mustard that is sitting at the table waiting for you what better to accompany this masterpiece then the two potato pancakes that are served along with your favorite helping of Dr. brown. I have to come here at least once every two weeks
