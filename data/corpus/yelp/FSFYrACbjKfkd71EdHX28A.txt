Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
It's kind of a win-lose situation.  The win being you get to visit this well known establishment and say you've been there.  The lose is the hot dogs themselves are only marginally exciting.  Though they have interesting topping choices.  And it's fun to read through the menu and decide which celebrity's dogs you like.  I doubt people who live in the area visit here often, sans a visit or two with out of towners..
