I took my boyfriend to Fraiche for a nice bday dinner. . . Food and service this night got a thumbs up.. . We wanted to cocktail it that night, but were pleasantly greeted by the Sommelier there offering any assistance on wine recommendations. I ordered the Grape to drink, delicious -- fresh and not to sweet. But good luck getting any liquid goodness out of the straw, the grapes muddled in the bottom were speed bumps to happiness.. . Fresh bread and olive tapenade arrived with our drinks to kick us off.. . Our server was very knowledgeable and pleasant and made us feel right at home.. . So we decided to start with the Burrata Speck Salad (sans speck) -- THUMBS UP. it came with a bit of watercress, shaved almonds, drizzled in balsalmic vinaigrette. Very nice starter.. . For an entree, we BOTH ordered the Monkfish Francaise. IT. WAS. OUT. STANDING. IT was cooked perfectly and came with spinach, white wine and shallots. Though the sweets menu looked great, there was no need for dessert, we were perfectly content.. . I highly recommend dinner here. Make a reservation. Sometimes it's busy!. . On a side note -- Fraiche has a fab happy hour from 530-630pm 7 days a week--- i know, only ONE HOUR to GET HAPPY. But the $4 cosmos and $5 cheese fondue is worth it.
