Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Pros: CHEAP, Lamb, Beer, Nostalgia, A Classic and Original L.A. location, YUMMY!. . Cons: Cash Only, LONG LINES, Occasionally overcrowded, NO AIR CONDITIONING- In the summer this is really a deal breaker.. . I go to Phippe's maybe twice a year because I get a deep rooted craving for their Lamb dip. This makes the wait okay. . . As soon as you walk in, you'll notice sawdust on the floor, and if you arrive anytime that isn't a lull, you may not be able to open the door...the line gets ridiculous. They've got 6-8? cashiers taking orders and prepping cafeteria trays. The seating is first come first serve, and you sometimes have to share a table.. . This is a MUST for any L.A. visitor, as it is within skipping distance from Union Station and China Town. Just make sure you don't go with anyone impatient.
