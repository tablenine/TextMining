Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Most of the Korean bbq AYCE,  you only spend about $15, same as here....,  the outside area is huge, so there's no problem in getting seated when you're with a big party. BUT it's not quit safe on the raining day!!!! i mean it!!~~ ^_^"   It's a great and convenient place to go to celebrate the birthday!!! and when u leave.......expect to smell like smoke!! =(  Its just part of the experience! this place might not have the highest quality of meat, but.....if you can eat a lot, I think what you get at here is definitely worth what you're paying.
