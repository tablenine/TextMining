4 stars for great service and the two hearted bell's ale offering.  . . But only 3 stars for the -just ok- pizza that was extremely overpriced.  I appreciate the organic and local piece they bring to the table but I can get better elsewhere for the price.. . I would come back--but only if someone else was treating.
