I love the dim lighting but hate the huge televisions that your eyes are drawn to because of the darkness around you. Good service but bad drink specials, no money saved there but food prices are pretty cheap. The stuffed turkey sandwich and sloppy joes's are good and yummy pickles come with. . . What is up with that slaw??? It is bad and I've had a lot of slaw. Even after putting some salt on it I was able to just taste this odd bad almost nothingness that I really can't describe. Tater tots are a much better bet for a side. You can't mess up tots.
