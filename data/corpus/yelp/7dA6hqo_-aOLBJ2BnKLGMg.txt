as an avid assman, i'm so happy that i can say "hot bao (buns)" and not get slapped for it.. . the food is great too.. . try the ginger ale. it's niiiice.. . the bbq is my favorite if you want a break while shopping for overpriced underwear...or you're tired of being sneered at by yuppies. stop by there.. . and i just realized. wouldn't it fxcking rock balls if this place delivered?
