I was really disappointed when I went here with a couple friends. My one friend is a self-described burger snob and he has rubbed off on me. I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done. Plus you could tell the meat wasn't as high quality as I would like for a $9 burger. The choices of getting to make your own burger were nice, but I felt like anything that I really wanted was extra money (bacon, avocado). And there was no sauce that was like thousand island (my favorite burger topping) or a balsamic. I def felt like I was overcharged for a sub-par burger. I doubt I'll be back any time soon - if you want a good burger in the area, go to Duke's on Clark.
