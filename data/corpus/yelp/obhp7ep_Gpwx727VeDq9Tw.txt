Just another yard house...and while my experience here has always been decent and the food has always been a hair above average, I could never give  a chain restaurant a 4 star rating...chains lack that crucial element of uniqueness that makes a 4 star rating so deserving.  Not that I would never hand out 4 stars to a chain establishment, just that doing so would require some razzle dazzle ...maybe some spirit fingers or a server who sincerely loves their job but not to the point where it's annoying.. That said, had lunch here today with a friend of mine.  Ordered the angel hair pasta, with shrimp and some creamy sauce..vodka pasta I guess? Nothing memorable about it really....wasn't terrible but I probably wouldn't order it again...Now I did thoroughly enjoy my buffalo wings....man I love Buffalo wings....I want to marry Buffalo wings.
