I was disappointed overall.  The Lobster Bisque had no lobster pieces even a little sliver would add to the presentation.  I had to send the asparagus back the first time because it was way overcooked.  The signature fried lobster tail reminded me of fish and chips, lobster is best when you can tell it is lobster.  The steak and veal chop were great but the price hardly justifies the experience.
