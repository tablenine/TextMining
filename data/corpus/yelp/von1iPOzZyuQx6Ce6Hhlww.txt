I liked this place, but the wait after wait killed me.  We had to wait for a table that would fit just the 2 of us despite there being seats.  We had to wait for our waiter every so often because it was so crowded and busy.  I get it, it was a Saturday night.  No harm done.  Lovely atmosphere.  Very rugged, but upscale at the same time.. . Our waitress was super sweet and helpful in giving her options to what we were up for.  I ordered a drink that was something along the lines of a Long Island Ice T, but with a flair of citrus for that summer time feel.  We weren't that hungry and I was trying to plan out my course of action of where and what I was eating at later.  I wanted animal fries from In n' Out.  Don't ask!  Anyway, we ordered the yellowtail ceviche and the hand rolled pasta.  The yellowtail ceviche was a mix of diced yellowtail, avocado, chilies and cilantro.  The hand rolled pasta was accompanied w/bbq pulled pork, peppers and some greens.  All very tasty.  I love the ceviche the best.  I could eat that all day.  As for the pasta, the flavors all though wonderful, overpowered at times.  Would have stayed for more, but being on a tight schedule of things to eat while there, I had to spare room for the next spot.. . I hear the cheese and cured meat platter is the thing to sample, but maybe next time...
