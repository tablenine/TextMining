Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Raised in the barrio they now call, Lynwood, one becomes accustomed to a certain taste for mexican food.  so when we rolled up to paco's tacos (which is near my work), I had my mexican tastebuds on full alert.  . . Once we sat, they took our drink orders.  Asked me what I would like, I said "Can I get a Tamarindo, please?" We dont have tamarindo. boo!  Ok, fine can I get a Horchata? no horchata...we have coke, diet coke...blah blah... What the heezy? no Tamarindo or Horchata? freakin' any kind of agua fresca? nope.  wow, I swore I entered a mexican restaurant. minus 1 star fo sho!. . grubbed on the chips and salsa. hot, fresh, salty and crispy chips. thumbs up! salsa with a little kick. two thumbs up! ok....starting to like the joint.. . ordered the chimichanga (shredded beef), a chicken taco and arroz y frijoles.  Breakdown of my meal:. -Chimichanga was petite but tasty. -Taco was nice and greasy, just the way I like it... -what stole the show was the beans...Im not a beans type of dude, but they were tasty.  probably all that freakin' lard caressed in there.. . Overall, my meal was decent.  Service was good.  Definitely coming back again.  Lucky Jackson approves, but still got love for street mexican food.
