Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Flo is a fabulous neighborhood spot for brunch, but be prepared for a pretty long wait before you can get in...If they're incredibly crowded (especially if the weather is warm), you'll find that you're sitting in cramped quarters once you've gotten a table - but it's worth it. . . Their egg sandwich is fabulous, especially when paired with the fresh fruit and granola. Their coffees are wonderful. Their prices are friendly ($20 paid for two dishes, two lattes, tax and tip). Even the chocolate and banana pancakes are to die for (ask for extra chocolate)! . . Make sure you're there early enough to avoid the wait...And if you're driving? You'll have to find street parking and Chicago Avenue tends to be packed with parked cars...A few of the little side streets are not permit parking, so don't be afraid to park there!
