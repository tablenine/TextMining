I have been a regular customer since my first visit to this place, recommending it right and left, and never in my life have I been treated with such disrespect by anyone as I was by the manager and, apparently, part owner of Terroni's, Max Stefanelli.  . . Of course, I did the unthinkable and asked for grated cheese with my pizza. The waitress told me they did not serve it with pizza, it wasn't "authentic." Hmm, interesting, considering it was authentic enough for my Italian grandparents and all over Italy when I was there last month.  (I have since learned from others they were told things like "I'll get fired if I bring it!" from their servers.) Oh well, but this would take some further explanation to convince me, so I asked for the manager.  Enter, one very unfriendly Italian man.  . . "What is the problem?"  He already hates me.. "We would like grated cheese for our pizza." . "We don't serve it with pizza."  . "Yes, but we are eating the pizza and we would like it."  . "You can't have it."  . My friend, in a tone of disbelief pipes in, "Ok, can I have some grated cheese with my water?" . "GET OUT, don't pay, just get out," bellows the miserable man, as if auditioning to play the Soup Nazi in the off-Broadway version of Seinfeld. Get out because I want grated cheese?  Really? . . So, one free meal later, I will never be returning.  All I can say is, if you won't boycott Terroni's with me, at least when you go, order a pizza after your meal and ask for some grated cheese.  Then ask for Max.  And the Cheese Comp.
