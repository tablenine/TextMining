What a perfect date night. Unfortunately the guy is no more but lucky me Highland Tap is still around. lol. . Oooo Highland Tap how I love your crab cakes, apple martinis, and filet. Mmmmmmmm . . Two words people...Crab Cakes. I would honestly say don't worry about ordering anything else, just crab cakes. I can't say i've ever had a crab cake that was so melt in your mouth unbelievably tastey. I mean ridiculously unbelievably tastey. Yes, they are that good. . . With dim lighting, courteous and knowledgable staff, and a good vibe, despite the restaurant being right next to the bar area, it is a really nice place for a date. A bit pricey but definitely worth it.. . We started off with two martinis, and an appetizer of crab cakes and calamari. I'm not a martini officianado so I had no idea what a side car was until it came with the drink and yes I had to ask why my martini came with another glass filled with more vodka. lol For those of you that are as clueless as I was a side car is the remainder of your martini so that way instead of ordering a refill you have one already at your table without being charged for a 2nd drink, which I think is pretty spiffy. Everyone likes to get a bit more for your dollar right?!?! . . The calamari was ok, but again the crab cakes were the winner for the evening. Delishhh!!! . . After the appetizers we recieved our meals, one filet and side salad with some sort of delicious bacon dressing and a prime rib with a side of asparagus. The filet, amazing and cooked perfectly, but the prime rib I would have to say I was a bit disappointed. When I told friends we went to Highland Tap they raved about the prime rib but honestly I have had better. It was just a bit too bland for me, but again kudos to the filet. . . All in all this is a great place for a romantic dinner; great martinis, crab cakes, and filet.
