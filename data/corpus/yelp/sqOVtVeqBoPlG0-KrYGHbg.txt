This is my new favorite place to get ice cream. Although the choices are not extensive. There're only about 12 flavors in the regrigerator. However, almost all the flavors which I've tried so far are terrific. The most impressive one should be the papaya ice cream( or sobert...i forgot). It has the real papaya taste unlike the tasteless papaya juice at Jamba Juice. The Thai tea ice cream is also very sweet and tasty. Â Besides, the price is quite reasonable~ one scoop for 2.5 bucks( not including tax) and same price for an ice cream coockie. It looks like the ice cream coockie at Boule ~ well it may not be as great as those expensive ice cream but still good~ especially concerned with its price. Anyway until i visit the legendary Scoops ice cream~ this place certainly will still be my first choice to get icecream
