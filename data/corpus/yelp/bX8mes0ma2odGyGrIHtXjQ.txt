I came here on a Sunday night for a friend's birthday. As usual, Yamato is ALWAYS packed because of their low prices. The inside of YAMATO is VERY NICE: classy, edgy, trendy, and well-decorated (besides that RANDOM Darth Vader statue that's placed in front by the host's table). Anyways, we didn't have to wait long because we had a pretty big party (around 8). We luckily got the special table that is encased in a wooden room. The privacy was definitely nice and so I'm giving kudos to Yamato for giving us the "special" room.. . Anyways, as everyone knows, Yamato slashed their prices of their sushi in half...probably because they're competing with AMI SUSHI (my all time fave sushi place in Westwood). Service here is fast and friendly, which is definitely a plus. The food here isn't so great, even though it is half-off. There's not alot to choose from and the quality of the sushi is pretty low. I ordered their orange dragon roll and their rainbow roll. Fish was pretty fresh for the rainbow roll, BUT the quality of the cali roll underneath it wasn't so great. The orange dragon roll tasted mildly sour but sweet at the same time...which is strange because they might have undercooked their fish.. . Overall, I wouldn't really go here unless I HAVE TO. And the open hours here at Yamato is erratic; they're not opened from 9 am to 10 pm straight like other sushi restaurants. They have time frames for when they're opened and closed. Don't know why but it's an inconvenience for most ppl when they WANT to come to Yamato, but hey !! AMI SUSHI is just right down the street.
