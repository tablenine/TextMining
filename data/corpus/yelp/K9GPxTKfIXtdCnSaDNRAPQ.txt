Category: Steakhouses
Ive lived in Chicago for all my life, except those six months in Greece, and of course ive heard of Gibsons......and ive bin to many different steakhouses such as Fogo or Brazzaz but never bin here-so from all the hype i expected the world from them and they didn't disappoint.....Thank God we had reservations which still took us about 20 minutes to get seated....Its at a great location and the crowd was awesome..... . We started off with Crabmeat Avocado appetizer which words cant explain what it does to your taste buds! Then i had the Fillet Mignon Â with mashed potatoes and let me tell you it was seasoned to perfection.....Great great food.........My friend had the Calamari with Asparagus which was fantastic..... . Great Liquor selection but of course i went with my favorite Cognac- Hennessy.....Kinda pricey but worth every penny....
