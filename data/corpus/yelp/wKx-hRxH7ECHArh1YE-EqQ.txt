simply pricey but also simply excellent. don't let the stuffy decor dissuade you. i've had two meals (lunch and  a prix fixe--that's about the extent of my french-- dinner) and one picnic bento box and every sweet and savory bite has been inventive or scrumptious --and usually both. the service is attentive.. . i unequivocally recommend springing for their picnic bento boxes for  your next hollywood bowl visit or any other function (lunch on your front lawn?). you'll never want to pack your own basket again.. . bonus: french lessons are piped into the bathroom. i don't know where else you can get that.
