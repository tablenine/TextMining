Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
I ate at CUT for a business meal with some colleagues - heard it was worth the trip. It is somewhat cut from the mold of a good restaurant in France or Italy - service is extremely courteous, but the dining experience will take awhile. . . The appetizers are very competent - I enjoyed the soft-shell crab (seemed like that was a popular choice) as well as the tuna tartare. . . The steaks - don't get me wrong, they are better than about 98% of what you have had in your lifetime. The Japanese wagyu has an interesting, almost "buttery" flavor - almost everyone in our group agreed that this might have been better for an appetizer, as most of us brought our appetites and a steak like this is almost too sweet for more than a few oz. of consumption. The American wagyu is an excellent steak - make sure to top off with the caramelized onions (an extra $9, but if you're here and you're serious that's a drop in the bucket). . . The desserts are VERY enjoyable - make sure to keep some of your wine from dinner handy (I don't often see Nebbiolo, but it's a fun beginner/ender grape to drink - try it). I enjoyed the Baked Alaska, but the Souffle was just slightly too dry.. . Overall, still top-notch - but for a perfect steak, in my opinion, you're better off heading to Mastro's.
