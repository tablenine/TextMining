Restaurant: Icosium Kaf√©
Category: Creperies
Icosium is one of my FAVORITE restaurants. The savory crepes make an EXCELLENT lunch or dinner. They come with hot soup that varies by season and is always really good. Also, it's BYOB. I like to go with a friend. One of us orders a savory crepe, the other orders a salad and we share. Both come with soup. Then we'll split a dessert crepe and a bottle of wine from home. A HUGE and DELICIOUS dinner for SO CHEAP!
