Some obvious benefits to this place: It's right off the Red Line, it has a rooftop deck, nobody punches you in the face when you walk inside. That's about it.. . The food is okay and the beer is "meh" (to quote Louis A). In fact, most of the brews are crap, but that's not really surprising. . . I've never sat in the dining room so I don't know how the waiter service is, but I always thought the bartenders did a pretty good job, so I can't kill them on that.. . Basically, for me, the food and the beer isn't bad enough to trump the positive aspects of this place. I wouldn't make this my regular hang out or anything, but I have no problem hitting it up every so often.
