I really want to give this place an even lower rating than what it is currently (to balance it out) because this place is way over hyped. Nothing really to write home about if you are Chinese. Paid $75 for a 4.5 lb lobster that was slightly better than other restaurants. Their Kung Pao Chicken was prettty good. Half of their dishes involve some sort of garlic. The french beef cubes were to expectation (it was very tender and had lots of flavor). $128 w/o tip is insanely expensive for 3 people at a Chinese restaurant, but it's mother's day eh. Bring down the price a bit and maybe a 4 star rating is warranted. (FYI: my family went to a supermarket and the lobster is $7/lb while this restaurant charged a little over $15/lb)... deserves 3.5 stars
