I love this place. Granted the median age of the dinners is probably 60+ but that pales in comparison to the fantastic offerings. From the fried chicken, rolls. prime rib to the best key lime pie I have ever had, I love this Atlanta institution that always makes me feel that I am at my grandma's enjoying Sunday dinner ( that is if my grandma had made Sunday dinners). Did I mention they know how to make a cocktail? Â The staff is knowledge and quite personable too. I always bring my out of town friends and family here for a state of southern hospitality.
