Excellent food, attentive service and awesome feel/ambience.  Ordered the filet for main course, which was perfect.  Very pricey, but certainly worth it if you want to dine at a top LA steakhouse.. . We didn't have a large group (only 6) but it was sometimes difficult to hear people across the table, so this might be better a place for 2 people as opposed to large groups.. . Great "scene" as well, if you're into that sorta thing.
