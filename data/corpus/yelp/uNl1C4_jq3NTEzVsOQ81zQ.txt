I think it depends what you are looking for (that is why the four stars). If you like pre drinks, people watching, lounge music, in a specias atmosphere buddha bar is your location. . On the weekend very crowded and a very touristy European vibe. (I guess because of Buddha Bar Paris), but everyone dressed to show. The food is good though very little portions for a high price. Apetizers and desserts are def better then the main course, but that is the case in many restaurants (I think a PR thing. People generally remember the first and the last course).
