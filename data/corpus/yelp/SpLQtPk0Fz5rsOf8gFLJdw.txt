Everybody should come here for the juicy pork dumplings. Mm mm they're soo good! We always order multiple orders of juicy pork dumplings, a rice cake dish (try this, so good), a veggie and fried rice.. . There's a special technique to properly eat these juicy dumplings. I usually pick a dumpling out of the steel steamer with my chopsticks, dip it into my condiment saucer (which consist of soy sauce, chili and ginger) then put it on my porcelain spoon, then slowly bite into the skin of the dumpling and savor the juice. Then eat the whole thing.. . Yum...
