Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Simply put, Roscoe's serves delicious, clog-an-artery-or-two, put-some-meat-on-'dem-bones food!  It tastes good, it's served hot, and you always leave satisfied.  What's not to love?. . Before I took him here, my bf couldn't understand all the excitement over Roscoe's.  So one morning, half hungover and very sleep deprived from the night before, I dragged him across the SFV to Roscoe's Pasadena.  Before I had even finished pouring the syrup over my waffles, he had inhaled his plate of chicken, rice, and gravy.  He quickly became a fan and finally understood why people love this place so much!. . It's not gourmet, it's better; its comfort food that always hits the spot!
