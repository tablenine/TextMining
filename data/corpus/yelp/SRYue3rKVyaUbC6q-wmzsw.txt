Big fan of Big Star! Definitely my new go-to spot in the neighborhood. First impression of this place was the guy checking our ID's, who was over 50 and I assumed to be the owner. Cool. We stopped in sometime after 1 a.m. and the kitchen was still knocking it out, so three friends and I sampled the menu and loved everything we tried. Started with guac - fresh and the chips were plentiful and served warm with salt &amp; lime. They killed it with the pork belly tacos, and whatever other ones we got were great as well - i think pastor, fish and some kind of tostadas. Tortillas are homemade and the food is much higher quality than a standard taqueria. Great tequilas, whiskey and my Badger friends and I will be back for the Blatz, Â Schlitz, or whatever old school beer was on tap.
