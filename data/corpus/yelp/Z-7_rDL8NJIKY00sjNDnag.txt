I liked the atmosphere here a lot, however the lights can be a little too dim. It was doable, but where we were sitting there were no light fixtures above us. If it were just a little bit brighter, it would make this place 100% awesome. I suggest at least one bulb above each table.. . It gets crowded so try to come early. Seats outside are the best on a good summer night. Too bad it's hard to get one during prime time.. . There is a huge selection of beers--maybe like one-fourth of what Yardhouse carries. I wish I could try them all.. . We split an Office Burger which was made differently than other burger joints so that made the experience more worth it. I think there was spinach in the burger also. The frites (not the sweet pototato fries) were bomb. The sauce that comes with it, also bomb--some garlic goodness.. . I would definitely come back with a big group of friends. Just to note if you don't know, ONLY 21 and up allowed.
