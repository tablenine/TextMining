Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
can a restaurant "woo" you?. . i believe so, and i believe the creperie has done just that.. . the creperie has that je ne sais quoi that makes dining out feel like a truly special treat. the food is delicious, the atmosphere is simply charming, and the service is quite friendly.  the cozy tables for two, the soft (albeit led) candlelight glimmer, the delicately patterned china plates, the edith piaf soundtrack... ::swoon::
