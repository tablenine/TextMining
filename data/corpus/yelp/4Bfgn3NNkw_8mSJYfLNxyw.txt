Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Well what can I say about this amazing place. You will not find any better pizza in Los Angeles, PERIOD! If you don't like the Pizza from Casa Bianca then don't ever bother going to Chicago and getting thin crust from the south side. This pizza is the REAL DEAL everyone. This is your crispy, thin pizza cut in squares that you would find in the Chicago/South side area. Not the deep dish, that stuff is for tourists. You can't go wrong with anything at this place really. I also highly recommend the mixed noodles al Bianco with a side of marinara sauce. It's AMAZING! Yes the wait can be long that's why you just get some beer or wine and drink on the street!
