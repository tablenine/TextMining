Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
I think I'm going to be in the minority here, and maybe a bit unpopular for saying so, but the food at Mozza Pizzeria and Osteria is very salty. I first went to the Pizzeria when it opened and ordered the mushroom pizza and thought it was oversalted. A few months ago I went to the Osteria and ordered the clam linguine which was so salty I couldn't finish the dish. The only good thing was the homemade mozzarella. Additionally, I made a reservation to have dinner at the bar and the bartender/waiter was rude and insinuated that we seated ourselves. Overall I can't say I will return to either establishment.
