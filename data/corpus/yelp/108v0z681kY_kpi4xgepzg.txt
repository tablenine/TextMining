I don't get it.  The service was fine, and the appetizers were ok, but the pizza was not good at all.  I've had plenty of deep dish before, but this was essentially melted cheese on a plate (and this is coming from somebody who loves cheese).  The crust isn't that good and the sauce is so non-existent that i couldn't tell you how it tastes.  This might be a tourist spot, but if you live in the city, you can definitely find better.
