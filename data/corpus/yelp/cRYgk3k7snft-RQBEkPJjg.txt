Restaurant: BondSt
Category: Japanese
Bond Street is very good Sushi/Japanese. I have been eating at this New York location at least forty times and it is consistent in quality in the restaurant and downstairs lounge. It is fairly small restaurant but it is modern and comfortable. It is great for a date or small group but you need to make a reservation as it has limited tables. It has a nice Martini list and moderate wine list. It is definitely great for chillin with friends.
