Hot damn! 2 lbs of crawdads with the mild whole shebang and a pound of shrimp, head-on of course.. . Got in for a bday dinner for my girl. I haven't been to the original location and that's only 7 miles away compared to driving to the San Gabriel Valley. . . Just be prepared for the ooey goodness that awaits. Well worth the wait, reasonable prices on beer while you wait for that table.. . It's a small place but it makes it more surreal that it's the IT place to be at. . . Don't worry about keeping clean, they got a bib for you. Just don't wear white or make it a prom date. Oh, and throw away eating etiquette. It's an Asian dive, we don't have etiquette. . . BTW. Mild = saracha hot. Maybe a little less.
