Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
first of all, i have tired the Manuel Special.  That burrito was huge!!! but it is very good.  I don't know what else to tell you but you should share with either one or two friends.  My boyfriend and I had shared the Manuel Special, and pretty much finished it.  It is quite filling and it will probably fill you down with all the rice and cheese and beans and beef in it.  It is soo good.  It cost about $20 just for that big burrito, but i believe it is well worth it once in awhile for a burrito that is delicious.
