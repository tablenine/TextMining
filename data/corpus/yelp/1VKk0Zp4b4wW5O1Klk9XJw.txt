Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I was craving Sushi last week and had heard a lot of good things about Tank so I decided to give it a try.  All I can say is that all the hype behind this place makes sense (although always leaves you wanting more since it was talked up so much.). . Tank Sushi delivers a top quality dining experience and top quality Sushi.  The only negative I can say is that it is a little expensive (Ocean Sundae $16.25 although sooo good.) But is expected from a place like this and can be countered by going when they are running there half off special (which I think the bar tender said they are running all week long now.). . An easy 4 stars.
