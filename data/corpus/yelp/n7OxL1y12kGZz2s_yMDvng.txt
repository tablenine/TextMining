I pre-ordered a 11-inch fruit tart for my birthday and it was AmAzInG! The fruit was fresh and gorgeous, and the writing on the cake was beautiful. Just by looking at the blackberries and strawberries, you'll know Porto's specifically picked the best fruit around! I only go to Glendale because of Porto's, so I do wish I lived right next door Â : )
