I can't say enough about this place.  I recently hosted a party here for my daughter's baptism.  We had 40 guests (including a few kids) and not only was the staff friendly and super helpful, but the food was NOM-NOM delicious.  . . Everyone from the management (Adan) to the servers were polite, attentive and eager to please.  They all made sure that my party was taken care of and the guests were happy.  Having to leave the party early to tend to my extremely crabby daughter, I was thankful that the employees did such a good job of handling matters.  All of my guests complimented the food, service, and my restaurant choice (which made me look like a star-even though I did nothing but pay the bill).. . I could go on and on about this super yummy place, but will just say this.  Go eat here. You won't be disappointed.
