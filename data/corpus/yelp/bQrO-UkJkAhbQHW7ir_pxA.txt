Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
I cannot believe I have lived within walking distance of this restaurant for over 5 years, but had not tried it until this summer.  What is wrong with me??  We actually dined in for dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised by the decor (including the bathrooms) - very clean with a great modern Asian vibe.  . . Then, I was even more blown away by the food.  First of all, if you order the mixed appetizer thingy, don't really plan on being hungry for dinner afterward.  But, I have to say, that appetizer sampler rocks!  All items were super yummy (but especially the cigar egg rolls and the crab rangoon...what can I say?  I'm a sucker for the deep fried deliciousness.)  And, for dinner, I highly recommend (I have yet to stray from this favorite of mine) the grilled sake garlic chicken...yummers.  The service was also great - very attentive - I love it when my water glass is never empty.. . And, if you're looking to order take-out, their website has this cool tool so you can order on-line...how convenient.  Thank you Friendship Chinese Restaurant, for being a friend of mine.
