We used to go here almost every weekend, when we had one kid, but now there's too and waiting 30-60 mins for a table just won't work for us anymore.. . I found the staff to be pretty nice.  . . The food is decent, it's your typical diner food.  I usually get the sliders and the cheese fries.  I usually walk out pretty happy.  The shakes are pretty darn good too.  They're large and they bring the extras in a metal cup so you could probably split one.. . For those having dinner there, there is a nice little bar you can sit at and have a drink.. . It's definitely worth a try and pretty kid friendly too.  Go for dinner and you won't wait.  Go for brunch on the weekend and you'll probably wait.
