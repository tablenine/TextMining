I wish I lived in Glendale so I could come to Porto's all the time. You absolutely cannot beat the price and the quality of their bakery items. My friend and I came in and literally got one of everything to try. There are so many good ones I don't think theres a better way to do it! . . You must try the black bean filled plantains covered in sugar. Sounds a little strange but it's worth the risk. That and the potato balls are my absolute favorite. . . Their classification as a Cuban bakery I found a little loose, because on top of some Latin favorites such as guava and cheese pastelitos, they serve amazing sandwiches that any deli/bakery would serve. The turkey croissant is a fresh and delicious choice. . . Eat on the go and on the cheap at Porto's!
