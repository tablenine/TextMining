Nice ambiance, good service, bitchy second floor Maitre d' (made us the "favor" of seating us...). Went for a couple of drinks on a sunny afternoon, and they sat us in the terrace (cool). When the waitress found out that we were doing only drinks and appetizers, she almost had a coronary and hurried to pass us the bill.. She was cute and attentive, but this ruined the moment...
