I can't speak on their deli menu since I've pretty much only had breakfast, but what a great breakfast! You must try their pancakes (to die for!) and a scramble egg with spinach, feta, tomatoes, and scallions...oh so good! The ambiance is pretty regular, but did I mention the pancake?!? Did service is decent. Nothing to write your mom about. Hey try it at least once...
