Paying $13.50 for a sub-par panini burger that doesn't even include fries is not my idea of a great meal. The burger itself was alright, but certainly not worth the price. I'm also pretty sure that the macaroni was of the Kraft variety and wasn't very cheap. The milkshakes were enormous and my triple chocolate shake was rich, thick, and worth every red cent, but the mediocre food still casts a long shadow over my superb shake. . . The one true redemption Milk had to offer was it's Blue Velvet cake. I found it to be a delicious, interesting take on an ageless classic. This curious morsel of pastry goodness will drive me back again, but I'll skip the other fare next time.
