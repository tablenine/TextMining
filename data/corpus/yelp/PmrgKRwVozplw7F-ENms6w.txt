Comfort food in a hole in the wall. I love it. Â It is like Ina's, but without the hype. The food is like you might make for dinner if you had a clue. I have no clues at all so I go here for a simple meal in a place near the house. It is cool, but don't wear a tie as you will look like you are slumming!
