Well overpriced but I loved the designer rolls.  . . Best seaweed salad I've had in a long time (lately I've skipped it altogether because I seem to have run into absurdly tiny portions, or more cucumber than seaweed).  It was a serving big enough for two and very good.. . Great energy for a Sunday night, especially as Mayfest was happening nearby.
