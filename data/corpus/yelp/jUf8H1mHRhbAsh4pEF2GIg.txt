From reading the reviews it seems as though people either love or hate this place. Surprising to me because I've been an avid fan for 5 years now.. . The coffee delivers, the staff has NEVER been rude or discourteous to me.( In fact, I've come to know many of them on a first name basis.) Sure the food isn't OMGAMAZINGWANTTODIE.......... .......but a restaurant that keeps as odd as hours as me, i can be in and out in under an hour, and least but not least, i can bring picky out-of-town eaters and know that they will find something they find palatable that accommodates for veg/vegans? This is invaluable to me.. . You can bring your mom on a sunday for brunch, or show up at 2am on tuesday for munchies? That is a pretty great combo...for my lifestyle anyway.. . Recommend: Italian sodas, vegan rice crispies, pecan pancakes.. Advice: Don't go after a cubs game, unless you like the company of drunk, arrogant, yup... er, umm.. unpleasant people.
