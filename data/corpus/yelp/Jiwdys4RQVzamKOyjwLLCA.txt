Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Two words: Wet Panties. Yes, the burgers here are THAT good and a bit messy - Dirty little bastards just how I like it. . . Truffle burger, YUM. Â Umami x6 burger, YUM, and my favorite the Port and Stilton double Yummm!. . Seriously this place fulfills my craving for meat; just the kind after a 2 hour hike in 95 degree weather and a massive tequila hangover from the night before. . . Besides, secretly the chubby kid inside of me screams - UMAMI, give me more! . . Bravo. I will be coming back. . . And on a side note: 5 stars for their service - the wait staff here rock!
