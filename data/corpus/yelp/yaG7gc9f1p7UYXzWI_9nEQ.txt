Hmmm, what can I say about this place? It was just alright.... . I ordered their breakfast burrito, and it didn't taste Mexican at all...but what did I expect? The burrito cost about $12 (which included $2 for the sausage). It had some potatoes and onions in it, and had cheddar cheese melted on top. The sour cream and salsa were on the side.  It was just...ok.... . My friend ordered their lox bagel, but they didn't even have bagels! We were there at 8am too! Can you believe that? Horrible.... . The service was whatever too. I probably wouldn't come back again...
