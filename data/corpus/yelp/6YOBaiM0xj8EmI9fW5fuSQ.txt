I came here over the weekend with some friends for brunch. It was a little difficult to order since someone in our party had an allergy request and the server didn't speak very good English. He just kept nodding his head as if he understood, and then when the food came, it was really clear he didn't understand a damn thing. When we brought this to his attention, he tried to correct it, but then he ended up changing my order as well as if I also had an allergy. LOL. It was a hot mess, but whatever. . . I got the Flo Combo (eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast). Nothing special. Not sure what all the rave reviews are about. . . Overall a below average experience. Won't be returning here anymore.
