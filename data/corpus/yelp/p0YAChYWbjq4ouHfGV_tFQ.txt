I've come here many times in 2007 for various occasions. I love that the place is cozy and intimate. It is great for a small gathering with girlfriends to celebrate birthdays and special occasions but also a great place to go on a date. . . Its great that its bring your own wine cause it lets you spend a lot more money on food! . . My favorites are the: baked spanish goat cheese, socca cakes, bacon wrapped prawns (everything tastes better with bacon!), clams, sweet papas fritas, and the spanish style barbequed skirt steak.
