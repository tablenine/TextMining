Holy mounds of meat! The corned beef sandwich's are huge and very tasty. I have never nor will never walk out of this place hungry. Wish I could get here more often because the place is great. The service is fast and if its not too busy you can get some quick chit chat about most anything. The potato pancakes are the the best I ever had. They are so good I usually get two. I will forever be a fan of this place. The only down side is that they are very expensive.
