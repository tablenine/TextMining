Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I'm a fan of this place.  I'm only giving it a 4 star because a few of the burgers I had from Mary's were a bit underwhelming.  However, the Lamb Burger (one of their monthly specials) and the Buffy the Burger Slayer are absolute standouts for me.. . The decor is funky and I've not had any issues ever with the service or the staff, both for dine in and take out.
