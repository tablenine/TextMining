Well, was glad to find out that Spago's, as long as it's been around, is still serving very good food. Met some friends here, and we spotted Pat Sajak and some young chick (who was definitely not his daughter) at his side. That was probably the best part of dining at Spago--trying to figure out who the young thing was with him. . . Extremely $$$ for what you get. The good thing is, friends paid! W00t! I shoulda ordered more. Haha.
