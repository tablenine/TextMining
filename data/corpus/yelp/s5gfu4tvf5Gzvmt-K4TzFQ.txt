Great sushi, but slow service. Even though it was a Saturday night, we waited a really long time for our food to come. Once it did come, they screwed up my friends' orders. However, everyone loved their sushi. . . Even the Strawberry martini I ordered upstairs was really good (and so was the music and people watching). I liked the upstairs atmosphere, but it probably would have been a bit hard to hear conversation, so I'm glad we ended up sitting downstairs. Our waitress was nice, but just seemed out of it when bringing our food and forgetting some orders. . . All in all, well worth the experience. A bit pricier than other places, but excellent sushi. My friends have been raving about this place, and I can see why- the sushi rocks.
