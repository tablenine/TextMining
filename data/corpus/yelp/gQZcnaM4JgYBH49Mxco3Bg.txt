We were lucky.  Hunger pangs got us here at 445pm, and the wait was only 10 minutes.  The people who came after 5 had to wait almost an hour.. . We sat at the bar, and the bar staff was knowledgeable, engaging and attentive.  The wine he recommended based on my preference was right on.. . The food!  Wow.  The appetizers were surprising and innovative.  The group next to us got the spicy beets.  Looked great.  Highly recommend the bell pepper w/tuna.  The main course (they are known for their pizzas) hit the spot.  Be sure to ask for some dried peppers to add some kick.. . The dessert was amazing.  We were too full to go for the favorite pudding, but I am glad for checking out the sobet/gelato.  Who knew something so simple could be so heavenly?. . This restaurant sums up my love for LA: trendy, fun, delicious and excellent service.
