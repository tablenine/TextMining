I may be alone with this review...... I'm not that impressed with this place,. The set up is pretty efficient but the food is not that great, the portions are huge and its mostly yuppified comfort food that tastes bland and overpriced. The average sand which ranges from $12-15$  and most of the entrees are around $20. I guess your paying to sit on their deluxe patio. Its a place where people feel important and if you aren't an aspiring yuppie you might feel out of place.
