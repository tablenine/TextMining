3 stars for the sushi and service + one additional star . for the 1/2 off sushi on saturday &amp; sunday before 6p.  . if you are feeling sassy order the latin heat !  it's bold. although i prefer the more simple rolls like my staple. ebi tempura.  the tables along the left wall when you . enter are close quarters and don't be startled when . the host pulls out the table for the person that choses. to sit against the wall because they will push it right. back in once you're seated...check it out, you'll see.
