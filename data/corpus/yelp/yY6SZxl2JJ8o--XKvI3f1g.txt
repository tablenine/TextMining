I've only been once, but if I wait to go a few times before reviewing I will have forgotten the first time I went.  This is a great special occasion type place.  It's a bit pricey, but I've been to a lot of places that were more expensive and not as good.. . First things first, the bread.  Phenomenal.  I could eat a dozen baskets of the bread and butter and be satisfied.. . For the main course we ordered the Chateua Brioadfnkd.  It's like a filet cut that is roasted and sliced and served au jus.  Very good.  With it we ordered the scalloped sweet potatoes, jalapeno cream corn, mac-n-cheese, and mushrooms, listed in order with my favorite first.  They were all absolutely delightful.  You have to get the scalloped potatoes and cream corn.. . The service is on point.  They do a great job of being attentive but not overbearing.. . Kevin Rathbun Steak is yet another reason to never eat at the likes of Morton's.  Thank you for the glorious dinner.
