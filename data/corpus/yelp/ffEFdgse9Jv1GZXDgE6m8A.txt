Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Champagne cocktail? Yes, please.  I'll take two.. . Two lovlies and I arrived about 7:30PM on a weekday.  I had been a bit worried about encountering an after-work crowd.  No such thing.  The place was nearly empty.  We grabbed 3 seats at the bar.  We like to be up close and personal with the action... er, I mean... closer to the alcohol.. . Service was a tad slow.  We had to flag down the bartender a few times to place a food order or ask for another drink.  Don't leave my bubbly empty!. . The crowd moved in at about 8:30.  We encountered a few single businessmen looking for a good time.  They were pretty harmless, but sometimes you just want to enjoy conversation with two friends.. . The Black 75 was divinely delish.  A little Effen Black Cherry and some Cava make for one HAPPY girl.  The food was OK.  We shared some cheese and a few small plates.  Nothing that I was really overly impressed with.. . I didn't NOT like Pops, but I didn't love it either.  It won't be my first choice when scheduling another rendezvous with the gals.  . . Although... I wouldn't mind going back to check out the live jazz in the lower level.
