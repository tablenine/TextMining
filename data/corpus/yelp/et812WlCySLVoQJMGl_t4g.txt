THANK YOU MISS DAVIS. THANK YOU MISS BROWN!!. . I can honestly say this was my FIRST time to eat chicken and waffles. I always thought WTF. I don't like to mix my meals, EVER. but now have been turned on to CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.. . The waffle batter was GREAT!! The fried Chicken batter was DELICIOUS! I do have to say though, I could split the two pieces of chicken and two waffles with someone. Really big portions.
