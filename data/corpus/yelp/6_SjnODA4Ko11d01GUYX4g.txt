Sushi Gen is one of those places you might consider not telling others about, because you want to keep it for yourself, but it seems as though the word is out!  I knew I was in for a treat when I saw the line waiting outside the door on a Monday evening before they opened for dinner! . . Very excellent and straightforward sushi and sashimi, meticulously prepared and fresh as can be.  The tuna sashimi, a staple in most sushi joints, is a cut above here - full-bodied and rich.  But all of the fish is excellent - the miso-sweetened blackened cod somehow stays flakey without being dry.. . Service is good, and prices are very reasonable when compared to newer, more gimmicky sushi restaurants across town - but it's not cheap.
