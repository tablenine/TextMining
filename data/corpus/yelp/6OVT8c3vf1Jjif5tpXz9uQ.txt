Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya is good but I don't think it's great. I think Santouka is much better. . . I usually only go here when I'm eating alone because there's almost always a place on the counter that opens up for one person and I don't think this place is worth the long wait time for parties of 2 or more.. . I think the broth is ok but it feels kind of watered down and lacking in flavor to me. The pork is ok and the egg is just boring. The shredded pork bowl is delicious though. It's super greasy but i think that's what makes it good and it's good as left overs too..
