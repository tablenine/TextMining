What is blue and possibly better than a red velvet cake? Blue velvet cake! Genius! The cake was a dense but not overpoweringly rich combination of blueberry cake layered with one of the best cream cheese frostings I've ever tasted.  Warning: It will turn your mouth blue but its worth it.. The tres leches cake is delicious as well.  Always save room for dessert (or two) if you'll be around Milk.
