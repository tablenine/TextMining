All I can say that when your mocha comes with the cutest flower on it made from foam and chocolate my heart melts and is won over !!!. The food is great - the french toast with bananas for breakfast is a must.. The crowd is always different - and given the fact that I love to people watch to draw my inspiration for writing - I love coming to this place.. I love the tables, they have cool pictures on them - and I also love the fact that the staff is not overly friendly.. I came here many times in weird times of night to meet up with a friend or two because we couldn't sleep and we talked and laughed the night away. :). Oh, lol, and the coffee is great - it picks you up - (I'm such a dork). . Definitely recommend it :)
