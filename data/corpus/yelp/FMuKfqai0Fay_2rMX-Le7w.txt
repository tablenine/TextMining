last weekend was my younger cousin's wedding. I knew I was getting old when i started saying things like "I remember bringing him home from the hospital!" Another sign I knew I wasn't "A few years out of college" anymore - I started to enjoy good cheese &amp; wine. . . Our casual lunch at Bin Wine Cafe was quite adult &amp; easy-going. The sndtrk accompanying our meal was strictly introspective indie rock. But that was another perfect pairing with our wine &amp; cheese. . . gawd, did I really just say I had wine &amp; cheese for lunch? you can't see, but I'm rolling my eyes at myself.. . We don't know squat at wine, so the waitress recommended two different reds to go with our gouda &amp; cheddar. The cheese &amp; the wine exploded together. It was incredible to taste the details in each. . . As for real substance, we had the asparagus salad &amp; croque monsieur. Both were quite light tasty. Nothing too heavy on the taste buds. I actually fell for the garlic aoli. That was great with the slivers of toast they give you with your cheese.. . Other than the pretentious aging hipsters across from us, it was a great lunch.
