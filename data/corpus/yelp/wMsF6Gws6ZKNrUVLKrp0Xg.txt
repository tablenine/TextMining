For the best ramen in town, I feel like this is the joint. So I gave it 5 stars. It doesn't have the best interior, or service (they came around once I believe), the wait is horrible (popularity comes with its price), but the food definitely makes up for it.. . The ramen here is pretty good, to be honest I don't dreaaaaam about it like others may do because I'm just not THAT big of a ramen fan. Despite that, I appreciate how good it tastes. The broth is quite flavorful, the pork is tender, the noodles are perfect. Even if I'm not in the mood for ramen, I love their chicken teriyaki here. Can't I find this at Yoshinoya you may be asking. The answer is No! The chicken teriyaki here has this miniscule crispy texture on the outside. It's a bit unique, but I like it, and the whole bowl is just so delicious. . . Expect a 30 minute wait. Good luck with parking. Drop off your friend to sign in as you search for parking. Bring coins for the meter. It's quite expensive in the Little Tokyo region.
