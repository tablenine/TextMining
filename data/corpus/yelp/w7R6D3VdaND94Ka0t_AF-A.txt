Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
So I finally made it to Palms Thai and I have to say that I was unimpressed with the food.  That's the most important thing to me and they do a very AVERAGE job here.  We had a papaya salad, the tom-yum soup, fried catfish with red curry and finished with some fried bananas.  It wasn't bad by any means, but it was definitely lacking the freshness, quality and flavor that separates good Thai restaurants from those going through the motions.  Now as far as atmosphere is concerned I do give this place a thumbs up given they've got "Thai Elvis" on the mic for your listening pleasure.  It was fun dining entertainment and makes for a cozy environment to be yapping it up with friends.  Now the bench seating I could do without, but we got a side table to ourselves so that made things better.  As for service, it was extremely friendly and quick so that always gets points from me...too bad the food doesn't match up.  Lastly, parking sucked as there was no lot...none that I could find at least, but we lucked out on one of the side streets. Oh, one last thing is that the prices are a little high in my opinion.  It was about $45 total for what the two of us had and the portions were not all that big.  The great thing about Thai is that it can be cheap, but super yummy...not the opposite.. . Overall I wouldn't recommend this place if you know your Thai and really want to EAT, but it would warrant consideration if you were looking for a late night spot where you could chat loudly with friends, have a little goofy entertainment and some so-so food to nosh on.. . P.S. I wanted to give 2 1/2 stars, but since it was the food that was lacking I couldn't justify rounding my review up to 3 stars.
