I like the design at Rosa Mexicano - it is definitely trendy and hip, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your mood.. . I like the grilled ceviche, the calamari, and the chicken tacos. I saw their brunch menu while I was there and it looks pretty good. I love this place mostly for margaritas on a girls night.. . These are (so far) only located in NYC, Washington DC, and Palm Beach, so I'm surprised Atlanta snagged one.. . EDIT 2/22/08: I have since been back and the food quality has definitely gone down hill. Service is awful as well, and it's passed its prime. If they keep filling Atlantic Station with things like this, it will end up a dried up place that once began as a good idea.
