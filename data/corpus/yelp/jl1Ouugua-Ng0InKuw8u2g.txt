Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
I love this place, it feels like a place where you can find loyalty. Loyalty to the bar, loyalty to your community, and in my case loyalty to pinball, even during a tornado warning I stood by my game. Currently they have "Lord of the rings" and "The Simpsons" both quality pinball games. Back to the review, the food is w.y.s.i.w.y.g. no surprises,the feel of Manuel's is very 1950's the kind of place you might go if you were my dad, in fact next time my dad is out here I'm going to bring him and see what he thinks. I'll keep you updated...
