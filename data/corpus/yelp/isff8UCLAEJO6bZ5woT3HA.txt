Very cool location!  White walls with double high ceilings make this place look massive inside.  Floor to ceiling windows along with the giant entrance hall and open air kitchen really make for an airy and open restaurant.  I was told that the venue used to be a bank and was turned into this Italian restaurant and bakery.  . . We went for an 8:30 Sunday night dinner and weren't seated till 9.  Our server was friendly and attentive and had a bus staff of 2 people to assist her, so we were well taken care of.  The food was the only letdown.  It's pretty typical Italian.  Nothing spectacular or special.  I had the ravioli and my date had the lasagna at the server's recommendation.  All average.  The great thing about this place is that there is no corkage fee for your first bottle of wine, so we brought a bottle of our own.  Love that.  A star for the location/ décor, a star for the service and a star for the free corkage.  3 stars.
