In LA for the day and had to stop by. Parking does suck. We came on a Sunday evening and were seated instantly. Being chicagoians we had never heard of chicken and waffles. My bf has the country boy and I had 3 wings w smothered potatoes. The gravy tasted like flour.  Next time I think I'll stick to chicken and waffles. But the fried chicken was amazing. Very juicy and tender. It was very fresh and we were served quickly. What shocked me were the prices.  It was $9.40 for my 3 wings n bowl of potatoes..... But if I'm in Cali I'll probably stop by again just for the chicken. On our road trip back we were kickin ourselves for not grabbing somethin to go.
