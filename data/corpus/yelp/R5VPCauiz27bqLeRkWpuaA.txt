I had the pulled jerk chicken with plantains.  Taste and presentation matched up harmoniously and were complimented by the dark lounge-esque surroundings.  While the entrees are a bit more pricey, I found that my appetizer was just enough fill me up.  Nice place to go before heading to the Music Box.
