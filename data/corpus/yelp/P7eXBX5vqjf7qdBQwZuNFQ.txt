I have had this place bookmarked forever and finally tried it out for lunch the other day.. . First of all the interior is super cute, love the handwritten menu on the chalkboard. The staff was nice, they actually gave me a friendly answer when I asked what the ordering procedure was (don't you just love the places that just give you a blank stare like you're the biggest idiot they've ever met?). There were a few delicious sounding veg options, we took a while to decide. . . The sandwiches were AMAZING! Super tasty, well proportioned with fresh ingredients. My friend and I both loved what we had and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the neighborhood. In fact I may have to start making more friends in lincoln park just to have to excuse to come here!
