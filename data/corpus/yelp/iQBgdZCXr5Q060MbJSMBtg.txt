Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
I've heard about Spring for several years, about how it's this really nice and expensive restaurant, only to be dined at for special occasions.  Well, my special occasion was a Groupon.  Thanks Groupon!. . I really liked the atmosphere.  It was sexy yet refined and relaxed.  The staff was surprisingly friendly.  There was not an ounce of pretentiousness.  Our server was very knowledgeable in regards to the entrees and wine pairings and didn't appear to be annoyed with my barrage of questions.. . I started with the grilled Octopus.  The octopus was not chewy, therefore it pasts my personal test.  It came with fresh egg pasta, parsley, confit, seasoned with lemon.  After much deliberation for what to have for my entree, I opted for their Maine Sea Scallop dish which was served on a bed of braised oxtail.  I really had no idea braised oxtail would taste so good.   It was tender and very flavorful.  Only four sea scallops were served, but they were HUGE sea scallops.  It was plenty to fill my belly.
