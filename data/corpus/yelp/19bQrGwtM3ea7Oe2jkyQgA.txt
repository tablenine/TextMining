Honestly, Daikokuya took a while to grow on me, but I've come to realize that this place is one of a kind.  5 stars for having the best ramen I've had...EVER.  Better than any other ramen I've had in LA.  Leagues better than anything on the west side.  Even my Japanese coworker craves this place while he lives in Japan!! ^.-. . Having said that, it's not the same place it was even a year ago.  It's massively popular and the wait is unbelievable (1+ hrs sometimes).  The staff is not nearly as cool/friendly, and the whole place lost some charm.  Probably from screwy management, eh.... . Oh, and the other stuff pales in comparison.  I just go for the ramen.
