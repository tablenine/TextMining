you can't even say this food is bland, it is the absence of flavor.  you'll want to say it was utterly forgettable, but chances are you'll never forget the night you went there for dinner and blew your own hard earned money on this awful crap.  and wasted not only that, but your own time, and an opportunity to eat, almost ANYWHERE else.  no thank you.
