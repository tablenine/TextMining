This place as THE BEST Hainan Chicken Rice anywhere around.  For that matter, it has the best curry beef stew anywhere around as well, period.  Come in and try it.  I guarantee you will be hooked.  The funny thing is that even though it's called "Savoy Pizza &amp; Pasta", I've never seen anyone ordering pizza here.  I've seen folks ordering pasta a couple of times, and I tried it once out of curiosity.  It's just "meh" to me.  It's not the worst in the world, but definitely not a place you'd come for pizza or pasta.  Stick to Hainan Chicken or Curry here.  That's where everybody gets here!. . Their ice cold Chrysanthemum tea or Cappuccino are awesome as well.  YUM.. . The bathroom is in the back.  You have to ask them for the key, and then go out the front door and round the back to get to it.. . This place is cash only, so stop by your ATM first!
