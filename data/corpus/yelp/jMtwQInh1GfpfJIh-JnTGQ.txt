Love this place!  The foods and beverages are all created with fresh local products.  . . The specialty cocktails are inventive (egg nog is great, Stackhouse is so-so but definitely an original).  The idea of the "Biggy Shorty" deal - shared specialty 750 ml beers - is a great one.  . . The menu is appealing and good for sharing with a date or with friends.  Reasonably priced.  We shared their famous fries, which they swapped out for us when we realized we had all little ends and pieces.  . I had chicken liver croquettes - delicious. And in the end, we walked for about $20 or $25 per person, plus tip.
