Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Why is there always a line out front?? Is this place famous? Oh, the food must be really good. . . All thoughts that run through my head every time I drive down Washington. . . Well people, I now have answers. The lines are long because everyone just piles in front of a window and shouts what they want, waiting in the same spot for the food to come out, and then dig for cash while they manually add up your total. Heard of an assembly line?. . The food is mediocre at best.. taco, eh... enchiladas, eh... tamale, eh... rice, eh... and so on. However, the prices are really cheap. . . I probably won't come back here and don't think it's worth it but if you're like me, you'll want to try it yourself. At least it won't cost you much.
