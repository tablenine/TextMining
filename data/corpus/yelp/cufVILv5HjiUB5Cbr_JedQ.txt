Our past two dinners here have been fantastic!  The Sunday special with $7 mezes are amazing.  I ordered the grilled octopus, the watermelon/feta salad, and the lamb chops. All three were out of this world. There was live music on our last visit and the atmosphere was fun!!  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  If you have room for dessert, don't miss the loukemades ( fried Greek doughnuts drizzled with honey &amp; nuts).
