Easter Sunday is a hard time to find a decent place to eat around 3pm.  After an awesome game of bowling, we walked around Lincoln Square for some place to eat.  Fiddlehead's was open for Brunch so we checked it out.. . $19 for Easter Brunch (not bad price, IMO).  Eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, salad, mac n' cheese, homemade waffles, etc.  Overall, it was good.  The waffles were by far the best item of the brunch offerings.. . The regular menu looked interesting, but they were only serving Easter Brunch.  The Host didn't really make this clear when we sat down, so we tried to ask for regular menus.  He got a little snitty with us.  The brunch was about to close down, so we rushed to get food and the servers didn't seem happy to see us.  C'est la vie.. . We decided to just do the brunch because we were too hungry to head back out in the cold to look for another place to eat.. . I'd like to try this place again during regular business hours.  Hopefully the service will be better.
