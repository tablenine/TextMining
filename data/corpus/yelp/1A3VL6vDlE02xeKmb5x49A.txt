I am pretty much always in the mood for sushi so I was pretty excited to go for Sushi Gen.  It was a Friday night, so of course it was packed.  We waited around for about 30 minutes and when they discovered 1 person in our party was not there,  they refused to seat us! :( So sad.  We had to lie and say he wasn't coming anymore. Shhh! . . Seriously fresh fish!  We got the Sashimi Platter and it was so satisfying.  The Sushi Platter was eh, normal.  The BEST part of what we got was the Ama-Ebi which is delicious x 2 because not only do you get the sweet shrimp part, but also the fried head! mmmMMM.  Ok, I lied, the Uni shares the spot for BEST part of what we got. I think I'm starting to drool.... . . I would totally go here again.  It's pretty decently priced for such good sushi.  Definitely 5 star material but I had to -1 for 1. making me wait, and not seating me with 1 person missing, 2. Ebi/Uni seemed unusually expensive although the rest wasn't too bad.
