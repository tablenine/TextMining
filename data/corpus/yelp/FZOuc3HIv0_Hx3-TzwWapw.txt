Went here on a Tuesday night and damn the fried chicken is good.  They have all you can eat fried chicken for $9.99 on Tuesdays and it is some of the finest fried chicken around (even better than Popeye's - although don't tell Tony Bourdain that).  They do serve alcohol and have 5-6 beers on the menu including Goose Island Mild Winter, which I ordered, but not much else.  Regardless, the food is solid, prices are reasonable, and service is great.  Can you ask for much more?  Would definitely go back.
