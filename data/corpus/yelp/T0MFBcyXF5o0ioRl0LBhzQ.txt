Restaurant: Bin Wine Cafe
Category: American (New)
Bin Wine Cafe is my "usual" brunch spot.  First, you usually don't have to wait long for a table.  That's a huge benefit in my book:  nothing ruins my brunch buzz like an endless wait for a table.  (In fact, I am almost reluctant to write a review, for fear it will get too crowded!). . The food is great:  I especially recommend the hash browns.  Bin's hash browns are not your ordinary hash browns:  they are more like a cake of hash browns, with grilled onions in the middle.  Absolutely fantasic!  The omelet of the day is usually good, too.  And they have flights of mimosas and bloody marys...yum.. . I will say that every one in a while I've had a not-so-good experience:  once the food wasn't very good, and once we had bad service.  Generally, though, the service is friendly and quick, and the food fantastic.  Check it out (just not when I'm there!).
