Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
My husband and I were invited Mozza with another couple, which I had never met. Muzza was cool. My biggest gripe is that it was unbelievably loud it . At first it was because of the music, which they soon turned down some, but then people's voices made up for the fact that I still had to scream across the table to have a decent conversation with his friends. . . So, I don't think its a place for a date or a group when that you actually plan to talk to. If its your boyfriend or husband, eh...you can go one meal without talkin;). . Foodwise, it was good. I liked my husbands better than mine. I have the pizza with goat cheese and leeks....and something else was on it. It was good, but it had a slightly sour taste in some bites...I probably wouldn't order it if I went back.. . My husband had the pizza called Fontina...it had mozerella cheese, etc..his was yummy.... . Overall, it was good, fun and exciting environment.. . Def need a reservation to get in!
