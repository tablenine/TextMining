We had a late lunch/early dinner here a Sunday afternoon. We started of with an order of Olives al forno $8 and an Insalata mista $8. The oven baked olives came with thin slices of orange, hot peppers, and herbs and was fantastic. The Insalata served with an vinaigrette was fresh and flavorful.. . For the pizza we ordered the Margherita with mozzarella, tomato &amp; basil $13, Gorgonzola dolce, fingerling potatoes, radicchio &amp; rosemary $13, and Tomato, Sicilian oregano &amp; extra virgin olive oil $10. The one I was most interested in trying was the one with the potatoes because it seemed like an odd ingredient for pizza.. . The pizza's here have a large doughy crust, I am not usually a fan of thick crust but the ones here are delicious. Both the margherita and the Tomato were good, but I was amazed with the one that had the fingerling potatoes and rosemary. It had a loads of flavor and the potatoes surprisingly worked on a pizza and I would definitely order it again. . . For desert we had the sorbetti &amp; gelati 3 flavors for $8. We chose the olive oil and vanilla gelati and chocolate sorbetti. I was again amazed with the olive oil sorbetti, I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it. After I tasted it, I think have new favorite flavor. . . I can't wait until I have another meal here, because there are so many other dishes I want to try especially on the antipasta menu. This place can get extremely busy, but if you catch it during off hours like I did you can avoid the wait.
