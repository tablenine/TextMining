Discovered this place by accident while trying to find the highway.  The first time we ate here it was delicious!!!  It was a bit pricey for lunch but we weren't disappointed.  Decided to try again one day for lunch and we were sadly disappointed.  Not sure what happened but the food just didn't do it for us the second time around...Lots of folks at my work love this place but I've eaten there for the last time.
