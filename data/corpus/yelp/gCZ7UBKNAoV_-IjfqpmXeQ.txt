Can you say AUTHENTIC italian deli!?  The lines here sometimes get intense on the weekends, when chicagoans want a truly thick meat sub stacked with "capocollo, genoa salami, mortadella, provolone and bari hot or mild."  . I dont get the meat sub, but I love weaving through the aisles looking at different giardinieras  (I'm a big fan of the HOT variety) and pickled vegetables.  . The prices are decent, and the scene here is very unique.  It's a true artisan deli.  And right next door, you can pick up some fresh baguettes or loaves of hot bread.
