I wonder if the places to explore on Buford Highway are ever going to diminish for me?...Nah, never!!. . I think I'm a super naive Yelper. I mean, every time I see a little, divey-looking hole-in-the-wall along Buford Highway, I get a little excited thinking I'm going to be super cool and be the first person to write a review. I need to wake up from my pipe dream. I mean, this shack-in-a-parking-lot called Chef Liu has like, 40 something reviews? Get out! The world is passing me by.. . Anyway, I finally caught up with the rest of you on this one, thanks to Tulie L. joining me for lunch on a Saturday. We got there on the early side, just before noon which was good. Within 15 minutes there was a line out the door, people waiting in the parking lot for a seat.. . The food was tasty and hit the spot. Not your average Americanized Chinese fare here. I don't think they even serve rice. It's basically noodles and soups, steamed buns, dumplings, meats, etc. My favorite dish was the lamb kabobs. Good flavors, moist, generous amount. The juicy steamed pork buns were nice as well.. . Chef Liu review -- done! Now I'm one of the masses.
