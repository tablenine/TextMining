It's just a little bit pricey, but beyond that it is very good and I go here often. If you get a chance to hit up the brunch buffett, then you certainly get your money's worth. The options are perfectly different and plentiful. If you odrer off the menu, the grilled scallops are incredible. I have had them 3 times and they were perfectly cooked each time. The service is also very good.
