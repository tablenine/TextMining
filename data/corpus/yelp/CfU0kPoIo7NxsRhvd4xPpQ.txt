I've been meaning to write a review on Lala's for some time now. My first time at Lala's was for dinner prior to attending a Ne-Yo concert. Lala's made a wonderful first impression, as it was the first time I was ever introduced to chimichurri and I fell in love. . . I went for the second time for a friend's birthday not too long ago. I ordered the Entraña al Champignon, which is "Grilled Certified Angus Beef skirt steak, topped with sautéed mushrooms in a light red wine cream sauce, served with mashed potatoes." I fell in love all over again. The steak was tender, flavorful, and juicy. I like dipping the steak into the chimichurri! I also recommend mixing chimichurri in the mashed potatoes. . . I've rarely run into places that serve chimichurri; however, nothing ever compares to Lala's.
