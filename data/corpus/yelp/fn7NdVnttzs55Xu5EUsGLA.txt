The interior is really cool!  . . The waitress I had was friendly, and service was quick.  . . I ordered eggs &amp; fried bologna with a spicy mustard (was here last about a year ago)...  My mom used to make me fried bologna sandwiches, so this was exciting.  And it was delicious.  The bologna was thick cut and the mustard was a perfect compliment.  I think it also came with potatoes with herbs, yum.
