it's an okay restaurant. They do live to hype of all the garlicy indulgence. I had the 40 clove chicken, it was tasteful but my food got cold quick. That was not so delicious. the main entrees are okay, but he most unique item was the ice cream. The garlic ice cream has a unique kick to it, idk if it's the sauce or ice cream itself but the flavor has a 'wow' factor. The service was good, but the food was nothing too special. . . Am I happy I came to this place? Sure, it was worth a try. . Will I come back? Most likely not, they place was fine but the food is something I can make at home.. . Service: **** (helpful staff). Food: ** (it did nothing for me, just garlic lots of it). Parking: ** (Valet of course, it's the hills). Atmosphere: *** (old, designs look messy to me, but it was decent). Cleanliness: **** (looked clean to me)
