Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Gloria's  satisfied my appetite like water doused on a raging fire.  It was like a horizon filled with edible clouds and a heavy downpour  of savory treasure's...a dizzying array of Yuca con Chicharrons, Pupusas loroco, Sapa de 7 mares, and my order, the Carne Adobado.  The meat, onions, rice, beans, and adobado sauce all blended together in such a tastey texture, my taste buds became my source of pleasure.  YES, my meal was an instant taste satisfaction!.      The locale and the restaurant itself may not be appetizing to eyes that are used to dinning at those trendy little hipster cafes you find in Beverly Hills, Sunset, or Melrose.  It's not a place where you go to be "seen", or to be "discovered",  or to try and sell your crappy @$$ script to some ego driven producer.  It's a modest, friendly, family owned, dare I say, slightly divey kind of restaurant.  But that's my point, it's a RESTAURANT!  A place where you go, hoping to indulge in delicious FOOD to satisfy your yearning taste buds.  .      Parking was no problem...prices reasonable...service excellent!  I shall return...Gloria...I shall return...
