Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Yea, I was stalking the restaurant before it opened.  Its ok, I know I'm not alone.  It was worth it.  The crust is very unique.  It has a crispy bottom and a slightly chewy, sourness to it.  I rarely eat crust without toppings, but this stuff is good.  I thought the fennel pizza was the best.  . The fennel pollen they put on the pizza emits the most amazing aroma.  It had such a creamy, round mouth feel we remarked to our server who slyly told us that there is CREAM on the pizza.  HA HA! Take that salad munchers.  . The anchovy pizza was good but i LIKE them, so maybe not for everyone.. The margarita pizza was ok.. The oven warmed olives are FAB, citrus-y and full of flavor.. The ONLY dessert worth ordering is the butterscotch pudding that comes with "one of the best cookies in LA" per the LA Times.  Its rich and deep in flavor, not too sweet and so luscious.. I hear res are hard to come by (I havent had too much of a problem) but there is always the bar where Ms. Nancy Silverton herself can be seen working on your very own pizza.  Good times.
