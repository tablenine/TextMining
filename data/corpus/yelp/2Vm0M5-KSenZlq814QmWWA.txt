Wow, overpriced chinese food.  Yeah, I'll pass!  I don't mind Americanized Asian food, but jeez, at least make it good!  Food is overly salty here and just plain bad.  On top of that, you are dropping twenty bucks for some noodles.  . . Two good things about the place: The ambiance and the martinis.  They have some fun Asian twist on their martinis and they are delicious!  I've returned there for drinks, but have vowed to never waste my money on their food again!
