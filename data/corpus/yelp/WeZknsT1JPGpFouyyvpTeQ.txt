I went to dinner during the week here with a friend.  The service was good, the place was crowded, but didn't feel too much so.  The pork rillette and wilted kale salad were fine, if unremarkable.  The cocktails ere masterful flavor concoctions, if a bit on the strong side.  I will come back if I want to splurge.
