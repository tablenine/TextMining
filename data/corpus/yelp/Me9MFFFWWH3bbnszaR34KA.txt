Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Over it and OVERRATED!. . This place is a rather pathetic version of the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei... Actually this isn't even as good as the one in Shanghai!  The wait is outrageous and the service leaves lots to be desired.  . . One of my favorite items at Din Tai Fung is the steamed red bean buns.  However, if you let the server serve it to you along with your other dishes, the extremely thin skin of the bun will chill off while you are eating your other dishes and harden... which actually makes the steamed red bean buns extremely difficult to eat.  It is suppose to melt in your mouth people...so, make him/her (your server) put it back until you are ready for it.  Trust me, you'll like it more.. . The chicken soup was pretty good and the shao long bao was decent.  But, this place just doesn't do justice to the Din Tai Fung name.  TRY AGAIN!
