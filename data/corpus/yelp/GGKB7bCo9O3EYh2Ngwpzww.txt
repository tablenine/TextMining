Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
I always had a kind of meh feeling about Reza's and I could never quite put my finger on why until a recent visit over Thanksgiving weekend clarified things. Firstly and most memorably, the portions are just ridonkulously large. For four people we ordered two vegetarian combos (about $16 each) and an appetizer. From this, we took home at least two meals worth of food. Wha??? I can't imagine what the $30/per person combos are like--it can't be worth it unless you can eat your weight in Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food. Oh, the combos also included the salad bar (we got one serving, which we didn't finish).. . The service was mostly pleasant, but when the waiters brought out the food, there wasn't even enough room on the table and they just stood there and waited for us to rearrange everything to make it fit. Kind of awkward..... . Overall the atmosphere and food at this Andersonville mainstay is decent, but something about the unnecessarily large servings really turns me off. I'd rather pay $8, get a manageable portion and save the styrofoam containers.
