4 stars for:. + The Umami Burger. Had this baby twice and it's one of those rich burgers that you're glad you tried "as is" (think Father's Office), in this case, with parmesan crisp and all. Really tasty, and I didn't mind the smaller portion size, so as to minimize potential stomachaches from the richness.. + The service at both lunch and dinner. + Cheap $2.50 valet.. . 3 stars for everything else:. - Any other burger (Hatch, SoCal,) was slightly lacking because the bun tasted like it was slightly overloaded with butter. First couple of bites were mmm-worthy, but then you start feeling the pain. Maybe this is to help compensate for the smaller size?. . - Sides were ok. I'm glad they were sample-size. Onion rings were tasty but one too many and you'll go into grease coma. Fries are good if you like steak fries but if not, may be too potato-y for you.. . The "Umami" ketchup is a bit strange for my taste (what is that, a touch of miso I taste?) but who cares, I'll definitely be back whenever I crave the distinct taste of an Umami Burger.. . P.S. Clever touch, "gourmet" ding-dongs and ho-hos...plus ice cream sandwiches from Milk. Yum.
