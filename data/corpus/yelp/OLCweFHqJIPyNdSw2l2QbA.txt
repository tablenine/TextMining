Restaurant: B Bar &amp; Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
The B Bar is always buzzing.  The patio area is what celebrates this bar &amp; grill from others in its category.  Also, many are not aware that it is also opened for brunch, though if you want to capture the B at its best, swing by on your night out.
