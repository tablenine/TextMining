Gone here twice and both times had excellent service and the food was great. The garlic noodles were delicious this time. The first time I don't remember what I ordered. Â The second visit I ordered Filet Mignon with ponzu glaze over leek mashed potato, portabella mushrooms and cipollini onions (DELIOUS!!!) better than mastro's and that's a steak house.
