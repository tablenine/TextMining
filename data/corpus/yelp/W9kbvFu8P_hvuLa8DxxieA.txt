This is one place to be seen.   The crowd are fabulous and the food are just as exciting. Show up with an attitude and you'll most likely get the best table of the house.. . The French waiter is flirty great and gave the Best service on almost anything (wink, wink, wink)- the French way.  I'll definitely come back for (him) more...
