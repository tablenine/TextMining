Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
YES! As someone who has never experienced soul food, this was a treat. I had the chicken and waffles, while my mom enjoyed the smothered chicken, and even my vegetarian sister loved the veggie entrees (she picked several sides to make a veggie combo). My chicken and waffles were surprisingly light, well flavored, just generally DELICIOUS. We also split a piece of sweet potato cheescake for dessert - so good!! Service was good, although we did have to wait a bit for seating. The only downside was the neighborhood isn't the best - seems like a lot of abandoned buildings around, not a street hopping with activity. Nonetheless, definitely worth a visit!
