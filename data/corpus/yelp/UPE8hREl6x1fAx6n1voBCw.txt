Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
I love Tapas! Been to most tapas restaurants in my area (Tinto, La Paella, AOC, etc.) Cobras food blows them all out of the water! There is no comparison.. . You'll always wait a few minutes for your table even with a reservation and the service is so-so but this is still my FAVORITE restaurant in all of LA. Â . . Key Points:. . You can bring your own bottle of wine with no corkage fee...or hell even a bottle of Vodka (seriously). . The Bacon wrapped dates are the best thing on the menu...no question.. . Always a fun atmosphere. Can't always hear what your dinner mate is saying but sometimes that makes it all the more fun doesn't it. . . For 3 tapas plates (plenty for 2 when having wine) runs about $30.. . If you want the good food but less of a crowd the Los Feliz location is great. Not BYOB but the service was amazing with the same great food. The restaurant itself is much larger. You can actually sit at your table without giving your neighbor a lap dance.
