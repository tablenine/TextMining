Restaurant: Harry &amp; Sons
Category: Sushi Bars
When my wife and I are itching for some good sushi, Harry &amp; Sons is always our first choice. I try to change my order up a bit so I'm not so predictable, but I always sneak in at least one Harry Maki roll. Can't ever go wrong with that one.. . Never had bad service. Never had a long wait. Great experience all around.
