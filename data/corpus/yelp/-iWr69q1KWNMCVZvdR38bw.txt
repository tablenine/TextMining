Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
a lot of great new eateries are popping up in culver city, and tender greens is one of them. it's organic, and fresh. i went here before the rest of L.A. caught on--beware of long lines, and very long waits. . . the ahi tuna salad is the most consistent, and i always order it with a double order of tuna. it's extremely delicious. the wine is tricky, and a crap shoot. sometimes it seems like it's been sitting out for too long. . . the chicken is very tender, and i hear the beef is excellent. great place for a hang as well, since it is near the wine bars!
