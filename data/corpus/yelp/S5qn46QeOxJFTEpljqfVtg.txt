I went to this place last night and it was outstanding.  My GF and I tried the Baoguette and the Sloppy Bao.  I am having a hard time recalling tasting such a flavorful sandwich.   Both were outstanding.  I love spicy food so this place is perfect.  However, if spicy is not your thing, order the sandwich not spicy.  It will still be extremely flavorful!  the mild was still fairly spicy so keep that in mind.  . . I just signed up for yelp just so i could review this place.  I will be frequenting this place on a regular basis.  Outstanding!!
