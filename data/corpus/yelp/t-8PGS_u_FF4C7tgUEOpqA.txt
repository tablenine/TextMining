Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
I'm a fan of any establishment that is consistently great. Expensive or not, fancy or a dive - if food is fresh, hot and timely I'll go back again and again.. I can see that the Vortex in Midtown which is so close I can walk to it is going to eat into my paycheck. New to Atlanta, Vortex was the first place I found while apartment hunting. Since then I've been back at least twice a week. . They gyro special is a soft, tender, warm piece of yumminess. You wouldn't think a dark place like this would have good salads but they do this thing with cranberries and red onions and bread crumbs - oh my goodness I'm craving it right now.. I don't usually go for the 'best burger in town' hype but I have to say that no matter what time of day it is, if offered a burger from Vortex I would drop whatever I was doing and head down there. . I can't see how one person could finish a whole burger themselves. I recommend sharing one and get a side of some incredible onion rings. . We timed it last time and it took less than 10 minutes for us to get lunch after ordering. No heat lamps here. . If you have walked by Vortex a million times, make this the day you finally go in. You will not be disappointed. Just don't be an idiot, the bartenders don't like that.
