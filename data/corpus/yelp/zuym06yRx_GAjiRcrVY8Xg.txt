I love this place.  My fav is the scallop special sushi, tempura and the scallop dynamite.  Yummy.  Dont ask for special rolls, only order what is on the menu other wise you will look like a fool when they tell you no in not the most polite way.  Cash only but they do have an atm machine inside.  i love everything here.
