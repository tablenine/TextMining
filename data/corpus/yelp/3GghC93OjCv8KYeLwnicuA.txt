Let me start off with saying that this was my favorite place in Los Angeles to eat before I loved less than a half mile from this place. Since being that close I might be changing my mailing address to this location because my goal is to take every person I have ever met to dine here. . . Last night was my best experience to date at this place as well. Ordered a four cheese penne and ate away. I don't think one time my glass got less than 75% full and it was refilled by a worker. Even though the place was full my order was taken right away and food came out promptly. For a moment, my chest started to stick out a little bit and I got a bit big headed. Perhaps the staff has mistaken me for some D list celebrity or something of that nature? The dining spot is a low key Hollywood dine spot so surely this was the case. Then I looked around and realized everyone else was getting stunning service........ . Then it occurred to me that I wasn't the King of Hollywood at all but I was being treated at a restaurant with a staff that actually cares about customer service and it's customers. This is one of the most rare things you can find a dining spot in Hollywood. If you wanted to be treated properly and eat amazing food then this is your spot. I cannot comment on parking because I walk to this location but it doesn't seem like too much of a hassle. . . When it is raining you can do delivery until 3:00am and it's the best late night post club dining you will find in Hollywood with a great location. If you haven't been to this place yet the only question to ask yourself is why not?
