I came here for my birthday with a group of 5.  As soon as we got there, we were finally seated for dinner.  The service was EXTREMELY slow.. it was so slow we missed the first show.  After waiting and waiting, our server finally came and he was actually super funny and nice.  He wouldn't take our orders right away, he made us order the drinks and appetizers first and then after they came he'd take our order.  It just seemed like a lot of waiting around.... . The food wasn't as bad as i thought.  Reading previous reviews, people hate the food here.  I got the crab cakes which were delicious, and a ceasar salad which was not good.  I could have made a better salad at home.  Everyone elses food was very good though.  The best thing was the cheesey garlic bread!. . Since it took forever to get our food, we were only able to watch ONE SHOW.  Kinda sucked because I wanted to see much more than just one show.  The show ended up being pretty good. Not great because you can see the magician mess up one of his acts.  He was suppose to pop a girl out from his cape but while he was walking around u can see her feet under his cape, but he gets an A for effort.  Other than that, the magic was pretty incredible!. . There was this one drunk annoying lady right behind me that kept disrupting the magic show by yelling out stupid things during the show and i wanted to turn around and punch her.  It was very unclassy and annoying.  Apparently after the show i wasn't the only one who thought so either, but the magician played it cool and would throw funny comments back at her so it became entertaining after a while.. . I would come here again, just much earlier than dinner time. I'd come like at 6, watch all the shows, and then eat late and you'd still probably have the chance to catch one last show after the dinner.
