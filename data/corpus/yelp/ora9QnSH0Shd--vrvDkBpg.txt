This place is a true 'hidden' gem. I'm not the biggest fan of sausage-type foods, but I like the many options and interesting combinations on the menu. It's definitely not the same old bratwurst. I thought the modern, minimalistic setting was comfortable and the simplicity of the whole experience was shockingly exciting. I got pretty drunk of two La Fin Du Monde's and don't think I saw one douche in the whole place...? And it was pretty cheap...
