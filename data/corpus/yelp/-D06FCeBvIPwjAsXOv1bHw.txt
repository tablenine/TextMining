Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've been going to Pink's since the mid '60's.  There was a cluster line but you never had to wait very long.  Since the development of a ridiculously long menu, the line has exploded and the service has slowed down to perpetuate this line.  The shorter it is, the slower the service is.  The celebrity names of the super specialities just confuse the counter people.  We are so sad to see this happen.  In the old days the menu was simple, uncomplicated.  . There should be a separate line just for the chili cheese dog...so that  we, patrons for 45 years, can still eat hot dogs without paying the price of wasted time.
