Restaurant: Hudson Grille
Category: American (Traditional)
Been here several times over the past couple of years to watch Football and MMA events.  Going to break this down into 3 categories. . . Service - Good if you are seated belly up at the bar- Great Bartenders.. Bad if you are seated at a Hi-Top, booth or table. Always seems understaffed.. . Food/Drinks - Great beer selection, but the food is well below average..even the basics like burgers.  . . TV's - LOTS of TV's - Not really a bad seat in the place.. . Conclusion:  Great place if you want to watch sports and drink beer. Due to slow service I suggest ordering by the pitcher.  If you're hungry grab a bite at nearby Pub71 or Mellow Mushroom before the game.
