Awesome southern food! I had chicken fried steak with collared greens and sweet yams...feel much fatter afterwards but I have to say they have the best southern cooking I've ever had. Take a bar seat and you can watch the chefs double fry your meal to come! On the down side some of the items are a bit pricey. Twice I went there the air indoors smelled musty. Also get there early for brunch on weekends - there seems to be always a wait...but it's worth it!
