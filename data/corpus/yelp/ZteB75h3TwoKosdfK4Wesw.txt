Drink Rating (1-5): 4, Fresh lemonade, wine. Dish Rating (1-5): 5. Atmosphere Rating (1-5): 4, small, clean, well-dressed patrons . Service Rating (1-5): 4. Comments: The first pizza (aka Meat Lover's) is my favorite one so far. The meat was piled on without the normal grease that pizzas usually come with. The Butterscotch budino was rich and creamy and a bit much for my taste, but definitely worth it.. Average Dish Price (1-5): $$$. Price Total: $63. People: 2. Overall Rating (1-5): 5. . This is Mario Batali's (Iron Chef America) pizza restaurant. I really would've never heard of this place if not for my fellow high class foodie Liz. Apparently to get a decent reservation time, you need to call a month in advance. We had reservations for 10:15pm (way late for dinner), but decided to take our chances and try to eat at the bar. We arrived at around 8pm and the bar had several spots open. Prices for individual pizzas were in the CPK range ($9-17) but tasted so much better. We ordered a pizza apiece: 1) Littleneck clams, oregano, parmigiano &amp; pecorino and 2) Fennel sausage, panna &amp; spring onion. Yes, clams on a pizza! My love for seafood and adventureous taste made me instantly pick it on sight. Liz went with the safer, popular house made sausage/meatball pizza. In the end, both were pretty good.
