Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
We ordered:. . Champagne . Half Dozen Blue Point Oysters. Red Wine. 22 oz. ribeye, cooked medium + 7 oz lobster tail. 12 oz. bone-in filet, cooked + 7 oz lobster tail. Sugar Snap Peas. Mastro's mashed potatoes. Creme Brulee + tea. . We left very well fed and extremely happy.  The service was outstanding and the dining room comfortable and elegant yet stylish.  We went on a Sunday night but I still didn't see any empty tables.  Overall, I was more than happy to pay my close to $400 bill for our dinner for two.  . . The cuts of meat were just unbelievable.  USDA Prime, very flavorful, and cooked to perfection.  I don't like my steaks too burnt on the outside and Mastro's got mine just right with just the right amount of beautiful browning on the outside.  The ribeye was so full of flavor, it was like a party in my mouth.  The bone-in filet was also very yummy, and the meat stayed tender and juicy the whole time.  The sugar snap peas and mashed potatoes complimented the meal very well but I didn't pay that much attention to the sides as I was too preoccupied with my steak =). . My only complaint: the lobster tails that we added to our steaks were big disappointments.  Mine came covered in strong seasoning that was way too salty and it was also really dry on the outside.  I couldn't really taste the lobster itself because of the way it was prepared.  It kind of tasted like the ones you get at a Red Lobster restaurant...  However, I realize it's not a seafood restaurant and my steak was more than good enough to compensate for the mediocre lobster.  Just have to remember not to add the lobster next time!. . I am still giving Mastro's five stars for fantastic service, beautiful dining room, and mouthwatering steaks.
