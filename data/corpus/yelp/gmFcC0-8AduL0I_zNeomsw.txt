i didn't find the food here to be anything terribly exciting before i tried it. i was eager to give it a shot though when it showed up in the neighborhood. i got a simple pasta that was described on the menu as having tomatoes--came out with diced carrots. not so good. the wine list is totally worth the trip if only to laugh at the icons/descriptions they use. hilarious
