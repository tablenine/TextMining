Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
Why does everything here have to be so good? Why do you have to be so far away from where I live? All these questions... because the food here totally does it for me. . . I must admit that I find it extremely difficult to order chicken or turkey at a bbq joint and stick to my chopped pork and ribs- both of which are divine here. Their sides are delicious as well (and I've had more than my fair share). My favs are: collard greens, fried okra, fried green tomatoes, fried mushrooms (anyone noticing a theme with the fried foods?), mac and cheese, stew, red beans n rice, que wraps... I might as well list the whole side items menu!. . Definitely worth a drive down here to get some of Daddy's cooking!
