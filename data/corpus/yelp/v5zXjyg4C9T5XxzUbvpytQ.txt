$16.99 all you can eat KBBQ? Yep, I'm a fan.. . Went here for my first time last Friday night with a dozen or so people. We ended up being a little late but they totally accomodated us - so nice. We were seated in the little side section but it was totally fine - we got to witness the crazy main room during our trips to the bathroom or outside to smoke. I kept having to go back and get people from the table so they could see the crazy birthday celebrations. A whole bottle of champagne on your head. Damn.. . We got served really fast for the most part. It took a little bit to get plates and utensils fo reveryone but those side dishes and the meat were out lickety split. When we asked for mores sides, they would come out with TRAYS full of dishes for us - it was awesome!!. . I really thought the meat was good; it was tasty and the texture was nice, too. Sometimes I have gotten meat at places and it's been a little gamey but not here at all. I am so not a fan of the pork belly though - I just can't get on that train.. . To sum up: Meat? Yum! Sides? Pleantiful and quickly refilled. Floors? Crazy slidey!! Ambuience? Frat party. Fun? Hell yes!!!
