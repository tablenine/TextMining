Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I really hate going to Palms because this place is rowdy, and notorious for rushing the customers out the door....I am only 1/2 done with my meal, and the bill is already here. . . Palms is really one of the older restaurants that gained its popularity through their overhyped entertainment which includes the "Thai Elvis" impersonator. If you are going because you want to entertain guests, have fun, and see a show, then Palms is perfect. You can see Thai music acts and performances. The food is really average, the service is average.... . Palms has really turned into a mainstream business and is very accomondating to non-thai people. . . Just like Chan Dara...its good place to entertain your co-workers and eat Thai food...but its not the place for the best Thai food.
