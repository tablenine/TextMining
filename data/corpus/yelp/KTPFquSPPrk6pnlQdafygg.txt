Per Nancy X.'s suggestion, my friends and I tried this place out on a random Tuesday night.  To my surprise, at 7pm, it was PACKED!  I'm so glad I called ahead to make reservations.  They sat us right by the sushi bar, so it was kinda cool to check out how they were making the sushi.. . It was Kristina B.'s first time eating sushi, so we were convinced that we'd convert her to a sushi lover.  The tamago was delicious!  I can eat that all day/every day, I swear.  Spider roll was great, too.  Fresh fish, not too much rice.  . . We tried two speciality rolls - the black dragon and the sunrise (or sunset...it was the one with salmon and mango.)  Both were good, but I really enjoyed the salmon/mango combo as it's something I've never tried before.  (Check out how awesome the rolls look!) Total bill for the three of us (including tax and tip) was $75.  Not bad at all!. . Vibe of this restaurant was cool and chill.  Good crowd mix, too.  Service was a tad slow, but it was reallllly busy.  Parking on Grand may be a little difficult, so just check out the side streets for easy (parallel) parking options.
