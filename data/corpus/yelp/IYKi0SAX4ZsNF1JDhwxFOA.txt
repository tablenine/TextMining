I can see I'm in the minority here, but I really don't get why everybody likes Mirai so much.  I took my mom here and we had horrible service.  Our waitress took our drink order and it took 20 minutes just to get a drink from the bar!  . . Mom and I ordered a few rolls to share plus one cooked dish.  Now, I'm all for reasonable portions.  But the portions here were just tiny.  The rolls were small and didn't contain much fish, and the cooked item we ordered (scallops) only had 4 pieces of scallop.  We got the bill and our food total alone (1 app, 2 rolls, 1 cooked dish) was $70!  I sure didn't feel like I had eaten $70 worth of food.  . . Maybe I'm just not trendy enough and didn't appreciate the atmosphere.  But I know that I appreciate sushi, and what I got here was just not worth the money I spent.  Bob San down the street is a much better choice.
