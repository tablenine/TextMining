Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Oh My Mozza! . . The Food: Well, this place certainly lived up to my expectations for deliciousness. . . To Start: Arancine- cheesy and to die for.. . Pizzas: Fennel Sausage with pana red onion and scallions. Coach farm goat cheese with leeks garlic &amp; onion. Funghi misti with fontina, tagglio and thyme. Rapini cherry tomatoes, anchovies olives &amp; chiles.  . My favorite was the Funghi misti which had a collection of mushrooms, and the cheese on thick and creamy.  All of the pizzas had a very unique flavor, and crust was crispy and buttery. Everything was delicious- and there was nothing that I would say was only OK.. . Dessert: Gelato- Olive oil, Peanut Butter, Espresso. Olive oil sounds weird but was really really good- just a light hint of the olive oil. The peanut butter was a really nice mix of sweet and salty-- although a bit on the salty side. Espresso- really just couldn't go wrong.. . Service: Not fantastic, the waiter was fairly attentive but I would have appreciated a little more friendliness and for him to have checked back a bit more. . . Ambiance: The place is cute, much smaller than I though it would, but once you get over the crowding it is a nice place to sit back and have a relaxing meal with friends.
