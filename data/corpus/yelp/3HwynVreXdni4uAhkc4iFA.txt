this location, unlike it's sister location, is smaller and more quaint feeling. therefore the wait can be awhile on a busy night. it also doesn't serve wine in-house. you have to buy a bottle next door (from a place the restaurant owns) and then walk it over to your table. i think this is due to some sort of lack of liquor license. i'm not sure. regardless, these "difficulties" are worth it because the food is amazing. soo soo sooooo good!! please don't miss out. walk, run, skip, jump, or hop your way over. whatever you must do. just go there. you won't be disappointed.
