I know that the rating seems to go against the tide but I was not all that impressed with the food.First of all,the hot and sour soup was one of the worst that I have ever had so off to a bad start.The Bulgogi sandwich was pretty good and the tofu sandwich was ok though even with the sauce seemed dry.i did enjoy the brussel sprouts but all in all for the price and bare bones location 2 stars is about right for me.
