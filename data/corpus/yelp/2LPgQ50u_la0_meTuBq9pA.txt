Restaurant: Phoenix Restaurant
Category: Dim Sum
For dinner, I give the slight edge to Phoenix over Evergreen.. . It's a spacious restaurant, and every time we've dined here, we've gotten a refreshing dish served to us that's not part of our typical 10-ish course meal in Chinatown.  Last time, we had a fresh salad with cucumber and watermelon shreds.  On this visit, I enjoyed lettuce wrapped pork, fish served over its fried scales, and a lychee jello.. . Decent spot for dim sum too.
