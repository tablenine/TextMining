To be completely honest- I didn't think this place was amazing.  I thought it was good.  I definitely have higher expectations for a place with a waiting list for reservations.  The pizza was delicious- I had the mushroom.  It felt really loud and squished as I tried to enjoy my meal.  Just my two cents.
