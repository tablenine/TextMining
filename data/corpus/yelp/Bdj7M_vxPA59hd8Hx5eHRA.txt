Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Hamburger Mary's is my go-to place whenever I can't make a decision.  I have never been let down by the place, which is obvious considering I go there at least once a month.  . . The atmosphere at HM's is 100% fun and theatrical.  The tables and decor are a mix of arty/theatrical antiques.  The staff is really great and upbeat and will answer any questions you have; literally, they will talk your ear off with fun facts about the restaurant, neighborhood and of course the food.  There usually isn't a wait, but if there is a wait, the line always moves fast and the food is completely worth it.. . The food is out of this world.  The burgers are great, but my staple favorite is the bird of paradise.  It's basically a warm turkey sandwich- and it's unbelievable.  The french fries are great, but the potato salad is my absolute favorite.  It's creamy but has chunks of potatoes in it and it's made with orange peppers, which I love!  Some of the best potato salad I've ever had, and I will order it every time I go there- even if I get breakfast, I always get some to take home.. . You won't be let down whatsoever at Ham Burger Mary's.  The service is great and entertaining, the food is spectacular and the restaurant is a great place for any time of the day, but my personal favorite is brunch.  They're mimosas are delish!  Happy Hamburger eating!
