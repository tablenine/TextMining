Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
The burger is pretty damn good, a little greasy though. The Portuguese bun is fantastic. I feel like we got shortchanged on the fries. The proprietor definitely loves what he does. He was happy to talk shop with us and the foodies sitting next to us. They also offer artisan desserts that are upscale versions of ding-dongs and Ho Hos made by the old pastry chef from Grace, I can't remember her name, oh yeah it's "Cake Monkey". Overall it was pretty good. I would certainly recommend it.
