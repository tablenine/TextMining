Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I've searched high and low in Chicago over the past few years to find a more authentic and intimate restaurant for Mexican food. It has always been my thought that as a chain, Hacienda couldn't possibly be as good as something else out there that I must be missing... . . But after mediocre attempts at Lalo's, Adobo, Jalapeno Sabroso, Salpicon, Ceasars, etc. etc etc. - I always end up right back at good 'ol Uncle Julio's. Â . . The fajitas and enchiladas rock... the chips and tortillas are all homemade on the spot and are always fresh and hot. Those stale, hard chips at the other places are such a turn off... . . The nachos appetizer comes in perfect little half moons where each bite is perfect and covered in cheesy, meaty goodness!. . And of course the infamous SWIRL!! It's delicious and perfect... two of those frozen sangria/margarita treats and I'm one happy camper!!! . . Outdoor seating is nice in the summer and the back room with fireplace is good for winter dining. I took one star away because the large, open restaurant tends to get really loud at night when it's bumpin' with customers and the ladies at the hostess stand are usually more interested in gossiping than hosting. Other than that, the food is GREAT... I guess sometimes a chain is popular for a reason!
