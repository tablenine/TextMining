The Sorrentina pizza (with San Marzano tomato, bufala, smoked mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, basil, and Parmigiano Reggiano) is amazing.  It reminded me of the kind of pizza that Antico Pizza was making within its first weeks of opening before Antico slumped into mediocrity with heavier crusts and excessive char.  . . Fritti's pizza has a very thin crust, slightly charred and a little sour.  I loved the smoky flavor of the cheese in the Sorrentina.  It's a simple pizza, but it's quite flavorful, delicious, and not too salty.. . The atmosphere is cozy and quaint.  Expect to sit only 2 feet away (or less) from strangers at another table.  The place gets packed, but our pizza still came out within 10-15 minutes.  . . In my opinion, Fritti wins the Atlanta Pizza Wars.
