The best shabu shabu in town!  I don't mind waiting for an hour maybe even two (sometimes) to eat here.  I'm a vegetarian and I order the vegetarian plate with extra seaweed.  I know, I know but in my opinion, it's not really the meat that makes this place special--it's the sauce!  Order the iced coffee, it's perfect after this delicious meal.  I love this place.
