The 3 stars is a place holder until I return on a regular day and see what service is like then. I came here for Easter brunch and although the place was busy it wasn't overflowing, It was after all 1:30pm. There were only 2 groups ahead of us but it still took about 40 minutes to get us seated. Then it took another 30 minutes for our order to arrive.. . For a place voted as having the best breakfast I had high expectations. I ordered the Toscana Scramble, which was alright but I won't be ordering it again. The portion of the dish was on the smaller side, I was still hungry afterward. The OJ was too sour, I didn't even drink half of it. The girlfriend had the Salmon which she says was excellent. I didn't try it though.. . I'm definitely giving this place a second chance and I have my eye on the breakfast quesadilla.. . Photos uploaded.
