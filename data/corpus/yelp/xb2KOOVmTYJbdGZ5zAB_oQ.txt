My wife and I ordered the Hollenbeck de Asada.  It's pretty solid, nothing great though.  I don't understand why so many Mexican places in LA don't season their meat.  It makes the food taste more bland.  The burrito has the potential to be awesome with more seasoning.  It's easily big enough for two people to get really full.  The guac, chips &amp; salsa were good (not the red/hot salsa).  If you're in the area, it's worth stopping by, but I don't think it's worth going way out of your way for it.  The owner is awesome!  It's definitely worth going to at least once.
