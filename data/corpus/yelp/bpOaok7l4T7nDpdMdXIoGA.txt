Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami Burger = delicious. The cheese disc thing that's inside is my favorite part.. . I haven't tried any of the other burgers yet because I really like the Umami one. The side dishes aren't too exciting - stick to the burgers.. . BYOB = cool.. . Service = nice, but slow. No immediate sense of a seating system. If you don't go inside and say something to the waiters, you're liable to sit outside waiting for a long time.
