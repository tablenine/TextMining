Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Went to this place 3 times and got in twice. The first time I went, it was 10 at night and the wait was at least 45 min. Since there were 4 of us, we decided to go to Denny's down the street since we were starving. The second time I came, it was for a friend's birthday. We had to wait 30 minutes and was entertained by the valet outside. I ordered chicken and waffles and a side of corn bread. I was expecting the corn bread to be AMAZING and was totalllllly bummed that it tasted like cardboard. It was soooo utterly dry, it almost ruined the whole meal. The chicken was ok and the waffle was a little bit better.. . However, my second visit turned out to be much better. I'm not sure if it was cause I was hungry, but the chicken and waffles were much better the second time around. . . I'll definitely be going back...and maybe try something new...but that's highly doubtful. ^_^
