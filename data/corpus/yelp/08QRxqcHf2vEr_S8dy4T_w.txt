SUCKIEST PLACE! omg, why are the lines so long? and their food is not even that great. Maybe I was expecting the best sandwich I ever tasted because of the long lines. But no, it basically sucked. We waited for like an hour!!! for a crappy sandwich!!!I was waiting in line with the boyfriend and started getting anxiety because of all the people and because I'm short I was running out of air supply. I ended up waiting by the door for some fresh air. Felt like my beef sandwich was jus bland, didn't taste anything. I thought i was eating cardboard...so why the popularity?? I HAVE NO IDEA. Gave the rest of my sandwich to the dog. Should of jus gone to the Hat for a Pastrami sandwich, at least I know that is good. haha.
