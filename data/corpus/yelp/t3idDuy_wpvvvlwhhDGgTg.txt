Category: Italian
I don't know why I always end up at this place in odd hours, (eating lunch at 2pm, eating dinner at 530pm etc).. . The first time I went I ended up having the Ravioli of the day, which was a little crisp for a pasta dish (either it was sitting out too long, or it was a little stale).. . The other times I've stuck with their pizza, which are very good.  One but of advice though, their Margherita pizza is just a cheese pizza with basil strips, it's good, but the first time I got it I was looking for the tomatoes on top (apparently when it says tomato on the menu they mean tomato sauce).  In the scheme of things not a big complaint, but  something to be aware of, if you're a tomato lover.  . . The staff seems hit or miss, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt considering the bizarre times I've been eating there (shift changes etc).. . I'm not sold that it's a life changing Italian restaurant, but they're pizzas are unique and worth stopping in, and taking back home, if your in the neighborhood.
