Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I am so excited that a great bar has finally been added to the Helm's bakery area in Culver City. The restaurants are great in that area (Wilson, especially), but until now there wasn't a bar nearby to meet friends for a beer in a comfortable atmosphere.. . FO2 food and beer is the same as the original. The true upgrade here is the space - there is way more of it. The outdoor patio makes the space. However, make sure you get there early. I came on a Tuesday and a line formed 10 deep to get in. I am sure it will die down soon (hopefully).. . Can't wait until this years Culver City summer artwalk. Now I can start at Father's Office with lunch and a beer and end at The Mandrake with a cocktail.
