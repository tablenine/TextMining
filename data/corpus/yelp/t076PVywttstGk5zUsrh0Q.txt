Joy Yee's popanacha a.k.a Bubble Tea is heavenly, I've been to every boba place in West Coast, nothing tops that, no restaurant ever uses real fruit like they do, it's simply awesome, price is great. Food menu wise I think it's pretty extensive, price is okay, especially considering the size that it comes out, it's HUGE for a girl, but me, of course I can still finish it :) but a normal girl would be able to take that as double meal, dinner and lunch :). I totally recommend this place if you've never been and for those Californians who think they have the best boba place, you better get your bum out here and I show you what bubble tea is all about :)
