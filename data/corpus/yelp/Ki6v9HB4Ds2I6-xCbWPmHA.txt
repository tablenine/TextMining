this place is so overrated...the food portion here is tiny and so not worth the price.  the waiters here seems a bit snobby...maybe because they think they are working at an upscale restaurant.  I regret going out of my way to eat there.  All of my friends were still hungry after our meal.  If you want great japanese food and a great deal...then go to Gin Sushi in pasadena.
