The new place from the owners of Bacchanalia (and Star Provisions, Floataway, Quinones), and the latest place in Atlanta to try the small plate/order a bunch &amp; share type menu format.  As the name suggests, it's meat-focused, and is in fact located in a former slaughterhouse - the karma's got to be heavy.  The carnivore in me loves the concept and the slight anti-socialness of a restaurant largely focused on serving meat. The room itself is quite attractive, albeit the hard floors and walls mean that when it's full, it can be quite loud. . . Foodwise, it was generally tasty, although the cooking wasn't nearly as even (uniformly good) as the rest of their restaurants, and the kitchen seemed like it went down hard when we were there (9ish on a Saturday) - it took 45 minutes or so between ordering &amp; getting the first of our food. I just write it off to still being in opening mode, and not having sea legs yet.  . . The thing that amused me, in retrospect, was that the best dishes, or at least the ones I enjoyed the most, were vegetarian - a leeks with vinaigrette was stunningly simple and good, and the fried strawberry pie was also excellent (although it might have had lard in the pastry, I didn't ask).  . . The large meat plates were the biggest disappointment (aside from the long wait to get the food) - the pork was dry, the steak was fine although not exceptional, and the burger, while quite tasty, was really small - just a couple of bites.  . . Punchline - go with good friends who don't mind a wait, share food, and order a bunch of small plates.  That way, uneven execution won't interfere too much.  As the kitchen gets more able, this place should get even better and deserve more stars - as it is, I'd probably give 3 1/2 now.
