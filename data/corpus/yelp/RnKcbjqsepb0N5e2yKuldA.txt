Went there on a Saturday Night with 3 couples for a friend's birthday dinner. We got there maybe 15 minutes late for our 8:15pm reservations, and despite calling them in advance to let them know of our tardiness, they seemed disorganized when we got there. After about a 20 minute wait they ushered us into a corner table that could barely seat the 6 of us. The service was mediocre but the food quality was good (as you would expect in a high-end steakhouse). However, having eaten at plenty of steakhouses before i do not differentiate them by food quality but by value. The value i got here was subpar for the quality/price (we ended up paying $600 or $100/person including - pre-dinner drinks, 1 bottle of wine, appetizers, entrees, and deserts). . In any case if you end up going here you might want to check out the St. Regis Hotel next door, it's beautiful and has a great after dinner atmosphere.
