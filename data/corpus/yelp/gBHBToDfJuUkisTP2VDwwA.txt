I was taken here by my boyfriend last week and it was very good. Even though it's a small place and there are always a lot of people, it was well worth it. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the RUDE waitress there and the challenge of finding parking. Unfortunately, because they were busy at lunch time, we had to sit at island, right in front of all the work going on. The waitress who was either in high school or college, was the rudest waitress I have ever encountered. Even my boyfriend who doesn't mind bad service too much if he likes the food, was very offended by her rude remarks and service to everyone she spoke to. On a brighter note, the house special chicken was DELICIOUS! the ginger and the orange sauce is the best part and they are very accommodating with their chicken. You can order it skinless and they are never stingy with their sauce, which made me an instant fan. I will definitely ask my boyfriend to take me there again.
