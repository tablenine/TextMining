after many pictures of friends and family eating at this place, i finally got to try it for myself.. . the wait is ridiculously stupid, about two hours for my group, but in the end i would say it's worth it.. . the staff is nothing amazing, they get their job done, and in a place that is as busy as this, that's all i can ask for.. . they've got pretty good music to "dance in your seat" to, you can be sure i was either bobbing my head or swaying back and forth while sucking on some shrimp's head or crackin' some crab legs. we ordered our seafood to be medium heat with the whole sha-bang seasoning (which includes rajun cajun, lemon pepper and garlic butter). man those are some kick ass flavors! i did not give two shits if my hands were covered in that sha-bang, i licked and sucked every little bit off these hands by the end of the meal. yes i know, insert "that's what she said" all over this review! don't forget to order some sweet potato fries, dip that in the sha-bang for more yummy goodness.. . after an platter or oysters, ten orders of sweet potato fries, five pounds of shrimp, two pounds of crawfish, a pound of clams, and seven dungeness crabs, you can bet we were a bit full. what a way to start the new year, woooo!!!
