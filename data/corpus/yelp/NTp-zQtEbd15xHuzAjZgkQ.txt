Amazing.  -1 star for the expensive and not so good fresh squeezed OJ and the wait, but everything else was just amazing.  I ordered the Eggwich, which is over easy eggs, strips of crispy smoked bacon, fresh avocado,. sliced tomatoes, lettuce, pesto &amp; mayo on a toasted ciabatta,. served w/ potato.  Oh my, I seriously just licked my entire plate clean.  My gf ordered the Kamil's Breakfast which is essentially mac'n'cheese with a twist of bacon and eggs and it was very yummy, but a little too heavy for me.  Nevertheless, will definitely come back
