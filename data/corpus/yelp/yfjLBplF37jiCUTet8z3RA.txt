Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
Ok so this review is a month or two overdue. A group of 3 went to Uncle Julio's in October. Getting there was easy as we took the "L" and it was a few blocks away. Valet parking for a Mexican restaurant is ridiculous so be prepared if you do drive. . . We did in fact go on a Saturday night. Yes, it was crowded and yes, it was loud. It was a Saturday night. If you expected otherwise, you probably should order take out and stay in, or pack a sandwich and head to the library if you're looking for quiet. . . We had no reservations and waited approximately 45 minutes to be seated. We were seated in their outdoor/indoor area which we didn't mind because this night it was about 65 degrees or so.. . The food was good. We were quite hungry after our long wait and we housed the chips and salsa they give you after you're seated. For entrees, we ordered fajitas, tacos, and enchiladas. The portions were generous and the food was flavored well. . . Last thing, our waiter was half a moron. When visiting Chicago again, I'd go back.
