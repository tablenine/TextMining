Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I love New York Pizza. But honestly, I just don't get what the big deal is here. The first few times was decent, despite the 2 hour wait. But lately the crust has been tasteless and in the end we've decided the place just isn't worth the fuss for eat-in or take out.. Also, the pizza is the best thing on the menu, so if you're going, don't bother with anything else.
