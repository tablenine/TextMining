came here with a bunch of guys from out of town because they were in dire need of a good burger. they kept wanting to go to in'n out. seriously, i don't get it. in'n out is ok but i would always prefer carls jr. freshness is one thing but a prime rib burger?! that's so ridiculous you have to want to eat it.. . ok back to fo. definately ample parking because its located in a shopping area with many different stores. as we approached, the smell was intoxicating. funny thing was, when we got in no one was eating, everyone was drinking. that's one part about this place i do not like at all. they make you stand outside like your at some club in hollywood and then when they let you in, you have to jockey for seats. if your with 1 or 2 people that's fine but i came with 6 guys on a friday night. we literally stood by this group of people and made it so awkward for them that they got up and left. Â burgers were divine and all in all, everyone was satisfied. . . now why can't they make pizza as good as they make burgers in LA? huh?!
