Really fresh seafood at good prices and a decor that makes me miss home (NOLA).. . I LOVE the upstairs patio area. The music is at a perfect volume and I just get carried away sitting under a big umbrella on a sunny day.. . The staff is usually pretty attentive. I don't think the view of the graveyard is depressing at all... it's kinda cool and a neat way to take in some history.
