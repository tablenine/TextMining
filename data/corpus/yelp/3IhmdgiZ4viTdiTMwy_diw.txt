This place is so great. It looks the same as it did in the seventies one would guess. The couple that entertain are a flashback and the "costumes" just make me smile. This place is usually crowded even on the weekdays but if you get there before 10 you could probably get a table. They serve appitizers pretty late which is nice if you get some munchies while you are there.
