Every time I eat here I am nothing less than satisfied. I always come for breakfast, which is packed on the weekends, and like to try a little something different each time. During breakfast on the weekends, they usually come around the tables with samples of scones or other baked goods that leave me salivating for more. The baked goods are a little pricey, but definitely worth it!
