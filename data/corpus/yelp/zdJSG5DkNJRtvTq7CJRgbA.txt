I've heard about this place for years. Not the biggest pizza freak but it's in my new hood so how can I not try it. Yelpers tried to steer me away to better places in Silverlake, and I went to them first. But then, with a visiting friend, I decided to give it a try.. . Service was great. Love the old school 'Frank Sinatra' Italian vibe. The dinner salad was tasty, good minestrone, decent Mondavi cab... Only a 15 minute wait on a Wed. night at 8pm. Ordered some eggplant parm and pizza. The EP was pretty outstanding. Thin slices, great breading not too much sauce or cheese. Really, really tasty. The pizza... well... I can see why people like it, but shocker of shocks CANNED MUSHROOMS. WTF???? What the heck is the excuse for canned mushrooms in S. California. Maybe in NYC in the dead of winter but nowadays NO EXCUSE. Canned mushrooms are the foulest blight on any food anywhere. THEY HAVE NO REASON TO LIVE. How hard would it be to make the change? The meatballs on the pizza were great. Liked the sauce, crust, cheese but CANNED MUSHROOMS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? So sad and disappointed about this. Of course I can go back and stick to meat and onions, but christ, maybe they have canned onions too. Canned artichokes are excusable... but mushrooms? No effing way! The menu should be changed to read 'canned mushrooms' in the toppings section. Maybe next time I'll try that Brownstone place down the street.
