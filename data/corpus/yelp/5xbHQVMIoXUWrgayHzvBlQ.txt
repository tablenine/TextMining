Restaurant: Lula&#39;s Sweet Apothecary
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
So, I have a brand new New Years resolution: to gain at least 10 pounds this year by coming to Lula's on a very regular basis.. . This place is everything I had dreamed and more. My friend (who is not vegan) and my vegan self walk in and the super-friendly girl behind the counter was happy to let us sample as many flavors as we wanted! We tried the maple ice cream and cake batter soft serve (both delicious), before settling on a sundae with cookies and cream and chocolate ice creams, hot fudge, rainbow sprinkles, whipped cream and, of course, a cherry on top. My friend was extremely skeptical of "cashew ice cream," but this skepticism promptly went away when we had our first bites (and then proceeded to inhale the rest of the sundae). "How do they do it?" was then the topic of conversation, along with plans for me to become obese by 2011.. . Everyone should go and if you are lactose-intolerant or vegan or simply looking for delicious ice cream--run there as soon as possible, even if it's freezing out. . . The ONLY downside: there is barely any seating available. The shop is absolutely adorable, but there are roughly 6 stools (and barely any standing room).
