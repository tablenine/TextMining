Had some friends in from NYC for the weekend and decided to take Sola out for a spin.  I agree with Emma on the Parmesan encrusted truffle fries, as we are all still talking about them.  The table had an assortment of appetizers and entrees, from the Gazpacho to the tuna tartar.  All were outstanding.  The tuna was very fresh and prepared in three different ways which was a nice touch.  Entrees were split between fish and meat and everyone came away thoroughly impressed.  The bill wasn't outrageous but this is definitely not an inexpensive dinner place either.  I am already thinking about my next visit.
