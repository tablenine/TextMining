I like the atmosphere. You'll need to pack a sandwich. Sepia keeps you from losing your color over the portion sizes by prettily placing the food on the plate. Their fusions are cool--scallops and black (blood) pudding with celery pate. I mean c'mon, where are you gonna get that? The Sepia Mule (ginger beer with vodka) will keep you feeling photogenic.
