Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's knows how to prepare Prime Rib. Be ready to walk out of this eatery almost comatose. Even while you are waiting to be seated there is a food cart in the waiting area. I have been here over 10 times, and would go back 10 more times. The decor is really old which adds to the experience. Highly suggested. It is a little pricey, so be ready to drop at least $80 per person.
