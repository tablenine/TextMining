Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
This place is tiny!  But the servers are friendly and the food is tasty, so don't get hung up on feeling out of place.. . A colleague recommended Desta to me as one of the more authentic places to try his national cuisine.  We got one order of lamb tibs and one order of kitfo (the Boy was feeling full on, raw meat-consuming carnivore), and enjoyed both, although I'm less of a tartare fan myself.. . Also, I'm completely fascinated by the breakfast menu here.  Props to Desta for keeping things authentic (well, at least according to my co-worker... it's not like I can tell) but accessible.
