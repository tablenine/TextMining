The food was good, but the service was horrible.. . We went on one of the first 80degree days this spring sat out side, and we literally had to flag down out server.. . The bussers were amazing. They literally were spinning circles around our server. we ordered drinks twice from our busser and I can Â only hope he gets tipped out.. . My bloodymary fell flat. I had to season it myself. Even the dressing was uninspired and boring. Also. The olives looked as if they were supposed to be stuffed but they were empty.. . I don't know if I'd go back, but the cobb salad was delicious. I'd prob just take it to go.
