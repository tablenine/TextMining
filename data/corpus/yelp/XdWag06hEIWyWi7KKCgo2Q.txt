I have yet to find better sushi in Los Angeles. Dining at Katsu-ya in Studio City is worth the schlep and the long long long wait. I love it. I love everything I've ever tried here. I know Katsu-ya is opening up locations just as quickly as Pinkberry, but there's a reason. The food here is heavenly.. . Everything is fresh and delicious - Â I have a deep long lasting love affair with the baked crab roll with avocado, seared albacore with garlic sauce, ceviche, and the Lucia roll (not on the menu, sometimes they won't make it, but when they do It kicks ass and takes names). All of my sushi snob friends agree that Katsu-ya is the best sushi in LA.. . Other items to fall in love with - Shishito peppers, Robert Roll, crispy rice with spicy tuna, (whoever you are, Robert, thank you for this roll!) and tempura green tea ice cream. YUM!! . . If celebrity sightings coupled with your spicy tuna roll is what you fancy - this is also the place for you. I used to meet my father weekly for Katsu-ya in the valley and it was pretty much guaranteed that we'd see a boatload of celebs (B-listers too. Awesome.). Great food. Great people watching. A place to have a saki with Jake Gyllenhaal, Phillip Seymore Hoffman, and Samuel L. Jackson. Good stuff.
