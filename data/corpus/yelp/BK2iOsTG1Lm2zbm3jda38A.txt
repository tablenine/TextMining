Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
I am always a member of the clean plate club.  Always.. . However, I met my match in Papi's super-huge jerk chicken salad.  The menu calls it a "Cuban style salad," which translates to a gigantic plate of fresh romaine, very thinly sliced red onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  The best part though is the huge serving of all white meat jerk chicken chunks they put over the top.  There's no dressing needed for this salad (though they do put some ranch on the side), as the jerk sauce and juices drip over the lettuce...oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  . . Oh, and if the chicken wasn't enough, they put a generous sprinkle of grated cheese over the whole thing, so that it just every so slightly melts.  I guess that in the end, you don't really have a salad as much as you have a delicious melty, cheesy, piece of jerk chicken on top of some lettuce.  Delicious, and at under $6, definitely within my budget.. . I am still not quite sure what the protocol is for sitting and ordering.  The take out counter is upstairs, but it looked like most of the dine in patrons were ordering up there too.  However, the bartender told me to take a seat and he would serve me.  All the servers are so nice though, that even if you did order at the "wrong" place, I doubt it would matter.
