One of the best sushi places I have been to in Los Angeles. The fish is super fresh, the star of the show, which is what a real sushi place is all about! No rolls here stuffed with imitation crab, tempura shrimp, and lathered in japanese mayo and sauces. My dad and I ordered the sashimi deluxe, sea urchin with quail egg, spanish mackeral, and yellow tail. Everything was delicious. The highlights were the toro, yellow tail, salmon, and sea urchin. Everything was so fresh that it tasted smooth and buttery. Mmmm...I could eat it everyday! I can't wait to go back for their lunch specials. They sound awesome as well! Thanks May W. for turning me onto this place :)
