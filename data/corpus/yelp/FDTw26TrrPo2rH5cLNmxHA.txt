Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
By far the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever eaten at.  . . I've taken many of my friends and family here and all the same praises.  The pho is unbelievable and the portions are huge.  The rice and noodle dishes leave you wanting more even though your stomach can't hold any more LOL.  One time we even ordered hot pot and it was unbelievable.  The only funk I have with the place is that sometimes they seat you at huge tables with strangers.
