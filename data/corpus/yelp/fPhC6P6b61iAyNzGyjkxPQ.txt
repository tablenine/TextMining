Top notch establishment. They do it right here. Focus on a simple goal, give people the best sausages and beer available! The fries are bonkers too. I started off with the bratwurst with kraut and hot peppers! Ya man! Banger! The veggie suasages are also super tasty, no one here is left out. Gets crowded on the big nights, great midweek lunch spot.
