Not my favorite pizza, but better than many places and besides, their lunch/happy hour/whatever it's called special cannot be beat. $3 for a giant slice of pizza and pop?! Hell yeah, I'll take it! That kind of deal is ridiculous in Wicker! If I wasn't kinda health conscious I'd eat here more often, as I work in the area and lunch tends to average $10 for me, but for those of you that aren't, it's the place to be. Skip the sausage, it's pretty flavorless, but the pepperoni's great.
