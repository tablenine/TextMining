Everything, from the tiny bar where Italian wines are poured to the  dining room with beautiful walls  and pretty flowers, is altogether inviting. For the adventurous, try the tasting menu---which might include black tagliatelle with parsnips and pancetta or grilled venison with acorn squash caponata and mint pesto. Other creative items are the warm lamb's tongue vinaigrette with chanterelles and a three-minute egg or the barbecued squab with roasted beet "farrotto" and porcini mustard. Finish with a savory saffron panna cotta accompanied by quince, pink peppercorn and quince sorbetto.  . The food is elegantly prepared and served with much love.  The wait was a little long but given the fact that we had no reservation they were very nice.
