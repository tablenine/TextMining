OK, I confess...I don't get Foodlife. It's kind of a "Stepford Wives" version of a suburban mall food court. The concept is this...you enter a restricted area, a gated community of sorts, and are given a Foodlife credit card. You are then expected to pick an open table and abandon your expensive Water Tower purchases, so you can get your tray of food at one of the thirteen generically named kiosks.. . All the while, you're praying no one has stolen the $300 top you bought at Ann Taylor and that no one rifles through the edible underwear you got in bulk at Victoria's Secret. This concept may work for families from Lake Forest in need of variety in their dining options, but I find the whole process rather counterintuitive. Besides, the food is simply not that great. It's really on par with mall-stops like Panda Express or the Great Steak Escape, and the portions served are certainly hearty enough for a mullet-headed truck driver.. . I had the $6.09 Chicken and Biscuits with a mound of mashed potatoes from the Comfort Food kiosk. Meh. I actually couldn't finish it because it was just too much and on the lukewarm side. I took a tour of the rest of the kiosks, and nothing looked all that appetizing. A Diet Coke seems rather high at $2.25, but I suppose you can use the flip sign and leave your table with the $300 top and all the edible lingerie to get a refill. Before you get up, you may notice that all the servers are smiling in a suspiciously mechanical way. They have a faraway glassiness in their eyes. You are now leaving Stepford.. . FOOD - 3 stars...meh. AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...certainly spiffed up but strangely bland in execution. SERVICE - 3 stars...well, you get your own tray. TOTAL - 3 stars...hmmm, a food court as a restricted community
