These got to be some of the best pastries available, no matter what! The prices are great, and they have a great variety of sandwiches, breakfast, cakes, pastries, meat pies and potato balls, and good coffee,as well. Also, great is the guava-mango smoothie. Just avoid going during lunch hours and early mornings on the weekend, it is CRAZY &amp; HECTIC!!! but if you gotta go, u gotta go =)
