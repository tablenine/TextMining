This is a kinda love it or hate it establishment.  I think people come in with a pre-conceived notion of what they think a pastrami sandwich is supposed to taste like (either based on other places or just from descriptions they've heard from other people).  Well, we came in a large group (14 people) and probably got 14 different reactions to Langers.  Most were positive, "good sandwich", "it was worth it", "better than I expected".  Some were negative, "too salty", "too expensive", "not worth the drive", etc.. . My point being, pastrami sandwiches have a very distinct flavor, especially with the rye bread.  Some people will like it, some won't.  If you don't like the flavor, it won't really matter how much it costs (or if it was free).  I prefer thinner cut meat (the Hat style) so the thicker cut meat wasn't that enjoyable for me.  It did make it SEEM saltier but it was balanced overall, especially with the rye.  Add some extra mustard and it was quite enjoyable.  Good, but not delicious and at about $14 each it's not much in the bang for buck category.. . If nothing at all...its good to try so you can tell people, "yeah, I've been to Langers...."
