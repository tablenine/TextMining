I've been to Yamashiro 4 times and have to say the sushi isn't as good as it use to be. Its a great place for a date, primarily for its view and name recognition. But other then that its just ok. I've never had any of the cooked dishes so I can't really comment of those. But the sushi is over priced for the quality. Â . Expect to make reservations as it is a hollywood landmark and gets pretty busy on weekend.
