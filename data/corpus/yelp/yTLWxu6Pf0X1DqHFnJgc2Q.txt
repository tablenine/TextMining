I want to move in! Dinner last night was ridic. The bone in Rib eye is my new lover. Did not matter that it was too big for me.. about to make a sando with the left overs at present.. . I felt like I was in NY the whole time. The ambience is great. Request Â a table upstairs. Gotta have the piano perfecting the melodies. This place is old school for sure but a classic! . . There are plenty of great steak places in LA but if you haven't been or its been awhile, don't sleep on it.
