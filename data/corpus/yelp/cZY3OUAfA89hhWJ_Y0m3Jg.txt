Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I'm a pretty big fan of vietnamese food, particularly pho and vietnamese sandwiches.  But now that I dont eat red meat, Gingergrass is a great option because they don't cook their soup in beef broth (like most vietnames restaurants) and they offer more vegetarian/shrimp/chicken options.  Plus, their pho soup is light and not as heavily salted, their mama cindy salad, although I'm holding off on it now because I'm always getting it, is delicious, and their shrimp noodle bowl is a nice treat on a warm day. Even my chinese parents, who are restaurant Nazis and the harshest critics, like this place.  What I particularly find refreshing is that their food doesn't leave you with that MSG heaviness/bloatiness afterwards and everything is just so light and tasty.  The sauces they use are like crack - you put it on everything and it adds so much more flavor.  . . Ok...the downside is that this place gets packed!  Park  across the street at the B of A. Ordering to go is always a great option &amp; call ahead to minimze wait time.  Recently, they've expanded a little so that there is outside seating, but I think it's only a handful of tables, and they don't take reservations from what I can remember.
