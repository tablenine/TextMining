Good, but awesome? I beg to differ. We came here on a Wednesday night and we had to wait 45 minutes. WHAT!?!?! meh we had some time to kill so whatever. My group ordered 3 bowls of ramen and gyoza and fried rice to share. The gyoza came out first and I do not know if it was an off night, but the gyoza were most definitely not mind-blowing, they were kinda meh... The meat inside was slightly gummy, the skins weren't as crisp as I was expecting and overall they were just ok. The fried rice was pretty good especially when I mixed in the ginger to add just a little spice into the rice (hey that rhymed, but I digress...) the bits of pork add a really nice savoriness to the rice so though it looked like regular fried rice, it was definitely different thanks to the pork and a brothy undertone to the rice. The ramen is definitely solid with a creamy porky rich broth and the eggs were good that night, not completely cooked through with an orange soft yolk. The noodles were a bit overdone, slightly past cooked to partially soft, but I was hungry after the 45 minute wait so slurp away. The pork was extremely soft and perfectly done, but after all the food, I still felt like Santouka rules my heart. Sorry guys...
