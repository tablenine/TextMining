The mistake I made was going here hung over, looking for a filling breakfast. The decor is pretty LA.  I ordered steak and eggs. I got them. I ate them. Then I was really starving!!. Small portions, but good. The coffee, well, it was aight'. I didn't want to shout out loud about it.  It's good. try it.
