Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Okay. I've been hearing rave reviews about Roscoe's. When I finally tried it, I wasn't disappointed.. . First of all, the main thing at Roscoe's is the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken is hard to describe except that it is totally awesome. It's way better than the crap they serve at Popeye's or KFC. There's something about it. The waffles are soft and delicious, especially when you slather it up with some butter. The portions are generous, which is pretty good since you will be wanting more after the first bite. The service was pretty good. We ate fairly late at night and the place wasn't crowded at all. Then again, it's the Pasadena location.
