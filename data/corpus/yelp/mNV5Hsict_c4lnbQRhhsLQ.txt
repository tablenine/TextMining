Best steak in Atlanta and quite comparable to the original Morton's of Chicago.  A definite notch below Peter Luger's but with better service.  Slightly edges Chops in steak but Chops has slightly better starters. The squash ordered as a side was practically raw.  It was promptly replaced with spinach.  The chocolate cake is massive and easily shared by three.  I will definitely return.
