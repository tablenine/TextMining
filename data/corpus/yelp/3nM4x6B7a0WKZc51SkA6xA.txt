Clearly my holiday spent in LA was all about hitting up as many restaurants as possible and stuffing my face! If I lived in LA, I'd spend a load of time (and $$) at Real Food Daily, and wouldn't feel one bit of guilt!. . Good vegan restaurants are hard to come by (esp in a meat &amp; potatoes city like Chicago), but RFD really impressed me. I would eat this way a hell of a lot more if we had places like this around the city. There was a diverse, hip crowd dining when we stopped in, not just tofu makin hippies!!. . Everything I ate at RFD was quite good and had a lot of flavor - I started off with a very nice organic Sauvignon Blanc with hints of pear, and apple. It was low in sulfites, which is great bc alcohol makes me turn red. (low sulfites are supposed to help combat that). *Note to self - drink more organic wine.. . I went for 'The Club Seitan' - tempeh bacon, lettuce, tomato, vegenaise, sourdough bread. 'Hemp' bread was listed as an alternative for some of the sandwiches, but I opted against trying it. The fake bacon tasted exactly what I envision bacon to taste like, just by smelling it. That said the texture of the fakin bacon strips looked like a bunch of seeds. Strange. . . For dessert, my friends and I shared the Apple Cranberry Crisp - unbleached white flour, soy, nuts, sweetened w/ maple. The apples were sweet and the crisp part of the dessert was crunchy and good. I ended my meal with a hot cup of the 'Yerba Mat√© Latte' - a green herbal tea brewed and capped with steamed soy milk. A perfect ending to a healthy, delicious meal. We need more places like this in Chicago!!
