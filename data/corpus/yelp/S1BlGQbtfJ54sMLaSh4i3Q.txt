Was expecting more since every time i drive past this place its packed..... . What I ordered:. . Appetizers - Beef tartar and Baby Beets (both were rather tasty!). Main Dishes - . KUROBUTA PORK CHOP - really left me wanting more...the presentation was ok and the chop was rather tasteless.... . The menu was small with items that really didn't call out to me... If the pork chop won me over then I would have tried the other dishes.... . If you plan on stopping by here just don't have high expectations...
