What can I say...this place just feels "right".  Great menu, very comfy chairs, just very comfy.  I feel happy here. . . I'd say my favorite sushi restaurant so far (and I only eat veg sushi :)   . . Wangs next store (which I've also reviewed) makes it even better!. . A bit pricey if you go nuts...which is hard not to do.
