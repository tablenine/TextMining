Dinner here is amazing. Han pen cheese, agedashi tofu and age nasu are just a few of my favorites, but there's so much more plus the good Japanese beer Sapporo and Asahi. Unless you arrive early you will have to wait to be seated pretty much on any day of the week. Service goes up and down, depending on how packed they get. They have a parking lot behind the building, but you may have to move your car in the middle of your meal if you block another car.
