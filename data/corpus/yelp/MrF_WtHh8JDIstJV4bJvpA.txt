Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Pros: It's delicious chicken and waffles, lots of character, very unique place. . Cons: Very very filling. . Want to go somewhere with a lot of character and some delicious chicken and waffles? Go to Roscoe's! This place is a great break from the plastic people you might think of when you think of L.A. It has a ton of character and some of the best chicken and waffles anywhere. Pour the syrup over everything and enjoy. There might be a long wait but it's worth it. Get Scoe's #1 and have one of the best soul food experiences you can have in Southern California.
