Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. It really stands out on the block. The inside is a bit cramped, reminds me of some chinatown restaurants. They have outdoor seating which can be nice on a good day. The menu features some pretty typical PAN-ASAIN (not just Chinese!) dishes. I just ordered several appetizers to get a taste-If you like tuna, they have a sashimi tuna dip with wonton chips which is delicious! For 11:30 at night the place wasn't too busy, but I can imagine during prime eating hours it can be packed tight. . . Overall the food was great, about what I expected, staff was alright, and the decor is my style-clean and simple. The value of price for food is an incredible find, and If you are interested in checking out PingPong I say give it a whirl. It is BYOB, so I suggest bring over some Tsingtao or Sapporo or something ( :) ).
