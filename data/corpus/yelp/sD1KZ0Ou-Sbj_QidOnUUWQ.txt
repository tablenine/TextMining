Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm not sure what the rave is all about. Â I waited over an hour to try the hot dogs here and I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.. I ordered The "Planet Hollywood" Dog (Polish Sausage, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon &amp; cheese). It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The hot dogs seem like ordinary hot dogs with extra toppings.. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but without the hour wait.
