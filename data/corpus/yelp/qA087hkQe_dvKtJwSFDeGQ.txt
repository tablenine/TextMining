went here for the first time tonight.  on the menu it says they serve corn fries but was disappointed when our waiter said that they have discontinued serving that item (but it's still on the menu).  so, i got the guacamole and chips instead.  it was not $7 and some change good and the chips they served with it were really greasy.. i ordered the shrimp po' boy sandwich and that was really tasty.  definitely worth the $10 and some change.  the reason why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because my friend said his crazy bloody mary with meat and cheese in it was definitely worth that extra star.
