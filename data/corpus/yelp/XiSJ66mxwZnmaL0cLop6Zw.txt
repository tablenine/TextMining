I think I like this place because it's attached to Wang's and I can get their ginger martini. It's very good, but not amazing. The staff is very polite and nice, but a bit awkward. It seems overpriced to me for what you get. The sushi was very good, and fresh, but it didn't send me into the stratosphere of sexy sushi.. . I love the interior and the Eames potato chip chairs, though, those are winners. The natural wood makes it seem like a rural Japanese traditional inn, with modern furniture. Love that esthetic. BUT I didn't come there to ogle the furniture.. . And WHY is the plektron percussion blasting in the bathrooms? I couldn't get out of there quickly enough. The bathrooms were spotless but LOUD.
