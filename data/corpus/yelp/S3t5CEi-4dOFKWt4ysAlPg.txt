THE EMPANADAS ARE NOT GREASY! that's awesome!. . I have to plan my graduation party pronto. It's real hard to find a restaurant with excellent reviews, good food, and a beautiful atmosphere in the Southside. My dad had his heart on another brazilian steakhouse but yeah right we're going to spend $45 per person. I found this place as a potential and we had to "test try." OMG the staff were friendly, steak was good, empanadas weren't greasy, and the setting is romantic. my kind of style...you must check this place out. won't regret the price either!
