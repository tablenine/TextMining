Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
great place for drinks.. just eat elsewhere..... . Lola's has more creative and tasty varieties of martinis than you could ever want.... and more. I normally don't like sweet drinks, but their chocolate martini is fantastically yummy, along with a variety of other fruity martini concoctions. . . i would give Lola's 5 stars for the martinis.. but i knock one star off for the mediocre/forgettable food (although i've only had appetizers).
