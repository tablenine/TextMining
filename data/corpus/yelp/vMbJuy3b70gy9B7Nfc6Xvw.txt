One of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles! And no corkage! Yay! My favorite dishes are the skirt steak, the patatas bravas (served with the traditional spicy tomato-based sauce and garlic aioli - NOT sour cream as another reviewer had mentioned!) on the side, the asparagus, the cod cakes and the tomato-rubbed bread with jamon and manchego cheese (forgot the name!). YUM! The chorizo is too greasy, the lentils too hard (and greasy!) and a couple of other dishes I don't care for - but the place is still fabulous! And our favorite waiter, Terry, seems to always be there when we visit - his great service always adds to a fun, boozy night!
