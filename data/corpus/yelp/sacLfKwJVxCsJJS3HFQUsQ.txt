The pita bread here is awesome.  I'm pretty sure I went through at least 2 plates of the pita bread on my own, and it's even better when you order the tasting of the spreads.  All of the spreads are good, as each has its unique flavor.  Very good start to the meal.. . All of the other dishes that we ordered were very good -- here are the recommendations for anyone looking to try a diverse selection of Greek food.  . . Grilled octopus -- cooked to perfection; tender and well-flavored. Spicy lamb pie -- I normally don't eat lamb, but this was great, and the cheese spread under the pie provides a good balance. Fried cheese -- a unique dish. Greek meatballs -- combination of beef and lamb, well seasoned, and comes with Greek fries, which are awesome. Spinach and feta cheese pies -- good, but probably the least impressive dish. . All of this is about $7-12 a dish, so not too expensive if you share.  Portions are decently sized, so I'd say the dishes above should feed 3 people, and maybe even 4 comfortably.. . Service was good.  Perhaps a little less asking if we wanted more drinks or not all night would have made it a bit better.  4 stars overall.
