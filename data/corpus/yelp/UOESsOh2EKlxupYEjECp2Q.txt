found this place through yelp and will definitely go back.  i got there on a sunday around 11:30 and even though there was a line outside we got seated within 10-15 mins.  we ordered the toscana scramble and the morning hash and both were delicious.  the pesto sauce really stood out in the scramble and the morning hash had all the flavors you want in a hash w/o the grease.  we also ordered a banana walnut pancake on the side and it was great but i felt like it could've been a little warmer when it was served.  overall i took a star off b/c there was a little bit of a confusion with the seating (we were asked to moved to a different table 5 mins after we sat down b/c someone reserved the table we were sitting in) and it did take a while for us to get our food.  but i'd say this is a 4.5 :)
