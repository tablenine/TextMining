Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I must confess that I've never waited for a table at Toast.  I've sat at a table and watched the lines form, but I've always had the good fortune of going at a time when no one else was.. . The food is good.  Clearly, or otherwise people wouldn't wait an hour for a table.  The French toast is stuffed full of goodness, and the eggs are almost always just right.  . . I have to admit that I wouldn't wait an hour on a hot summer day, or a cold winter one, but maybe in the spring or fall, when it's that perfect temperature outside, and all you can think of is stuffed french toast.
