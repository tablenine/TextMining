I was very careful not to let my experience be colored by all of the reviews on here. I did really want to love daikokuya as much as everyone else. But it's important not to be biased just because everyone else loves it.. . Caught a late lunch here the other day, and had the house specialty ramen. It was good. Am I going to carry on about it? No. I liked it. It was about 9 bucks. That's fine.. . Decor is meh. Lines are generally long. No real complaints, just wasn't a WOW OMG kind of experience :-). . On a positive note, our server was pleasant and attentive without being overbearing. . . Worth trying, if only to say you've had it. I recommend going between lunch and dinner times to avoid the rush :-)
