Yipee!. . I was happy to run across this while walking around for something to eat. I've had falafels from their Amsterdam locations a few years ago, so I was psyched to try it here in the US.. . I ordred the Maoz (falafel) with eggplant in a wheat pita. It was just as good as I remembered. I topped it off with some hot sauce and tahini from their toppings bar. The falafel wasn't too greasy but a little on the soft-ish side - the pita was nice and soft and stood up on its own while I took multiple bites into it.. . I hope they open a location in SF soon!
