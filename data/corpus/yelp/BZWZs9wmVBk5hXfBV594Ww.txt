I have been hearing so much about how great the Hainan chicken was at Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra. I finally was able to try it last night and it was pretty darn good! The chicken was like fall off the bone soft and the rice cooked in chicken broth just made it extra good. It's wholesome and tastes like momma's cooking. I had the dark meat and it was pretty good. I have to come back again because I had to inhale my meal because I had to be at Corkbar in LA. It was a fast in and out within 20 minutes!. . My boyfriend and I also ordered the eggrolls and I thought those were not bad.  One dish of the Hainan chicken was more than enough for me.  Next time I come back... I'm taking my time to savor it.. . Cost: 2 orders of the Hainan chicken dish and an order of the eggrolls: $25 with tax and tip total for 2.
