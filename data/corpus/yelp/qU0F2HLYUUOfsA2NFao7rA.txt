Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Was working in LA so one of my co-workers suggested we go to this place.  After two and a half hours in traffic, I was f%*#@n pissed.  The line wasn't terrible when we got there, maybe ten minutes at the most.  Unfortunately, it was about 40 degrees out that night so I was even more mad by the time we go our food.. . I gotta say though, they were great hot dogs.  I got a chili cheese dog that was damn tasty, and had part of some Millenium dog or something.  It was really good too.  Got a grape Crush soda in a real glass bottle to drink.  Hadn't had one since I was a kid.  . . Without traffic, I would definitely go back.  Guess it depends where I stay in LA next time around
