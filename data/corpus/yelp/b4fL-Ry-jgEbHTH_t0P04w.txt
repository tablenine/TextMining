I do appreciate that I was able to get a table for 7 people on a Saturday at noon without a problem.  But the food is probably the reason why it's not busier at prime weekend lunch/brunch time.. . We were a group of hungry volleyball players ready to take down some calories after playing for the last 3 hours and since two from the group live in this neighborhood, they suggested this cafe.. . Service was: meh - but we weren't in a rush but I did feel it was very slow.. . Food - let's just say my quest for the city's Egg Benedicts DID NOT end here.  Poached eggs looked unpresentable with wavy curls of egg whites sprawled atop the plate.  Hollandais sauce was lumpy and flavorless.  No indication of any zesty lemon at all - or salt.  Eggs were cooked through.  The only saving grace may have been the delicious thick slicked of Canadian bacon.  The potatoes were also rather tasteless even though it appeared to have been cooked with a variety of flavorful ingredients.  I'm glad I shared this plate and had the opportunity to try something else.. . That something else was the Lox and Bagel plate which was GREAT.  The bagel was small and dense (not the crappy fluffy stuff you get at a supermarket - maybe the most authentic bagel I have had in a long while) with a beautifully egg washed golden top. (sesame bagel).  Lox was lovely, bright and plentyful. . . Finally, I saw a giant plate of hummus that my friend Joyce ordered and wanted to give it a try.  Sadly the hummus lacked any flavor.  I think they forgot the garlic which is a key ingredient to hummus next to the tahini and the chick peas.. . So, I think  have to settle at 2-stars for the food and 3 stars because we were easily seated.  I will come here again if someone suggests it, but I won't recommend it myself.
