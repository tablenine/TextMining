Oh how I love this place. Everything I've ever ordered there was just a crunchy, gooey marvel, especially the Turkey Turkey Â - and I normally hate turkey, so winning me over in this category is really quite impressive. If you are in the area and need a really good, non-chain sandwich, this is your place. My only holdup is that the service is on the Germanic side, so if you're looking for TLC, you shall look in vain. Who cares though? I'd rather have a great lunch served with grunts than studiously polite ickiness.
