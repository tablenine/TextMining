I have been here twice now.  Tables had been reserved each time so I sat at the bar and have always been treated cordially; very attentive service overall.  The bartender was the one to serve the food and at each visit has answered numerous questions about the food, how it's cooked, the spices, etc.  He really knew the ins and outs of every dish and was able to make some great recommendations.  Get the fried okra and chickpea salad to start, and if you like tea, get the ginger tea!  The entrees that I've had are the lentil dish, and a chickpea &amp; kidney bean dish.  Both dishes were spiced just right (at least, for me).  The mushroom stuffed nan was definitely a winner. It's unpretentious and not too pricey, if you order right.  I'll definitely be back.
