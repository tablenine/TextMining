Restaurant: The Swallow at the Hollow
Category: Barbeque
When you step out of the car, you can smell it.. . My pre-meal beer was served in a plastic cup. My kind of classy BBQ joint! I was anticipating the BBQ already.. . The ribs did not disappoint. There are some sauces on the table, but those are just table dressing. The ribs are already cooked with some sauce and taste great as-is: not too wet, not too dry, not too spicy, not too tangy.. . The sides are OK; only the coleslaw really stood out for me. The coleslaw is just the right amount of creamy salty peppery without being too runny with too much dressing.
