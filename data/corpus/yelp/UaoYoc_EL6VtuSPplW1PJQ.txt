Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Maybe I'm biased, but I will always remember and cherish lola's as the restaurant that my bf took me on our first date.   Until we break up or get into some ridiculous predicament...dun...dun...dun, i would have to say I'm a fan for now.  (you never know I am a girl and my theory is that all girls are crazy, some crazier than others - where I stand is still yet to be determined - I will just say, I'm the craziest of them all :).  . . Lola's is definitely memorable for their martinis.  I'm not much of a drinker, but their martini list was phenomenally large.  I wanted to try each and everyone one, but  I lack the enzyme that process alcohol since I'm asian and I drink once in a blue moon that my wish couldn't be fulfilled that night.  But on the other hand I did get slightly buzzed, smiled and talked up a storm that night.  The amount of alcohol in your martini is definitely not small.  . . Taking the amount of alcohol in your martini into account, i'd have to say my friends and I absolutely love happy hour at lola's.  The food is cheap, tasty, and satisfies your appetite.  If you want more, their regular menu is available as well.  I've never been disappointed with lola's food and drinks, though after happy hour it may get a little pricy.  My friends and I have hit up happy hour at lola's several times and we nearly stay till the end playing pool, relaxing and enjoying the ambience surrounding us.  While my bottomless alcoholic friends can handle several martinis, I'm buzzed and happy with one.
