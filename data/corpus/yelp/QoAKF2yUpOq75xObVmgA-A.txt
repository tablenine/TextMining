Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Affectionately known as Mozza in some circles, Pizzeria Mozza is in fact the little sister to Osteria Mozza and serves no indignity on its menu of amazing salads, pizzas and desserts. Book in advance and arrive with good company, because the Pizzeria is one of few genuinely alive establishments in Los Angeles.
