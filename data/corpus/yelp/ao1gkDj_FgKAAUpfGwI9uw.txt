Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
I didn't find the prices abominable, 'specially for the mag mile, but the Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of those places you take your friend from outta town who doesn't eat anything outside of burgers and spaghetti to.  Big menu, but the food is standard fare, not ridiculously tasty or anything, but it works.  . . Service is just as bland as some of the entrees, but the cheesecake is always a winner, although I personally think I make a better cheese cake (I can rock a killer chocolate swirl turtle cheesecake.  booyah.)
