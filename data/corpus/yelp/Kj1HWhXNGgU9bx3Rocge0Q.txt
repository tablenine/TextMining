I've spent over a thousand dollars at Crustacean, and I've never even been there!. . True story.  This is the preferred destination for my wife and her high school buddies each and every time they celebrate a birthday.  So yes, this is a second hand review, based solely on her experience.  However, since I've shelled out so much cheddar for this place, I think that sort of entitles me to say a few words... . . Garlic noodles.   I understand it's a side dish, but apparently it's one of the unique offerings at Crustacean that keeps them coming back.  "Addictive" is an adjective that I keep hearing.. . Roast Crab.  I hear is great, but not really anything better than fresh, delicious crab anywhere else.  if you're a crab-lover, you're gonna like it.. . Roland.  A server there who often serves them.  How should I feel about this kind of familiarity?  I haven't decided just yet.. . $140  This is the approximate amount that each girl drops (subsidizing the girl having the birthday) each time they enjoy the full-on experience there between the 5 of them.  I'm the invisible benefactor... kinda like Charlie to his angels, except I only pay for 1.2 of the angels.. . My wife wants to take me there on a date.  Sure, I'm game... but I already feel like I've eaten there many, many times!
