this place is kind of cozy and very popular which means you have to make reservations a month in advance. i don't know if i could plan that far in advance for somewhat casual dining. however, you don't need a reservation to sit at the bar and eat. we went early-ish and found two seats at the end.. . the eggplant caponata that we started with was very flavorful. we also had Â a nice arugula salad. most of the pizzas look great, with interesting combinations of ingredients from more familiar, like the margherita, to more imaginative. we settled on the funghi misti, a mushroom pizza with taleggio &amp; thyme. it was good, although not mind-blowing as i had expected based on reviews. their gelato &amp; sorbetto are tasty, and indulgent in an ice cream sandwich!. . we recently tried to order a pizza to take with us to the hollywood bowl, but they apparently have very particular restrictions about that. orders have to be made a day in advance, and only between certain hours and if the chef feels like it. that puts a damper on any cravings.
