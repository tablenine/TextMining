Hands down my favorite burger in LA! Sweet potato fries are also bombdiggity! This is a really good date place if you want to go somewhere that's not all fancy and uptight. If you run out of things to talk about with your date, you can always talk about the HUGE beer selection, or complain about how they don't let you customize the burgers, or even just whine about how there aren't any seats! I prefer the Culver City location because it is a little bigger, and I've never really had to wait that long for a seat. The bartenders are always great with beer selections and I make it point to go to FO at least once every couple months or so.
