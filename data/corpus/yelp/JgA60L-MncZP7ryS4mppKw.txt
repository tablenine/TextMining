This place is good and gets a decent rating from me.  Service is superb.  Our waitress was extremely helpful when we stated we could not eat a fish-based sauce (i.e. - no oyster sauce), which is plentiful on their menu.  When I asked for a soy based sauce, she later came back to us to inform us even their soy sauce also is fish based so she offered us a mushroom sauce.  Very helpful!  . . The mushroom sauce is tasty and their portions are large enough.  The food was good but nothing that really left me in awe.  However, the service was definitely up there in my book and the waitress for being so kind and attentive.
