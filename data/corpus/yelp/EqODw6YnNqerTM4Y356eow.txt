Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Being an east-coast boy, I was really happy when I first noticed Coalfire in my old 'hood.. . A BYOB place cranking out good, simple, neopolitan style pizzas?  Sign me up.. . The first time we dined in, they screwed up our order.  They brought out the "bad" pizza, left it on the table for us, and explained the situation.  They let us try it while we were waiting for the pizza we ordered.  A bit strange, but a nice gesture nonetheless.  Not only that, but they cut the price of our pizza on the bill.  The "bad" pizza was delicious and it whetted my appetite for the our actual pizza.  The ingredients are all very fresh and the pizza comes out of the oven with that perfect blend of crunch and chewy.. . The servers are on top of it with wine glasses, or a tub of ice, for your beers.. . I will say that you MUST eat at the restaurant to get the full impact of the pizza.  It simply does not fair well as take out, or delivery.  And, it is not that great the next day.. . That aside, it is my favorite thin-crust pizza in the city.
