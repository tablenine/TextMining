Keeping this one short and simple since everyone has pretty much said it all.... . Love, love, love you the Griddle! It's too bad I moved back to Seattle because I crave this place for breakfast too often - especially after a night of drinking. Awesome hangover food. Great coffee, huuuge yummy pancakes and my favorite... omlette my soul! The chili is amazing!. . I miss you, the Griddle!
