Good Burgers but lets be realistic $45 for 2 people for burgers (with fries and 2 drinks)?  I  had a coupon from a magazine and a gift card someone gave me for my birthday.  The manager really had no logical explanation why they would only accept one or the other he said, "it is what it is"   but, I do wonder what they did was legal?  When I report them to the BBB (better business beau)  we will see.  Obviously they lost a customer but the manager said he doesn't feel like arguing with me and it is what it is so I don't think they really care since they have a 200% mark up on food.
