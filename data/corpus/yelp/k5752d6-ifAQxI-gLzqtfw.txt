Please pay attention to this review so you remember who to thank after you follow my advice and order up what might be the greatest sandwich of your life.  . . Are you a pastrami person? This is a completely irrelevant question, so don't give me the answer.  Don't waste your breath uttering names like Carnegie, Jerry's or God forbid, Canter's and write me off.  You haven't been to Langer's. You haven't had the life experiences that make you qualified to converse with me, so just listen. I'm nobody special, I just ate there.. . The cow was made so that from it, the brisket may be cut, and that brisket cured, smoked and steamed then sliced and piled upon rye and brought to my table. I'm convinced of this.. . While I've dabbled in pastrami sandwiches before, the #19 at Langer's is a category unto itself.  While I've eaten, coveted and baked rye bread forever, I've never had it as good as Langer's. I never had use for Russian dressing and have rarely been inspired by cole slaw, until now. Swiss cheese was never my thing, and so forth.. . This is exquisite pastrami, sliced thick and piled generously. It reminds one of its close cousin, Texas barbecued brisket. This is a beautifully old restaurant that has resisted modernization and for one reason or another never embarked across town.  There might not be five places in this city that have this sort of character or legacy. There is no where in the city that performs such magic with and between two slices of bread.. . You haven't an excuse worth sharing.  Take the day off work or head on down during the weekend. The only downside is the itch you'll have the next day to get back.  I'm a few days in and it doesn't go away.. . So on the occasion of my 200th review, I dedicate this milestone to the memory of Al Langer. Thank you sir. That is one fine sandwich.
