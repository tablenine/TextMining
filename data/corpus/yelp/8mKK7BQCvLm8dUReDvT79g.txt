MMM... I ordered the Flat Iron Steak Salad. It was yums. If you've never had breakfast beets, THEY ARE SO GOOOOOD!!! . The ambiance was nice! There's outdoor seating that's not overcrowded too. . The price was not bad, I'd say.. $10. They also have a "live salad" for you organic lovers... You can watch your salad being made, while you wait to pay. It's cool.. everything is made fresh.. I'd go again, FO SHO!
