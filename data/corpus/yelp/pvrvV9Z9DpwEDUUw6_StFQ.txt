Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
Not sure what the big deal about this place is. The mexican food is better... everywhere else in town. Even Caramba Cafe is better; and that is scary. I felt like I was at Don Pablo's or Chili's. . . The parents seem to like it alot. So, that should be a give away on what type of atmosphere it is. There were actually servers going around singing happy birthday. And, a raffle every hour for free stuff. Oh wait, maybe I went to Chuck E. Cheese by accident.. . They took the slick modern interior that was Sala, and junked it up. Too bad; I was really looking forward to going here.. . One positive note. The bartenders there are super nice. That is what gives this place 2 stars.
