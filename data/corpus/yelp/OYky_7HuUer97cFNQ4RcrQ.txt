Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
The decor is very mod and oh so downtown.  Not sure if that's a positive or negative.... . Their wine list is extensive and expensive!  Real champagne will set you back though I've tried most of the less wallet busting sparkling wines and the staff has done an excellent job of editing.  Solid sparklers representing a good part of the globe and the mark up is not completely insane (maybe 2 to 3 times what you would pay at Binnys).  If you're into other champagnes besides brut, they have sec and demi-sec varieties which are tasty and a bit sweeter (try Cerdon de Bugey by Bernard Rondeau, excellent at $40ish per bottle).  The sommelier was actually very helpful and not snotty at all when we wanted help choosing a bottle between $30 and $50.   Service the entire night was actually great.. . The by glass selections are limited and way overpriced ($11 for a split when the bottle would probably only be $30) so definitely go for a bottle to share.  You'll get better and more bubbly for the price.. . The food however, was not spectacular.  Way overly salted to the point of being inedible, and this was on four separate dishes.  To their credit, our waitress took all the food off the tab and the rest of the night the kitchen sent out almost the entire menu completely comped.  Mainly very very very small plates of asian fusion, the stand outs being the hamachi carpaccio (heavenly) and a crabcake/potato thing (tasty).  Not sure I would eat here if I had to pay for it since the food really was teeny tiny but it's a champagne place after all :)
