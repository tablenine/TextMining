Overpriced sums it up. . . I came here for lunch yesterday, and got the skillet fried chicken -- featuring a slab of fried chicken breast. The texture was nice but it was pretty bland! It came with very cheesy risotto with ham (pretty good) with frill mustard green (too sour). My meal was greasy and too filling. I couldn't even eat dinner last night.. . Presentation was good, service was great, as well as the atmosphere. But the food itself disappointed me.
