What a delightfully tasty surprise in a small no thrills restaurant. We were very hungry and had no idea of the portion sizes and ordered too much food. We all ordered gyro sandwiches, some with potatoes and mine with salad. That was the best gyro I've had in Georgia so far. The lamb actually tasted like lamb, the tzasiki sauce was on the side so you could control the amount and did I mention it was giant, well it was. In addition to the sandwiches we also ordered dolmas and spanakopita. The dolmas, was ok, I've had worst. I didn't try the spanakopita (too full) but my overstuffed friends were very determined to eat all of it, even at the risk of exploding, so I'm going to say that must have been very good. I look forward to another gyro sandwich, I'll go really hungry! . . Overall, we had a good time talking, hanging out and eating; in my book that is a good time. The only warnings I issue is order light and if you're still hungry order more because the portion sizes are huge.
