my favorite soup dumpling haunt in la. it's definitely worth the trek out to arcadia. and the wait isn't so bad after 1:30 on sundays if you go to the new wing adjacent to the original, although some purists may say the new wing ain't the same as the original. i go for the pork and sometimes will vary w/the pork/crab ones but all-pork rules!. . full review w/photos: . http://njeats.blogspot....
