A comedy skit i saw suggested that Chinese are the Jewish of the east because we're so cheap and frugal.  For me, it must be my palette too because i really like this place.  (mmk that worked in my head)  but yah this place is pretty good.  Matsah ball soup, pastrami on rye, and macaroons.... mmm.  I have to admit, i don't go there often.  Actually, i haven't been there in a long time.  But from what i remember it's really good and the price isn't too bad.  Also it's open 24/7.  Total comfort food in my book.
