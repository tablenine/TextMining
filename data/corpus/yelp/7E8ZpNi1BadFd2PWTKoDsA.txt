Yup, it's a hipster joint, as evidenced by the fact that Steve Aoki and his posse were a table away when we ate there New Year's Eve. But I'm continually amazed by the food. The place would probably thrive on its hipness alone, even if the food were sub-par, but the variety and quality of the dishes keep me coming back. You want breakfast but your friend wants Asian? No problem, both are on the menu. . . My one major grievance is the service, which is only a step above serve-yourself. Yes, I know it's a diner, but that doesn't mean I need to be ignored when I walk into the establishment, and the waiter should check up on you at least once. Even the busboys carried a too-cool-for-school attitude. Hear this, Freds: Courteous service will take you far.. . Now, why the hell did they take the DIY toasters off the tables?
