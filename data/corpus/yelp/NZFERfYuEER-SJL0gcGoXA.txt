So what if the belgian fries were not great, the homemade ketchup was average at best, and the burger was nothing special? . . I like it here because... well...  um.  They really were nice.  Yeah.  And they made me try a pumpkin shake.  Practically twisted my arm, in fact.. ...and you know what?  It was quite a treat, this pumpkin shake.  . Yes.  So, that's why i like it here.  It has nothing to do with my blind love for one Mr. J. Gold.
