K.P. and I went here a couple years ago after getting kicked out of a Jay-Z concert. haha. I know, who does that? Anyway, this is the place that taught me how delicious bacon wrapped cherry tomatoes are!!! Holy crap, it just melts in your mouth and is my favorite drinking snack. . . We sat in the "lounge" area, which boggles my mind because it's like a little corner with seating and ottoman-sized tables. I don't remember too much about the drinks, so they must not have been that great. Overall,.  the decor is great and it makes you feel hip.
