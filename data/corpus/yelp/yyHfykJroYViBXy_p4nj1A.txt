Restaurant: Rose Angelis
Category: Italian
Rose Angelis is my all time favorite restaurant.  Every time I go I tell myself I will order a new dish, but inevitably end up with the artichoke chicken pasta.  The secret is to order it with their creamy pink tomato sauce, not what the menu offers.  I would venture a guess that 95% of the waiters will automatically know what you mean.  IT IS AMAZING! The tiramisu is also fantastic.. . RA is a great date place.  If you are lucky enough to go on a nice summer evening, ask to be seated outside.  The patio is delightful.
