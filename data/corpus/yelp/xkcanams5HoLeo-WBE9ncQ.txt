Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
Good ol' Gingergrass. Gingergrass is like a gay white-washed Vietnamese guy. White-washed by trend-following nerds and "writers" with quarter finished screenplays lying around their apartment. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind being around this crowd, but after a while it gets annoying. . . Now to the food; everything sounds so darn delicious on the menu and by golly you know what? IT IS!!! (oops, caps lock). I always want to try something new, like the Pho, but I end up getting Shaking Beef or the Tofu plate, forgot what it was called....Shaking Tofu? Mmm...The Tofu's the best tofu I've had, but then again, I haven't had much tofu...foo'. Their broken rice goes well with every plate it's served with, so don't miss out on their rice.. . The wait can suck sometimes, but it's usually worth it. There's a wine store across the street you can hang out at while you wait to be called, just don't get hit by a car crossing the street. Gingergrass will actually call the wine store or your cell to let you know that you're up. . . This is definitely one of those restaurants you'll have a random craving for because of its unique taste. See you soon gingergrass -_-
