Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
The Pick Me Up and I have had a pretty rocky relationship.  . It all started sometime in 1997, when I was convinced to meet up there with a friend for coffee.  I sort of avoided the place up to that point, because I was too punk rock and I assumed it would be full of douche bags and alterna-rock idiots living up the 90's coffee house culture.  . I was won over by the four berry shake and french toast.  They lost me with their old fries, which were soggy and consistently undercooked.. I was a loyal fan of the Pick Me Up for a few years until they started to gradually raise the prices out of my college kid budget.  Since I wasn't living off of my parent's dime at the time, I had to stop going there.. After college, I started going there again, but we had to break up, because the quality of food in relation to the price took a bit of a nose dive.  . I was convinced a few years later to give the place another chance and as luck would have it, there were a lot of improvements.  Better fries, the old French toast was back and now they have a liquor license. . Most of the wait staff is really good, but occasionally, you'll get a pretty horrible waiter/waitress .  Fortunately, the really bad wait staff doesn't last long.   . Next time you go, order a four berry shake with chocolate ice cream.  It's excellent.
