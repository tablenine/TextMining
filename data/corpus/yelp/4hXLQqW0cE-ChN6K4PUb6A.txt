What can I say? Probably the worst lunch meal I've had in a really long time. I ordered the split pea soup and the pulled pork burrito. Split pea soup didn't taste like split pea, the burrito was not edible. I can only assume that Bin Cafe is trying to go for the "cutesy" tactic of making food taste like other food, not my style, as I insist on my split pea soup tasting like peas, but the outcome of their approach is a complete failure. The only good thing I can say about the food is that it's priced well. . The drinks are alright, however, they are not cheap and for the price they are not spectacular.. The service is spotty at best. We had our bloody mary glasses sitting empty for a long time until the waitress was kind of enough to consider asking us if we would like a second round.
