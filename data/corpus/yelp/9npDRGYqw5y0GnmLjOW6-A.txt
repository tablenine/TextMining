So me and my P.I.C. decided to go on a day trip up to LA. I saw this place on tv and we decided to check it out. WOW! Sawdust on the floor, very interesting choice of decor on the walls. The place is over a hundred years old so hey can't complain to much about it. We ordered the Lamb sandwich, Beef sandwich, Pickled Egg, Potato Salad, Tortilla Soup, and the Beef Stew. All I can really say was it was OK. Not something I would crave and drive up to LA to have but hey it was worth the experience. Some 'regulars' told us to check out the upstairs area, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. It's just like classrooms but you can sit and eat your food there. Nothing to spectacular. It was OK, if you want to check it out do so...not something I would say is a must.
