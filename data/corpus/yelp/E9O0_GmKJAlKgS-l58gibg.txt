Restaurant: Loca Luna
Category: Tapas Bars
Loca Luna is one of my favorite places.  I go when I'm in the mood to drink but also have conversation.  I've helped friends celebrate here several times.  I also like the music but, it can get really loud, which hinders the previously mentioned conversation.  I moved from Midtown a year ago and haven't found myself here since.  When I used to live in walking distance, I made the trek several times. Basically, drinks are good, people are friendly, and the tapas are great.
