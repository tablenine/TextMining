Okay. You guys know how a wolf even with a life threatening injury will continue eating/sating its appetite because the pleasure of the chomp overrides the life-threatening pain (or something like that)?. Whateva!. Point is, I left Foodlife with the biggest belly ache ever! I could not stop eating. I was surrounded by yumminess, defeated by the delectable, a slave to the sumptuous. Foodlife nearly killed me and I cannot wait to go back!. Suggestions: brisket, sweet potato spears, and a crepe w fresh strawberries and organic vanilla bean creme.
