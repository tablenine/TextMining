It is one of those places you go to cause you need to try it.. . It is pretty cheap, really cheap for certain items like coffee and lemonade.  Food is ok, and that is why I gave it three stars.  Will be honest and say I don't like their french dip even if it is suppose to be that way.  I thought the bread got all soggy and was pretty gross by the time I was done which from looking at these other reviews is the way it is suppose to be.  If I could dip it in the an jus (sp?) instead of it just coming wet would have solved that for me - maybe there is this option and I am just ignorant.  Then I will take down my review if this is true - just message me.  . . Some other comments.  They have a parking lot.  Place is huge.  Before coming, I expected a stand.  But nope, it is huge.. . I had banana cream pie and true to the name of the thing, it was just slices of banana in cream.  Not the pudding like substance I was use to with cream on top, but straight cream.  Not good.  . . I can already see this review getting railed on, but oh well - the protection of the internet.
