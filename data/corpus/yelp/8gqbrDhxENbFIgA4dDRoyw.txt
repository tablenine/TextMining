I have never tried Vietnamese food before so I was very anxious to try this place out.  We went there on a Tuesday and this place was packed.  I was not expecting this big of a crowd this early in the week.  Up-on seeing this I knew I was in store for a damn good meal and i was right.. . I ordered the #182 which was the beef and broccoli. I got huge portion of food for cheap ($8.95).  It was very tasty! I was also able to sample the #47 which was a soup that I forgot the name. That was really good too.  I thought the ginger flavor in the broth was very unique.. . The service was good and the ambiance was nothing to write home about.  Actually my only complaint was that the chairs were not all that comfy.
