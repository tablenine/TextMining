Second visit, same as the first! Went here tonight with my homegirl, 'cos I was craving sushi. On my tiny budget, I CAN crave sushi here! BYOB we love - champagne with sushi - and a couple of combos split between two people is enough food. I really need to come back here to try their Thai stuff, but I'm stuck on the sushi. And the fabulous cute waitresses who are on their game and great, attentive and wonderful. If you're on the fence about this place - yallah - try it for a casual dinner and come back for MORE! . . Only caveat I might mention is order Maki rolls instead of plain sushi pieces - the plain sushi pieces are a bit boring, but the maki combinations are OH YES DARLING, delicious.. . Really a gem. And did I mention BYOB? I thought I did.
