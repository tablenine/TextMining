Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
After wanting to try this place for a very long time last night I finally got my wish and I'm hear to report it was WAYYY over rated or I caught then on an off night. The service was pretty good but the waffle was soggy and really sweet, mac and cheese was bland and the chicken breast had bones in it! WTF chicken breast are not suppose to have bones. Needless to say I found myself daydreaming about my fav chicken and waffle spot back home in my honest opinion they're giving Roscoe's Â a run for their money for sure. Me no likey Roesoe's its back to the bay for me Angie your still the best!
