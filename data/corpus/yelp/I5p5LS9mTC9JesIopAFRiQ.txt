Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
After newly moving to the Los Angeles area we were asking friends about where to get some great mexican food. The consensus seemed to be GO TO TITOS!. So of course trusting our friends, we did. And oh boy how did we regret that decision... . . When we first pulled up and parked I had a feeling of uneasiness. It looked dirty. I am all for the little taquerias that have an authentic feel but this was just gross. . . We look at the menu, which is extremely minimalistic. That should be a good sign as you would expect with so few items they should be really good at execution and taste. Hmmm, not so here.. . There were so many beans and a disgusting glop of cheese in a tortilla. We asked for sour cream to be added and were told they don't have sour cream. Um ok, WTF?, Then we asked for guac to be put on. They told us we would have to buy a side for like $3. And they wouldn't even put it in the burrito. . . Needless to say, neither one of us finished and while we were eating I kept thinking how Taco Bell actually makes a better burrito. . The only reason this place stays in business is that they have this "hype" built up about them and I think people are so scared of their own images here in LA that they just go along with anything if someone says its cool. . . Save your money and your tastebuds and Â try somewhere like La Cueva in Redondo. Much better burritos. . . Oh ya and cash only, as in a complete waste of cash.
