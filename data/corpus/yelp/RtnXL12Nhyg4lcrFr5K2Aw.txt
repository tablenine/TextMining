Restaurant: Pho #1
Category: Vietnamese
Great food served quickly in an unbeatably unique and casual atmosphere for a ridiculously cheap price - what more is there? Well, there's Nickelodeon playing on the big screen as the restauranteurs' children watch on in captivation. If you're looking for a formal dining experience, look elsewhere. Pho #1 pretends to be nothing other than what it is, and it delivers supremely. I had the P19 - Pho with Beef Brisket and it was a high-sodium party in my mouth.
