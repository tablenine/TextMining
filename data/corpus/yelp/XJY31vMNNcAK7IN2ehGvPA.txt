OMG! SO FRICKEN GOOD.. The line is SOOOOOOOO long that it drives me nuts, it out the door! I got up to order, they have these cool ass shirts, looove it. I wanted to get one but only saw it in kids size, so therefore not for me. I got the oinkster pastrami, MMMM.. and the bbq pork but it isn't my style! I had piggy fries it reminded me of in-n-out but BETTER. I loved their ube shake! too bad I can't go back for a loooooooooooooong time :[ but while we were at Oinkster we were texting people that they gotta try this place! haha. park on the street, or in their lot, they have outdoor and in door tables. Beer &amp; wine. Do the combo. Go for happy hour! Service was great, the guy who took my order was fun! First time there so I didn't have the garlic aioli, I didn't know how it worked. :[ must try next time! I would come here again, but not a weekend because its packed, like sardines &amp; of course it gets hot! it's a must! But I don't think its really a tourist atttttraction!
