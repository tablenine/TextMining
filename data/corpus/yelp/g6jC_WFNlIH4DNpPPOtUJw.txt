Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The Good: The service is quite friendly and I like the busy environment when I am slurping some noodles.  They also have a spice level for the ramen and a creative "Wall of Bravery" for those who finish the spiciest ramen in under 30 minutes.  I got to see the soup because the girl next to me ordered it; it's blood red with jalapenos floating around.  B.T.S.. . The Bad: The ramen was just okay for me.  The soup base can also be very salty for some people.  The prices are higher than what I usually pay for ramen and the extras. . . Try: here.  You won't hate it, but you won't love it either.  There are plenty of better ramen places around, some of then even in food courts in Japanese markets.. . Don't Try: the special 2 unless you think you can absolutely do it.  You have to pay a little extra for the ultimate spicy soup, but if you do finish it, including all the soup, your picture will be taken and displayed on their wall.  But if you can't handle spicy food, it's pure suicide.
