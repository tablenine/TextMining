Have eaten hear several times because it's close to my house... but it's just "eh." The veggie burger tastes like it was just dumped out of a box, cooked for 20 seconds, and slapped into a bun. The cheese fries are absolutely drenched in a rather plasticy-tasting cheese sauce. The fried mushrooms were actually quite bad... tasted sour. . . Plus, slow, slow service for a "fast food" establishment. Not to mention, a bit pricey.. . In short, it's okay if ya got no other options..
