Restaurant: Seasons 52
Category: American (New)
I worked for Darden Restaurants in Orlando FL, where their home office is, so I went to the first test restaurant of Seasons 52. It was always good, but its important to remember that "fresh seasonal" is a concept that the corporate people who also created Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Bahama Breeze came up with. I think they do a better job of preparing their food at Seasons 52, but a lot of the ingredients are the same bulk order shipped to their other concepts.
