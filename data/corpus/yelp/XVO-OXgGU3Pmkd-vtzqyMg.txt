Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
Duck Walk and I go wayyy back. I've been eating  here for about four years and everytime I've gone there it's been a treat.. . I usually get the cashew chicken and crab rangoon. Both superior to ones I've had other Thai restaurants. . I only have two complaints. Sometimes they try to rush you out when it's  busy, and the bathroom is in a really awkward place. The bathroom door is usually surrounded by random men that I'm assuming work there?? Talk about stage fright.
