I think I like this place slightly more than Fogo because I found the meats more flavorful.  The ambience of this place is so much better too! It looks so nice and sleek inside...a nice place to bring a date.  I wish they continued those buy one dinner get the second half off coupons but I haven't seen those in a long time.
