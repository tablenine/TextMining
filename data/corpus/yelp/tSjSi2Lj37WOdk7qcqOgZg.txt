Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
"Irasshaimase!  Irasshaimase!" A loud welcome is what you'll get from the waitresses/waiters/chefs as you walk into the restaurant.. . yes yes, I have arrived at Shin Sen Gumi once again... thanks for greeting me at the door. =). This place is by far my favorite Ramen lunch spot, there is no other like it, unless you're going their other location in OC of course.  . The reason I say lunch is because of their specials, they run 7 days a week, unlike your typical Asian restaurants which only does weekdays!. The best value for your buck would be the Ramen plus Gyozas for $7.25 or Ramen plus Musubi (spam sushi) for $7.75, it'll definitely fill you up.  If it doesn't, you can always order extra Ramen for $0.95 more!  However, if you get extra Ramen, remember to pace yourself with the soup, because you don't get extra soup with the extra ramen.  Not sure if you can, might have to pay more if you want more soup... hmm, something to ask the next time I'm there.. . For someone that's never been to Shin Sen Gumi, it's best to get everything in "regular" option, such as regular amount of oil, medium soup base, and medium firmness of noodles.  Try them, you'll love it!. . Arigato Gozaimasu!  Arigato Gozaimasu!. . note: to the Japanese speakers, I must apologize if I don't have "welcome" or "thank you" written down accurately, I found it on a free dictionary on the web ;)
