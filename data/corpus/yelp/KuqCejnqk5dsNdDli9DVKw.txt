The food was good, the prices were high. . . When I asked my fiance what his favorite part about the meal was, he pointed at the basket of seasoned, crispy, thin-cut fries, and I agreed. The sandwiches were okay, but I was kind of disappointed, mostly because of the high price point. . . I do like the interior more than Urban Belly, though the big communal table in the middle was empty while all the smaller tables around the perimeter were full. I get that they want to encourage communal eating, but listen to what your customers want!. . I had the bulgogi sandwich (pretty good, but the flavors were pretty ordinary and nothing stood out), the chicken lemongrass sandwich (this was underwhelming with smallish chunks of chicken that contained quite a few pieces of gristle). The seasoned fries with the curry dipping sauce were really good, though, and you do get a lot of them. We also shared a yuzu lemonade that was perfect to share and very tasty. . . I might stop in again if I'm in the area, but I'm not in a hurry to spend my money here when I can get a great sandwich for a lot less in many other spots around the area. Lower those prices, and I'll be back.
