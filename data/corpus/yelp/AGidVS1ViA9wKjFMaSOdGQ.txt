I can't believe it's taken so long for me to review May Street Market. My mom and step-dad took me here for my birthday (nearly a year ago now), but I think it's a good sign that I still remember it as being an excellent dining experience! Our server was great and so was the food. I will definitely be back as soon as possible!
