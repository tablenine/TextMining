Oh poo to those complaining about this place. I think a lot of unfortunate reviews come from bad weekend service (though I could be wrong). It's all about the weekdays people! I enjoyed everything from my coffee to my crumb cake french toast with a side of turkey sausage. Service was splendid and all was enjoyable. Minus one star for the wobbly table and for being placed at a very small table for 3 people. Otherwise, waitress was prompt, food was good, and dogs walked by (I love dogs). . . Also, I got over the fact that most restaurants I saw in LA/Hollywood that have outdoor seating are always overly close to the street (props to Alcove and Grub for having pretty outdoor seating and avoiding the trend).
