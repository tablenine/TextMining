Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
3.5 for food, rounded up to 4 for quick service. I'm not a big burger eater to begin with but the concept of umami was intriguing enough to join 6 other people and wait outside on a cold LA night for 40 minutes.  The restaurant is SMALL but it doesn't take people long to finish off the smallish burger and serving of fries.  . Most of got the Umami as described so often before.  I like my burgers a little more pink than red but surprisingly the meat tasted great with a nice outer char.  The flavors of the parmesan crisp, mushrooms, onions were delicious.  My only complaint was the super soggy bun that didn't hold up too well after a few bites.  . . Sides: onion rings were amazing so I heard.  Sweet pot fries were eh.  Thin cut good.  . Desserts: cake monkey ho ho was teensy tiny.  Root beer float looked good.  . Summary: Not sure if it's worth $13 for this meal but I'm glad I tried it once.
