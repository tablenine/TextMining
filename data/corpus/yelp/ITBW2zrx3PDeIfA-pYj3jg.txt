Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Gourmet-style food at fair prices. I ordered the french toast orgy and paid $10. It came with 3 pieces, thick and fluffy, stuffed with my choice of chocolate-strawberry or mascrapone cheese. Mix both to complete your order if you like. Then it's covered with oatmeal and topped with fresh fruit. I thought it was a great deal, even enough for two.. . It is a small restaurant and the wait is long. You wouldn't trust a skinny cook or an empty restaurant, so don't complain about the wait. If you appreciate great food like I do, and taste every bite, you'll be happy after waiting for your chance to dig in. There's a starbucks 40 yards away to wait at.. . Don't miss your quote, it will make the wait even longer.
