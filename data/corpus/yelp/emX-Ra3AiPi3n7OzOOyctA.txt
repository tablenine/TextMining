PROS:  . - Superb beer selection . - They're known to have arguably the best burger in town . - Sweet potato fries (which I don't normally like). - Good vibe/energy/crowd. . CONS: . - No servers.  You gotta order at the crowded ass bar.. - Tables are first come, first serve. - They don't serve ketchup and you're just not supp to ask for it. . Btw, the big door guy who checks your I.D. @ the SM location has this bizarre fetish with big hoop earrings.  So be sure to rock your hoops if you wanna get in quicker.
