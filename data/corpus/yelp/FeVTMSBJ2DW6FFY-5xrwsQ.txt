Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I get the hype - it's sushi in Hollywood and it has to be super fancy. I even saw a Geisha there which was slightly surprising since most restaurants don't live up to the name in terms of characters.. . But man the sushi was delicious! Not traditional by any means, but spicy, salty, and seasoned. What was most important to me was that the sushi tasted fresh (not like it had been frozen for a few weeks in the back) and the sashimi we had stood up to that. We had 2 salmon, 2 tuna and 1 yellow tail.. . I also had the Geisha Tear for a drink (which was basically a pear martini) and very delicious but super strong. Definitely kept one drink the whole night.. . I went with a table of 8. We ended up ordering about 3 appetizers, 5 drinks, 2 miso, 1 rice, 1 edamame, and 8 rolls, and the total was $375. Definitely pricey but if you're going out for a birthday its worth the extra cash.. . We also gave up on parking and used valet, which on a busy Saturday was raised from $8 to $10.. . Service was good, sushi was delicious (yet expensive) and the decor was midly impressive. I'd go back for a special occasion.
