who do these people think they are?  the sub 51 routine is a bunch of bs.  the space is okay, but i wasn't happy waiting in line forever.  my buddy ended up bribing the bouncer so we could get in earlier..... . on the other hand, i ordered an old fashioned (a la don draper).  bartender put a bit of soda water in there.  my buddy told him not to put any soda in there, so he went ahead and remade the drink.  i appreciated that.  it wasn't a bad old fashioned either.  i expected less from a psuedo-swanky basement bar.  . . i should mention that the space is so small that my friend accidentally knocked this girl's drink out of her hand and it shattered on the floor.  apparently it cut this other girl's foot.  blood was everywhere.  so that's an illustration of how small this sub 51 space is....................watch yourself (and your drink). . also, if you smoke cigarettes be prepared to get bombarded by homeless people trying to sing to you and beg for money.
