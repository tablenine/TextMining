Went out with a couple of my girlfriends for a birthday dinner here.  They're quite busy in the evenings around dinner time and I can understand, their seafood is outstanding!  We ordered the king crab legs and one dungeness crab to share and they were AMAZING!!  We got medium spicy which can give your lips the feeling that they're on fire, but if you're into hot stuff give a try.  Their season fries and sweet potato fries are excellent too and a great pairing with the cajun seasoning from the seafood.  The sauce that they cook the seafood in is to die for, you most definitely have to dip the crab meat in the sauce---- not cause the crab by itself is plain but the sauce is just that good.  We also got some corn on the cob but I would probably recommend to skip that because it's nothing out of the ordinary even with the cajun sauce.  . . The ambiance is quite cute.  With netting all around you do feel like you're near the sea.  The tables are quite small so don't plan on bringing a large group, plus the waiting could get quite long with a bigger crowd.  Be sure to arrive early or go really late if you want to avoid lines.  . . It gets to be pretty pricey if you're ordering crab or lobster.  If you want to go for cheaper you'd have to order the shrimp or crawfish but of course those have less meat and are harder to peel... We only ate crab and it came out to be around $20-25 per person.  I think it's worth it, it's not like you're gonna go there everyday anyhow.  . . Can't wait to go back!
