No nonsense, no-frills, holy-frickin-cow-it's-good Cuban food. . . I went here with two friends late on a Weds night, so it wasn't trouble to get a table and look at the cute waiters (and some cute patrons, too!). . The oxtail stew is AWESOME, and my friend Jeff always loves (and raves about) the garlic chicken.  The garlic bread they serve is too greasy, but the sangria is damn good.  The fried plantains are nice, but there's too much rice served with everything (I don't love rice, so it's probably just my stupid bias).. . I still say "Go!"
