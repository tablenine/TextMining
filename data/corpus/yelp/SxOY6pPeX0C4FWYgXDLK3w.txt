Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I actually give this 3.5 stars. If you are into the whole gourmet burger thing, this is for you. They have a good variety of burgers, some with goat cheese as well. The burger is small, but a good size for me because I have a small appetite. I think for me, I could only go there once in a great while, because of the price and just because I don't think it's something that I would crave that often. . . When I want a burger, Hamburger Habit often satisfies my craving because it's a good old fashioned burger. Umami is good, still keeps the greasiness of a regular burger, but doesn't quite satisfy my burger craving because, well, it doesn't taste like an old fashioned burger. It's more gourmet and is pretty rich, and definitely tastes different. I give them props for creating a taste that I've never had before, that's for sure! I wish the fry portion was bigger though, they were fat fries, but about 8-9 in the entire serving!. . Sorry if this is vague, I'm having a hard time describing this place, haha! I think what it comes down to is, if I want my burger craving, I go to Tommy's/Hamburger Habit, etc. I don't think I'll go here that often only because I'm not really gonna crave it that often.
