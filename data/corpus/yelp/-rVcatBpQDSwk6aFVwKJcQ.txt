Restaurant: Fiddlehead Cafe
Category: American (New)
My wife and I decided to try Fiddlehead Cafe when we wandered upon it this weekend.. . It was late afternoon, so the place wasn't crowded and the waitstaff was very attentive. We tried a red and white wine flight and a cheese flight. All were great choices. We then shared the Smoky Chicken Salad Sandwich with fries and the food was terrific.. . With the comfortable decor (and no distracting TV), the good music choices, the open windows, and great food and wine, my wife summed it up best: "This is the kind of place we'd want to find if we went on vacation somewhere.". . We had a great experience at Fiddlehead and will definitely return with friends.
