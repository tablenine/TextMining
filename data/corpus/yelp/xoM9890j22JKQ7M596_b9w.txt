The workers here literally treat you as if you were their own kids. . . When I poured a grip load of sugar water into my iced tea (I know...very unhealthy!!!!!!), the lady smacked my hands softly and said (in chinese, of course), "Too much sugar is no good for you!"....lol Another incident was when I was eating the shrimp rolls (which, btw is delicious) and decided I couldn't finish the last piece left, one server said (again, in chinese), "c'mon . just 1 more.  you can finish it". lol hahaha. . Okay nm what I just said - that really has nothing to do with my rating but I just thought it was pretty cute that they see you as their kids.. . I've only eaten the hainam chicken (dark meat please), pastas, and shrimp rolls here. NO COMPLAINTS WHATSOEVER.  Oh, their chili sauce is bomb! haha... . Seating is not horrid but if you come during lunchtime--- well duh...you're going to have to wait awhile. If you notice there is a long line though, I suggest you stand next to idiots who are done eating but decide to sit around chitchatting (inconsiderate bastards) and make them uncomfortable enough to leave. Yea, it's rude but what they're doing is worst!!! haha. . What else can I add...the workers here are super nice?  =)
