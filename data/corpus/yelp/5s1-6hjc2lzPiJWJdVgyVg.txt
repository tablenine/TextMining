I love the HaiNan Chicken there! . This is a little nice cozy restaurant with heartwarming decorations and services. The waitress is always there adding more water or sauces for you. . They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but it's always very crowded since it is one of the most famous restaurant in Alhambra. Expect to wait for at least 15-20 min if you are coming for food during "rush hours". . The street parking is a little tight, but you can always find a spot at nearby neighborhood.
