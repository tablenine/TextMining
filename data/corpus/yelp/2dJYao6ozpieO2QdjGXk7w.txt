Came here hoping to have a nice healthy, refreshing sort of meal. Left feeling heavy and well, unrefreshed. . . UMS. : Lamb cheek and polenta - savory, fatty, but everything on the plate from the lamb to the heavy polenta to the side salade - all seemed too salty. It was odd. Glad I had a Hibiscus iced tea to wash it down with. . . Going down the line, though, other people's meals looked really good, so i will be back again for a hopefully more enjoyable experience.
