Why 4 stars--because it was hard for me to give five for a gyro but it is close.. . Hey Al, your the hottest on Yelp....congrats.. . But at last my dreams are over-I have findly found a Lamb Gyro in the Atl that I can say is better or as good as what I have tried anywhere.. . The owner(AL) is great which pushes this review to 4.5 stars. They lost half a star and a round down just on the A-kebab being ok.. . But wait... this place has to be the go to for anyone out after 1pm on a fri-sat night in the ever condo-hotel dining Buckhead. I have the great advantage of my girlfriend being a chef at a local hot spot in the area and my to -go gyro is now a regular staple for my late nite chef dinner. . . Can you believe I worked in this area for years and did not find out about this Med Food Find until Yelp users steered me in the direction. Thank You Yelp and I have to say that this is one of the best examples of what the ATL needs--small affordable dining- that is what makes great food cities so great.
