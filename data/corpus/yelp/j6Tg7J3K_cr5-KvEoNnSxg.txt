Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
If you've never been to Fogo de Chao, make reservations today, and GO! . . This is my second time visiting a Fogo de Chao. I am always amazed at the quality of both the service and the food. In a word: WOW! . . Started with the salad bar, which offers the most wonderful smoked salmon I've ever had. The salad was great, but I wanted to save room. . . Next, the staff bring to your table a small dish of mashed potatoes, sweet bananas, and a basket of cheese rolls.  They are all terrific! . . Then comes the meats. . . The gauchos bring by a huge selection of cooked meats for you to enjoy. On this particular evening, I had chicken, sausage, lamb, pork, and seven (7) different kinds of steak. Bacon wrapped fillet mignon...WOOHOO! . . Try your best to save room for dessert.  You know what? Even if you don't have any room left, order it anyway. . . We had the creme broulet with strawberries and whipped cream, as well as their tres leches cake. The cake is fantastic...the best rendition of tres leches I've ever had. . . The service at Fogo de Chao is amazing. All the waitstaff work together to efficiently and professionally keep the customers happy. Look at all the reviews for this place, most are 4 and 5 star for a reason...it's simply wonderful! . . Some hot tips: . 1.) If you need to use the restroom, plan ahead. There are only 2 stalls in the men's room for a restaurant that must hold 500 patrons. . 2.) All parking is valet (7 dollars). If you don't have cash, let your waiter know, and they'll add it to your tab so that when you pay via credit card, they can give you cash back. . 3.) Make reservations!  At 8:30 PM, because the lobby had at least 30 people waiting for a table, plus 10 others waiting in the bar area. When we left at 10 PM, there were over 150 people waiting for a table. . . Enjoy!
