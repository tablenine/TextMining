Restaurant: Verde Taqueria
Category: Mexican
Verde Taqueria officially opens today (4/27/09), but I attended a soft opening yesterday to help workout the kitchen. . . In the interest of disclosure, I know one of the owners, but I'm writing to help get the word about because I think they show great promise and their restaurants meets a specific need in the Brookhaven area. . . It's a very cool space, clean interior, slick looking decorative concrete floors, nice booths, both a front and a rear patio (maybe 4-5 tables on each), and a decent sized bar right when you walk-in. I would say the feel is somewhat like taqueria - not the same look, but the similar food, though Verde has more of a hangout feel. There are plenty of flat screen TV's, and Verde is somewhere I could see myself going to catch a football game, eat some tacos, and drink some margaritas. . . Being their first day of service, they were obvious kinks they're working out, but I think the food was showing well. They have kept the menu simple - mostly tacos, a few salads, a quesadilla, etc, but there are at least 10 tacos with a few progressive choices such as short rib, buffalo chicken, buffalo tofu, etc. . . I'm not going to write too much on my thoughts on the food, as I don't want to do you or them a disservice by rating food served on the soft opening while they're working out the kitchen, but suffice it to say, I plan on going back. . . Be sure to hit up the Verde patio for a margarita while the weather is still great (read: not 110 degrees outside) in Atlanta.
