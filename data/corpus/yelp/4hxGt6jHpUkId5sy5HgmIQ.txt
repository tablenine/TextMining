Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (New)
Houston's is one of the only chain restaurants that I visit frequently, and for good reason. The food is consistently outstanding, and they do many things exceedingly well. Every time I come here I am stumped as to what to order since I have so many favorites on the menu - the veggie burgers, the regular hamburgers, fresh grilled fish, filet mignon, the spinach/artichoke dip, their amazing french fries, sushi... (that is pretty much their whole menu right there!) It's pretty much always packed to capacity here, but thanks to their big, comfy booths it feels cozy and private - perfect for a leisurely dinner with good conversation and a great glass of wine.
