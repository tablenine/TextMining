Delicious brunch!  I highly recommend the smoked salmon potato tart.  The service was excellent and my girlfriedns were all very pleased with their dishes  -- both sweet and savory.  My only complaint is that the drinks are a little expensive, but otherwise the menu is priced well.  I also appreciated the lack of a wait for a table on a Saturday morning -- not always the case at good brunch spots.
