I went here for the first time last Sunday. At 1pm the line was out the door, which is fine for me, because I'm terribly indecisive and needed that time to read every single item on the menu. Twice. . . We ordered at the counter &amp; they brought it out really quickly, especially considering how packed the place was. Some items on the menu were a little overpriced, but he food was amazing. I ordered the Turkey Hummus Melt (seriously flavorful sliced turkey, hummus, basil, and melted jack cheese of dill potato bread) -- so bomb. Lunch Date got the steak salad, which was also really good; the steak was cooked perfectly. I would def come back here to try something off the breakfast menu.
