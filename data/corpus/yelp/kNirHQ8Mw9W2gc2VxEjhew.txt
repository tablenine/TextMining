I love Moody's. I'm not quite sure what I love more...the beer garden or the food. The beer garden makes you feel like you aren't on a busy street in Chicago. Actually the inside is pretty cozy I just have a thing of not being able to see what I'm eating. Service sucks a big one but the food is pretty good and greasy. The Sangria could use some serious help as it tastes like watery kool-aid but no matter what Moody's has me as a loyal customer.
