Five stars for the best damn bakery in LA.  Something I always notice when we go here is that everyone in line is really happy.  You just get this really good feeling seeing the literally hundreds of offerings in the long cases.  You know you're in for something good when you're waiting in line.  I personally love the crumb cake, the cheese and pineapple danish, and the almond croissants.  I've never had anything here that was less than delicious.. . Also know that the parking lot is a little crazy during peak times.  Give yourself some time to find a space and just relax.  It's totally worth it.
