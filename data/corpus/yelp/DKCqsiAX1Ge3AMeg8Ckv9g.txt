Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Ford's is fairly good but I prefer Beacon just down the street because the food is more consistent and the prices are more reasonable. However, Ford's has a bigger (and usually crowded) bar so I guess that is a plus for some people. I've had some great soups at Ford's and I was underwhelmed by their salads. The flatbreads/pizzas are usually tasty but a bit expensive for an appetizer. Short ribs are great and the steaks look good but they have run out of the bone-in version the last few times I have been so I haven't tasted one yet. Seafood dishes are mostly good and deserts are fantastic; if you still have room left after the large dinner portions. The wait service can be spotty but the bartenders are pretty cool.. . Update 3/10/2007 - . I met a friend at Ford's for lunch the other day and we both had the Pub Burger which was very good. Much better even than it looked and the onion rings were also tasty but a bit cold. Service was competent this time and we sat outside on the patio so I didn't even see Jack Osbourne, who my friend said was enjoying his lunch inside.
