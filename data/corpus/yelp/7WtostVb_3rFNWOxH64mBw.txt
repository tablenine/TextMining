When I first walked in, I was lured to the gleaming dessert cases, then the prepared foods.  Wow, then look at the kitchen.  Pretty cool!  I really liked the space - stark white walls, black banquettes, and gold accents.  But it is a bit loud because the place is so big and cavernous.. . Anyway, two of our friends live downtown, and the host (Michael?) was very accommodating in getting us a table.  Apparently, they are keen on having 'locals' frequent the place.  So we sat and ordered drinks, and were served complimentary sparkling water pretty much constantly the whole time we were there.  . . For food, my friends ordered a pizza, clams and mussels, a chicken dish, and some other small plates and seemed to enjoy them a lot.  We ordered the meatballs marinara (recommended by Michael) and the stuffed artichoke to start.  The meatballs were really good - fresh, tangy marinara (slightly chunky) and the meatballs themselves seemed barbecued - they had a great crust.  Then we had a caesar salad, which was ok.  I like more anchovy in my dressing.  The cheese they topped it with was great though.  Also had the ravioli, which was with a carbonara-type sauce.  Yum.. . Wrapped up the meal with coffees and my friend got pineapple sorbet, which I got to try.  Nice meal closer.  All in all a great experience - good food and attentive service.  I am jealous of my friends who live three blocks away!
