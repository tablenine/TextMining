A friend and I came here for a late night dinner the other night and I must say I was pretty pleased with the way the night turned out.. . We came in around 1:30am and were seated right away back in the open room beside the bar area. There was a band playing so it was pretty loud, but the bar closed shortly after and we could finally hear each other talking.. . Our waitress was very friendly and came over right away to take our drink orders. They have pretty much any drink you want, including a full bar until 2am, but i decided to settle with a simple coke. Never being here I had a very hard time deciding what to get off of their humongous menu, until I got a recommendation from our waitress to try the Monte Cristo, which I took her up on. My friend got a Reuben as thats what she was craving and what lead us to Canters in the first place.. . We decided to do a little splitsies and trade half our sandwiches, and I have to say I'm very glad I did. The Monte Cristo was awesome and I think I'll need to start getting it more often at other places. The Reuben was very good as well and the sauerkraut was prefect. The Reuben came with steak fries and we got a side of ranch for it on the side by request. Now I wouldnt come here if your looking for one of those tasty and cheap diners as both our meals were upwards of $14, but they do give you a pretty hearty portion of meat, and the food was pretty delicious. . . I would definitely recommend it to try as your next late night diner experience if you have yet to go, and I myself will definitely be going back for more once my pockets are deep enough!
