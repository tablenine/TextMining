so i came with great expectations of the chicken wings. they were really good, but maybe i was expecting too much, but they were delicious. i think i liked the teba soboro (ground chicken rice bowl) more. i really like their ponzu sauce too. my bf loves yudofu, so we ordered it, it was ok, not my favorite though. we also had the agedashi tofu (okay~) grilled cod soaked in sake i think...(too sake-ish) and ume onigiri (ume rice ball...is ume rice ball) . but i really liked the kirin and sapporo on tap. . maybe we just ordered alot of plain things, but i like the atmosphere and will definitely be back.
