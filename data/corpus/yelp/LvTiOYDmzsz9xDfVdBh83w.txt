Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
Real. Chow. Baby.. . Well, the first two are true, I can testify the place does actually exist and they serve chow.  I saw no children though. And I certainly didn't hear them because the place was deafeningly loud... honestly, sound treatment isn't that expensive and it greatly enhances the dining experience to hear what the person sitting across from you is actually saying.. . The food?  Well, it's DIY Mongolian BBQ, which I really have never cared for. One's natural tendency is to load up with all your favorite veggies, meat and spices, usually resulting in an uncoordinated mess.  Some guidance would be greatly appreciated... 'recipes' if you will.. . The actual mess creation is a little complicated - black bowl for veggies and sauce, smaller red bowl for meats and seafood, and various colored swizzle sticks for upgrades like a shrimp skewer or roti.  I was afraid I would commit some Chow Baby faux-pas, resulting in my order being sent back as uncookable.  The portions are what you make them, and for another buck you can refill your bowl as many times as you like... a guaranteed formula for success in Georgia.  Service was corporately nice, pices are reasonable, and you won't go away empty at least., just a little unsure about what you actually ate...
