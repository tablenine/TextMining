Oh man this place is FRIGGIN BOMB. So my friend and I came to Little Tokyo HUNGRY as bears, and we were looking for a good place to eat. We looked up a couple of places on Yelp to try, our first option was San Sai but alas on a Saturday night at 11:20 PM they were out of stock. One of the workers there came out and profusely appologized about it and said come back tomorrow, they should be restocked then. . . We then started walking down the street and noticed this place, and decided it might be one of the places we'd try. We also saw Mr. Ramen (dont go there, the vibe is whack and the waitresses are TERRIBLE). We then decided to try Mr. Ramen first... and so much happened there... so much disappointment. So we left and paid for our unsatisfactory foods and still had empty stomachs. . . My friend and I contemptplated what we should do next since we were both still REALLY hungry and we came across this place. Decided to try it and oh man, it was money well spent. My friend had the LARGE Ramen bowl... it was ginourmous! Then I had the Ramen bowl + Shredded Pork bowl combo and my god, it was to die for. The ramen was great, wasn't too salty, well flavored, nice texture... the noodles were so friggin good. The pork was like amazing! It was so tender, I wouldn't have thought it was pork! Their rice bowls were like, on par with the ramen cause even though I was full I wanted MORE!. . So in all, if you want DELICIOUS Japanese food, thats filling, tastey, and a whole bunch of other adjectives GO HERE.. . Go here with friends
