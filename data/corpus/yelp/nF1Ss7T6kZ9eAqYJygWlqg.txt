this place is pretty cute, and it is pretty damn awesome if you are looking for non-dairy "ice cream" .. a total hole in the wall, not a lot of seats, not a crazy amount of options on the menu - we tried a few things, all were good - all were not cheap. does ice cream have to cost this much in nyc? worth checking out if you are a vegan looking for dessert on the lower east side - and a short walk from dirt candy.
