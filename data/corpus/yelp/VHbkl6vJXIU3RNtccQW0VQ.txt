Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Price Worthy although surprising enough it is as inexpensive as a good meal at your local small mom and pops diner.  Selling Greek and Arabian food, you can indulge yourselves with many different dishes, wines, beers, and pastries.   To either dine in, with a very humble setting, or just to drop by and get something cooked to go, or from the market to make your own creations at home.   . . Find it on the north east corner of Normandie and Pico in Los Angeles. . . and try the lamb!
