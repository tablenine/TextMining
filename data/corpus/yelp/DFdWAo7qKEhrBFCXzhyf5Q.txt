Restaurant: Bakeshop

I've been to Bakeshop twice and was really distrubed on my second visit when I noticed the BAD HEALTH GRADE on the way out--80 B. I am really sorry, but this is a DEAL BREAKER!! (It's not me, it's you). You were good on paper, Bakeshop, with that Concentrics pedigree, good location, and some good initial PR, but you lost me with the strange dining rules (no sandwiches after 3:00, only quiche &amp; pastries) I settled for the quiche Lorraine, it was served from the "warmer" cold 5 minutes after ordering (it was a bit better when cashier warmed it up the second time). It also looks strange having the storeroom in the dining area (bags of flour and cases of Dasani along the wall). The hazlenut pasty was ok, but the carrot cake in the jar was 80% frosting, 20% cake.
