I figured I would give them a chance since yet again the same friend loves them and wanted to go there again. Extra star because the Mimosa with apple and cranberry juice was unique and delicious. I had two of them!!! . Cheese fries were awesome!!! . Here is my problem the corn beef I ordered yet again was dry as hell, and full of fat. On the menu they advertise that its just like Carnegie Deli in NY and just as good. Me thinks not!!! It was half the size and dry that's sandwich was nothing like CD. . I did order some Junior's Cheesecake to go which is always a treat. . I think I will stick to the cheese fries and mimosa's if I do go back again. . . PS. the waiters are really really cute!!!
