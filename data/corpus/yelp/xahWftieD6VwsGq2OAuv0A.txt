Again, what can I say....THE BEST SUSHI IN ATLANTA!!!. . I stopped by yesterday (Tuesdays are Neighborhood Night if you want to hang with the locals) to meet up with friends and ordered up my favorites...The Pink Lady and Bubble Gum.  Also tried a new roll called the Candy Box which was pretty good!. . The owner and staff are always friendly and amazing!  Definitely Castleberry Hills own modern day version of Cheers...where everybody really does know your name!
