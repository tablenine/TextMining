Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
I think I have pretty much tried everything on their menu at least twice.  The selection on the menu might be small but everything on the menu is done well and the food is at a very reasonable price for fresh cook seafood.  The spicy corn with butter rocks.  I prefer the grouper over the catfish.  The fried jumbo shrimps are very tasty.  Even though the craw-fish and crab is good eating, it seems like a little too much work and a big mess.  A few things to note, there is very a little seating and the closest bathroom is across the street.  You can ask for towels and wipes if you are eating the messing stuff.
