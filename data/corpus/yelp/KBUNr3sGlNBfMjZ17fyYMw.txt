Great Garlic Noodles , yes, overpriced, but who cares, my rich gal pal Melanie is picking up the tab. She is a frequent patron of this place, so the eight of us were seated immediately on a busy Saturday night. Anytime I don't have to wait to eat when I am starving is a good place to eat. We had the shrimp toast, tuna roll, sashimi and shrimp mousse for appetizers. Melanie wanted to order even more for appetizers, she said the portions are not that big. But hubby and I declined, it should be enough for 4 adults and 4 kids. It was actually just enough for the adults, the kids decided it was too ewww for them. For entrees, hubby raved about the cubed filet mignon, it was more fusiony than the authentic ones we order at a regular Vietnamese restaurant. But he liked it, I thought my braised short ribs with port wine sauce was ok, nothing spectacular.Melanie and her boyfriend had the lobster and drunken crab. They have tried everything on the menu already. The kids feasted on the garlic noodles, udon and Pelligrino. Â We were stuffed, so we split the walnut cake, capuccino cake and mont blanc. I liked the mont blanc best. The chocolate ganache shell is not too hard and still has a creamy consistency. The kids liked the Koi river, kept them busy while the adults chatted over desserts and coffee. It was a good experience, and the food was great, but not wow. This is not a place I would come back, mostly because the price tag is not worth it.
