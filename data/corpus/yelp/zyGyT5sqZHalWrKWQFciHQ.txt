We visited Canoe after planning to for months (the flood shut them down for part of that time). When we finally visited, we were disappointed in the food. It was good, but nowhere close to the flavor we had experienced at Rays on the River, SoHo, or McCormic and Schmick's. It's not that the dishes were not thought out - the sauces matched the favors of the meat and vegetables well. Instead it seemed to be a lack of execution. Our pheasant was overcooked and dry, the steak and fries were so pungent my wife had to leave the table, and the rabbit while well-flavored, was very dry. However, the service was wonderful. Our glasses were never low, and our waitress was wonderful. I'm hoping the problems in the food are due to Valentine's
