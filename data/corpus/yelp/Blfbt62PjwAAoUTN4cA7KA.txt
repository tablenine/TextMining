We went for bugers and fries and our expecations were met or exceeded.  The fries were seasoned and hot.  The cheeseburger and the mushroom burger were everything you would expect.  Both burgers came out  more medium well than medium as requested.  You might need to order medium rare if you want a true medium.  Nice selection of beer. Best part - milkshakes with booze in them!  I'll be back for the Mocha Milkshake
