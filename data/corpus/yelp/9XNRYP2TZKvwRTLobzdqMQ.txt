Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Full Disclosure: I recently took over the Tender Greens website. All because of fellow Yelper Eric H. who is the head chef of TG's WeHo operation. So before you think I'm giving out some biased five-star review, I'd give this five-stars no matter what whether I was working with them or not.. . So onto my review. Tender Greens is remarkable. In that the three co-owners have set up a fast-casual operations selling organic food at prices comparable with similar non-organic fast-casual chains but far superior in quality. Just comparing the decor of this place and nearby competitor Choppe-Choppe and it's like night and day. I took a date here recently and she was raving over and over about the quality of the food and how amazing everything was. And it is. Nothing seems to go wrong here. I had the rustic chicken soup which was loaded with chicken meat and veggies (no noodles) and a tasty flavorful broth. I followed this with the Prawn Salad which has nice sized shrimps (six of them) grilled to perfection and then loaded with greens, lima beans, peppers and a light dressing that made for a perfect summery salad. But good any other time of the year too. Followed it up with the Blackberry Tart and it was fresh and flavorful and had a nice surprise of custard in the middle of the tart. That was unexpected and a nice touch.. . There isn't much that the Tender Greens Three do wrong. From specialty non-alcoholic beverages to locally produced microbrews and wines (If you have an Eagle Rock brew on tap there, thank me....I'm responsible for introducing them to that beer) this is one of the best values of any restaurant at any price point in LA. And one of the best. It's already expanding into San Diego and by 2011, into San Francisco. And hopefully, a city near you real soon.
