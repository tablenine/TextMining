Classic Va-Hi favorite.  Their cocunut soup with tofu and just the right amount of Thai spice is unrivaled.  The Thai noodle (Pad Thai) is also solid.  Get it Thai hot if you want spicy.  My wife loves the Kaboom Maki, which also comes with a great seaweed salad.  They do $1 sushi nights M-W at happy hour times.  They have decent outside seating but the main dining room is great.  Beautiful bar.  For someone who loves Thai food and spent many years in San Francisco with some of the best Thai food, this place rocks.  Formerly a part of the Thai Quad (now 3 Thai restaurants right next to each other).  Great artwork inside as well.
