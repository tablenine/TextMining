When I decided to visit Joy Yee's Chinatown location, I was wondering if I had made a wise choice in picking a place with other non-Chinatown branches over one of the many MANY independent food spots in the area.  My decision was made easier by the fact that I was looking for food in the off-hours between Dim Sum and dinner - also their small space was packed with both asian and non-asian patrons, usually a very good sign!  Their menu is HUGE, but it offers pictures of most every dish which makes ordering a bit easier.  Every dish I sampled was very tasty!  Yes, their dining area is small &amp; a bit chaotic &amp; there are often long waits, but that's typical of good places in Chinatown. They are also known for their bubble tea, milk, and freeze drinks, they have a carry-out counter that offers those to-go.  Their taro-root drinks are delicious!
