Excellent food and excellent service---the problem?  The lone huge problem keeping it from being five stars?  The wait.  After making reservations for 9 p.m., we got there a few minutes early to enjoy some drinks at the bar and relax.  Little did we know we'd be warming those seats for 2 hours.  Yes, that's right.  9 p.m. reservations and we weren't seated until 11--and there were only 2 of us!   The hostess was very wrapped up with a "We're very posh and extremely difficult to get seated at" attitude that wore on me very quickly after the first 30 minutes wait.   . . Finally we were seated and fortunately our waiter was a pro and gave us a bottle of wine on the house for our troubles but I really didn't appreciate the hostess attiude.
