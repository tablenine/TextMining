Good neighborhood drinking spot.  Not a dive, not glamorous; hip interior but still a come as you are kind of place.  You can celebrate your birthday in your fancy party dress, you can come in your hoodie and sagging jeans, or you can roll on down in your stovepipe Acne pants and tank.  Seriously, last night I saw a dude in sweats, a chick in a sequin mini dress (that's her problem, not mine), and everything in between.  I even saw a real live fucking hippie. Just one. It really is EOE here.. .  I often quickly tire of the indoor smoking but that'll change soon enough.  In the dozens of times Ive been here over the years,  Ive never not run into someone I knew. And i don't even live in Chicago. I dont know what that means, Im just sayin'.  Maybe that it appeals to the general cross-section of thirty-something urban dwellers? I dont know. Whatever.. . Food = okay. I generally come only for cocktails. Although, come to think of it, they have a nice turon (fried banana w ice cream) as a staple on their dessert menu. Yes, you heard me: turon (they give it an anglicized name, of course. But it is tried and true of the asian persuasion. Holla).
