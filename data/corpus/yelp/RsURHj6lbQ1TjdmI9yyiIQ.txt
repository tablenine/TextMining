a chicago must i agree. . the pizza put pie was okay but the atmosphere was really cool so I enjoyed it.. the hostess man was hilarious.  when i walked iin at 10 pm on a sat it was packed and i stood at the front and he pointed at me and said 45 min.  didnt ask how many or what my name was or anything.  just "45 min, stay here" so i went over to the bar and made my way to the front after 45 min, he then promptly told me to go back to the bar and he would find me when he was ready.  so he came over 5 mins later or so and brought us to the table.  our waiter was very nice and told us the whole story of al capone, very cool.  we got the pizza pot pie bc it is a must, it was okay but im not a sausage fan so that could be a part of it.. great atmosphere, i would go again and try the anitpasta, it looked good- and CASH ONLY, dont forget
