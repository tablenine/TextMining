This place is currently one of my favorite places to eat.  Eating at the bar is honestly a much better experience...you get to see them work on your dish!  Oh, sometimes Nancy Silverton is working the bar.. . I could eat here several times a week but my wallet won't let me.  You know it is a toss up...gas for the car or some yummy food?
