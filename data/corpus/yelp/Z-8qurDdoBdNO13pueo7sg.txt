Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
My friends and I often eat at Fraiche because it's convenient. I can't say that it's the best cuisine in town, but the place is pleasant, friendly, you can sit outside under a canopy on the street and watch the people go by. The appetizers are good (although they're quite small portions).  They have a "salumi/charcuterie" appetizer list that doesn't interest me, but many people like it. This place is pricey and you can eat better in other restaurants, but the food is fine for what it is and I like the location.    I have to say, though, that I never leave thinking "Wow, what a great meal."  (For that, I go to Pastina on Westwood Blvd.). . I found the lamb spezzatino lacking, but loved the monk fish.  The desserts are pretty fabulous.  It's a place you can linger, though on Saturday night it's mobbed and noisy.
