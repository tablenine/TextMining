I've been hearing about this place for a while now and finally made it over there. And it was totally worth it.  I suggested it to my boyfriend who is constantly on a search for the ultimate cinnamon roll. Well, I think we found our place. We went for breakfast and started out with coffee and, of course, a cinnamon roll. The coffee isn't fantastic but that's cool. I'm trying to cut back anyway. The cinnamon roll, however, is a different story. It's soft and gooey and has the most amazing cream cheese frosting. Trust me, it works. . . Anyway, I wasn't really feeling breakfast food so I got the grilled cheese. It's made with Rosemary Garlic bread and Vermont white Cheddar cheese. It was heavenly. And really filling. My boyfriend got 2 eggs, bacon and cheese grits, which comes with a stack of toast. He remarked that the 2 eggs must have been colossal eggs because there was so much food. Needless to say, he couldn't finish it all which is surprising: he's a member of the Clean Plate Club.  We were both impressed that he got so much food for $6. . . Our server was great, too. Granted, the place wasn't very busy (Tuesday morning...) but she was prompt, friendly and chatted with us a bit. The inside is funky and I love drooling over their pastry case with the monstrous cupcakes. . . I love this place and I'm thinking about going for lunch today. Sounds like a plan.
