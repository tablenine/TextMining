I'm a wishbone fan from way back, especially the original on Grand, but I had lunch there the other day and it was a mediocre experience.  The service and food on Lincoln is consistent, but Washington space is hit or miss.  I had bad service, wrong food brought out.....waited for right order and then there were chicken nuckles in my dish- couldn't eat it.  Would love to see quality control take hold on the Washington space because I still believe...
