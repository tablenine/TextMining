Have your movie and eat it to! I've heard of these mythical places for awhile now and have been avoiding them forever. I generally assume that combining eating and a movie would make the experience of each poorer, but that was not the case here.. . Parking is confusing as hell to get in here, and even the spots in the garage are tiny. Half the open spots were unusable because people don't know how to park.. . Once inside the main area is classier than a typical place with a bar and way better decor. You could actually have a date at this place and not feel like you're in high school. . . Inside the theater you sit in comfortable enough office chairs and press a button for your waiter. Very effective system as you're not bothered during the movie when you don't want to be.. . The food was actually pretty good. I had a great side caesar and chicken fingers with crispy fries. Much better than I expected. Even free refills on drinks!. . I wouldn't hesitate to go back here for a dinner and a movie all at once. I suspect this place does well with parents who're trying to have date night without it taking 4 hours for dinner and a movie.. . Try it once! Maybe you'll be impressed.
