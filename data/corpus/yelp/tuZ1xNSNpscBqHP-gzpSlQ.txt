Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
If I had to sum up Mastro's in three words they would be: . . Oh, the gluttony. Â . . If I had to sum it up in three parts, here's what it would look like for 9 people wearing party hats and ready to ring in the New Year:. . Part I. Martini's with stuffed olives. Red, red wine. Oysters Rockefeller. Oysters on the half shell. Warm spinach salad . French onion soup. . Part II. Bone in filet mignon. Bone in rib eye. Chilean sea bass. Lobster mashed potatoes. Gorgonzola Mac n' cheese. Truffle gnocchi. Creamed Spinach. . Part III. Butter cake. Creme brulee. Chocolate cake. Fresh whipped cream. . It was decadent. It was mouthwatering. It was more food than we could handle. But, in the end, it was worth it!. . Note: This was my third visit to Mastro's, and I'm proud to report that it just gets better every time.
