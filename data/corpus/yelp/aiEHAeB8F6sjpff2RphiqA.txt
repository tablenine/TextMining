Really good sausage.  Mmmm...I just got back from lunch with coworkers and I had the vegetarian Italian and the mango jalapeno.  We also got a couple rounds of fries to share.  Sadly, no beer.  And that really brought me down.  I mean I am fighting a massive hangover and I know that beer will cure it...or at least help me forget for a few until I am hungover again.  And these beers looked damn tasty.  I love my Belgian beers, and there they were with the cold dew dripping down the side of the glass.  That perfect amount of foam at the right temperature.  Taunting me!!!  So while the sausages were extremely good, I don't believe I will have had the true experience until I get wasted there.  Or at the very least a good buzz.. . Love the decor with the mess hall feel.  Obviously, more upscale to appeal to the hipsters.  Quick service and great food.  All that was missing was my beer!!!!!!  Oh...and sweet potato fries.  Get those and I'm golden.
