Went back last weekend and had the blackened mahi mahi tostada, which had some of the most amazing grits I have ever tasted! Â The spicy thai calamari to start was also the perfect plenty of sweet and spicy. . . Food wise this place doesn't disappoint, but we definitely felt a little rushed once we were seated, so not sure if that is the way they operate, but usually when I am spending $20 plus at a restaurant, I want to be able to relax and enjoy my dining experience.
