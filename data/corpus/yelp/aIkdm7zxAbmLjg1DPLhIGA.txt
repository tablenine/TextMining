Restaurant: Fado Irish Pub
Category: Pubs
The Rumors are wrong, Fado Irish Pub in Buckhead is NOT closing down with everything else. So with that said, pour the Guinness and toast with ye lads to plenty of more weekends of whiskey drinking and beer pouring. . . This pub style stands out in Buckhead with it's Irish flare and dark wood and rustic decor. However, the bands are the same old tribute bands that play "Summer of '69". You will only find people dancing late into the evening after a few too many pints of dark, flavor filled beers. Â Everyone else is found hanging around the bars or crammed into the wooden booths. Cover is typically between $5-$10 on weekends. During the week, this place only attracts professionals on business looking for a bar near their hotel, or die hard "football" fans (this is one of the few bars in Atlanta that show world soccer games). . . As far as food goes, I've never tried it, but my friend meets up with his mother on Sundays for a traditional Irish breakfast.
