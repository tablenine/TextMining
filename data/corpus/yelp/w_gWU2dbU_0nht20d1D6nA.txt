This place was...you guessed it, a short drive from my old dwelling in Hell-A.. . It's prime time people watching, as Franklin street is home to many fine establishments. It's also about Scientology star gazing right across the street from the Celebrity Center--whatever that means...you in your tower of Babble Mr. Cruise.... . It's definitely a neighborhood bar. Found myself here watching an NFL playoff game amidst the locals on a Sunday afternoon.. . Go here if you want to have a breakdown bc "ohmygodyou'reinLAandjustcan'ttakeit!" and get some free shots. The bartender was kick ass and a Boston native. Me likey.
