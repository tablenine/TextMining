Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
We went into the Apple having already known a few things...1...the place is always busy...and 2..the burgers were supposedly great. After taking a seat I was impressed with the nostalgic environment offered but the menu soon changed my opinion of the Apple Pan even before I received my food. To give you an idea....burgers are 6.50 before the .50 slice of cheddar. Fries were about 3.00 for a small plate...maybe enough for 2 if you're not too hungry and the whammy...a slice of Apple Pie is 6.00.... We decided to share a soda....unfortunately a can which means no free refills and also split a single order of fries. I got the hickory and she got the steak burger. The hickory sauce is actually pretty good and so were the two burgers in general. It reminded me of in and out except with a larger patty and much more lettuce. If you don't mind spending 20+ for a fast food meal then this is the place for you. If I offered you a fast food meal that cost over 20 for 2 people that also came with an average 10 minute wait for a table would you go? Oh...cash only as well. . . Pros: Decent burger, near mall, ambiance. . Cons: HIGH PRICES, parking
