I was sooo impressed with this place....the fact that it is a BYOB always makes it worth going..but no corkage fee!?  Outstanding!. They chill the wine for you on the table...which is nice.... The maki rolls are amazing....and for you veggie sushi lovers..they can make up any concoction you'd like!. I highly recommend the Red Curry...its got a hint of sweet yet spicy..very good with rice...and the Spicy Crazy noodles are fantastic too!!. For the price this place is awesome...the quality of the food is great, the service is good as well...!  And for those of you that worry about street parking..there is ample!
