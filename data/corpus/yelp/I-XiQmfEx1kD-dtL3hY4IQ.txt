Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
Loooove me some Waikikie! You get some awesome, stupendous, etc, etc island-style Hawaiian Asian food. The cross of Hawaiian, Korean, and Japanese food makes my wannabe foodie heart all warm and fuzzy.. . I mean, for Christ sakes folks, the place has friggi'n Kimchi. The Spam Mashubi will force you to never think about Spam the same way again.. . I recommend the BBQ Beef fried rice for your first dish(add the teriyaki and the red chillie sauce to it). The owner is super nice and the prices are good.. . Try a Hawaiian beer while you're there too!
