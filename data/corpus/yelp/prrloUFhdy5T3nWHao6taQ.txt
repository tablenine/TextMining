I need some good reviews or people are going to think I hate everything. So I thought and thought and then remembered a really good lunch experience I had here a couple months ago. It was quite empty so I sat at the bar- nice bartender. I had a sandwich which was delicious, but I cant remember if it was the spanish one or the mexican one. What made it better was that it cost about the same as that sandwich that I didnt like just across the street from here! I do want to go back for dinner but hope to avoid the waiter that Kathleen M had. Â I know- sit at the bar!
