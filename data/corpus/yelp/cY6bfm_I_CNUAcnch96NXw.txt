Category: Bakeries
What they have:. - Cheese Deli with someone to help you pick your cheese and pair it with the right breads/ wines/ etc. - Bakery where you can buy sweet confections by the dozen! Absolutely delicous pastries! It's the only place I would go to pick up pastries to bring to an event. Â You can also buy loaves of bread, bagels, etc. - Pre-made food that you can buy by the pound (main courses like pork chops, salmon steaks, or fried chicken as well as sides like mac and cheese, tabouli salad, or hummus). - Small wine selection. - Small flower selection. - Some "cabinet foods" e.g. peanut butter, spreads, tea, crackers, etc. They have very exotic kinds of food in this section (e.g. chocolate chip cookie dough peanut butter). It's mostly room-temp goodies, but some chilled dips/spreads. . - Made-to-order sandwiches/ salads/ etc. They have your staples (BLT, Tuna salad, etc) but they also have unique choices like balsamic grilled veggie paninis. Their egg and cheese breakfast panini is outragously good! . I would recommend it as a great place to buy desserts to bring to a dinner party or to sit outside and enjoy a leisurely breakfast. Seating is very limited, though (especially indoor seating). Not a great date spot. Their pre-made foods are expensive (by the pound), but the made-to-order foods are reasonably priced (about $7-8). . Easy to park during the week, but on weekend afternoons it can be hard to find a spot.
