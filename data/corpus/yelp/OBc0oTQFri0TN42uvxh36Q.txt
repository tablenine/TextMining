Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
This renovated house manages to have a cozy feel while maintaining an elegant interior. It's close to everything and the porch is a great feature.. . I keep it simple with dishes I order at Italian restaurants, and the pasta dishes at Pulcinella hit the spot. Pair up one with a good glass of wine and you've got a great, fresh, Italian meal. If you're more adventurous, there are plenty of interesting combinations and options no the menu.. . I've only managed to hit this place during off evenings I guess, since it's been pretty quiet and at times almost empty. The service was good, but nothing special considering how quiet things have been in the restaurant.
