So after having drinks at Sidebar we walk over to Cut and who's there posing for pictures, Wolfgang Puck himself, I wanted to say Hey man this meal better be good, but I just said Dude that's fucking Wolfgang Puck he's kind of short, Anyways the decor is nice and they have pictures of celebrities all over the wall.  Where I sat down, our president elect Obana was staring me square in the face.  The back of the menu's also feature celebrity pictures which I don't understand why but apparently I needed my picture of Angelina Jolie to approve what I was going to order.  Onto food, For appetizers we ordered the pork belly (really tasty), tuna tartare (very good also, the crackers they give with these are really spicy) and the blue crab and lobster cocktail (I loved this it was delicious).  Being that I was recovering from a cold I didn't go all balla and order the Kobe beef, So I went ghetto Shot Calla and ordered the Bone in New York Sirloin.  It was a good steak but probably not the best I've ever had.  I also ordered the Wasabi Yozu Kochi butter sauce for it, The sauce was good but a little overwhelming after a few bites.  For sides I was a little bummed out they didn't have squash but we ordered the Autumn Greens with Garlic, which my friends devoured (it was tasty), and we also ordered the Sweet Potato Puree which I devoured, I loved that dish man.  For desert I had Brown Toffee sticky pudding with Ice Cream, good not great,  Oh yeah we all had some wine (I think it was a Pinot Noir).  I'll give Cut 4 stars, the service was great, the appetizers were amazing, the Steak was good but not great, the sides dishes were awesome and dessert was good, yeah it's costly but it's a good meal, and hey maybe when you go you'll see Wolfgang too.
