This is really as good as people say it is. The downside .. FINDING THE DAMN TRUCK .. and the wait. But if you go with a good group, it would make a good mini adventure. Also, its not as clean as you'd like a sit down restaurant to be, but it's expected. I asked them about their letter grade and the (asian) guy said that trucks are not graded by the food inspectors YET.. Hmm. Let's hope they get on that soon because I would really like to continue to visit this little shindig. . I usually just get the marinated beef (kind of like bulgogi), and I stay away from the chicken. . I LOVE Korean BBQ and I LOVE Mexican food. THIS IS THE BEST IDEA EVER! (Maybe not the best, but it's up there). . I love you KOGI, and I hope we meet again soon :(
