Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place is cute and in a fun location, but is always very crowded and the wait time is always longer than they say it will be. The pancakes and french toast are a little sweet for my taste, but I really like the "pesto scrambler" and the omelette selection, and despite the chaos of brunchtime, the hosts and waitstaff are very patient and friendly.
