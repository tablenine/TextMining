Restaurant: Rose Angelis
Category: Italian
Rose Angelis is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city.  The decor of the charming restaurant creates the perfect date atmosphere, and the food is amazing!  The salmon ravioli is my favorite and is so good you have to eat the entire thing.  But you must leave room for dessert because the tiramisu is ubbelievable!
