ok, so i walk in and my heart just drops. it's the size of a shoebox. isn't this supposed to be a bar? where's the bar?! after relegating myself to the unsuccessfulness of my planning, we walked to the back and there's the bar! the night is saved! i love the atmosphere of this place. it's definitely decorated for the guys and the utensils are magnetic. =P. . rattlesnake &amp; rabbit  - it tastes neither like rattlesnake nor rabbit but it's definitely very good. . apricot &amp; ginger - loved the slight hint of sweetness. . . sure, it's a bit on the expensive side but this place is so much fun. A must try!
