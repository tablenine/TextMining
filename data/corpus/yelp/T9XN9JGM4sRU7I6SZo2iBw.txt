Heard good things about this place.  Had ribs delivered tonight, and unfortunately I was not pleased.  These ribs just aren't to my liking. I prefer a "tangy" sauce and this was more of a "smoked" jerky flavor....some people may prefer that I suppose...but not for me. :(. . Cole slaw was quite good....cornbread wasn't to my liking though either.
