It's easy to keep the bill down if you're not drinking.. This place has THE BEST GUACAMOLE!!!!. They make it, literally, to order.  All I can say is OMG.. Smaller portions than Garcia's, but it's nicer, nicer than Los Mogotes, too.  I mean, you can wear casual, but you can tell the place is well kept, and I think it's relatively new.  I only heard about it last year, so.... They have this cute little bar set up, when you first walk in, and then there's another dining area in the back.  The staff was always friendly.. Nice little place to grab a bite.  An the food is delicious!
