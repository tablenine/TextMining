I long for the days when it's consistently warm enough to sit outside on Krog Bar's plush pillow-lined benches while sipping on a refreshing Pinot Grigio... Winter, you are exhausting! In all honesty, the inside of this intimate wine bar is very lovely &amp; equally as sexy as the outside. There is just something so liberating &amp; so European about lounging on Krog Bar's patio though. This place makes for an excellent after work happy hour, as well as a late night rendezvous. I haven't tried many of their tapas, but I can vouch for the roasted red pepper hummus... some of the best I've had &amp; believe you me, I've sampled a lot. For those of you on a first date, this is sure to impress without breaking the bank. The cozy cushions just beg for a midnight kiss!
