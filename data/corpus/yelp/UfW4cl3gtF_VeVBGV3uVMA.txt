open, clean, airy appeal, nice welcome, friendly counter person and . efficient set up for ordering made for a good start for my take out order.. . first,  a choice of beef, turkey or veggie burgers, in 3 sizes ranging from 1/3 to 1#,  . -a choice of white bun, wheat, or breadless, served in a bowl (!). . tons of options, broken down into sections:  . -cheese, ranging from blue to feta to sharp and tilamook cheddar to american. -up to 4 regular toppings, like mixed lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, dried cranberries, shredded carrots, pickles. -deluxe additions, at a dollar each: avocado, deep fried onion strings (my choice), sauteed mushrooms. -toppings ranging from apricot salsa to steak sauce to garlic aioli. . there are so many options, it's like filling in a test form, except there really are no wrong answers.. . had a side of french fries; a huge portion, so share, don't order two, and a root beer float.  though the shake of the week tempted with its chocolate fudgy malted decadence, it sounded like a meal in itself.. . my coworker and i shared, and both the turkey and veggie burgers were delicious, the fries were okay for take out, eaten an  hour after i brought them back to work, and the floats were yummy. i can't wait to go back and make another combo, and this time i want to eat there so i can really get a good handle on the fries. and maybe imbibe one of their alcohol choices.. . warning, the bill came to $35 for the two orders, partially due to my extras, which i thought were worth the added expense. but that's the main reason for the 4 star rating, no issues with the food, decor, or service.
