Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I was duly disappointed with my Hakata Ramen experience. I've loved ramen for years, but never really had good ramen until recently. Ever since my revisit to Orochon in Little Tokyo, I've been on a ramen kick. And to hear about a reputable ramen house in Rosemead that's 7 minutes from home? I was psyched.. . I ordered ramen with everything medium (figured it was safe to do that since I've never been there before) with extra chasiu and bean sprouts. I don't usually like extra meat, but after tasting the chasiu at Orochon, I automatically thought to add more. Bad idea. Their chasiu was dry and not all that tasty. But it went well with the soup I guess, which was not distinctive at all. Leni A. was right in saying that she could have made it at home - Ramen House ramen is not supposed to taste like that! On top of it all, the noodles were thin and did not have the chewy consistency that ramen noodles should have.. . Normally I'd give it 3 stars, but their outrageous prices (the bill came out to $30 for 2 people, which is fine if the food is good, but is quite unreasonable for subpar food) dropped my rating. . . At least the appetizers were decent.
