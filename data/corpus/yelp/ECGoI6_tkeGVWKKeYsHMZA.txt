This is a fantastic cafe that I often forget about because I rarely go north of Addison unless it's to the Metro. It recently expanded again, and features great brunch and lunch menus, along with all your standard cafe drinks. Plenty of room inside and outside, they also have shows. I once saw Jeff Buckley there! No, it wasn't his ghost, it was before he died.. . Despite the great space and size, however, service was lacking the last couple times I've been, and the prices have gone up too much. If the value were better, this might squeak into my top 13 brunch spots.
