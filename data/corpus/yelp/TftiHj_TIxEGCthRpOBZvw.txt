The food gets 3 stars. The last 2 stars goes to our waiter Shaun. He was unbelievably attentive and we almost considered him part of the group by the end of dinner. [this may be the Delerium talking].. . The best dish, hands down, and probably the cheapest, was the garlic noodles. I think between the 5 of us sharing family style meals, we ordered this dish 3 times that night. The shrimp on sugarcane just exploded in my mouth and was amazing. The shaking beef was just ok, nothing special. We got the sampler, the halibut entree, and 2 crabs as well. Both the drunken crab and the roasted crab were delicious. . . However, I was really mad to find an empty crab middle! Â I expected a middle filled with meat and delicious stuffing! Its the best part of the crab, and they threw it out?! WHY???? I had to look around the restaurant again to make sure I was in an Asian restaurant. SHAMEFUL.. . The beer was amazing. We were all introduced to Delerium, and we are now enlightened. We also bought a bottle of their cheapest champagne for about 100 bucks as our initial toast for the night [we knew was 30 dollars in the store] but it was a special occasion for this dinner. The bartender at the front was a huge disappointment. He had no clue as to where to find the champagne, that it was a bottle, and not a half bottle, and did not even know anything about the champagne period. I had taken a star away in my head when I was dealing with him, but Shaun made up for it during dinner!. . The atmosphere was dim, cozy, and Asian featured, of course. I have to give credit to the An Sisters for doing such a good job on the interior decoration. . . Overall, a great night for fine dining. However, my cravings for crab are way too often and way to ghetto to frequent this place again. Boiling Crab, I'm coming home baby.
