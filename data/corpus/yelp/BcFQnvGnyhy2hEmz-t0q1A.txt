Restaurant: Fat Cat
Category: Bars
Fat Cat equals a skinny wallet. . In the up incoming Uptown, Fat Cat has nestled itself on Broadway amongst the historic Green Mill and the alternative-rocking Rivera. Adorned with sky-high windows, a hip 1930s/40s decor and music you can easily talk over; Fat Cat is undeniably a laid back and stylish joint. . . With a decent beer selection (remember, I'm a beer snob) and an array of specialty martinis, there is something to wet everyone's whistle. Unfortunately, the night was stinted by steep prices (my money ran out before my tolerance). . . Bottom Line: With the Green Mill right next door, Fat Cat will never be the big cheese.
