About blasted time I visited Feed. It was good. I liked the decor, and the service was fast and while not overly friendly, it did the job. . . I got the pulled BBQ pork, and my companion got the pulled chicken. VERY peppery! And very good. The fries were pretty good; hand-cut, which I always like, but the little slivers were nearly burnt, while the thicker, "normal" sized ones were still pretty pale and starchy. The buns for the sammiches were low-quality - they fell apart from the juicy pork and chicken - but the star of the show is what's between the bread, so that was forgivable. The corn on the cob looked divine, and the mashed sweet potatoes made my mouth water. We each got a filling dinner with tasty sweet tea and lemonade, all for just under $20. Helluva deal! I will be back. :). . To expand on the cash only thing - the bar next door - The Continental - has an ATM. Handy!
