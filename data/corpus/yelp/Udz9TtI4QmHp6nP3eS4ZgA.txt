Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
Parking: . We were so overwhelmed with the traffic that we parked at the first meter we saw. After we put money in the meter, we realized that langer's had it's own parking lot at the corner of 7th and Westlake. . . Area: . The area was quite busy and a little sketchy. As soon as we got out of our car, a hispanic guy came up to us and asked "ID? you need ID?" It was quite hilarious. . . Decor/ambiance:. The restaurant had a bit of that old school 50's diner feel to it. . . Foodies: . 1. #19 pastrami, swiss cheese, russian style dressing ($14.45). This dish was featured on the "the best thing i ever ate". The meat of the sandwich is the thick-sliced, tender pastrami. It's sugar-cured gave it a caramelized sweetness that really gives the pastrami an extra flavor. The cheese is your standard slice of swiss and complements the meat subtly. Their russian dressing is a bit like thousand island but softer and more muted. The rye bread was quite soft and the crust had a crispness that adds to the many textures. It's very pricey but it was enough for us to share. . . 2. Large fries ($3.50). . We had order a side a fries and didn't realize there were two different sizes to choose from. If not requested, they automatically give you the larger size. The fries were more crispy than average and was very filling. . . Service: . Our waitress, Eve, was super nice and came around the table several times to make sure we were enjoying our lunch.
