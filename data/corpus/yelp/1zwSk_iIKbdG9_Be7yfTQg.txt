There seems to be a lot of chatter lately about this restaurant, and tonight I got to try it out in a large group setting with family.  The service was outstanding and they have some very interesting tap beer selections.  As far as the food, I was most impressed with the appetizers -the spare ribs fell off the bone and the cornbread with the homemade honey jalapeno sauce was equally as excellent.  The "hot" entree items that I shared with my cousin, however, were a let-down.  Not spicy enough!  I suppose I was particularly disappointed at this since this place boasts the "hottest/spiciest" flavors in town.  3 Stars.
