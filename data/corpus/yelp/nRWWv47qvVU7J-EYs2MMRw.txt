Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I finally got the chance to try their fish tacos last Saturday before walking down to the Sunset Junction... Awesome tacos! Everything was fresh, the fish was so oh tender, and the horchata was delish! The owner was very friendly, and it was so unnerving to see smiling faces from the other side of the counter as they cook my food. I think this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship...
