The view from the restaurant is AMAZING!  The building is a replica of a palace in Kyoto.  The glassed in balcony has a stunning view of the city lights.  Request to sit there.  Went here on a date and was overwhelmed.  The staff were incredible and the restaurant was perfect.  I LOVE unagi so of course that was ordered with some spicy tuna in a vader roll, hokkigai, anago, more sashimi and of course saki.  To find the place though, you think you're getting lost because you have to drive straight up this crazy hill and around another building.  It's worth it.  Their ginger creme brulee was the perfect ending to an amazing dinner.  IF I remember correctly too, there is this pagoda there that was brought over from Japan over 500 years ago.  It has a very rich history!
