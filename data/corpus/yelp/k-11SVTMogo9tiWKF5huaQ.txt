OMG! OMG! OMG! So my boyfriend wanted to stop by here to buy some rolls and potato balls. I never been here before - so I didn't know what I was missing. They close at 7:30PM - we got here at 7:25 on our way to Santa Barbara. There was a line - and there was a lot of food still. The lady there that helped me was great - she gave me a roll and a croquette so I could try it. The whole thing - not just a piece. I LOVED the croquettes, empanadas, and potato balls. OMG! And so cheap. My boyfriend loves the guaba/cheese rolls. There had this sale: 12 for 7.99 dollars. Another place that Im glad it is far from me!!! LOL
