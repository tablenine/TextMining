Came here on my recent visit to L.A.  The place is small and has counter service only.  The french fries are perfect, and the server will come by and put some ketchup on a small platter for you to dip them in.  I didn't eat a burger, but instead opted for a grilled swiss sandwich on rye, which said it came with lettuce, but did not.  Pretty good for the experience, probably won't go back, considering I don't live there.
