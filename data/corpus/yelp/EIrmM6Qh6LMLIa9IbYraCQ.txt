This is where you take your friends who don't know a lot about LA if you want to impress them. This is where you take the uninformed, the inexperienced, and you overwhelm them with the sheer magnitude and power of FREAKING GIANT BURRITOS!. . The place is usually crowded, but if you can make it for lunch, you'll usually get pretty good service. The food is, as everyone else is saying, enormous, but not without flavor. For the price, it's really a good deal. . . The two best burritos are the Hollenbeck and the Manuel Special, which you should definitely order if you want the best experience (because other reviews have said the food is somehow lacking, and I'm assuming they didn't get either of these two) . . Anyway, it's a good place to eat if you're hungry, and a GREAT place to take your friends if they somehow haven't heard of it, or if they're not from the area. (so the 4-star rating would be 5 stars in the latter scenario)
