Atmosphere is pleasant, and food often quite good, such as squeeze-it-yourself OJ and some of the (slightly overpriced) sandwiches like chicken salad.  . . Takeout/delivery experiences are consistently frustrating.  Once I received a salad: half of it was rotten (as in advanced degree of decay) and the small dixie cup of house dressing was all oil as though it hadn't been mixed.  Another time they claimed my location was out of delivery range, though it is within 5 blocks.  I called back and spoke to another employee who tersely and without apology attributed the discrepancy to the previous phone person "lying."  I would rather go to Caffe Florian where they are always competent and professional.
