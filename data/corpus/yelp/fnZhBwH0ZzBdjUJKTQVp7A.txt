Totally unassuming place, nestled in a narrow strip mall, but this place is a little gem. So much character and the service is some of the best in LA. I had never eaten a pupusa before and had no idea what it was, and the waiter explained everything to me without making me feel stupid. The pupusa, btw, was out of this world. Great vibe, charm, and service. GO GO GO!
