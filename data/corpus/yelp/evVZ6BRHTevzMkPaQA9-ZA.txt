Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
One of my best meals ever. Seriously! . Started with the amazing tower of seafood. This could have been my dinner but I controlled myself enough not to eat too much of it. We managed to drink a few bottles of the prisoner 2008 napa red wine which perfectly complemented my petite filet (medium well), lobster mashed potatoes, creamy corn, and asparagus. hmmmm-mmmm. My favorite side was the creamy corn (not sure what the actual name was. My petite filet was very juicy and did not require any steak sauce. It was honestly just right. I wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I was surprised about was that we were sitting upstairs and there was a very obnoxious group of people behind us. They managed to leave when we were half-way through our meal but seriously they were really annoying. The service was excellent. . . I almost forgot, the cherry on top was our amazing dessert. The butter cake was seriously perfection. No complaints. Highly Recommend Mastro's! Can't wait to return. I hope I don't have to wait too long.
