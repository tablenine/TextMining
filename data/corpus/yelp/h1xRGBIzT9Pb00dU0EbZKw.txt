Good eatin' here!  Chicken and waffles as a combination - who would have thought????  Scoe's #1 came with 2 big waffles with 2 scoops of whipped butter, warm maple syrup, and your choice of 2 pieces of southern style fried chicken (or as the menu says "1/4 chix").  Had a side of their candied yams, mac n cheese and greens.  The greens stood out on the sides as a big winner (good spice/ seasoning and tender).. . This one was located in Hollywood, which was a pretty popular spot for a Tuesday night.. . I would definitely come back when I am visiting in SoCal.
