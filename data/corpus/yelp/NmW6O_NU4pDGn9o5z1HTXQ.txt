Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
buona terra is like meeting someone who's totally hot.  you check them out on the street or a bar or something (. http://yelp.com. ), walk up to them and strike up a conversation (drive to the restaurant and go inside) and listen to what they have to say (read the menu and enjoy the atmosphere) so to "soak it all in" and get a better idea of who this hot person is.  it's going really well and you like what they have to say (the appetizers and service), so you continue to engage them (continue the conversation with whomever you are having dinner with) but all the while you are maybe, just ever so briefly, simultaneously imagining what kind of mad sex you're going to be having later that night (the entree).. . then s/he turns out to be a dead lay and you get food poisoning.
