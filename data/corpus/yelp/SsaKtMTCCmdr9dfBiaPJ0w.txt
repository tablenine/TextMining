Perhaps as equally ridiculous long wait line as the one at Ding Tai Fung.  . . The Taiwanese comfort food (pork sausage) at its best.  . Throw in the oyster omelet, pumpkin rice noodle, and the fried pork cutlet over rice.  Makes me drool even writing this review.  . . The Zhon Zi, the dumplings and the sausages are great to-go items, too!
