Let's just say my boyfriend and I would drive 40 miles just for a bowl of ramen.  We used to come here all the time when we lived out in LA, parking sucked since it's mainly just street parking, but well worth the wait and trouble.  The ramen and soup are the perfect combo.  Honestly, I don't even need the pork slices.  Large portions, decent prices, friendly service.  I hope the new Monterey Park branch will live up to this reputation.
