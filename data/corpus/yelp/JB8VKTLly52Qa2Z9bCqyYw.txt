Restaurant: Nakato
Category: Japanese
My husband &amp; I decided to try Nakato for our anniversary dinner....what a good choice it was. Their sushi is fresh and delish and a large variety is available. The sirloin was as tender as the filet and they served lo mein as well as fried rice as part of the hibachi dinner. The service was 5 star all the way. We will be sure to come back with a group of friends next time!
