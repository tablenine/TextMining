By far, the best steaks around! I reccomend the 35 day dry aged omaha ribeye. The size of a strip, the thickness of a filet, and the taste and texture of a ribeye. Perfectly cooked (med rare) through and through! The sides are unique and very good. The peanut butter dessert (which they no longer offer) was amazing! They have a great selection of wines available. Ambience and service was great and efficient. No offense to Ruths Chris (which i love dearly) but in comparison...Cut makes Ruths Chris look like Sizzler! It truly is.... A CUT above the rest!
