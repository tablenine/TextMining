Restaurant: The Foundry On Melrose
Category: American (New)
The babe and I went to The Foundry for a friend's birthday dinner on a Saturday night.  The place is actually alot bigger than it looks from the outside.  There's a back area with additional seating and there's where our party of 7 sat.  The décor is simple with some old school rustic influence. . . We started with appetizers.  I got the heirloom tomatoes which were excellent with prosciutto.  The babe got hand rolled pasta in a delicious cream sauce with bits of cauliflower and broccoli.  . . For dinner I got the appetizer portion of quail which was good but could have used a bit more marinating time and less cook time since it was a bit dry.  The huns got the short ribs and they were disappointing....dry and not very flavorful.  My friend got the duck special...I was able to try a bite and it too was a bit dry and lacking in flavor.. . The service was excellent and drinks were always filled.. . The Foundry gets three stars. - one star for the service. - one star for the appetizers. - one star for the atmosphere. . Overall, a decent place if you live near the area but with so many other choices I'd probably go elsewhere. For $30 entrées it's best to stick to the appetizers which are half the price and seems to be prepared better.
