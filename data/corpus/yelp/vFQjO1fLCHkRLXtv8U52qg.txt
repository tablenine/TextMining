Com is the bomb! . . The restaurant is clean and cute. The food is healthy, and the portions are just right. Everything is delicious! I never leave feeling like I have pigged out, even when I *know* I ate too much.. . The wait staff is extremely friendly and will always help you decide what to order if you can't make up your mind. (*Always my problem - too many choices!*)
