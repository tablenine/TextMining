Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
I love me some champagne!  Especially when I am celebrating.  I came here by surprise after getting engaged.  My fiance had set up a party of 20 in the corner to celebrate.  I thought it was wonderful, at least for most of it.  The champagne is delicious, there was some crazy drink made with sparkling wine and black effen, surprisingly delicious.  It is a nice atmosphere, kind of hip. The service was great for most of it, but I have one complaint.  That being the treatment by management...after running up a $1400 bar tab, one would think they are entitled to keep both of their tables.  However, they wanted to consolidate us down to one, so they could sit another table.  Not happening, we ran up another $600, you would think after spending a combined total of $2000 we should be golden...
