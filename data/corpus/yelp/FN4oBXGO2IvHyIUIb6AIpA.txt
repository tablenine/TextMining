You could serve me poop-on-a-platter but as long as it comes with tater tots I would be sooooooo happy. . . I went here on a saturday for brunch with the roomies and I nearly did a dance on the booth when I saw on the menu "all brunch items come with hash browns, french fries, or tator tots. HELL YEAH, I'M HAVING ME SOME TOTS! I was craving some serious meat so I ordered a cheeseburger (with tater tots on the side, of course). I also ordered myself a Bloody Mary, which I must say was the best Bloody Mary I have had in a a while because before the food had even arrived I felt slighty tipsy. The cheeseburger was good but with the tator tots and bloody mary, the whole meal was wonderful!
