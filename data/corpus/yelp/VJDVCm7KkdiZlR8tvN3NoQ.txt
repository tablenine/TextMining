I really REALLY like this place. There's no particular reason why it excels above and beyond other bars, but here are a few fine points to mention:. . 1) Old school Star Wars plastic lunchboxes serve as the condiment carriers. . 2) A stellar music playlist.. 3) $1 beers. All. the. time. Their Old Fourth Ward ale isn't bad (just a typical domestic light lager), and at $4 a pitcher (yes, not a special-- it's this price all of the time) it becomes extremely tasty.. 4) Diverse clientele: a lot of hipsters, but many old regulars (and by old I mean double Ivan S' age old) and other locals.. 5) Friendly, fast service. Our guy tonight was Sam and he was charming, quick, and always there when we needed him. Three cheers for Sam! . 6) They had a side dish called a "meatball boat," and it is just that: three delicious meatballs covered in cheese and served on a plate. What could be better?. . And if those 6 points don't get you in on their own, they've got a pretty fun trivia night. Mondays host general knowledge at 8pm followed by a round of cartoon trivia at 10. Thursdays have adult trivia at 10, which I can only imagine would be tons of fun. . . I'm hoping to move in to the very close vicinity, but even if not, you can bet a $4 pitcher that I'll be back here. Soon.
