Two in the Pink.... Jeez, what can I bring that hasn't already been brought. Went there with the old lady on our way to Roscoes. I seen it on Travel Channel or suhtin and figured we'd give it a shot. . The line - it kept going and going, I thought it was packed out front until we walked around the side and finally the back before we found the end. 1.5 hours later we made it to the street side. We get to know your neighbors in line pretty well at this point. The tour buses start driving by a waving at the idiots dumb enough to wait in line for 2 hours, and you wave back, try and put on a little show. 2 hours later we got up to order. I got the 12 inch Jalepeno filled All American, with Pastrami, bacon lettuce tomato. La Chica got the "Planet Hollywood Polock Sausage, grilled onions, grilled shrooms, bacon &amp; cheese. There is plenty of seating since it takes about 10 minutes to finish. The flavor was great. Mine had plenty of salty meat to keep my doctor happy, just how I like it. I give it a "once every 1-5 years ranking" based solely on the time I had to wait in line. I wasn't disappointed when i sat down and ate, and neither was the ol lady.
