It's a great place to enjoy some close up magic and get trashed at the same time.. . My mother is a member-- she's been driving me friggin' crazy with her incessant and simplistic card tricks she's been learning from her classes. COME ON MOM, WHAT ARE YOU IN JUNIOR HIGH AND JUST MOVED NEIGHBORHOODS SO YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS AND INTERNET WASN'T INVENTED YET SO YOU GO TO THE LIBRARY AND CHECK OUT CARD TRICKS AND MEMORIZE ALL OF THEM??????. . Other than that, the drinks are typical club prices (expensive), the food is slightly above average but definitely higher than normal prices.. . Pro is that everyone looks nicely dressed-- hard to get that anywhere these days.. . It's like Disneyland-- gotta go at least once.
