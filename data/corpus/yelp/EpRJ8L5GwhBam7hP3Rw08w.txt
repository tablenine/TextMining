If you are a fan of raw chicken then this is the place for you! If your life's dream has been to contract an awesome case of salmonella, look no further! Run, don't walk to Mexicali!. . Brian V and I went to Mexicali for dinner and drinks. Brian ordered a chicken sandwich. He had finished eating one half of the sandwich and started on the other half. Upon taking his first bite he froze, made a face, and spit the bite of sandwich on to his plate below. The chicken on this half was completely raw. We called over our waiter and showed him the chicken. He was apologetic and asked if Brian wanted another sandwich, which he declined. Brian was totally grossed out by the whole raw chicken thing and didn't want anything else. The waiter brought our check which included a charge for the raw chicken sandwich...we thought it was a oversight. We called over the waiter and pointed out the "oversight." Oh no, we were told we had to pay for the sandwich because Brian had consumed half of it...WTF?!? We asked for the manager, who proceeded to argue with us about the bill and tell us that because Brian had eaten half of the sandwich he had to pay for it. The argument went on for a while until I started mentioning things like the Health Department and food borne illness. Suddenly the manager agreed to take the sandwich off the bill.. . This experience was unreal...I have never experienced such f**ked up customer service. Boo for Mexicali!!!
