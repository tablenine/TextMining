I was breathing hard. My mouth was watering. My brow was sweating. I didn't come 3,000 miles all the way from NYC for nothing. I knew it was my personal journey to find the famed Kogi truck. . . My fingers buzzed with such excitement, I could barely type in the words "kogibbq" on my Twitter. The cartoon bird chirped cheerily as I eagerly scanned the words "@Kogibbq: Roja truck at UCLA from 12-3PM!" PERFECT. I am a woman with a mission and that mission is to hunt down that truck. . . After circling the UCLA campus in vain, my heart was thumping hard. Could it be that the truck sold out of food and left the viciniity already? Or was it that my dull sense of direction failed me yet again? One more turn... and I spotted the white truck with graffiti emblazoned all over the sides. PHEW! I sprinted out of the car and my legs carried me as far as it could go.... about 10 yards. I bent over and panted. I MADE IT! VICTORY IS MINE! *FIST PUMP*. . ....And it was everything I imagined it to be and more. Definitely NOT overhyped. One bite into the Spicy Pork Taco and I was a pile of putty. Those were definitely the best - and in 2nd place was the Beef Short Rib all for $2 each! I love corn tortillas over flour tortillas, so this would get 5.5 stars if I could click another star into place. I also had Beef Short Rib burrito, but that's made with flour tortilla, so next time, I'll def eat 4 Spicy Pork tacos at once. . . I am so impressed with Mark Manguera and Roy Choi - what a way to jumpstart an entire mobile food truck frenzy!
