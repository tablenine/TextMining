Service like a knee to the groin. . . Deli case filled with bland and over-salted mush.. . Yes, the baked goods are by-and-large nice. The Semolina bread is fantastic, as can be some of the desserts (if you like desserts). And the cheese selection is nice. . . It is the management: Surly. Unhelpful. Careless. Insincere. Horrid. Just call ahead and TRY to order something not specifically on their list. Go ahead. But protect your groin.. . I only go here in desperation, and almost invariably regret the decision.. . Atlanta has been held hostage by this mediocrity for too long. Fortunately for us, there is now H&amp;F (you have to get it at Savor, etc. since they stopped selling retail direct, but at least you can have their excellent breads) and Bakeshop (yeah, the baguette isn't blistered enough, but most of the breads are beautiful).. . Shame.
