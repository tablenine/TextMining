best parmegean cheese ever, my daughter eats a whole container with nothing else, its creepy. theyre olives are awesome too. I love that they have gelato and spices and oils from italy that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else. the staff is very helpful, everytime i make anything italian i stop here for advice. the sandwiches are great too although they have been slipping in quality
