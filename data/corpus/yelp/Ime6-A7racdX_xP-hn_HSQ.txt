Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
My friend wanted to go eat Korean BBQ for her belated b-day celebration so I did some research on Yelp and found this place!  I'm giving this place five stars even though they ran out of that rice noodle wrap stuff, because they gave us that egg/tofu dish as a substitute, and near the end of the night, they gave us all free shots of yogurt soju! =)  The waitresses were very nice and let me take pictures of the food and meat before they helped us cook it on our grills.  They were also very prompt at bringing us all the items we asked for.  The place was clean and the food was also very delicious - I'd have to say that it was better than all the AYCE Korean BBQ places I've been to.  They also let me leave my car in their parking lot for awhile after we left the restaurant to go on a Metro adventure to LA Live...and my car was safe and sound when we returned! =)  How can I not give this place five stars after the great service, food and niceness?!
