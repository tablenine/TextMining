I kinda had qualms about going to a place called Geisha House, but since I was going to an Asian American promoters party, I thought it kinda evened out. Or maybe it just screams irony. Whatever...I thought this place was cool, and I could imagine it having some really good parties. The layout was great, multiple floors, never felt too crowded, and it was easy to get a drink. I think all the crappiness of the place came from who was throwing the party, so it might have just been that night. The DJ sucked, and the line was hella slow. I would come back.
