Restaurant: Adobo Grill
Category: Latin American
I went to Adobo Grill this past weekend on a date because a friend told me about the awesome, made-at-your-table guacamole. We showed up really hungry and without a reservation and the host told us there was a wait or we could sit in the bar area where they served the full menu, so we sat there.. . We ordered cocktails, which were delicious, and guacamole right away. Two seconds later out comes our guac...already made?!?!? Apparently in the bar seating, they don't make it at your table and charge the same price?? Boo, hiss!. . My enchiladas were decent and my date said his chicken dish, I can't remember which one, lacked flavor. The service was very fast, even to the point of being rushed. I know it was a Saturday night but when you shell out $70 including tip, you shouldn't be shooed out of your table after 45min.
