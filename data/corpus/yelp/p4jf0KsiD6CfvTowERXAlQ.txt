Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
On a Wednesday night at 6:40, there was a 1 hour wait for a table. ONE HOUR!!! Â That's how popular this little "hole in the wall" joint is! (It's a pretty small restaurant) After a good hour walking around the neighborhood and picking up some tasty Molly's Cupcakes next door to Sushi Toro, we were finally seated! TWO HUNGRY DINERS!. . RATINGS. . Overall: 4/5 (Mitch's special rolls are just too special and too tasty). . Taste: 4/5 (You can't beat fresh fish!). . Originality: 4/5 (Mitch's special rolls are just...too unique!). . Plating: 3.5/5 (The kamikaze and futo fell flat, but everything else redeemed them!). . Value: 4/5 (A good deal for a sushi joint serving high quality fish and sushi!). . Service: 4/5 (Hard to complain about anything but the wait! The waitresses were polite, quick, and got all our orders right). . Final Words? We may come back just to try all the other rolls on the menu!! The long wait was worth it, but it really is TOO DARN LONG!
