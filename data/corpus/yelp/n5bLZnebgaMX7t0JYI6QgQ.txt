Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
We came here for my friend's birthday and loved the experience. Just be prepared to work for your food (crawfish is really really hard to get full on, you gotta eat a ton). But its such a fun place to go with large groups.. . I love having butcher paper as your table cloth and just wrapping it up and throwing it out. No plates? GREAT. No utensils? GREAT? Just a bib and sack of food, with a cold newcastle is a great day.. . We ordered pounds of the crawfish, shrimp, potato, sausage, and corn combos. We also ordered five/six crabs, and a couple orders of the cajun fries. I LOVE the cajun fries, a great way to start off and sort of pre-game for the attack on your stomach to come.. . You gotta love a sack of food in a clear bag placed in front of you, which after a little pause, you rip open and begin sucking crawfish shells, chomping on spicy sausage, and ripping through perfect corn. Its just a great combination of spicy, char, and intense flavor from the cajun spices. All in all, its a great value because if you are with a huge group you can just get bags of one item, we ended up probably paying about 15 bucks a person with beers. . . Bottom line: its a really fun place to eat seafood and have fun smearing stuff all over and reliving what its like to eat as a kid. Only with adult food.
