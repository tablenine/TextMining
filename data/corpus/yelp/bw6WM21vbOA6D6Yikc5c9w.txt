I love this place! This is one of my favs! Try the Dolce Vita, or the veggie sandwich, everything here is sooo good and sooo fresh. Also, don't leave without trying the frozen coconut! Delicious! Everything here is good, it is a nice place to go unplug for a little while. It is right on Auburn and Randolph. I recommend you go here a.s.a.p. !!!
