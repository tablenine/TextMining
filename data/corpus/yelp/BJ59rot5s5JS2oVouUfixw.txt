I haven't eaten here in years and years, but my husband and I frequent the retail store for sushi grade fish.  It really is amazing-- the fish is cheaper than it is at publix and the quality is infinitely better.  If you can't purchase through a restaurant source, I think the Fish Market's retail shop is your best option for at-home-sushi and seafood in general.
