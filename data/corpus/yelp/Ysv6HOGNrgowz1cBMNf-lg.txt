Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Never again!!!. . I chose My Father's Office in Culver City to meet my two friends as there was plenty of parking and I remembered the Montana location as being pretty good...many, many years ago. . . Unfortunately, I was running late and my friends ordered food and drinks for me.  When I arrived there was a line (?) to get in.  I explained to the "security" at the door that my food was waiting and my friends were inside saving my table.  Security insisted I  queue in a line of 40 others  waiting to get in.   I chose the right thing by calling my friends and having them join me at BEACON.  We had a fantastic meal and a fine bottle of wine.  It turned in to a most positive experience.  Thanks to My Father's Office I finally tried BEACON.  There are so many other choice restaurants in my neighborhood, I will never have to go back to My Father's Office Culver City again.. . Oh... the one star... is strictly for the parking lot!!!
