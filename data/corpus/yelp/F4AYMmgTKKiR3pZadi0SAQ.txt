Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Looks like a complete dive when you walk in. I think there are a total of 8 tables in the whole place so I wasn't expecting much.  I was proved wrong because the sushi was great.  It was so fresh and the rolls were huge!  It's right near my apartment so I have a feeling I"ll be eating at Toro pretty often. The best part was the bill...finally an affordable sushi restaurant.
