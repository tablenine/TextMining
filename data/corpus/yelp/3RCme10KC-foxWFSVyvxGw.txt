Let me preface this by saying that I never step into an ice cream shop to purchase ANYTHING without actually purchasing some ice cream. Damn lactose tolerance condition gives me the shakes if I don't feed it with some sort of frozen dairy concoction at least a few times a week. . . Let me preface that preface by saying, **usually**. . See, I had eaten a big breakfast, late afternoon snack, and while on the way to a friend's dinner party, I figured it might be nice if I picked up some of those infamous Milk cookies I'd been hearing about. . . As I stepped inside, don't think the ice cream gods didn't come calling. The little ice crystals twinkling off the top of the frozen milk seemed to say "look at us, Veronica! look how beautiful we are! you know you can't resist!". . "NO ice cream gods, you will not win this time! You will not ruin my dinner!". . I had to cower in the corner of the shop just to shut out the voices calling my name. Yet all in all, I was successful. To the cookie counter I went. . . An assorted dozen later, those cookies were a total hit at the dinner party. Milk, you certainly live up to the reputation. I will admit, Diddy Riese can kick your snickerdoodle's ass, but that ooey gooey chocolate chip concoction had me bowing down in complete submission.. . Now, back to that ice cream discussion...
