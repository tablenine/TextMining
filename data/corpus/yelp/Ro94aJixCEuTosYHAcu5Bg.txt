Delicious fresh-baked bread.  Good desserts, though not all are available by-the-slice.  There is a small amount of seating, and a larger patio if you don't mind sitting outside.  The hot foods line does take a few minutes to prepare your food.  They have a few too many things crammed into the space, making it a little challenging to get around, but all-in-all, I like it.  Will review again after trying more dishes.  Also want to try the gelato.
