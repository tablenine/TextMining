this place is a sausage fest. it's packed. it's river north obnoxious at its worst. the food is meh. the drinks are pricey and it's just in a good location. location good. outdoor seating is a total lie--sorry--don't think the roll up windows count at all. hideous and a mobile lincoln park trixie fave.
