Category: Steakhouses
The 55 day dry-aged ribeye was quite possibly the best steak I've ever had.  That alone is enough to make the restaurant 5 stars.  Was also served by a super helpful and entertaining waiter. The ambiance and decor were more casual and underwhelming than I expected.  The bone marrow and kobe beef sashimi were good but not standouts.  . . Still 5 stars just for the fact that the 55 day dry-aged ribeye was the epitome of a steak.
