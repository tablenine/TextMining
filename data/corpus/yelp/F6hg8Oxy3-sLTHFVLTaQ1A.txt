Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I almost never eat alone at dining establishments but after watching an episode of Man vs. Food LA about Philippe the day before, I couldn't resist stopping at Philippe while driving through Chinatown on the way home. . . The last time I went to Philippe, it was probably about 7 years ago. I don't think anything has changed at all here in the 7 years. Heck, nothing probably has changed here in the 100 years or so it has been open. . . I ordered the beef dipped sandwich, a bowl of chili, and a cup of the 75c lemonade to wash down all the food. You would be hard pressed to find a french dipped sandwich anywhere which taste better. The chili was very ordinary and of course you can't expect too much out of lemonade that cost 75c.  Don't forget to try the spicy mustard if you like mustard.  I really enjoyed that with my dip.. . It won't take 7 years for me to visit this place again, that's for sure. 4.5 stars if I could give half stars but for now, I will leave it at 4.
