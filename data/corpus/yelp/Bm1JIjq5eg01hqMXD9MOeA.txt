Restaurant: Two Urban Licks
Category: Bars
I like to call this place "Two Urban Dicks".  This place sucks big time.  The food and drinks are over-priced, the music/band is always too loud and the suburbanite/conference attending clientele perpetuates the hype of this mediocre restaurant.  I think people fall in love with the decor, which is the only great thing about this place.  They think that for some reason it's a really good restaurant that serves great food.  That and the fact that it's owned by the over-hyped Concentrics Group make it irresistable for some reason I cannot seem to understand.  The service is described as "snooty" and "cold" by other reviewers and I certainly have experienced that at Two.  I personally find the food boring, uninspired and not consistent.. . If you do happen to still want to eat at Two, you probably do not want to valet your car.  I know someone whose car was stolen from the valet lot and I heard it was most likely an inside job.  The valet is an independent company (only contracted by the restaurant) and for some reason, Two management hasn't gotten rid of them despite the fact that they have almost run me and several other people over while trying to park the cars.  If you have a really nice car, make sure you watch them park it.  They like to drive your really nice cars really fast through the little lot and over the speed bumps.  If you do not valet your car, you will have to park on the street though, since the rest of the lot is reserved and you will get booted.. . [Note:  Why do so many people write in their reviews that it's acceptable/cool/OK to make a reservation and then have to wait 20-30 minutes for your table????  That's NOT cool...that's really bad management/customer service.  This place isn't worth it...trust.]
