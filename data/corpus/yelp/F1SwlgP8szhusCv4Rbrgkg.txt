Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
I'm absolutely shocked that The Majestic didn't rate higher with the locals, so I'm going to give it 5 stars.  I used to live 2 blocks away from this place so I would go in the late mornings or early afternoons after all the drunk revelers had already passed out for the day and at home nursing their hangovers.  A couple of years ago, The Majestic was a grimy little 24-hour breakfast place, but I'm guessing someone bought it and tried to take advantage of it's kitschiness.  Now there are nebbishly cute litte hipsters who work the kitchen and waitstaff.  Granted, I miss the middle-aged gay man with the bouffant hairdo serving me my grits, but I've never had a complaint with any of the service.  However, don't expect the food to be any different than any other breakfast place.  It's certainly not any worse.  Since the Dunk n' Dine went belly-up, this is really the only 24-hour shop I'll eat my breakfast at.
