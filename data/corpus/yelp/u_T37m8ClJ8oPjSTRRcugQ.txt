Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
I walk by Ping Pong every day.  I never thought I was trendy enough to try it, but boy am I glad I went in.  I went with two girlfriends I hadn't seen in ages and we had the best time.  We had a much longer wait then what we were quoted, but we drank our wine and were content.  We took our time with our meal.  We first ordered the potstickers, they were fantastic.  After eating those we ordered soup.  I had chicken noodle, the chicken was so fresh, I was impressed.  One of my friends had a salad and it looked delicious and the other friend had the hot and sour soup.  Apparently there is a bit of a kick to it.  For dinner we ordered three different dishes.  We ordered the beef and broccoli, ping pong chicken and cashew chicken.  All three were great.  The staff never pressured us to order quickly or push us out after we were done.  I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu.  I see Ping Pong becoming my new favorite Asian restaurant in the city.
