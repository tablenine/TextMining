MEAT.  I WANT MEAT!!!  And lots of it...that's what she said ;). . You cannot beat the price of this place and the quality of meat.  For those NOT watching their diet I rec commend the following.. . -Get there about an hour before you plan to eat because it takes a while to get seats.. -Sign up on the sheet for the LARGE plate and put "FATTY" in the notes section. -Also add to the notes "At the bar across the way". -Go to that bar across the way, sit outside (dress warm if it's cold), order a pitcher of beer and some appetizers and hang out until the Shabu Shabu Nazi comes by to tell you to close out. - Finally FEAST!!!!  . . The meat literally melts in your mouth.  My mouth is watering as I type.  I'm hungry now.  Damn it!
