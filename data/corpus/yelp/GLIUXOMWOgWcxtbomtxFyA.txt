Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
This is in some respects very much like a mini Dean &amp; Deluca.....but in other respects not. So yes, the people that come to shop here are perhaps on the snottier side and the space is so tiny that you're rubbing (or in some cases - jabbing) elbows but the two things that will definitely bring me back:. . 1. The amazing, high quality food that is complete eye candy and tastes equally yummy. The cheese counter alone was luscious, and makes my mouth water just thinking about it, and this is coming from someone with a major sweet tooth!!. . 2. The super super super nice staff. We ordered a bunch of items (salads, roasted vegetables, pate, cornichons, cupcakes) for a picnic and the woman helping us was lovely and made sure that we had all the utensils and napkins we needed as well as some sliced baguette for our pate. Lovely.. . I heart Joan's on Third.
