I've been here a couple of times and I cant say I'm a big fan but I still give it 4 stars because of the service. I have to agree with everyone, garlic noodles are delicious. The chocolate lava cake is awesome too. I dont know about the halibut... I wasn't impressed at all. I would order something else if I go again..
