review is of sub 51 on a saturday night...3 stars for sure.. . stop #3 on the bach party barcrawl train.  after deciding not to wait in line at social 25 (after making a reservation, hmmm) we headed over to sub 51.  one of the girls in our group knew someone, so we didn't wait in line - score.. . it was crowded but not so packed that you couldn't move.  dj was playing some good mixes.  i don't remember how much a drink cost, but obviously nothing that outrageous if i'm not still brooding about it.. . i think sub 51 is kind of meh, but i wasn't there long enough to really get into it.  nothing terrible, but certainly nothing great.  maybe i'll be back?
