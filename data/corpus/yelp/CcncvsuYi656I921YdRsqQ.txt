Disclaimer: based on a vegetarian perspective.. We ordered:.  the seafood dumpling, chicken dumpling, pork dumpling and the vegetarian glass noodle dumpling.. My boy friend raves about the meat dumplings here so I was pretty hopeful for my vegetarian dumplings.. I must say I was slightly disappointed about receiving 10 bite-sized gumdrop dumplings in a steamed pot at about $10 a plate.. That's like a dollar per mouthful.. Ok content:. I did enjoy the seafood dumplings, aside from the price-serving size ration being a little ridiculous, it had a good flavor and I appreciate the variety of sauces they have on the table.. My boyfriend devoured the meat dumplings, but I on the other hand, took a bite into my vegetarian noodle dumpling and gagged.. It was like chewing on sand.. I couldn't figure out what was in them to produce that scratchy sand consistency, but I was completely turned off.. The fact that all the glass noodles were tiny broken off pieces also contributed to the feeling that I was swallowing a mouthful of very earthy, fertile dirt with all the wormy fix-ins. As a vegetarian and this being the ONLY vegetarian option, I am not a fan.
