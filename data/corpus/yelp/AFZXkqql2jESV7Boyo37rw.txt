This place is really a niche for vegetarians in the city. I myself am not one, but I did not miss the meat at all. The chef really takes pride in making sure all of the vegetables are really fresh. The fruit juices are to die for. I wasn't fond of the Asian themed dishes- they were really too saucy. I think Asian food is probably best left to hole in the wall Asian restaurants. However, I recommend any of the salads, the sliders, and even the corn is pretty good.
