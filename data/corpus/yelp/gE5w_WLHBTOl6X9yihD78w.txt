Went to brunch here with a group of friends.  There were enough of us that we were able to make a reservation and it was really nice not to have to wait.  On a Sunday morning, there gets to be quite a line at Toast!  We sat outside at a sidewalk table, and while these tables have lots of ambiance, they're a little cramped.  The guy at the table behind me kept getting up and banging his chair into mine, and we were definitely privvy to the conversations of people at nearby tables.. . The food was pretty darn good.  I had the berry French toast and would give it a thumbs up.  It's not the very best French toast I've ever had in my life, but it's certainly pretty good.  My husband created his own omelet and was very happy with the results.  Service was fairly quick, especially considering how busy this place is on a weekend.. . I would return to Toast, but probably at an off-peak hour.  I'm not a huge fan of lines and the crowds, although that's probably why most people go here.  Trendy, you know?  Frankly, there are better breakfast places in town where you won't have to wait and you can have a little more personal space.
