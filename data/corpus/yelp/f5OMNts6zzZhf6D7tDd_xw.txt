Category: American (Traditional)
this place is awful, really, it is. their burgers are sub par and WAY overpriced. not only that, but what place charges more for a veggie burger than another burger?. . most of their burgers are around $9. it is 75 cents extra if you want a black bean burger and $3 extra if you want a buffalo burger, chicken breast, or turkey burger substituted. That makes a $13 burger! You have got to be kidding me. . . Their patio is so ridiculous. It is cramped and it closes at 11pm. They seated our table of 8 at 10pm then tell us this afterwards. . . Not only is this place a rip off, not cute, and serves icky, unimaginable overpriced food, but the service is also snobby and sucky. There is no sign saying "you must be assigned a seat, prior to seating yourselves", outside. We sat down, then had a server come up and tell us that we need to ask where we can sit before seating ourselves. we were the only table outside. Come on!. . Waste of money and time. Try Moody's or Taste of Heaven Across the street.. . I have been to this place 5 times, and it has always been awful.
