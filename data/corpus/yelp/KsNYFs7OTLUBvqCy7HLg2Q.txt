CHEESE ROLLS.. . That's all that needs to be said.  This place is AMAZING.  I went here with the recommendations from one of my friends and I must say it did not disappoint.  I went here on my way home to San Diego and stopped by only to find a huge line.  Being discouraged at first, I waited it out and only waited at the max 10 minutes.  This place is BUSY.  I was told to order the cheese rolls and guava cheese strudels.  Both DO NOT disappoint!  I can't really explain it.  You just have to try it.  . . This place gets a 5 star.  I don't think it gets better than this as far as pastries goes.
