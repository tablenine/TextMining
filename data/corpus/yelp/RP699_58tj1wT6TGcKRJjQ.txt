When I first heard about Kogi, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Korean BBQ taco truck? Did I hear right? This was certainly a novel concept. So after waiting in the long line, I finally got my chance to see what Kogi was all about. The verdict? Amazing flavor, unlike anything I have had before. I tried the chicken, pork, and short rib tacos, but I think that the short rib tacos were the best of the three. The tacos are rather small so make sure to bring enough money (cash only) for more than just a couple. After one bite you'll be wanting more and more!
