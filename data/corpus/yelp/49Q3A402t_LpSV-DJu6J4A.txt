Restaurant: Apres Diem

I love Apres Diem. I've been going there for a while. I used to go there during my lunch break. The Fattoush salad is delish. It has grilled eggplant with the perfect amount of a light dressing. Â The chicken foccacia sandwich, roasted portobello sandwich, and the gyro are all on point. I have not had anything there that I didn't like. They have good calamari, but its not the best thing i've ever had, but it isn't bad. Also, they have a beautiful array of deserts. You must try one when you go. I don't usually order deserts, but one of my friends always ordered a desert when we go. The place is GREAT! Go at night, they have live music.
