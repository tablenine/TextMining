I don't usually like ramen (im more of a udon man) however this is by far the best ramen I've ever had. The broth is great, the egg is amazing and the pork is the best part. Usually I don't like ramen because the broth is extremely salty but here that's not the case. I went with 4 people and we all ordered ramen and a pitcher of kirin and it came out to around $12 a person.
