Yuck, yuck. I stumbled upon this place late on a Saturday night, seeking a place for dinner after a late arrival into ATL. It was one of few (if the only) option in the area still serving food at this hour.. . If you're a beer person, there might be some redeeming qualities about this place. But I'm not.. . Three things are particularly important to me in a restaurant: quality of food, service and overall atmosphere. This place struck out in all three. Service was painfully slow -- took nearly 10 minutes sitting at the bar before anyone bothered to take my order. Meanwhile, I was practically deafened by the countless TV screens blaring college fooball games at painfully high decibels. I never even knew who was my actual server, I think ultimately the manager served my food because most of the waitstaff were gathered around chatting in a corner.. . Not much for atmosphere either, even for a late Saturday night, the place was enormous, but nearly empty. Should have been a warning sign, but I was starving and needed a drink (stat) after a 4-hr flight from the West Coast. So I braved it.. . I ordered the fish tacos after being reassured by the bartender they were a good option. Super bland and served with *cold* fries(!?!). Fail.. . Ewww... that's all.
