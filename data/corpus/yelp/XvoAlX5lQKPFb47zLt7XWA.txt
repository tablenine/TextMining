Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I would have given this place 4 stars, but I deducted one for the long wait time for a table which makes it inconvineient to go here without budgeting half your day for this one meal.. I do love the crab and pork xiao long bao since you can actually see and taste the crab.  The veggie dumplings are great as well.  I am not a fan if the shrimp shaomai, probably because I am more used to a fattier/greasier version in those hole in the wall places.. The food here is very good, but not so good to justify the 20-60 minute wait, depending on when you go.  The restaurant is nice inside for a Chinese place and they do take credit cards.
