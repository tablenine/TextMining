This place is small and there's no parking.  The have an extensive tequila list, that's good.  They don't even have any draft beers, that's bad.  Their food was crap too.  . . Much of my dislike of this place was having to meet a friend I didn't want to see, so my review may be a bit tainted.  I did eat a lot of xanax beforehand, so I think my dislike of the bar is genuine, despite that.
