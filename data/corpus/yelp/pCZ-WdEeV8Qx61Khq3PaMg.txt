My first Jean-George experience with a couple of friends.  Would've given two and half stars if I could.  First off, I want to give props to the servers who were very helpful and attentive.  As for the food, I wasn't impressed, in fact pretty disappointed.  I just don't understand how you charge those prices for mediocre execution.  The plates didn't seem that complicated.  I wanted to like it, and I really don't mind paying the prices, but the food wasn't up to par.  I don't think it was me either, I went with a couple of friends and we agreed that maybe one out of the eight plates were all right.  As the plates came out, we kept making excuses for them, but when we got ice cream that was more icy than creamy, we were kinda frowning.  The space is nice though seemed a little too dim at our table.
