Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
My brother wanted to try out this place 'cause of all the tourist hype so we went on a Thursday night. . . - Ordered the Millennium dog. - Guadalajara dog. - Ozzy dog. - America the Beautiful dog. - a bacon chili cheese dog and a tamale topped with chili.. . Pros: Chili is there specialty, so I recommend ordering anything off the super special menu with chili. The proportions are very big so I'm pretty sure you'll be full with whatever you order. You're order's made in decent time too so there's not much wait for that.. . Cons: I recommend NOT ORDERING ANY HOTDOG WITH GUACAMOLE. It's not even good guacamole and it'll make your buns all soggy, more so than the chili, but the chili's actually good.. . Besides the food, the location is in west hollywood.. I've never been around that area so I thought it was pretty sketchy. Parking may be hard to find too and of course there's the long line.. . Conclusion, decent food but NOT WORTH 40 minute drive + 1 hour wait
