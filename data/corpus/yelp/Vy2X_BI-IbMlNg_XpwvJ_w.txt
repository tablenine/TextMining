Came here with Gary F. a few months back... very long wait - it was on the weekend so I'm not surprised.... . It was fairly small inside and can seat about 40 people (cramped!). Â I had heard a few good things about the place so we waited.. . When we were finally seated, we proceeded with ordering the usuals yellowtail (sashimi), salmon, halibut, fatty tuna (yummmmm), spanish mackeral, unagi, salmon skin handroll.... . It was good - but forgettable... . . Gary liked the yellowtail so much, he got a second order of the sashimi for himself.. . The fish was fresh, and the prices were okay.. . Just a little too crowded for my taste for "average good" sushi.. . I still think that Uzen, a few miles away is much better... but that's just me.
