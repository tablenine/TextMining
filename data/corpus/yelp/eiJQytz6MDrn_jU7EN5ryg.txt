Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya is hands down one of the best ramen shops in L.A.  The broth is rich and has the right amount of saltiness, the noodles are chewy and not too soft, and the fatty kurobuta pork literally melts in your mouth.  The size of the ramen is fairly large, and all but those with the largest of appetites won't need anything else.  If I'm super hungry, I'll get the combination with the oyakodon, but then I'll invariably end up full beyond belief and have those mixed feelings of slight regret and total satiation that you get from overeating.  The wait time can be long, but if you can read Japanese, you can amuse yourself with some of the manga in the front, or you could watch the small TV they have in the front.  Along with Santouka, this is is one of my favorite ramen places in the region.
