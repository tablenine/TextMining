Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I didn't really know what to expect coming into Jerry's, but I was extremely pleasantly surprised!  It was a Friday night, and after a long week at work I didn't want to go out for "just sandwiches."  I realized that we were in for something more as soon as we walked through the door.  It's a beautiful, comfy, swanky room with exposed timber framing, cute cooking utensil "chandeliers" and a warm inviting fireplace.  We had to wait a little for a table so we parked ourselves at the bar where we discovered the AMAZING beer selection-both draft and bottle!  I think I actually discovered my new favorite beer there, Rogue Hazelnut Nut Brown Ale--YUM!  The sandwich selection was so extensive I just ended up pretty much closing my eyes and pointing, and that's what I got.  Turkey with avocado, brie and honey mustard...  so good!  Props for offering 2 choices for sides and a significant selection of breads for my sandwich to be served on.  I highly recommend the focaccia with oven-roasted tomatoes on top.  The sides were small, but yummy.  All-in-all I loved this place, and I can't wait to go back!
