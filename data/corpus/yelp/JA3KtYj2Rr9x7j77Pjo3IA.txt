Happy Birthday, Dad!!!. . For my dad's 64th, we went to Green Zebra for brunch.   OOOOh I cannot wait to come for brunch again!!  First of all, we had reservations at 11 and it was not crowded AT ALL.  As we left at 1, it was starting to get busier.  SCORE- a lunch place that isn't crazy crowded....AND is delicious!!!  *high five to myself* (I just pictured that and it looked like the top half of a jumping jack).. . I got the grits with poached egg, mushrooms and mustard greens.  First of all, I love mustard greens, they make everything taste good.  They definitely made my grits flippin' awesome.  The grits were different than grits I've had before, more dense and creamy with a yellowish tint, almost like a savory custard.  The eggs were perfectly placed on top and the combo of all of the above was like a bomb diggity in my mouth.. . My dad and step mom got the rhubarb german pancakes, which were also delicious!  Neither of them needed syrup.  I'm sure it helps that we are all kind of in love with rhubarb, but those pancakes were great (I tried some).  Our cousins got a frisee salad with egg and eggs benedict.  They seemed quite pleased with both.. . For my dad's birthday, they brought out a little carrot cake for him to eat with a candle.  It was cute and delicious.  Also, the server was great and humored us when my dad was trying to joke around with him.  He definitely gets a star for that!. . I can't wait to go back and try more, but ... I also want the same thing I had again.  It's a tough life.
