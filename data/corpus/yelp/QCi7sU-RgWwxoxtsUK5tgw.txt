I haven't tried dinner here, after hitting up another club in the area we came here on a Thursday night. The place wasn't empty but no where near overly-packed. The set-up and decor was pretty cool, I liked that there was a somewhat separated dining area and then the bar/clubbish area to the side, as well as the large buddhas everywhere. Drinks were regularly-priced and the bartenders were fast. Music was ok- it was all house/trance, which I like, however the selection they were playing wasn't the best. Wouldn't come here for an entire night out but I'd come back for a late night stop again.
