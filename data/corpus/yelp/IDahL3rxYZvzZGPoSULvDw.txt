Where do i begin?  This is my favorite summer spot.  Sangria + outdoor seating + nice weather= great times!  I frequent this place in the summer as it's the best time to go.  I've been a few times in the winter, but it's way to dark in there and hard to walk through.  The food is great...oh man the blue burger is the best thing in the edgewater neighborhood.  The drawback is the service!  They can take forever take your order!  It seems a bit understaffed on the busy nights!  This place could be so much better if it was staffed right in the summer time!
