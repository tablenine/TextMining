Don't get it.  Shane's is so much better and serves the same kind of food.. Okay, the atmosphere is kitschy fun, and I like the egg cream sodas.. The food is just all right though -- leaning towards mediocre.. There is nothing wrong with this place--although i did see a cockroach on the bar/counter once. (With all that stuff everywhere its a wonder I don't see more of them.).  But why anyone would want to eat the icky industrial cookies they give away sometimes is beyond me.  . Burgers are better at Shanes, at Zaytoons, were better at Homage even.
