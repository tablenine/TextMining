Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
I'm lovin Friendship as my go to Chinese place with solid quality food that doesn't require me to spend a fortune.  The Tuesday special is a great deal and I would be the perfect setting for a "girl's night out" event.  My companion and I scoped it out recently, toting along our 6 pack of beer.  We started it off with the appetizer sampler which is far too much for even two of the hungriest foodies around.  It was a good way to get introduced to all the appetizers I hear people raving about.  The crab rangoon and bbq ribs were delish.  I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was the best I've had.  The service was a bit spotty but I was happy to get in and out during the Tuesday night special without much wait or reservations.  The location is a bit odd for your average North or South sider but since we live just West it was perfect.
