This awesome Mexican restaurant is always packed because they not only have the best food, but the best margaritas. I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas with mole sauce and they were incredible. I also love their regular lime margaritas. They are so tasty. I spent under $38.00 for two entrees and a half a pitcher of lime margaritas. I will definitely be back.
