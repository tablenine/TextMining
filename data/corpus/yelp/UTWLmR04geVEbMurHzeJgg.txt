Category: Japanese
the main draw for this ramen place isn't really the excellent ramen (the ramen itself is fairly okay (mr. ramen &amp; daikokuya are better choices), but the crazy customizing you can do to your bowl of ramen. mainly, the heat factor.. . the spicier the soup, the lower the rating. they warn you about ordering the #1 and #2 levels of spicy ramen, but really, what bad could come from a little spiciness. . . seriously, a lot. my foolish (but well-meaning) partner thought it would be funny to order the #2 ramen so he could have his polaroid taken and put up on the "wall of champions" i.e. people who have finished the crazy spicy ramen bowls in under 30 minutes. he didn't think it was funny spending the next 24 hours in painful toilet land. . . i had the #4 with the shoyu broth. i thought it was a little salty, but then again, it was a salt broth. what did i think it was going to taste like? rainbows? seriously, it should've tasted like rainbows.
