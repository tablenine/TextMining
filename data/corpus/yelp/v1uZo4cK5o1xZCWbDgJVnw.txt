Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Plenty of drunken late night memories at Fred's, some of which I can't really recall. But to date, I must say this is my fave late night diner in LA. Really fun menu, great service, funny tshirts, reasonable prices, GOOD COFFEE, and yummy yummy mac n cheese. . . Random, but the bathrooms are SO COOL..both the guys &amp; girls!! Ended up at Fred 62 late wasted one night after a show. My kind-of-date was so boring I ended up entertaining myself playing with the blacklights in the bathroom for a little too long.. . Parking sucks &amp; some nights the wait is excruciatingly long.
