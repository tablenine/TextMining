My husband and I were visiting on vacation and we could see a few restaurants from our window but we could not decide where to go. So, we just decided to walk and see what intrigued us. We ended up eating at this restaurant and I'm so glad we did! . To start, the restaurant is split in to 2 sides. A pub setting or a dining room setting. I thought this was awesome so you can choose if you want loud or quiet. We chose the quiet room, makes for a romantic dinner.  They have great paintings on the wall that compliment the room. We had great service from the moment we walked in the door. From the hostess to the servers and busers.  My husband ordered the beer sampler to start off. And to our surprise they werent tiny shot glasses with only a sip in them. They were big shot glasses that were very well portioned. We got onion rings for an appetizer, very good. They are huge! Both of us ordered salads for dinner, which were outstanding. Only fresh ingredients. Overall, a great restaurant, we will return if in Chicago!!
