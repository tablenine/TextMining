I can't believe I haven't done a review for Din Tai Fung yet!. . Din Tai Fung has bar-none, the best xiao long baos.  If you're eating here and did not order them, there's something wrong with you.. . Din Tai Fung has been around in Asia for YEARS, but the son of one of the original founders opened one here.  In L.A..  Arcadia of all places.  Smart man.  Anyway, onto the food.... . You HAVE TO order the Steamed Pork Xiao Long Bao.  There's no question.  This is the only place I eat xiao long bao "the way it was supposed to be eaten".. . 1.  Pour some vinegar to the shredded ginger. (Xiao long bao's are always served with shredded ginger and Chinese black vinegar.). 2.  Gently pick up a xiao long bao with the chopsticks and make sure that you DO NOT break the skin.. 3.  Gently dip the xiao long bao in the ginger vinegar sauce.. 4.  Lift it up and place it on the spoon.. 5.  Nibble the side of the xiao long bao and suck the soup/broth inside.. 6.  Eat the rest as you like.. . You don't have to eat them this way, but if you're looking for the entire experience, you can follow those steps.. . Din Tai Fung also has Steamed Vegetable and Shrimp Dumplings.  Both of which are good too, but trust me, just get the Pork Xiao Long Bao.. . If Xiao Long Bao or Dumplings aren't your thing (why are you even eating here anyway then?), they also have soup noodles and fried rice.. . Din Tai Fung is located in Arcadia, where there are a lot of other Chinese places around that also serve xiao long bao.  However, Din Tai Fung's xiao long bao are world famous and you can tell before you even eat them by how long you have to wait to be seated.  Be sure to always get a reservation!
