The cookies are sooo good. Cranberry-oatmeal or iced lemon or chocolate chip... fantastic. My husband loves their little baby apple pies too. The coffee is fresh and good.. . I haven't cared much for their soups (I've tried split pea and cream of tomato), but their salads and sandwiches are pretty good. The focaccia bread is wonderful - slightly salty.. . A little expensive (somehow I never spend less than ten dollars when buying a couple of cookies?) but very good.
