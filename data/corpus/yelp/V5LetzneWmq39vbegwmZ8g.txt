had the defining meal of a vegan restaurant - caesar salad.  and it was delicious.  especially after that article in the nyt saying we're all going to die if we eat red meat, i think i'm going to be going back here and often.. . it was really crowded, almost too crowded, thus the 4 stars.  felt kind of claustrophobic for some reason.. . but they serve beer, organic of course, which was cool.  guess beer is a plant-based food, hooray.
