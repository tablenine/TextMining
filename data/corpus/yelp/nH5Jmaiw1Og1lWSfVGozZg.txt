Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
They have amazing prime rib. I loved the unique way they served their food compared to other steakhouses and I love their sides and their spinning salad.. . The service is excellent and they were always very courteous and helpful throughout the meal.. . They offer various cuts of prime rib to choose from and definitely a place that you should at least try once.
