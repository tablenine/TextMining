The most amazing breakfast I've ever had. Ever. . . Started with a new yorker running around outside calling out people's names. Don't be deterred by the long list or the new yorker. He's super friendly. And the list disappears quite quickly. . . Ordered the some like it hot omelet, avocado, hot sauce, chicken sausage, eggs. Delicious. REALLY DELICIOUS. Best friend ordered the banana pancakes. Equally incredible. Spent the morning watching the SC game (from two weekends ago...NOT TODAY'S EPIC FAILURE) eating breakfast. The waiter was super nice, (pretty cute) and of course, an SC fan, so I loved him. Consumed the freshest orange juice you could find this far away from Florida. . . Completely unpretentious, total diner style. Sat at the communal table near the kitchen. Think  your adorable neighbor's house, the one with the 7 cats, the huge flat screen tv's, willing to cook for you for hours.... . What? You guys don't have neighbors like that?
