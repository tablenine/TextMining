This review is for the rice crispie treats only.  For five years I've been deprived of the biggest, gooiest, tastiest rice crispie treat ever.  Back in the student center at my college, they were there.  I ate them frequently, a 2"x2" block in one sitting.   Then I graduated and never saw them again... until one day while wandering around downtown.. . I stopped in my tracks.  Could it be?  Yes, yes it was.  I gave them a little squeeze - soft and marshmallowy, just like I remembered.  I immediately dug in - it brought me to a happier place.  Now, any time I'm remotely in the area - I must by one.  Going skating in the park?  I must hike down Michigan Ave for marshmalloy enjoyment.
