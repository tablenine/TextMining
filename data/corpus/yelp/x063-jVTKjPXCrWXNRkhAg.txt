Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Server was nice. Food was bad. It was so bad that once my husband took one bite of the STILL COLD meat that was supposed to be a burger, the we called the waiter over and he took the plate off the table, disgusted, without even saying a word. . It's pretty sad when even the waiter is disgusted with the food! It's got a great location though and I imagine if you just went there for drinks it'd be fun. . I did see Harrison Ford there though (since it's his son's place and all) which helped soften the blow a bit of the bad food at high prices.
