Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Pizza Mozza is definitely a happening place even on a Tuesday night and its a good thing I had reservations.  The place is pretty small with table seating and bar seating.  We had reserved a table so we were ok but there is no way, you could walk in without reservations and not expect a long wait for a table.  The bar seating was a bit more flexible.  Its also fairly noisy so dont expect an intimate dinner.. . Mozza is definitely doing their pizzas the right way.  They taste so good because they use the best ingredients and cheeses.  There is so much variety to choose from and my favorite was the funghi misti.  We also tried the Squash blossom pizza which had  a chunk of burrata cheese on it.  They were out of the little gem salad so we opted for the chopped salad which was pretty good too.  The pizzas are not too large and can be pricey but you know that when you walk in there.  . . We ended the night with the popular butterscotch budino...(pudding) and yummmmm.....we devoured it.  Definitely a good end to the meal.
