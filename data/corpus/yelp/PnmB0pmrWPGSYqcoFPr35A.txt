Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I grew up eating El Tepeyac. My mom used to bring home the Okie burrito for me OR their yummy tacos. There's a smaller location in Alhambra off Palm (near the Costco there). So, I already knew what I was getting myself into by FINALLY visiting the OG location in East LA.. . There was a line going way around the building... its a small little "mom and pop" shop so its hard to get a table especially during those popular eating times. We got a table probaly within 30 min. . . I ordered the Hollenbeck which is TO-DIE-FOR. It is very moist and tender and oh so yummy with all the fixin's inside. The guacamole adds an extra nice flavor to the burrito. The hot sauce is very good as well. . . Everyone else had the hollenbecks as well.. one other person ordered the Okie. Everyone with us was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. . . My mom will come to this location to pick up the Manny's Special for office parties and such. GREAT idea to share it (like a party sub). Perhaps I will do that for my work when we have our next event!. . Carne Asada, Machacca, or Carnitas all the way!. . I'm craving it... perhaps we'll take another visit tonight!
