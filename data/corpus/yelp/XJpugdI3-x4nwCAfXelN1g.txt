Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
The Geisha House, tucked away with a wonky entrance on a side street off Hollywood Blvd. has by far the freshest, most delicious sushi I've ever eaten.  Though pricier than an average sushi place, the atmosphere makes up for it.  It's a classy, beautifully designed restaurant with romantic lighting and hip appeal.  If you happen to be a fan of The Hills, this is one of the places where they usually go for dinner to.. . We decided to splurge and order the sashimi igloo - where your sashimi is presented with flower pedals decorating the outside of an actual igloo made of ice, housing your sashimi.  Impressive!. . If you're feeling fancy, and want to savor some amazing sushi, treat yourself and go to the Geisha House.  If you're lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of Heidi Montague.  In fact, when we got there, Brody Jenner was waiting outside the front doors.  When we were leaving he was still there...then as we turned the corner, we saw Lauren Conrad putting her car to valet.  Did she make him wait that whole time?!  Scandal!!
