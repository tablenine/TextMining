If I could give more stars, I would! Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. Started our meal with the Gnocchi appetizer, I had the Whitefish entree, he had the Braised Short Ribs - AMAZING!!!!. . Worth every penny they charge and I left satisfied, not gorged. If you've never been - you've got to go!!!
