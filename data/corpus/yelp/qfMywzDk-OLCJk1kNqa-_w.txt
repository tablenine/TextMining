3.5 stars I am very grateful to them for starting the food truck revolution, but now there are much better options rolling around.. . I thought the food was overly salted and way too spicy (and surprisingly I usually like really spicy, salty food) I tried all the tacos and the short rib was by far my favorite. Â I also had a chance to try a bit of my friends short-rib quesadilla and it was really good--next time that is what I will get. I will eat Kogi again, but only when it comes to me (but isn't that the beauty of it?)
