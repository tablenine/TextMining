Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Had the pleasure of coming here who is a taco fan like me. Though I got the chicken tamales ($2.60) and after comparing to Tom's tacos (Here's why I compared it . http://chowhound.chow..... ) this was a whole lot better! The lines here reminds me of Costco food court. You just find a line and order.  The ladies write down what you want and you pay when you pick up shortly afterwards. . . I really don't know why people hate this place? Perhaps its the annoying website? . http://www.titostacos.com. / Or maybe it's the always full parking lot?  Or maybe its just a pain in the arse to drive out, and out past LAX for a taco? For the price and quality, it's really worth stopping by if you are in the area. BTW, for my  tamales they give you this red meat sauce, it tasted like a kicked up version of meat stew. Not bad. Tom's does not have this on their menu.
