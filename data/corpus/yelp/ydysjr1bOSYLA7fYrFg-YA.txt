Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Brazilian
OMG!!! This place was the bomb dizzle.  The food was GREAT.  This wasn't my first Brazillian steak house experience so I knew what to expect, fasting of course.  My girlfriend and I were in the ATL visiting her family and decided we had to try Fogo while we were in town.  Everything was superb but the salad bar was a little small.  The service was excellent.  Everything just melt in your mouth...hmmm.  The lamb was our favorite.  We also tried the one in Beverly Hills and it did not compare to this one.  The meats weren't as flavorful.  If you're town, Fogo de Chao is a must.  I'm definitely going back.
