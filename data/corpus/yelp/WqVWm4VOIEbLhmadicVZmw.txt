This place was awesome once but I just think it has gone downhill since the Marietta Street location opened. I was there tonight and it was mediocre. The beer was good. The service was fair at best. We are a good tipping party of 5. We walked out the front door and there were 3 employees standing at the Host stand and not one of them said a word. That just topped it off for me. I have been back to this location many times since the other location opened and the food just doesn't taste as fresh as it once did.
