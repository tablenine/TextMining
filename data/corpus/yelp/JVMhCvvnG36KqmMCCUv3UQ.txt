Restaurant: Electric Lotus
Category: Indian
I first went to Electric Lotus for Indian food with a large group, which is always a scary way to try out a new place. Large groups can be quite a pain in the ass to servers and it shows in the service sometimes.. hence my fear. Couple that with mixed up orders or slower food arrival times, it can be quite a mess.. To my surprise, my fear was pleasantly gone within the first 5 minutes at the table. . There is a quaint bar (full bar service) at the front of the restaurant that is a great starting point when dining at Electric Lotus. Each time I've been there, I've seen the bartender slammed and still manage to take care of people at the bar. You walk in to a very dimly lit room filled with candlelit tables and booths surrounding. The booths have curtains on the outside and there is at least one (that I've seen) booth where you eat sitting on pillows. They also have rooms in the back and on the side that look like a lot of fun for large parties. Some nights they have a DJ, but they usually place really unique music. . The food is amazing. The menu is large, but not too overwhelming with options. They have a good selection for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. My personal favorite is the Tiger Prawns for Two meal (I believe it was $45 more or less and it can feed two to three people). They start you with Veggie Samosas served with mango and mint chutney. Then you get the Tiger Prawns with grilled veggies, Chicken Tikka Masala, choice of vegetable ( I love the Chana Masala), basmati rice, and naan (I upgrade to the Garlic Naan). They even give you a choice of dessert. . Great date place. Wonderful Ambiance. Not too kid friendly.
