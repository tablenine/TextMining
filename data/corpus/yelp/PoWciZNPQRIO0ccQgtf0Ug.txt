Category: Latin American
Porto's has the best strawberry shortcake!!. . They have all kinds of pastries, sandwiches, and drinks that are all really good.. . There are always really long lines, but very little wait because there are so many people to help behind the counter.  . . If you are in the area with a tummy that is growling for a cuban sandwich, I highly recommend Porto's. Oh! and try to leave room for dessert!  yuuuuummmmmmmeeeeeee....
