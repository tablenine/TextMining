Came here with a friend to use a Groupon that I'd bought. Had the Crispy pork belly and the seared sea scallops. The pork belly was really good but the scallops were so-so. My friend had the skate wing which she thought was a bit bland. Might have been cool to try other dishes but I probably won't be coming back.
