Ok, fellow yelpers - I really wanted to love this place as much as the majority of you do.  But it was hard with the amazing and nearly perfect (if it weren't for the HIGH prices) KAZU just down the block.  And at Kazu there is parking...but when we pulled into an empty parking lot here, and were then told we had to pay for valet - that's STRIKE ONE. . Ordered the spicy tuna crispy rice rolls - and yes, they were TASTY, very tasty - but not remarkable.  Tasted the same as the same rolls I have had at Koi and other places where they serve this delicious fried treat.  . . I also ordered the special baked crab hand roll which everyone recommended and which they have a similar (sounding) roll at Kazu.  Well...it was quite tasty as well, but there was something about it...something KRAB-like.  So we asked and the waitress begrudgingly admitted that yes, it was a "baked crab" roll...mixed with crab and KRAB.  Now, I know I may sound like a snob here, but I would expect a place with such a fab rep to serve fresh, REAL seafood.  So even though it tasted good, the Krab handroll was STRIKE TWO for me...on principal.. . Everything else was fine tasting - good, but not worth noting.  Besides the halibut sashimi which was drowned in a soy sauce mixture.  I personally love the clean flavor of fresh fish, so when everything is over seasoned or sauced, I grow suspicious of well...FRESHNESS.. . Ok, enough complaining.  It only gets 2 strikes from me.  Not  a total out, but if I could afford to never go anywhere else besides Kazu (and NO, I don't work for Kazu...the food is just that damn good), I wouldn't.. .  Listen, I'd come here again for the basics...since it's not too pricey.   Probably. But I was disappointed...I wanted to really love it too. Sigh.
