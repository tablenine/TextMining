Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I come here for the food.  My friends agree to join me so they can celeb watch.  Yes, it's pricey, so I don't go very often, but I really love the food here.  I love the market feel, but can't help but feel that I should be able to sit down and be served sometimes at these prices.  . . My faves: The butter lettuce salad and the butternut squash soup (I believe it's served on Thursdays?).  DELICIOUS!!. . Tips:  Parking is the usual street parking of the 3rd street brunch crowd, so be prepared and be patient.  Also, save some of that patience for waiting for a table, because if you haven't ordered yet, they're real sticklers about you claiming a table ahead of time.
