Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
they have a really great selection. the bartender was very friendly and inviting. the decor is equally as inviting and although "sexy", does not make you feel like you are drinking in a cave... so sort of non-cave sexy. i heard the food is really great, despite the fact i didn't eat any. the prices were pretty normal/ as expected for a wine bar/ champagne bar. i would definitely revisit pops for champagne. (also, i've heard their live music is fantastic)
