Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
This place is sooooo gooooood. . I love a huge, perfectly-seasoned pastrami sandwich with a boatload of extra pickles, please add swiss, and just enough yellow mustard to give you some zip without making your eyes pop. Add a side of crispy-chewy chili fries (enough for two or even three), extra cheese please, here's a twenty and my change is only HOW much?? I'm docking a star because this place is a bit pricey for one person to eat alone... but in Johnny's defense, it is a lot of food.
