Venue: I liked the aquarium running along the floor of the restaurant and the aquariums all over the restaurant. I love aquariums in general so having it everywhere was a nice touch. The first thing I thought of when I stepped into the main dining area with very high ceiling and fans was "French colonial Vietnam" better known as French Indochina. The decor, dark colors, fans and over all decoration of the place transports you back into Saigon in the early 1900s. It reminded me of the movie "The Lover". If you don't know what I'm talking about... google it. This restaurant reminds me of that time period.. . Drinks: 1st martini I had was the lychee and lemongrass martini. Strong but I did not taste the lemongrass. Lychee flavor was subdued. 2nd drink was the grapefruit and rosemary martini which I loved. The great mix of all the flavors made up for the lack of flavor in my first drink yet was still nice and strong.. . Food: Appetizer sampler platter was what was ordered. My faves were the sashimi type dish and the short ribs on a stick. The sashimi blended with the other herbs and the combination of flavors was amazing. The short ribs were not fatty and the meat was soft. I was whatever with the lobster on the candy cane. You can get that at a Dim Sum place for $3. and you get 4 pieces. The egg rolls were not impressive. Main dish was the Garlic Noodles and Tiger Prawns. Loved it!!! The garlic noodles reminded me of ramen. The tiger prawns were amazing and was so tasty. It didn't need any sauces or additional spices. It was perfect! Dessert was the molten lava cake and vanilla bean ice cream. Tasted good but nothing memorable. It was decent.. . Service: Our waiter was very attentive and super helpful. Anything we wanted we got and he constantly came back to check up on us. "A" for service. =)
