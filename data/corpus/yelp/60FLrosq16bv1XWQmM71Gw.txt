Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Joy's has nice, fresh ingredients--VERY tasty food which is easy on the pocket book! . . Lunches are ESPECIALLY cheap! I normally leave there for under $8 and that's with a $2 tip! Their lunch specials include a hearty portion of an entree and your choice of one of four appetizers! (The appetizer I normally opt for is their Thai Spring Roll, very fresh &amp; yummy!). . The "spicy" dishes are VERY mild (to my taste), so if you're a chili-file like me, you'll be disappointed (even if you ask for spicy), but the food is really flavorful.. . They have the ability to open the dining room to the outside with floor to ceiling glass panels/doors. It's really nice on a warm day to sit inside but feel like you're in an outdoor cafe. (Plus still have the AC to keep the humidity at bay.. . They also have a large outdoor seating area in the back of the restaurant. It's a little quieter out there on a busy night.. . This is a FAVORITE of mine for lunch! You can't go wrong for dinner either.
