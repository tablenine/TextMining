Restaurant: Little Five Corner Tavern
Category: Bars
Corner Tavern is a great place for a little "hair of the dog" the morning after a long night of drinking. Good food (the black bean burger is the shizzle), good atmosphere (it's never too loud inside, which won't exacerbate your hangover headache), and good beer selection (just don't get the "Little 5 Lager", I'm pretty sure it's actually Natty Light).
