In New York, I'd plunk down $15 for a standard diner brunch. That is to say, not some fancy cafe with a fluctuating menu full of seasonal locally-sourced ingredients. No, we're talking pancakes from a boxed mix, chewy bacon, stray eggshells in the omelette, spanikopita-perpetually-on-the-menu kind of diners. Every NY neighborhood's got a least one...or twelve. The food is terribly unremarkable, and the "unlimited mimosa (or bloody mary)" is made with well liquor. Yet, I've forked out the cash on many a morning, hungover from the previous night's debauchery. . . Know what I love about Real Food Daily? For that same $15, I can get a (sizable) plate full of scrambled tofu with vegetables, freshly-made hash browns, tempeh bacon, and homemade pancakes! And it tastes gorgeous! And is good for me too! (A bonus when trying to lessen the previous night's damages.) Â . . I love this place for brunch. The Eggs Benedict are delicious (as is The Weekender and the Ava B and Cheez Scramble) . I also loved their Yerba Matte Latte made with soy milk. I sweetened mine with agave. Perfection! . . Can't wait to go back for dinner sometime. This beats limp huevos rancheros and a Popov Bloody Mary any day.
