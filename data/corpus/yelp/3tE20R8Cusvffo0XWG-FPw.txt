My true rating would really be a 3.5 if I could give them half stars...here is why: . . Take away notes: . . Ambiance - very welcoming and cozy (borderline corny, but not quite) . Service - attentive and overall good . Food - average. My bf had the pork chop with mashed potatoes. The meat was tender and well seasoned, but by far, not the best pork chop we've had. The potatoes were the high note of that dish. I had the gnochetti in a cream sauce. The pasta was super tender and cooked perfectly. Really amazing. But the cause was just SO over powering, it almost ruined the entire dish for me. I kept wiping the extra sauce off the gnocchi and onto the plate...just TOO much sauce. . . Overall, a good experience but just not enough to get me eager enough to come back right away. . . Oh, another thing: not sure if this is an LA thing, but why can't servers give you cash back if you over tip them on the tab? They wouldn't do it for us and we didn't want to be pests so we didn't press the issues but in other major cities I have dined in (LA included) we can always over tip the server so that he can give us cash back and we can pay for valet. Whatever, now we know.
