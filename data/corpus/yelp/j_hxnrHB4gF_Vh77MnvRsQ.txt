Love this place. There's nothing like the mushroom pasta entree or the ricotta/honey appetizer. First time I went we had to wait 30 minutes for our reservation (booooo) but second time was great. My only complaint is that they pack you in like sardines into the dining room! I think I actually elbowed the person at the table next to me.
