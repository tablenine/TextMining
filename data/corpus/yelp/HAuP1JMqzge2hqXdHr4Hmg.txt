No no no. This is not as good as Katz's. It's just not. Pastrami doesn't need cole slaw (damn you #19). Order a pastrami on rye, and you will be happy. get a side of cole slaw if you want a bite of what "everyone talks about". if yelp were national, i would give it 3-stars, but in the pastrami abyss of Los Angeles, it gets a solid 4.
