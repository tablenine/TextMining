Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
Residents rave about Chicago-style hot dogs. I asked a friend of mine for a recommendation before my visit and she unhesitatingly backed Hot Doug's, along with its weekend offering of duck fat fries. After a tour around the Lincoln Park Zoo one afternoon, my father and I hopped into a cab to travel well out of the way to the aforementioned mecca. Upon our arrival to the middle-of-nowhere establishment, we tumbled out, intending to shoot in and back into the cab (the driver offered to wait for us, thank goodness), only to discover that it was closed, with plans to reopen only well after our stay was to end. (Effing hell.) So we got back into the car, dejected. But chin up, daddy dearest, me has a backup plan: Look out, Wiener's Circle!. . When we returned to civilization and were chilling by the window in the divey strorefront, contentedly scarfing down our simple, yet delicious Char Dogs, dad shot me the look of death: "So, you're telling me that we spent $30 on a cab ride that took us right back to where we started [the zoo]?!?" Well...um... yes.
