Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
The atmosphere abd friendly service of Roscoe's appealed to me since i spent the first 16 years of my life in Tennessee. Though i came here for waffles and eggs, i was happy to see soul food staples like grits, greens, and of course, fried chicken on the menu of a restaurant in the middle of Hollywood. In fact, they serve fried chicken about a dozen different ways. . . So why the three stars? Well, for one thing, i dont eat chicken. But more to the point, i came here for breakfast food, so that's what i'm reviewing. The waffles are not much better than what you would find in the frozen section of your local grocery store, and are served with enough butter to kill a small animal.
