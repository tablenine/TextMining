Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
this place is OVER-RATED.. . The set up is nice, staff is friendly.  The meat however, it's just OKAY.  I've had better.  Not only that, there was a piece of plastic in my salad, and a BIG piece at that!  I was totally disgusted especially since this restaurant has such great hype.  The food looks messy and overall, i probably wouldn't come here again.  For the same price, you can go somewhere with much better food.. . Maybe it was just because I expected a lot from this restaurant, but it was just.. okay; nothing special.
