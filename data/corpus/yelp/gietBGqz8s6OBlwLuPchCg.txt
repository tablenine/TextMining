Both the bf and I really liked the food....until he woke up in the middle of the night to throw it all up.  Turns out he got food poisoning from the spicy tuna tartar.  We know because we ate the same food except I barely touched the tartar because it had olives in it.  If it wasn't for the food poisoning, I would agreed with all the other yelpers, a solid 4 stars.  . . If you do end up going, avoid the tartar and you should be fine.  Rack of lamb was as delicious as it looks.
