Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I have to admit that Katsu-ya was a great restaurant year's ago, but something has happened to it since then.  It's my understanding that the head chef from this left for Koi and that probably explains a lot.. . Katsu-ya's signature roll is the crispy rice with spicy tuna and when I ordered it, i was surprised to get our order almost immediately despite the fact that the entire restaurant was jam packed.  My only conclusion was that it was pre-made and you could certainly tell.  . . The crispy rice was not crispy at all. It was mushy and cold as if it was made an hour ago.  I complained and asked for another one. The one they gave me was just as bad.  I don't blame the waitresses, they were very nice and did the best they could.  I know this is their signature roll but if you want to protect the image of your restaurant you shouldn't treat it like a McDonalds.
