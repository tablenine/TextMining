I had two grilled veggie tacos and the house margarita.  I was impressed with the tacos!  Brimming with yummy grilled zucchini, squash, onion and mushrooms, it had flavourful refried black beans  lining the taco and what seemed to be an avocado-y sauce piped on top.  Good flavors, very satisfying and seemed healthy.  I was excited about the house margarita (with salt, on the rocks) because they said that they make their own sour mix (no icky fake sugars, artificial stuff) but it was a little bit sweet for my taste.  Squeezing the lime into it (and a bit on my tacos as well) and utilizing the salt balanced out the sweetness pretty well.  Service was lovely.
