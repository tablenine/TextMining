Having moved out here from NY, I didn't think I'd find anything as good as Katz's.  Well, I can't quite remember what a Katz's pastrami tastes like because Langer's is heaven on earth.  The rule when I am eating a Langer's pastrami sandwich is:  don't talk to me, I do not want anything interrupting my moment of bliss.  So from the first bite to the last (I am a 125 lb female known to be able to eat 1 1/2 sandwiches here), I am in another world.  I may have to run downtown now to eat one before Thanksgiving.
