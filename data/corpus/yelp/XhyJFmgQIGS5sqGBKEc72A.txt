Located in Century City in a huge futuristic type park with lots of strangely perfect trees and tall silver buildings, Craft is a crowd pleaser. I went after work one night and saw all the nice suits and ties and banana republic dresses get their drink on at the Craftbar, and on the patio. In my opinion your better off eating at the Craftbar part because you have your choice of the bar menu, and the dining room menu, so we did and ordered a little off of each menu. The bar menu is a great way to taste all the deliciousness they have to offer from the chicken lolly-pops to the falafel skewers, and the lamb slider, suckling pig, great summer salad, yah lots of good eats. The drinks were great, had a "Paloma" in quotes because its not a real Paloma it is sort of a variation with lime juice and ginger beer, so good, so refreshing, perfect for summer. The service was not great, but it was pretty busy in there. Great place to meet guys who have real jobs, or at least dress like they do!!!
