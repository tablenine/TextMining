Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
What a low-key simple yet perfect little operation.  . . Order at the front, get your drink, watch the lady heat up your torilla and fry up your fish and/or shrimp.  Then head on over to the bar and go to town.. . Sadly, their salsa bar looked a bit dinky.  I got stuck with the paltry dregs at the bottom of each bowl.  Granted, they were fresh and yummy, but I'm talking, I had to scrape the very bottom of the bowls to get some salsa onto my delicious tacos.  . . Can't wait to go back to try it again.
