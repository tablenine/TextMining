Sleek and clean white walls and tall ceilings. Lovely and vibrant atmosphere. A little bit NY, a little bit SF. Prices are hard to beat. Shared a thin, delicious pizza with a girlfriend and ordered the portobello fries (absolute must!) and olives the first time I came here. I don't think the bill hit $25. It's cheezy to say but I love their water presentation. I love sparkling water and they do it right here. . One of the true gems of downtown, if not the whole city!
