Magic, Mystery, and Ghosts!. . Ok, well, "ghost" - Hi Irma!. . Love the Magic Castle, but OMG - can they limit the amount of people who go there?  It was insanely crowded when I went for my bday last weekend. Food is pricy but pretty great - and they can definately make a good Lemon Drop martini.  Note that you don't have to get dinner - you can spend a minimum of $15 on appetizers and stuff and get by without burning too huge a hole in your wallet - then buy more drinks! . . The main show was kind of silly.  I wasn't impressed.  The smaller shows are more fun, but you have to get there early and get a good spot up front or actually at a table where the magician is working.  All the tricks seemed to involve cards though - where's the hat and rabbit tricks? lol. . Brought in a lot of people, spent a lot, and got a free pass to come back though!  And I will.  But, I'll get there early &amp; watch some shows BEFORE dinner and before it gets too crowded. Close-up Gallery tends to have the best show.
