So, I'm not really sure what else I can say to add on or detract from this place, since it has already received 58 reviews.. . . So I'll refer to my belly after dining on my chicken salad for motivation:. . *Ahem*. . "Glug, glug, glug,  mmm, what's this Andre's feeding me?  Warm grilled chicken salad, topped with blue cheese crumbles?  And a sweet applesaucey dressing!? .... . Glug, glug, this is pretty good!  Glug, not sure about the hard and heavy as a brick biscuit, however.  I could have gotten a better one from Popeye's. Glug, glug.  Oh yeah, Andre easy on the lemonade, its kinda bitter and flat!  ... . . Oh wow, I'm really starting to get full!. . Glug, glug, churn. Fart."
