On my way to a free concert at California Plaza I get the undying urge to eat something.  I decide to detour to 12th and Olive where I hear that the legendary Kogi truck will be until 9:00.  I drive by to see if there is a line and a place to park.  I don't wait in line for food, and I'm not paying for parking.  To my surprise there are only a few people standing on the sidewalk and there is an empty parking lot right next to the truck where you can park for free.  Double score.  I walk right up to the truck and place my order immediately.  No waiting in a two hour line for me.  That's for suckers (I'm talking to you, hipster doofus).  Five minutes later I have my two tacos, one short rib and one spicy pork.  Or should I say mini-tacos?  These things are teeny-tiny.  This isn't a meal, it's a snack.   I'm getting suspicious and preparing to be disappointed.  Until I bite into the first taco.  Is it the short rib or the spicy pork.  Which is which?  Who knows, who cares.  They're both awesome.  I'm blown away.  I want more, but I don't have another four bucks, and I'm late for the concert.
