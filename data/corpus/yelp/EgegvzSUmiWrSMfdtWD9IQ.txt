Is the food good? Yes.. Is the food over priced? Completely.. Are the employees @$$ holes? Without a doubt.. . I didn't have a bad run in with the scum working there (aside from listening to their disgusting mouths) but two people that sat down after me did. The girl was asking questions about the food and what not and then without warning the kid in the Mets shirt just said "You can't eat here, get out. You're not ordering enough food get out of here." And then he just kept repeating it.. . I ate my food and it was good until I saw the huge fat guy that's supposedly the owner. After looking at his disgusting obese body and all of the warts and skin diseases I literally lost my appetite. I could not have drawn a more disgusting human being. Then when he started talking about pornography I about threw up. Just the thought of him handling food is as good a deterrent as any not to eat there.
