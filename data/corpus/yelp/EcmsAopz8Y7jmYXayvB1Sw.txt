Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
I was in an establishment in the Pops "family" up in the north suburbs somewhere and it was nice, warm, cozy, fireplacy, classy without being pretentious.  All good things, so when a friend of mine brought up coming here after a night out somewhere else I was in.  My understanding was that the Lakeview location was pretty much the same deal as what I experienced up north.  . . Man was I surprised by it being the opposite of all those things. It's just like any other place around that area.  Meat market-y, pricey (though I guess so was the other one), oddly laid out.  I really didn't dig it at all.  It's like the move in locations removed all the cool things about it.
