Outstanding Outstanding Outstanding.. . As we pulled up to the strip mall (yes strip mall) that houses Urban Belly, we were like, "Really?"  I mean, if you were to judge this restaurant only by the laundromat on one side and dry cleaner on the other, you'd probably drive right by.  A quick service Chinese restaurant would have made more sense in the spot.  But, despite being nestled between these two laundry services, Urban Belly manages to create a fresher look with its signage.  You know, at first glimpse, that this restaurant is not your typical Asian dining in Chicago and worth exploring inside.  . . The owners did a magnifacent job creating a very comfortable dining experience.  By knocking out a low ceiling and exposing some cathedral ceilings, the room feels much bigger than it actually is.  The paint color is very warm and soothing.  Now, the custom made communal tables help make Urban Belly quite unique.  I have to admit, I was happy to sit with the other young family at our table.  Although it sounds like it would be awkward, the seating arrangements just work.. . Now, the food was absolutely delicious.  The chicken and mushroom dumplings were a delight.  5 dumplings and tons of mushrooms.  They tasted amazing.  The noodle/soup dishes we split were also ridiculous.  The Asian Egg Noodle was cooked a little crispy which made it taste delish!  The mussels in the Somen soup were absolutely delectable.  . . Go there now before it gets packed (because it will).  This is a great addition to the 'hood.
