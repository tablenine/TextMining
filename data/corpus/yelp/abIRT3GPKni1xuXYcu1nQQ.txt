Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
MOST FAMOUS hot dog place in LA??  ehh... . . the line was out of control, the parking was insane, and then what do you get?  a hot dog you could have made a home.  i honestly think that costco has better hot dogs.. . definitely a place to try once, but i wouldn't have high hopes.
