K  .   So I've been uber busy with my real job and have had to live sans yelping for about a week, but i've been wanting to write this stellar review of Elliot Street the whole time.      Finally   .   Now I've only been here a few times (and $8 may seem a bit steep to a few penny pinching readers), but this place represents all that is true about "you get what you pay for" !!  Great Service (not too busy for anybody and the right amount of small talk for a mood of whatever), all premium Boar's Head meats (even the weiners, cause life is too short to eat bad meat - George Clinton wrote "Bullshit thoughts rot your meat" ; well I think it goes both ways), awesome bread (I love the Ciabatta), Hot pressed sammys (is nice even outside of the bedroom), and those killer little touches like spinach on your sandwich, cause when it's hot pressed it doesn't get all slimy and make you think you're eating bad Kimchi in a Koren adventure gone wrong . . .  And if I happen to be there - please make sure to ring the bell at the corner of the bar - I'll return the favor - I promise !!
