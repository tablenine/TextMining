Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
An awesome gastropub in quaint downtown Decatur with a crucial beer list and juicy burgers? Hell yeah. They also give you malt vinegar with their fries without having to ask, which earns insane brownie points.. . Arrive early on the weekends because this place gets PACKED and for good reason. The vibe is relaxed, as is the crowd, and the servers are very knowledgeable about the extensive beer selection. If you're looking to get gussied up and have an intimate conversation, you may want to look elsewhere. For a chill night out with a cold one and good music, Brickstore's it.
