not too familar on the  pricing because ive never paid  to go here. the theater is clean. all the workers are nice and friendly. the peach cobbler a la mode was really good. a downfall is they have  a pretty limited selection. this theater is always peaceful. you never really have to worry about crying babies and loud kids talking through the movie. excellent date location....
