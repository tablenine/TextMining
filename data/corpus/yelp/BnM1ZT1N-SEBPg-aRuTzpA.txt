I love grazing on bits of cheese, meats, fresh bread and nuts so this was a fine place to graze and nibble. Baaaa. . . The service was pretty average - meaning that our waitress pretty much forgot we existed, but we were so taken with the wicked DESSERT PLATE, once we managed to order it, that we didn't really mind. This dessert plate had all the good things of the world piled together on it: baklava, chocolate-covered figs, chocolate covered dates with almond bits inside, pistachios, dried apricots, cashews... I mean, really, could it be more like a midnight run to my mother's pantry? Wonderful times. . . I should note that some of the cheese and meat servings also come with cashews, pistachios and dried apricots, so there was a little monotony in the experience, which seemed kind of lazy. . . Bluebird has subtle and sophisticated decor, a solid beer list and not a bad wine list. Their menu could me more extensive, and had we had better service I would have given them a 4 or 5. Â I would go there again, for sure.
