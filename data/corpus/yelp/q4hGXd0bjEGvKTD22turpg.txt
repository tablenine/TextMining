a gem in Chinatown. . . this place is so classic and homey. it's like a step back in time. an old couple was there. they were all dressed up and looked like it was their weekly ritual to come in and have a sandwich. love the old world feel! . . the place is bustling! waits can be long but well worth it. i only tried the beef sandwich but the meat was so juicy and tender. the bread was indeed soggy but still very tasty. lemonade is good and only $0.75!. . even though there is a parking lot, you'll have to wait for a spot and navigate the maze.
