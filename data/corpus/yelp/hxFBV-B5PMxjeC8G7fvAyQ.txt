Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
Rosa is ok. I believe it's hard to find great Mexican cuisine in NYC (and I am not sure why that is) but Rosa doesn't live up to my standards for Mexican. . . The gaucamole is very tasty and has a fun element to the dining experience. I like how they make it at the table and it's so easy to make (very basic). It's probably the best and most popular aspect on the menu. . . The tacos are good and greasy and the crab meat enchiladas are very good, flavorful. The portions are decent, the atmosphere has a great vibe, and the service is good as well. But, nothing is special about this place and I am still looking for good Mexican in the city. Rosa is not a place I would go back to over and over again.
