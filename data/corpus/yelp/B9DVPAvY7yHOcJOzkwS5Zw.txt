What's better than $2 hotdog chicago style. No Katchup, No Burgers, No Sausage. Just Plain ol' Hot dogs and fries done right. Chase it down with a Tamale and you have your Gene and Judes experience complete. My trip to Gene and Judes = 1 double dog everything on it, 1 tamale, large grape drink final tab= $6
