The line can get super crazy here, so go early on the weekends if you want to eat at a reasonable hour. . . I love the ambiance and that the guy who seats you doesn't take names or have a list or anything. It's a little crazy, but fine as long as you don't feel like you're being passed over or anything. . . The flat bread is A-MAZ-ING! If you get anything, get this. It's huge and will feed a table (or just me) but is the best thing there in my opinion. Weirdly, the salads were also very very good. The one thing I didn't really like? The pot pie pizzas. They are a fun, good concept, but the filling tasted a little too much like tomato sauce and meatballs from a can. I would eat it again just to get another look at that flatbread, but I definitely wouldn't come here and wait that long for just the pot pie pizzas.. . Great history, great food and if you can avoid the line, a great, overall experience.
