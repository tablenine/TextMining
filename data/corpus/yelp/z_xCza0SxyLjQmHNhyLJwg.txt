My husband and I have been here many times, and we won't stop going.  It's a special place to us because we had our wedding reception there.  The food was good every time we went there, and the wait staff was very attentive.  The view overlooking a beautiful garden and Chattahoochee river was spectacular.  Alaskan Halibut, Sage Roasted Pheasant, Smoked Salmon, and Oysters (can't remember what other dishes I ordered) were very good.  It's an awesome place to bring your date here.
