What is all of the hype about? Because it was on TV? This place was one step up from a Sonic. Â I was with a party of seven and the consensus was pretty consistent. The exception was from the two people who ordered the Chili. They loved it. . . The Tap beer was flat. I, literally, had a piece of paper in my burger - they didn't remove the sheet that separates the slices of cheese - and the tater tots were pretty standard.. . So, average food. The part that made the dinner miserable was the horrible smell of cigarette smoke. Not sure the stink will ever come out of my clothes.
