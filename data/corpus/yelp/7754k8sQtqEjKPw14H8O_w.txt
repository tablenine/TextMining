The southern fried chicken is fantastic (not the chicken fried chicken, which is an odd twist of phrase that doesn't really mean what it should). I wish the sides were more consistent. They range from decent to good, but I can't recall a one that has knocked me down yet. The pie is also good and perfectly traditional. Probably closer to a 3.5 than a 4, but I'll round up for the fried chicken. Had the leftover chicken today and it was still just as delicious.. . If someone tries to coerce you into Mary Mac's, make them come here instead.
