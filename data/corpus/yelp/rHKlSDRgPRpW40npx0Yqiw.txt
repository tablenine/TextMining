Restaurant: Casa Vega
Category: Mexican
A friend and I were driving through the area looking for something to eat, and were drawn in by the appearance of an old school Mexican restaurant. We figured it would be a pretty straight forward kinda place, we weren't really dressed for anything special so we were a little taken aback when we pulled into the mandatory valet parking, and then walked into the door to a hoppin bar and a 30 minute wait! It was an interesting scene for sure..more Hollywood types than expected loitering around the bar. We felt under dressed and just waited outside until our table was ready. . The two of us were seated in a booth on the same side...romantic! Except that we are platonic girlfriends who just want to have a conversation...awkward. Guess it was too cramped to have seating on both sides of the table. Also, we were practically sitting on top of the table next to us and couldn't help but overhear their entire converstation. . . But the food was GREAT and the server pleasant...the chip and salsa are perfection. I ordered taco's and they were the BEST EVER. The plates did seem a little pricey ($19-$23 for a combo) but the meal included your choice of a huge starter tostada salad or yummy soup. I am still craving Casa Vega weeks later, but it's a little out of my way so we will see when I make it back. I'll try to go with a larger group next time to avoid the awkward seating situation.
