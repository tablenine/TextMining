If you live in LA and you haven't been you need to get out more often. This is the real deal Jewish deli and bakery. Come in for lunch and hit the bakery on the way out. Late nights drinks in Hollywood and get stuffed before heading back to the burbs. If you still need more info I'm sure you can find something on you tube, the travel channel and food TV have been here many times.
