Restaurant: Native Foods
Category: Vegan
I love meat and probably will die of starvation if I become a vegetarian.. . However, the fake meat dishes at Native Foods tasted so real that I couldn't believe it is fake. Heck, the fake chicken wings tasted better than the real chicken wings. If I ever have to go vegan and I can eat at Native Foods everyday, I think I just may be ok.. . 4.5 stars.
