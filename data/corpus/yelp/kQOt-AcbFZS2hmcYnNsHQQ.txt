Really nice beer selection, and a surprisingly good menu even for a gastropub. Â The wine list was impressive but somehow we were in a totally beer mood. My "Saltzburger" was really tasty, and I was stepping out of my comfort zone with the fried pickles but they were awesome.. . My husband whined about the diminutive number of TVs, but I say it was a blessing. We actually had great conversation the whole time!!
