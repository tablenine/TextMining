Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I had no idea this place had so much hype. Came with family in search of a good ramen place and this was the closest! Parking's quite nice as it's next to the plaza but it's pretty limited...so only if you're lucky will you find a spot.. . The line was long when we got there but it seemed to be a fairly alright wait (nothing a quick tour of the bookstore couldn't fix). There seemed to be only three choices (or main choices at least) and a slew of appetizers. The guys next to us tried the "special challenge" and made a huge ruckus doing it. I--a newbie at orochon--just went along with my safe little #6. The ramen was a bit on the hard side but the broth was rather nice. And by nice I mean, salty and heart-warming. Mmm. The gyoza was deliciouuus but didn't hold well. I like it when they fry it a little longer so at least it won't fall apart when my greedy chopsticks come after it. . . So Â I'm not going to lie, I don't really do ramen. I don't frequent ramen places and the only thing I recall eating in Japan was mochi. To me, Orochon was good partially because of the ridiculously cold weather but that was it. Good. Nothing really popped out to me and I wasn't inhaling it like it was the end of the world. Maybe it was the lack of meat (order extra meat if you're a carnivore. man, oh man.) or maybe I just needed it a bit spicier...whatever it is, I'm willing to go a second time to see again what this hype's all about. Maybe even go on the dangerous side and go a little higher on that spicy list...heh.
