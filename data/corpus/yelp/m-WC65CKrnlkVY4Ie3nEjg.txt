Their slogan should read, "Porto's - Home of the famous cheese rolls that you heard about from Jamie.  You know, that guy who can eat like 10 of them in one sitting!". . That's all you really need to know, but I guess I can talk about other things to fill up space.  I mean, if I put that line up there, how many of you would really FUC me?. . So, I've been there probably about thrice.  But, I've had stuff from here about "thrice-ty" times!  Number 1 request when people go there, is yes, their cheese rolls.  I've also had their guava/cheese strudel and strawberry strudel to name a few.  Both good, but I'm not a big guava person.  I've also tried their potato balls and yes, they are indeed pretty good.  From the outside of the potato ball, it looks like I'm about to bite into a nice big piece of dough.  Wrong!  It's actually, to my surprise, potato.  Hmmm.  Go figure!  Not only did I bite into potato, but it's actually quite hot.  Goodbye roof of my mouth!. . The parking is usually horrible, but not hard to find if you don't mind walking a little bit.  Also, this place is very popular, so expect to wait in a line.  This branch is separated into a deli side and a bakery side, so don't end up waiting in the wrong line.  Unless, you're 2 1/2 years old, it'll be easy to figure out which side is which.. . Now will you FUC me?
