Thai chicken fried rice was my choice here. Its right off the blue line Damen stop. Â I added extra spice to my dish and I immediately regretted that. I wasn't sure how spicy it was going to be. The dish actually packed a lot of heat on its own. It was however still really tasty. I will go back again.
