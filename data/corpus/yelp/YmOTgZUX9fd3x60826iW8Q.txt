I never crave pancakes until I remember than Griddle Cafe is an option.   Damn, that place is good.  For 3 years I lived a hopscotch away, literally, so I was able to send someone in the hungover group to wait in line and be there within seconds of having our table ready.  But yeah, that wait sucks donkey balls.. . It's a shame I live 3.4 miles away now as we're usually too lazy to drive, find parking and endure the wait.  . . Mmmmm, pancakes.
