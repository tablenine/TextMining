Yuuuuuup, I'm downgrading.  . . Fine, Sun Wah still has amazing duck.  And, for $33, it's a great deal!  Nothing beats the super crispy skin, bao, radishes and sauce.  Yum.. . However, let me get that dinner TO GO, so I can enjoy in the comfort of my own home and NOT deal with the grumpiness that comes with being a Sun Wah server.   . . To catch a server's eye is next to impossible.  I think they've perfected the art of ignoring customers.  And, if you try to order something extra, they basically snarl at you when you're placing the order.  Not to mention that when the order comes out, it's WRONG.  (Hi, soy sauce chicken does NOT equal bbq pork.)  If you need bowls, chopsticks, water, napkins, good luck trying to flag someone down!. . Also, we waited close to 45 min for this duck.  45 min.  In their old space, we'd wait 20min MAX.  Plus, the presentation used to be more intimate + more informative...with explanations about what was occuring with the dinner.  Now, the poor girl was so tired from slicing duck nonstop that I'm sure she didn't want to explain anything.  . . Oh, and they've totally cut the portion sizes for the soup + fried rice.  Like, seriously.  . . So, although the new space for Sun Wah LOOKS great, they totally need to work on their service. Shout-out to the ONE guy who was nice to nice.  The ONE.  Ugh.
