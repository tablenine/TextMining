I was in the mood for a burger and one of my buddies raved about this place so I made the jaunt down to the Highlands last night with him and a few friends. . . Going in, there is a little bit of that dungeon feeling like some people have mentioned but I happen to have an affinity for dark and smoky atmospheres. Makes me feel like a villain in an old movie.. . Got the Swiss burger (medium), with onions rings. It's a decent size and a good looking burger but the flavor just wasn't there, it was quite bland actually. I don't think I tasted ANY seasoning. The onion rings were nice and big but also lacked seasoning in the batter. . . I was very hungry when I walked in so I threw a bunch of hot sauce, ketchup, and mayo on this bland burger and scarfed it down. I don't know, maybe my friend over hyped the burger. Whatever the case is, I wasn't too impressed with the burger. I'll come back to drink and try the prime rib though.
