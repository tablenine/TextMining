Since I have a macaron obsession, I'm always on the lookout for any restaurant or bakery that sells these rare treats. Bottega Louie's chocolate and vanilla macaron are good, but there are definitely better in L.A. The texture of their macaron isn't as chewy as it should be and they're a little too sweet. At $1.75 per bite sized macaron, I expected it to be way better. For great macarons, try Lemonade, La Provence, Little Next Door, Paulette's, or Bouchon.
