There was a reason I waited five or so years to return to TUL.  Quite simply, I hate it.  Yes, it's a cool atmosphere, but it's much too loud, always behind on reservation times and the food, well the food isn't the best I've ever had - not by a mile.  Much too expensive for what you get. . . I'll leave my review at that.  Let's just say, I'm simply NOT a fan.  :(
