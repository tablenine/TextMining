Our server was ridiculously awful - stringy emo black hair, when we told him it was freezing in the restaurant he said, "that's why i wore a sweatshirt." ugh. The no substitutions, no butter with bread is so obnoxious. My taglietelle with ragu was delish but everyone else at my table was disappointed. Also not worth the $16. The bartender was helpful when it came to wine recommendations. Much appreciated. Dessert of fritters and nutella was AMAZING. Basically, I won't go back unless I get a dessert craving. Change the attitude and maybe you'll have repeat customers.
