Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
I went here with my father when he was in town, and he'd seen it while walking, and wanted to try it.. . I'd never heard of it, so went in w/ a neutral stand.  My dad ordered some wine, and I wanted to try out some neat beers.  I named 3 beers, which they were all out of!!  Then I settled for a 4th, which they finally had in stock.  I know restaurants run out of bottles, but 3 from a huge menu?  That's kinda big.  The waiter also was horrible at pouring beer, and didn't slant the glass at all, which is really important for higher quality beers.. . So I wasn't super hungry, so I ordered the mac n' cheese, figuring a place like this would use interesting cheeses and make it taste different.  It was so bland it was bad.  I'd rather have saved my $8 and bought a bunch of Kraft mac/cheese.. . Add to that the service was horribly slow, and not very friendly.  My dad and I always joke about the Bluebird now.
