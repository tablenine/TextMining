I took a group of 8 without reservations and we sat pretty quickly.  Now, i know i'm a little picky when it comes to food, but i expect great food from restaurants i spend my money at.  . The towering seafood on ice was greater to look at than to eat. For $95 dollars, you'd expect better execution on the shucking at least.. My kurobuta was way over cooked when i asked for medium.  The beets from the beet salad were too soft and the whole dish in general was bland. The chicken was pretty good, a little on the salty side, but good. It came with a pasta/cheese macaroni thingy that had no taste, was dry, and pretty unappetizing.  . The overall experience was just alright. Nothing great.  What really killed the night was the fact that when I ordered the chocolate fondue, I was told i had to close my dinner tab and open a new tab, plus I had to move my group to the outdoor lounge.  There wasn't room for everyone to sit at one table, so, unfortunately, (actually, fortunately) we went to ford filling station for dessert.
