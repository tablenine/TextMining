After scurrying around the Highlands in search of Christmas gifts, the beau and I weren't quite hungry yet--so we stopped by P'cheen for a drink. We ended up scoring the leather couch on the far wall and ordering a couple of festive libations: me, a mug of hot rum-spiked cider and he, a martini glass brimming with hard egg nog. I usually loathe egg nog, but the drink's thin texture and cold temperature made me question my firm hatred of this holiday staple--as I often associate it with thick, nauseating froth.. . The dim lighting, cozy seating and Florida/Alabama game blaring made for the perfect appetite inducer.
