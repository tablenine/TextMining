On my new list of favorite restaurants in LA.  Staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  (Even the Chef was gracious.)  Excellent wine list and beautiful wines by the glass.  Try the Italian Kerner and the Bordeaux by the glass.  The food was simple, straightforward and terrific. The lamb dish reminded me of something my Italian grandmother used to make.  I will definitely return.  What a fantastic dining experience.
