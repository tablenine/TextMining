Best place! YAY! I live within walking distance and LOVE to pop in for some delectable vegetarian cuisine. They have great teas too. . Whenever a friend's birthday pops up I also love to go hunting for a cool/different gift in their back gift shop. . Great for food, gifts, people watching, and service! . One of my favorite spots in Chicago.
