Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza

Oh Mario~ (Batali)! . . Just coming back from Roma, my bf and I were craving buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto, our staple appetizer when we were there. So~ I suggested Pizzeria Mozza for a random dinner date. . . We had:. . Meat:. Salumi Salame. Bufala mozzarella &amp; Prosciutto di Parma. . Salad: . Tricolore with Parmigiano Reggiano &amp; anchovy dressing. . Pizza:. Margherita with mozzarella, tomato &amp; basil. . Dessert:. Butterscotch budino, Maldon sea salt &amp; rosemary pine nut cookies. . The mozzarella wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but it was good.. meat was on the salty side. Pizza &amp; salad were good, very safe if its your first time here. I'd skip the dessert I got, I really wanted to get the Caramel copetta with marshmallow sauce &amp; salted Spanish peanuts, but... there's always next time.. . Parking is available, just gotta look, otherwise valet service is there too. We didn't have reservations either, just walked in on a Thursday night, (I think) but it was still pretty poppin', we had to wait about 20 min, and we sat at the bar. . . In Short: it's good, you get what you pay for, meaning: it's a bit pricey, so of course it's good. . . Happy eating!
