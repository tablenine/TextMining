I've been here for Happy Hour and regular meals, and I haven't been disappointed.. . Happy hour: half off all appetizers until 7 PM (I think), including hot wings, seared ahi tuna, ahi tuna poke, pizza, garlic noodles, sliders, the list is endless... Everything is VERY tasty and VERY good.  It's a great way to try all their appetizers at a discount!  Beer selection is ginormous, and you can't really go wrong with anything here.. . Dinner: I think I had one of the biggest dinners of my life here.  I got the lambchops and cleaned the entire plate, like completely empty.  They were that good.  Then I had the chocolate souffle (okay so I shared that one...)  Also amazingly good.  Yes, I was way overstuffed (I'm not a big person...) but it was oh-so worth it.. . So the food is great, the drinks are great, the prices are just too high.  I think you can probably find better deals elsewhere.  However, you probably pay for location and convenience.
