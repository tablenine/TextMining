It's a fun place to go (hey! we saw that guy that shuffled around as the mailroom clerk on Just Shoot Me), but the food's really not all that memorable. . . The margaritas must've been strong (unless my friend was a weenie and was giggling crazily for some other reason), and the dim lighting makes it feel authentic in a this-is-really-americanized-mexican-food sort of way. (Truly authentic usually comes out of the great local taqueria with the saltillo tile floor - oh! I'll go write a review for Tres Hermanos in North Hills!)
