Came here after a long morning with friends and it turned out to be a really good decision.  It was only about half full on a Saturday afternoon and a very chill environment with local art hanging on the walls.  Ah, and good ol' 90s music playing in the background.. . Had a great beer selection and served late brunch (score for the hungover!)  I had the strange daze omelet--mozzarella, bacon, mushrooms, spinach, and hollandaise sauce.  HOLLANDAISE SAUCE on my omelet..I'm obviously a big fan of it.  The omelet was made very well and the smoky flavor of the bacon blended well with the sauce and melted, stringy (in the best way possible) cheese.  Not to mention I had it with a toasted English muffin and, you guessed it, the hash browns.. . The hash browns were so good they deserve their own paragraph. You may have read about them a few times by now, but I don't think you can understand just how good these hash browns are.  Warm, shredded potatoes in a creamy sauce.   I really want the recipe--I couldn't even guess what it was.  All I know is that it's freakin delicious.. . My friends had the breakfast burrito and the park west club--they looked super legit as well.  Service, for me at least, was really great.  Maybe it was because the place wasn't that full..and it was 2 in the afternoon, but the waitress and bus boys frequented our table a lot to check up on us, refill drinks, etc.  Overall good stuff.. . I'd say a great spot for my first visit to Logan Square..
