Our lunch among the hipsters was great. The wife and I brought the baby after a Kaiser visit and were very pleased that we did. . . I had a very very very good skirt steak sandwich that I'll warn you, is quite heavy with blue cheese hollandaise sauce. But I'm man enough to handle that (with the spare tire to prove it). The wife had an wonderfully simple club sandwich. We recommend both and can't wait to come back for more.
