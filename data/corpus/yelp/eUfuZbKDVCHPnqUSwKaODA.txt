There are a few things I really liked about this joint. . . 1. If you order coffee you get your very own French press (or if you are with multiple coffee drinkers..you share..)..point is..French Press action is HOT and the coffee is ever so yum. . 2. Great prices considering you will have left overs unless you have an impressive appetite..if this is the case..you will leave extremely satisfied.. . 3. PUMPKIN PANCAKES! Served with extra sweetened and spiced pumpkin filling fun...and whipped cream...and for me...a doggy bag... . Everything was delicious a group of us 4 picked at each others eats and we were happy to do so. Their French Toasts looked INSANE, their Huevos Rancheros sounded phenomenal..who the hell am I kidding? I wanted to walk around to everyones table and ask if I could take a bite everything sounded like it pretty much had to be a winner.. . Oh, and there was a super happenin back room that I guess either you have to be friends with them, paparazzi fodder, or a large group to utilize....and almost everyone was sporting that "Real LA" look that kinda weird fake hipster heroin rock deal and no one made eye contact. So cool.
