I am torn between 3 and 4 stars. The concept is cool - customizable burgers. That's nice and everything but this takes it a smidge too far. I dont want to take 15 minutes to wrack my brain over the possibilities. I have always been OK with several burgers to choose from. I should have just picked from the palyed down section of the menu where a few burgers have already been put together. . . I ended up getting chicken in a bowl atop field greens, jalepeno jack cheese, roasted red pepper, sprouts, black bean and corn salsa and tiny carrots sticks. It was good but exhausting arriving to that choice. The waiter knew this was Â a major decision too as he sympathetically let us know that it was complicated and confusing and a lot to take in. Uhm...I'm not slow. . . I will be prepared next time by thinking about what I want hours before hand. I can see now why a line started forming outside around 6:30.
