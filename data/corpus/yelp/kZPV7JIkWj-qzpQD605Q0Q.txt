Toast has the ABSOLUTE BEST salad I have ever had in my life. Their Chopped Salad is so incredible, I dream about it. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life. The ingredients are so fresh! The wait can sometimes be a pain, but it is worth it. The staff is also very polite. Don't be surprised if you get bumped down the list if a Hollywood darling suddenly shows up after you.
