Oh, did you want a $4 mojito? I sure did. If you don't mind elbowing your way through throngs of NYU douchebags, this place is the bomb.  For inexpensive and decent food, it really can't be beat - I tried the Miso Soup ($2) and the Vegetable Tofu Curry for $6, and my friend had Chicken Dumplings ($5 or 6).  Despite the schizophrenic menu, everything we had was pretty effing good for the price.  . Word to the wise: be prepared to sit elbow-to-elbow with the table next to you as you struggle to hear your dinner companion over the squealing twenty-somethings behind you.  Good luck getting a table, but by the time you do, you'll be four-dollar drunk and hungry for sashimi.  Hopefully you'll be drunk enough to not mind that you don't have a server for a half-hour, but who cares? It's cheap and fun, and I'll be back, just not for a romantic evening with a loved one.
