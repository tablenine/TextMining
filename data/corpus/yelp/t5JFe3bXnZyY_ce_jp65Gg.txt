I keep going here.  Mainly because I love Bun and keep hoping they will take it up a notch.  I have a hard time finding Bun in a town that is so pho.  I have noticed in the years that I have been coming here the portions get smaller, the meat gets tougher,the noodles are soggier, the flavor of the Bun Sauce nuoc cham has less flavor but the crowd is larger.  Don't get it.  . Years ago I worked at a Chinese restaurant that also served Vietnamese Bun dishes--because some of the cooks were Vietnamese.  I got hooked on their's.  I miss the taste.  I know I will keep going because I am not a fan of Gingergrass--Servcie is good, the place usually smells like their table cleaner and the bathroom green light I don't get but who cares.
