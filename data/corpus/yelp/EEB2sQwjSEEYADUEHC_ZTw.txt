Restaurant: Yamato Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Yamato is a nice addition in Westwood for cost-conscious UCLA students. With half-priced appetizers and sushi for happy hour, it certainly is a bargain.. . Taking over Eurochow's old corner spot, Yamato has transformed the space into a very posh, almost Vegas-esque restaurant. The waitstaff is courteous, the sushi chefs yell some sort of stereotypical Japanese greet upon entering, and the table layout of the restaurant is done nicely without cramped spacing.. . The sashimi was fresh, the yakitoris grilled nicely, and the sushi rolls, albeit small, tasted good for the happy hour prices. Sashimi averaged around $5 for 5 pieces, yakitoris around $2.50, and sushi rolls from $6-$10. Happy-hour wise, the food is definitely a bargain that will leave your taste buds satisfied.. . However, for the chance that you missed the happy hour special, Yamato is a pricey option for sushi. If i had to pay the regular prices for the items I ordered during happy hour, I would have absolutely considered it trendy, overrated, and over-priced sushi.. . Overall, Yamato is a very nice restaurant that all broke college kids can dine at once in a while. Just make sure you don't miss the happy hour or else you will leave broke and hungry. Oh yeah, happy hour here doesn't include drinks... who would've thunk it.
