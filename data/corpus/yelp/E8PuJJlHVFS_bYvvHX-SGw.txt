Love this place! Went there yesterday with some friends who have recently moved to Culver City. They were in the mood for Mexican so I took them here (since Ive been wanting to try this place myself). . . I had 2 pupusas, revuelta and bean and cheese, and I LOVED IT! . . My friends had the Burrito special (chicken), the carne asada plate, and the Carne asada burrito. . The portions were big and they all finished all their food. . The horchata was heavenly and I heard the wine margarita was good. Â . My friend from Boston was impressed at the difference between Boston Mexican food and California Mexican food.. . We will all be coming back. The service was great, very friendly and the place is super cute.. ***************************************. update 4/19/08. . Been back a couple times more now and plan to celebrate my husbands birthday here.. . Sangria: AMAZING! Not that Im an expert, but its way better than any sangria Ive ever tasted.. . Pescado Frito: It was just Okay, I would give it a B. . House Special Pescado: This was really yummy, very well done . . Chile Relleno and Enchilada: My mom makes the best enchiladas and chille rellenos, so its hard for anyone to compete with that. . I would say a B-. . Empanadas de Leche: OMG OMG OMG this was really yummy.. First time I ever tried this and was in love.. . Plan to try : Bistec Encebollado, Carne Adobada, and Siete Mares soon. . .but not soon enough!
