I liked their Prix Fix menu options.  I got the 2 course meal instead of the 3 but looking back I should've gotten the dessert and made it a 3 since it's only $6 dollars more.  Chicken tortilla soup was okay but I really enjoyed the crispy parmesan chicken. . . We sat outside since it was a warm day but I think inside would have been just as good.  Service was okay.  It took some time getting the check but overall if someone was asking me for a quiet, nice and somewhat unique/romantic restaurant, I would tell them to go to this place.  . . Think ladies also like this area because of the nearby stores... vera wang, marc jacobs, paul frank, etc.
