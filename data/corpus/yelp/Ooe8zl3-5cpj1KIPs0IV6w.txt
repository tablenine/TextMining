I stopped by here to pick up something to go for lunch, since its a couple doors down from Ulta.  (Had to get the boyfriend some hair product so he can keep up his cuteness!)  Anyways, I am usually a huge fan of this place and think they have the best caldo de pollo (chicken soup)!  Today, I had the worst service ever!  Usually when I get take out at a Mexican restaurant like this, I am out of there in like 5 min...sometimes it makes me wonder how they get it out to me sooo fast!  Well this time around was the exact opposite.  I think I waited about 30-40 min for take out!  Not only that but when I got home they forgot to give me my side order of rice and my meal was cold!  It was so cold, I could not even cut into my cheese enchilada!!!  It was like eating cold pizza for breakfast.  Guess I will only eat here again if I have time to sit down in the restaurant.
