I give this place one star for its location. Ate here for the first time tonight and oh my god, it is NOT good. Seven hours later and my stomach is still wretching.. The dishes themselves are very unimaginative and bland, actually they are just gross! We tried the beef salad, the sliced chicken with vermicelli noodles, and beef Â broccoli with the horribly disgusting wide crispy noodles.. Whoever they used to write up their menu did a good job because it sounds good on paper, too bad its not good on your plate. YUCK!
