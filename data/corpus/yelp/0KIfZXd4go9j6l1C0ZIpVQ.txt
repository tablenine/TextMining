My husband and I ate here to celebrate our anniversary. We heard good things from friends and decided to try something different from our usual Italian or seafood "celebration" restaurants. The hostess first sat us at a very small table that was very close to two other two-tops. She had no problem moving us when we asked for a nicer table. We chose to do the prix-fixe for $35. I thought it was a great deal, the appetizers were huge and delicious. Some of the spices were a little too heavy for me but for the most part, I enjoyed the dishes. The entrees were small but amazing and we were already almost full from the appetizers. I didn't really enjoy the desserts, the apricot ice cream was too rich and I thought the orange blossom simple syrup tasted a little too much like perfume. All in all it was an enjoyable evening, I would definitely go back.
