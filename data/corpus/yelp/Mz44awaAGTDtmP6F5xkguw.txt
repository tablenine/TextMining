Meh. Average ribs, great place for a beer and a game.. . Yes, the ribs are tender and fall off the bone. You get a lot of them. However, to me they're incredibly average and unspectacular. Bland. Same with the 'zesty' sauce. Nothing you couldn't get at a chain or grocery store.. . Please keep in mind I'm coming from 20 years in the deep south, where ribs are smoked for hours and kin still feud over BBQ superiority.. . Positives: I love the wood-paneled atmosphere. It's a great place to drink some beer and watch a game. The employees were all very nice. Despite its age, the place is very clean.
