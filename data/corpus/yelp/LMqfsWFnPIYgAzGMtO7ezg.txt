one of my besties introduced me to this place and I'm addicted!  Not only is it open until 4 am for those late night munchies, but it serves fresh, delicious food that is 100 times better quality than Denny's.  I love their green side salad with balsamic vinaigrette (their dressing is delicious).  Their breakfast foods are awesome, their bugers are delicious, and their sandwiches are ginormous.  The club sandwiches are a little difficult to eat since they're about 8 inches tall, but they're delicious nonetheless.  Definitely recommended!
