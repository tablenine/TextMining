oh! ok went to find this truck last weekend and when we got there I was like urghhh.. it was already 11 pm or so, but men! Im telling you that it would take you more than an hour waiting in line for this famous taco so we actually decided not to wait hahha! and pass on it. but i would really love to try this taco, if its not that awesome, why are they so crazy about this? its korean barbecue taco wow! yummy minus the line that turned me off .would definitely update whenever i grabbed a bite and decided to wait an hour for a piece of taco
