Anyone who knows me knows that I must come here when I come to town. It's just one of those places that I can't find up here in the bay area, much to my disappointment of my stomach. Â . . Ok, so my friends and I have this system. We all sit at the bar (always!)and try to order so that we each have one piece per order, so that we can try more different kinds of fish, got it? But that's neither here nor there. Anyhow, this is what we ordered:. . - salmon: get this w/the seaweed on top and sesame seeds. trust me, it's damn good.. - japanese snapper: with lemon and salt only. don't dip in soy. yum.. - kanpachi: this tasted like a mix of yellowtail and halibut - very tasty.. - sea urchin: so buttery. so good. . spanish mackerel, scallop, yellowtail, fatty tuna, sweet shrimp (get the fried heads), unagi. . . All of it was good. Never noticed a fishy smell to the place but I probably fixated on what fish I wanted to order first .... . One thing I don't really understand here is ... sometimes you'll be given this free appetizer before you start ordering and sometimes you don't. What test do I need to pass to get this every time and not some of the time?? It's mountain yam sliced julienne atop some seaweed mixed in a light soy/vinegar broth. It has the consistency of snot but aside from that, it's quite tasty. . . I would have given 5 stars but I took one away since the prices seem to have increased since the last time I was there. And the wait can literally kill you if you're really hungry.
