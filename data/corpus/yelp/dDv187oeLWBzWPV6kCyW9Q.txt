I think I'm jumping the gun a little with this review as I've never actually had proper food here. This review is solely about Milk &amp; Honey as a coffee shop... just sos ya know, right?. . After weeks of playing Letizia's Roulette (will my coffee be lukewarm or hot? will it be full of grinds or smooth? will it be the size I paid for?) I finally realized that Milk &amp; Honey has a coffee counter and it's only a very short walk down a creepy alley away for me! Rejoice.. . I've never had to wait much, they have TimeOut on sale, coffee has thus far been exemplary and the pumpkin donut I had this morning was tits. From now on I will gladly take the 20 second run down the alley, ignoring all the dumpster-diving bums I might pass, for my morning coffee.
