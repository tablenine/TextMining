First time there. Sat in the restaurant side, not hibachi.. . Ordered: . . - Spicy tuna rolls (good). - Shrimp tempura roll (the shrimp tempura was hot and the sushi was cold, freaking awesome!). - those huge Salmon eggs in nigiri form. - Beef negamaki. - some kind of grilled fish (very good). - Kobe beef skewers (cooked over coals in a clay pot on the table). - Agedashi tofu (eh). . Waitress: Kaiyo-san. Sushi chef: Kaki-san. . Excellent service. Fresh, good food. Clean restaurant. Complimentary valet. Ver-y ver-y nice :)
