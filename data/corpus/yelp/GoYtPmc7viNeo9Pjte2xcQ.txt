Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I LOVED Joan's on Third before their renovation a couple years ago.. . Great selection of "artisan" cheeses, et cetera...The French (provincial) interior is lovely, and not overdone.  Their coffee is fantastic, and the bakery boasts of specialty cupcakes, chocolate bouchon, gelati, cakes, and an ever-changing menu.. . The cheese used in their tuna melt is a deliciously interesting choice.  And, their Chinese chicken salad dressing has a unique flavor unlike most other Chinese chicken salads.  The deli case has a great selection of food perfect for picnic baskets -- mozzarella and tomato salad, stringbean in oystersauce dressing, Korean BBQ, and delicious meatless items (perfect for vegans/vegetarians).. . My big gripe is that there has been a lot less (almost non-existent) chicken in their Chinese Chicken Salad since their expansion.  And, it seems that the portions have gotten a lot smaller also.. . But, that is not enough to keep me from coming back.  Joan's has the perfect little packages to give away as gifts and really good food.
