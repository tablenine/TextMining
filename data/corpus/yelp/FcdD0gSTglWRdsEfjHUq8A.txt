They have the predator/prey thing down:  Alligator/duck, rattlesnake/rabbit.  I've tried almost all of the carnivorous varieties and I've yet to be disappointed, though I'd show up for the truffle-oiled Belgian fries alone.  Aside from the sausage party, there's a great bar and an incredibly friendly staff.
