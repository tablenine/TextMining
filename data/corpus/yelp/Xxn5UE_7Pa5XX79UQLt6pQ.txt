yumm!. popped by here for a group lunch on a weekday. SO GOOD! Service friendly and attentive.  Sushi delicioius. Beers cold.  Can't get much better. We ordered loads of food (rolls and sushi) and it was all fresh and delicious. Hands down the best unagi EVER.  Also they aren't kidding when they say "spicy tuna roll".  Tuna, scallop, sweet shrimp - you can't get enough. We ordered TONS 'O Food and several beers.  Bill at the end was pricey but not out of control for so much quantity AND quality. 250 for five peeps.  Pop in - though be prepared to wait. There was a line at 1:45 PM.
