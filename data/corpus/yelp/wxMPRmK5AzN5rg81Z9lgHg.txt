Category: Taiwanese
I had never had any Taiwanese food before I went to Sinbala.  My son, who is 6, loves anything asian.  I think he's gonna move to Japan when he grows up!  (Big sushi fan!  Kinda strange, since he's part mexican, italian and scandinavian!)  Anyhow, We had the Chicken Nugget (popcorn chicken) and vegetable.  The chicken was little chunks of meat, breaded and fried.  Great stuff, but eat it hot 'cause it's pretty greasy and quite salty too.  The vegetable was some kind of greens in a broth that had  ground pork in it.  Tasty!  Even my son liked it, and I thought the strength of the flavors would be too much for him.. . The highlight for me was the sausage!  It was kinda like a skinny stick of canadian bacon, sliced about a half inch thick on the diagonal.  The plain order comes with lots of fresh garlic.  You can order it with a ton of other stuff.  If you like ham, you will love this sausage!
