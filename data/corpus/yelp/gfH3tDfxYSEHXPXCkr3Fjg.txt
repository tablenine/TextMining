Definitely was not impressed by this place. The only good thing is that they serve freshly baked sourdough mini-loaves. Other than that, its just okay.  Well, okay except for the dessert portions: TINY and expensive. What the??  If it was tiny and good, than maybe the price would be worth it but the two dessert dishes we tried were tiny, not very good and way too expensive. Booooo.
