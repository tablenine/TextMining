bummer.  sooo 'meh'.  if it wasn't for the cool counter, i wouldn't go back.  or at least i wouldn't order the philly cheese steak omelette. and i agree with Greg W's review - if i ask for milk for my coffee, don't bring me half and half.. . on a plus note, they have outdoor seating;  and there are some hilarious types that show up to eat there.  like, i've never seen so many people wearing sunglasses while dining indoors.  i imagine they put them on while looking in the mirror before leaving their homes and say, "...smooth, baby, smooth..."
