There's so many reviews already for this place, so I'll keep this short and sweet. . . Ambiance - 5 stars. Food - 2 stars. . Seriously, the food is blah for the price (it's an expensive place!). This is definitely not a place for an authentic sushi experience. It's a cool place though, have to give them that. So, come here if that's what you're after. But don't bother if you're after the food. Go to Sushi Sushi instead. I'm giving it 3 stars only because the service is excellent, and the place is beautiful. These are the other things I look for when deciding where to go. if I were to rate this place based on food alone, it'll probably be a 2 stars.
