Oh Lola, how I'd like to meet ya someday. And funny enough, I'd ask to meet you at your very own place. You see Lola, you've created stellar ambiance that makes up for the fact that your food isn't mindblowing. Well, scratch that. The fried butternut squash ravs are delicious. So score one for you there. But this place just screams "Hey guys let's go grab a drink at Lola's". And extra points for the martini specials during your weekday happy hours. Five bucks for a martini on this side of town really makes this Lola a showgirl!
