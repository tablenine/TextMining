Category: Specialty Food
New favorite place in LA.  I wanted to buy everything in the marketplace, I was in heaven!!!  I still haven't tried anything savory from Joan's, though I'm sure I'll be back.  My friend and I just popped over while furniture shopping at floor plan for a quick snack.  I had their marshmallow fluff filled chocolate cupcake, I'd had it before and loved it the second time as well.  I also had an iced coffee...I don't ever drink plain iced coffee...it wasn't very good, but that is because I don't like plain iced coffee.. . I just had to buy something from the marketplace though.  Housemade dressings?  imported cheeses?  Housemade candies and chips and breads and and....ohhh, I do love this place.  I went with a package of lime cookies for the hubby, even though I ended up eating half of them.  I imagined they would be hard shortbread like cookies, but they were nice and soft in a crunchy chewy sort of way, and they were perfectly flavored.  Loved them!. . Oh Joan's, I think you and I are having a love affair....wait, what?
