Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Sorry, but this place is quite overhyped. I personally think there are many more korean bbq restaurants that can top Manna's in a heart beat. Sorry Manna fans -_-'. I give them 1.5stars for the meat, .5 for service and the only reason why i would come back would be for the fun and busy environment and how it can cater to a large group of people--so i give them another star for that!
