Category: Sandwiches
Fresh carved meats au jus? How can you have just one? . . I avoided the seemingly good sides so that I could have two sandwiches. They are on the small side and I felt further justified after observing a couple of 10-year olds eating two PLUS sides and dessert. The jus could've been more flavorful but at least it wasn't too salty. I recommend a double dip for sure! . . Don't expect parking or seating to be easy but things move along rather quickly. . . When you're in Chicago..try Buona Beef for Italian beef au jus; I'm reasonably certain you'll enjoy it more in terms of overall flavor and condiment options-- but...Phillipe's is hugely charming, affordable, memorable, and worthy of repeated visits.
