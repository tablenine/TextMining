Ate here at 8 pm on a Saturday night. Couldn't have asked for much more.. . Sat downstairs. Great feeling around the room. Open, but still had a personal feel. Meal started great with a couple of top notch martinis and crab cakes. The tuna was seared perfectly, and the swordfish was pretty good itself. . . I saw some negative reviews on here about the creme brulee. Maybe it was sub-par cause it was during restaurant week? I dunno, but ours was done perfectly. They also gave it to us on the house due to one of ours birthday.. . You pay for what you get, and I was just fine with that.
