i'll preface this review by saying that i ate so much and was so satisfied that i didn't even eat the piece of sweet mandy b's cake that i had in the fridge for when i got home. that, in and of itself, says a lot (if you know me and my intense addiction to cake, that is).. . our dinner here was very good. we came at 5:15pm on a sunday and were seated immediately. i had a great glass of chianti and george had the very expensive coca-cola (meaning no free refills...seriously, how much could it cost them?). that aside, the food was really good. i like the house salad with the dressings and the mediterranean bread best. so incredibly delicious. i would order just those two items for take-out in a second. i got the pizza without mushrooms but with meat sauce and it was good - nothing bad about it, just nothing exceptional that i would have a craving for (although it should be noted that i ate almost an entire 1/2 pounder).. . service was prompt and friendly. i'm sure we'll do take-out a few times this winter, and we'll probably go back to eat sometime in the next few years.
