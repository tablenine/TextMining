I'd forgotten how much I like this place, since it's been a few years. There was no wait and the service was excellent and friendly, which is so refreshing after getting used to being herded like cattle at all the overcrowded spots. Even parking was easy!  The menu is fairly simple, but not too small  -- everyone in our five person party found something they liked.
