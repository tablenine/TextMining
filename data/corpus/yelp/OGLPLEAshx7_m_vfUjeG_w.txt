Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
my husband hates on this place - i don't get it.  maybe i'm not that much of a prime rib expert but i certainly like to think that i know great food when i taste it...and lawry's prime rib definitely falls into this category.  . . yes, the meal is expensive for what it's worth and come on, how often do you crave prime rib?  so it's worth it to splurge and treat your taste buds a little.  . . when i had my meal here a few years back, i remember the prime rib being really juicy and tender and of course, moist.  i remember wondering to myself if this was really meat...meat can't possibly taste this tender and soft, right?  and the fixings that went along with it - tossed salad, creamed spinach and yorkshire pudding - were good compliments and the cherry on top of my prime rib sundae!   . . it was a good meal...and the best part...it was free!  i had a college course there and i believe our professor comp all of our meals...maybe that's why lawry's tasted so good in my memory...and maybe that's why my husband's hating...sucka!
