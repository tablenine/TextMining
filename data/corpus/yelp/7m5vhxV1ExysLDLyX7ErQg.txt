This place is probably the best cuban food you will find on the west coast.   Coming from Florida I feel I have to knock it down a tad due to the more mild than authentic flavors but the amazing prices and great portions more than make up for it.  Cuban Sandwich was perfectly prepared and decently sized and at less than $5 its one of the best deals you will find in the area.  Pastries are good as well although the guava flavors are not as authentic as you will find elsewhere.   Place gets crazy busy during lunch and parking is a pretty big issue, but don't be afraid to park way down the street and know you will need to walk off your lunch on the way back.
