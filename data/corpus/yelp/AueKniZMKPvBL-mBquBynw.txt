Yum! Yum! Yum! I like this place too much and have had to limit patronage to keep it special. You can always tell a great restaraunt in LA if people are willing to park then wait in line for food. Gingergrass always has a short wait but it's always worth it.. . The Bo Sate is a great combination of unique flavors between filet, yams and peanut sauce. Get the Basil LIme Elixer - you won't be disappointed.
