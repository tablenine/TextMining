For catering and quick delivery Toast is the best!  Need lunch for 45 guests in 3 hours?   They are the ones to call.  They really provide 5 star service.  The food itself is a little pricey and deserving of a 3-4 star rating but it always arrives fresh and well-presented and our guests are always happy, especially with the variety on the dessert tray.  If we need take-out, they welcome us to park in the valet area for a quick pick-up.  They would not be my first choice for dine-in because of the lines and parking but for their quick, friendly, efficient, and professional service and delivery, they are the BEST!
