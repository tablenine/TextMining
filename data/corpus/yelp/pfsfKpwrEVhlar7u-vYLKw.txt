Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This is one of my favorite KBBQ places in LA.  They use their own special sauce for marinating the meat which is sweet and enticing.  . . Would not go with more than 4 people as you will get a little crowded.  . . It is fairly pricey but the food is worth it.  The staff is usually friendly and prompt though I try not to go when it is crowded.
