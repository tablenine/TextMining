I looked at the numerous Ecco reviews on this site so i thought I would give it a try.  I was very disappointed.  . . The appetizers that we ordered were squid, pork sausage, &amp; meatballs.  The squid &amp; pork sausage were good.  However, the meatballs were flavorless.. . Entrees were pricey and not worth it.  Our table ordered the roasted pork, fried quail, and chicken fettuccine.  They were OK.. but I expected more based on all the fantastic reviews I have read on this site.. . Lastly, the service SUCKED!  We had to constantly flag down our server for everything from cocktails to dessert.  I understand it was a busy night but the service was the last straw on a bad night.. . I will not be going back to Ecco again.  Once was enough!
