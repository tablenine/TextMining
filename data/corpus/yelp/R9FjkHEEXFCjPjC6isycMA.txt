Amazing, fresh sushi, long waits, cramped (but it can be fun in the "hey, that looks good, what is it?" kind of way), have I mentioned amazing?. . Make sure to try:. Dynamite roll (especially if you like spicy rolls). Southern gals. It's fried and topped with BBQ sauce. Sounds like blasphemy? It is... and hell tastes AWESOME.. Rock n roll. The plain sushi/sashimi dinners: The other chefs do the rolls, but Mitch is solely responsible for the sushi and sashimi. Want to see his mastery? Choose one of the samples and throw Mitch a smile. He will make you see the God that you had offended when you ordered sushi covered in BBQ sauce.
