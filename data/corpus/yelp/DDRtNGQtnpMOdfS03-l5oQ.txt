we actually didn't pay any cover when we went on a friday night. . . the music was good but the place was filled with a highly random crowd that i wasn't really a fan of. also, people who are 50+ should not be making out on a couch next to me. it's just...weird. . . drinks were really watery. i drank my captain &amp; diet like i'd drink a glass of water.
