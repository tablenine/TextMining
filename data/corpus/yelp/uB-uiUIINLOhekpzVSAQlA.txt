Do I even need to review this place?  It's been consistent no matter what city I've been to.  Some highlights:  Avocado eggroll appetizers, tons of fun burger, thai noodle salad, navajo sandwich, everything.. . Here's a tip at this location though.  It never fails us.  Go in at anytime and bypass the line.  Go to the bar area and find an open seat.  Sit down and enjoy.  . . If someone does smoke, you can barely smell it since it's pretty airy.  . . If you are in a big group, sorry, you have to wait.. . But for all you couples standing there and waiting with your buzz lightyear device in your back pocket, sit your butt down and order already.
