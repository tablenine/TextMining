This place honestly never disappoints.  Working nearby, I often go here when I am in need of satisfying my hunger. I have tried several different items on the menu and for the most part have never been disappointed.  Even the specials are great.. . The one thing that I absolutely recommend is the beef pho.  It is amazing.  Definitely my favorite. Oh, and their pho is WAY WAY WAY better than that "other" pho place nearby.  You people who think otherwise are crazy.. . The one thing I don't recommend is the slaw.  It just tastes weird.. . The service here is usually great.  I've never had bad service...but sometimes it does get a little more on the average side when they are slammed...which is completely understandable and not really an issue because even then, the food still comes out quickly.. . Whether you love Vietnamese food or even if you have never tried it, Gingergrass is definitely a great place to go.
