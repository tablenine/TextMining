Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I am a big fan of their SWEET TARO BUNS !!! I LOVE TARO !!! IF YOU LOVE TARO, PLEASE ORDER IT !!!. . And about some other dishes:. . The mysterious "appetizer" on the menu is usually a cold dish, either chilled marinated cucumbers or shredded bean curd with bean sprouts. They're both delicious!. . The pork dumplings are delicate and juicy, not greasy at all, which is a big big plus! The beef soup is also flavorful without the grease. This is by far the healthiest tasting Chinese restaurant.. . Another plus is their customer service. We were sitting right below the A/C ventilation and we asked them to turn down the A/C so it's not blowing directly at us and they did! . . I took off one star for the price and the wait. They only seat you once the entire party is here (even though I told them my friends are in the parking lot and there wasn't even a line). It's not that pricey, but always a little higher than expected.
