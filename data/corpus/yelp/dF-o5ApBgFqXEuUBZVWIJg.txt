Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
The deung shim ( rib eye steak) was pretty good.  29.99. The wahng galbi was also pretty good.. Their dduk is great.  Very soft. Not mushy.  They also have the radish wrap too.. The banchan is good too. (potatoes, the soysauce pickle w jalapeno, boochingae, chunsachae,  broccoli with chojang...). Their hot sauce is great.
