Ok, so I've been here like twice, but they've got french toast I can't get outta my mind.  And the biscuits w/ the jam they serve... mm.... The other foods are very - different and not particularly appealing to me, but I have tons of friends who love it.  This place is ALWAYS packed so be ready to wait and wear extra deodorant.  Featured on Food Network - do you still think I'm lying to you???
