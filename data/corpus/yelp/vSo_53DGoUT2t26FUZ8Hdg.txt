I don't know why I went for a piping hot bowl of Pho when it was an unbearably humid 95ยบ F outside, but despite the fact I left even hotter than I entered, it was definitely worth it. . . The spring rolls were tasty and a good deal for $2.75, but they're incomparable to the deliciousness of the ones at C'om down the street. I got the small bowl of pho with shrimp (with no noodles and extra veggies), and my dining partner opted for the medium serving of pho with eye round steak. The broth was fresh, healthy, and flavorful, and the plate of herbs and spices on the side was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The small was huge, and I doubt I'll ever order anything bigger. I couldn't get over that it was $5!!! I can see myself coming here all the time in the winter, and it wouldn't even make a dent in my wallet.. . The spaces in the parking lot were definitely made for Smart Cars, so park at your own risk! Ambiance was nothing memorable, but it was so spacious that I can't imagine ever having a wait there. The air was kind of stuffy and hot inside, and I wish it was a little cooler in order to fully enjoy the hot pho. . . Don't leave before trying some of the sauce in the squeeze bottle on each of the tables. It's a smoky, garlic-y, spicy (not nearly as spicy as the sriracha) sauce that's super tasty.
