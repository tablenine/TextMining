I never really "liked" this place...but I still would go with friends from time to time and have a good time. The crowd gets more and more Lincoln Parky since it's opened, of couse, but that's to be expected. I haven't eaten anything besides the wasabi fries, which weren't as good as I expected them to be. Their beer is decently priced, and I do like the set up. Also, when the computerized mirror in the bathroom worked that was cool. They sometimes play good music. I guess this place isn't bad...maybe I'm not adult enough for the crowd. It's like for low key people that consider themselves hipsters, but are actually yuppies (and boring).
