Restaurant: Woodfire Grill
Category: American (New)
I headed to Woodfire for the first time in September.  Everything about that experience was outstanding.  This was a restaurant I wanted to try several years ago, even before Kevin came on board.  I then started watching Top Chef and fell head over hills for Kevin's simple cooking style and knew that I had to try his place out.  I absolutely love how you get to see Kevin in action while you dine. The music is also a compliment to the space.  . . Our waiter was fabulous.  He has actually been our waiter on several of our visits.  He was very patient with helping us select a wine after describing what we like.  I think we got it right after the third taste!  (Spann Charbono...delish!). . I had the mixed salad, softshell app, halibut, and side okra.  My girlfriend had the butternut squash soup, strip, and beans.  I don't think we really spoke to each other during our meal.  It was that good.  The halibut melted in my mouth.  I actually liked the soup better than the salad, and I could have gone without the softshell app.  The portions are large enough were you don't need every course.. . I didn't give Woodfire Grill a five simply because our following visits have not measured up to the initial visit.  The food just seems a touch off.  I would attribute this to the restaurant gaining more popularity due to Kevin's skills on Top Chef.  He still won in my book!  And I will continue to go back for more because it still is "that good."
