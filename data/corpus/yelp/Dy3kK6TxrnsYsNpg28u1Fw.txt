i came back to nyc after leaving it for 2 1/2 years.. . it was noisy and dirty and i missed it so very much.  it was my home for 11 years.. . so for a little detox,  i stopped here at gobo after reading great reviews from yelpers.. . like any bad a**...i never like to follow the rules so i was so happy that they served me the veggie burger with sweet potato fries even though it was not on the menu for that time of day.  downed with gulps of soy bubble tea, this usual carnivore was in gobo heaven.
