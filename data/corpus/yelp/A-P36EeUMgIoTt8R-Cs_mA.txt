If I were still single, this would probably be my first date place.  Bob San has been open a few years, so it no longer gets that "lets go cause its cool and new" crowd, but it does still manage to draw enough "beautiful" people to impress a date, while also drawing on the diversity of the locals for the real flavor.  As far as the food goes, the House Crunch and Bob San hand roll are my favorites.  My only criticism is that all of their 'spicy' stuff is basically doused in Tabasco.  Nothin' wrong with Tabasco, but how about some different flavors?  And with Mirai down the street (although at a higher price point), you gotta reprasent!  Ya-so-ma-say!
