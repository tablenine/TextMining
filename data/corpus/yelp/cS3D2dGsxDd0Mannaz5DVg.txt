I'm all about some d'z.  Despite being a non meat consumer, I love coming to this bbq place.  Great mac and chz as well as fried zucchini and broccoli chz casserole.  Service is super friendly.  The boyfriend and his buddies have to come here at least once a week for "pulled pork goodness".  Great jazz on the patio!
