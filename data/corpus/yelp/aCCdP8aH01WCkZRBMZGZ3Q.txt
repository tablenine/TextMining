If I had money I'd probably try to come in at least twice a month.  The food here is yum.  The ambiance is very lively.  You can not hear your date.  There is a DJ spinning the turn tables through the whole night.  The Filet Mignon is awesome, the kobe beef is delicious and the shitake mushrooms is to die for!  The rolls are so so!  Prices are not that bad.
