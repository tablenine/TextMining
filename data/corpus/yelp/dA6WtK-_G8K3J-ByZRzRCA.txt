Initially I was bummed when we arrived and were informed (by a member of our party) that Peter Chang had left, but had I not been told that I'm sure I never would have known from the food we received.  . . Personally, I loved the service -- Phuong (? the hostess?) is just as no-nonsense as it gets, but at the end of the day she's just looking out for her customers.  We ordered one appetizer, which was met with a disapproving look and finally "If I were you, I would order THIS instead."  Done and done!  Just tell her what you're after and she'll make sure you get a good assortment of dishes.  . . The food was absolutely delicious.  The white fish and cilantro rolls were amazing (especially considering that I detest fish and cilantro....go figure).  Don't miss the won tons in red oil....it's more like an oily soup, but we'll order it again.  . . Our table especially enjoyed the salt and pepper shrimp -- large individually fried shrimp with plenty of flavor -- and several of the pork belly dishes.   The only plate that wasn't a hit was the Sichuan Beef ...definitely a little too dry for most of our tastes.. . Long story short, we'll be back.  Hopefully sooner than later.
