It is a fine sausage they sling.  I just had my first bratwurst (I started out simple, though regulars rave about the rattlesnake and rabbit).  I chose caramelized onions and sauerkraut as my two toppings, which lent a little crunch, a little sweetness, and a nice peppery punch to an already flavorful dog.  To accompany the crisp and golden brown fries, we chose a pesto mayo (I'm going to start making my own, it's so good!), and a chipotle aioli, which tasted remarkably like BBQ potato chips.  Immensely satisfying.  Also, instead of your standard LA tap water, they have refreshing cucumber water for those who don't wish to pay an extra $5 for a soda (I don't care if it's handmade by hippie leprechauns, that's way too much for a bottle of sugar water), or $10 for a beer. The beer selection is good, but you're paying a high premium to be seen drinking it.. . Overly expensive drinks aside, the prices don't hurt too bad.  Sans beer or sodas, my GF and I ate for a very decent $15, although we did use the KCRW member discount. (Love that card!)  Also, there are no waiters to tip, though a buck or two for the counter guy is always appreciated.. . Why not 5 stars?  Because you have to wade through a slew of downtown hipsters to get your order in.  At least the people-watching can be enjoyable.
