I saw this on Man vs Food, and i like Ramen.  For Ramen its overly price, but I guess its the experience.  They give you a big serving (I wasn't able to finnish mine).  Good atmosphere, a little small tho, so if busy, expect a wait.  And no i didn't try their special, I ain't crazy enough to try it. =)
