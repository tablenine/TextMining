Went there upon coworkers recommendation. The food isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about. We ordered the farmer breakfast dish, meatball pizza, and tea sandwiches.. . The breakfast dish wasn't what we expected, we thought it was gonna be like a scramble. But it was something healthier looking and small portion.  Pizza was a bit salt. Tea sandwich was average.  For the price, we expected the food to be better. . . The place is pretty noisy, service was good tho.
