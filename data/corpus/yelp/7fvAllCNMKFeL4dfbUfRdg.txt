Restaurant: Twist
Category: Sushi Bars
I live 5 minutes from Twist so it's a great go-to place when you want to meet a bunch of friends for dinner and drinks. The bar area is semi-cool. Half off bottles of wine on Monday nights! I think this restaurant is pretty casual but a lot of people seem to come all dressed up for it...but then again, people seem to dress up to go shopping at Phipps, where it's located, so maybe that makes sense...ANYWAY.. . Aside from the fact that Twist can't seem to make up its mind about what kind of restaurant it is (also a problem at Shout in Midtown-- is it a tapas place? a sushi place? a seafood place? a romantic dinner place? a happy hour place?), the food is GOOD. Sushi is fine (I love the Super Crunchee!) and paella is good enough... only sad thing about the food is that I used to LOVE their bacon-wrapped scallops and they took it off the menu for some reason.. . But for the convenience and the sure fact that everyone will find something they can eat on the extensive menu, I'll be back I'm sure.
