Enough have been said about Bossa Nova as a whole.  Huge portions of amazing food served by friendly people at 2:00 am. . . I am concentrating my review on the Bossa Burger.  The Bossa Burger is what Hitler was picturing when he named that town in Germany.  I had been craving red meat for a week and this certainly satisfied.  Dressed with lettuce, tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms, it is perfection on a bun.  A really good bun.  Mmmmm....
