Not hype at all.  This place is actually very good.  The meat is all surprisingly moist, and if you need a piece that's rare, or well-down, you'll get it.  The sides are great, but I tried to fill up on pounds of meat to get my money's worth.  Even the salad bar is fantastic.  Everything is very fresh, and high quality.  . . The salt crusted filet is amazing.  I'm not a big fan of the bacon wrapped whichever piece and the ribs are largely too fatty to enjoy.  The sausage and the chicken are both very tasty as well.
