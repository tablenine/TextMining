Restaurant: Little Bangkok
Category: Chinese
A favorite for everyone.  Little Bangkok has a welcoming and clean tucked-in atmosphere that is hard to find in Atlanta.  You can tell through the clientele that many have been eating there for years.  Amy, the owner, knows who her regulars are and takes the time to tell you how she appreciates the business!  Now the food, fantastic.  This is feel good Thai and Chinese food.  Nothing fancy or fusion here, just tummy warming yummy!  A great place for both eat in and take out, Little Bangkok is a must for anyone looking for great Intown Thai food...
