I've actually NEVER been to shabushabu in Little Tokyo, but I can tell you one thing..... that place is ALWAYS happening! And it's always busy until it is closed. How do I know this? I only work RIGHT across from it lol and people need to stop moving our damn chairs around because yours truley, has to keep putting them back! I dont even know why our store puts those chairs out there. Â  But anyway it's bangin. All the time.
