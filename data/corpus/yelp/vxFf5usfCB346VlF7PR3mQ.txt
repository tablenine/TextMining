Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Already a southern soul food tradition, Roscoe's was made famous for bringing chicken and waffles to the west. For those who think it's a weird combination. Let's think it through. Fried chicken with honey is a classic combination. Taking that into account, fried chicken and syrup isn't that far of a stretch. And instead of biscuits, why not include a different starch, one that goes better with syrup. And then there you go, chicken and waffles. . . Although Roscoe's has all sorts of crazy chicken and waffle combinations, whenever I go, I just get the original Chicken and Waffles. If you're new to the experience or only visiting once, skip the giblets and order what made them famous, the classic Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
