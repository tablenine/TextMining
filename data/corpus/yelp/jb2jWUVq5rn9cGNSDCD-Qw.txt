It's been awhile so I'll make this short.. . he kimchee quesadilla was delicious and I was surprised that the wait was not that long. Â It could do with some extra spice for those who like it hot-- maybe a sauce bar? . . Tofu burrito was also good, but again I expected it to be more savory.. . However, both were tasty and very filling and worth the money.
