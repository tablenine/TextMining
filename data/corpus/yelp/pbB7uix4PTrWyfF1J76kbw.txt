Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's has been KILLIN IT since ever since with their Guava cream cheese Rolls, Fruit tarts, Assorted Cakes(Best damn cakes PERIOD), Cuban sammiches, etc.... . At every one of my Family parties in LA...there's always something from Porto's in the dessert area to satisfy the genetic sweet tooth.. . I haven't had one thing from here that I didn't enjoy.. . Check it out, Yelp about it, blow the spot up. . They deserve to Shine :)
