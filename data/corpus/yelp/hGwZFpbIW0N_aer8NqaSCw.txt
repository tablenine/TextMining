Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I went her with a friend before like a few years back, and I REALLY liked it, and decided to take another friend here.. . Since we got there at around 2 PM, the wait wasn't as bad as I though, maybe 5 minutes for a table for two. The place looked packed, but the crowds died down as we had our lunch.. . Looking at the crossed out dumpling with soup, we decided to get entrees and split them. In addition to that, we decided to get a dessert dumpling tray, for the fun of it.. . * Chicken Fried Rice. * Chicken Fried Noodles. * Red Bean/Taro dumplings. . Even though the portions of the entrees were small and kind of pricey, it was sort of worth it, due to the quality of the food. However, there were a few things here and there that kind of pushed my buttons a bit.. . First off, I had to ask for our tea, when everyone else got their tea automatically. And mind you, I totally understand that it's busy and all, but if everyone else got their tea, even not having their food delivered to them, how come I had to ask for it?. . I guess the big pusher was that we finished our entrees, and waited a good 7-10 minutes, and yet our dessert tray didn't come out. I finally decided to raise my hand and ask about it. Took another couple more minutes, and the waitress checking our paper twice in order for us to get it out. I didn't remember whether or not we had to ask to have it come out, or it came out automatically when we were done with the savory stuff, but this was during the time where it was kind of an off-time, and it wasn't as busy as it was when we first arrived.. . I would come back again, but if the same thing happened again, it just means they'll get a lesser tip than normal.
