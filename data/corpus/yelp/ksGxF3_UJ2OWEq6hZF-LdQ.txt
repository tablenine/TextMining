First of all it's great they do breakfast, not enough breakfast joints in Atl (I'm not including McDonald's or microwave king). The food is good here but partly because you wait so long to be seated, then served, that you're starving by the time you get the first fork full of food in your mouth (remember, hunger is the best gravy). The service is slightly sub par, but unfortunately that's common.. I'd recommend this place if you're not in a hurry.
