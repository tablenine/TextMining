Almost 5 stars. Evey thing is great enough to be 5 stars, but since the waiting, parking (the one ways......uuhhhhh), loudness were bothersome, I dropped one star. . . The place is great. The white walls, open kitchen, high ceiling, very clean &amp; elegant restroom, BIG glass windows... The food - 5 stars!! - the fresh ingredients, quality, taste, and wow~ for the price of the food. . We had Caprese Salad, White wine-steamed mussels &amp; clams, Shrimp penne pasta (Penne Gamber), Napoli pizza (mushroom, olive, tomato, red onion), and they were all GREAT. Most of the dishes are ranged around $6 ~ $23, but they all taste like $30~50 dishes.. . There are some waiting...parking is not that easy or convenient... (sucks), but I am DEFINETELY loving it and coming back for more.
