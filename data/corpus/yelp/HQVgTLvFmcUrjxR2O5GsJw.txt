I still love this place, but I have to say - I was just here a couple days ago for shaved ice, and I saw a very disturbing sign with a big 48% on it. Upon further scrutiny, I realized it was the grade that got from their health department inspection.. . I could have sworn I'd seen an A or a B up on their windows before, but when I looked this time, it had disappeared.. . I love their food, but now I'm a little scared. Â Perhaps they're trying to be more authentic in their Taiwanese eats by introducing cockroaches?. . But I'm paying American prices, so I expect American cleanliness standards. Guess I won't be coming back here for another month or two, or however long it takes them to get their act together.
