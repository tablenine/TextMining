Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Best Chinese food I've had in the city outside of Chinatown.  If not the best, it's a close second to Ho Toy on the southside.  But Ho Toy doesn't deliver.  Friendship delivers quickly and the packaging is perfect for keeping the food hot and in one piece.  The prices are pretty reasonable for the large servings you receive.  And most importantly, the food is just very good.  You can't go wrong with this place.
