As if this place needs one more review.  But, I always have to say my piece whether or not it really has to be said.  . . I started coming to this location years ago when it was Sundown Cafe...they formally changed to Taqueria del Sol shortly thereafter.  I never even knew they were related.  The tacos, as in all the other locations, are amazing.  I always order the Carnitas, and an order of Guacamole (and no, I am not sharing, so don't even ask), and if the Bob Special or the Nutty Shrimp Special is on the menu, you can be sure I am dropping everything and going.  . . I love a place where, for less than $10, I can get enough food to fill me up, and it's fresh and tasty to boot.  . . By the way, the shrimp and corn chowder is to die for.  It has a little kick so spice wimps beware.  I could seriously eat that daily but my stomach (and thighs) would not approve.  But, on a cold winter night, it CANNOT be beat!. . Yes, the lines are long.  But in the 47 seconds after you pay, your food literally comes flying out of the kitchen.  I think, no matter the line, it averages out to be a pretty quick meal!
