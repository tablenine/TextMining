SooWon!! where have you been all my life.... . Not to turn my back on Yang San Bak but OMG they're delicious!!!. . It's a small little tiny place in a strip mall next to a laundry mat. (WEIRD) Â This place is very popular so call ahead or be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. It is obvious that a lot of non Koreans come here since the waitresses help you do everything. I don't get that kind of service at yang san bak. (But my favorite spicy pork belly spot will forever be yang san bak! ). . The food is delicious; their meat is really great from the pork neck to the beef. Everything was scrumptious. The truth is, I was really impressed by the service, we never ran out of sides because they always kept bringing more, they grilled the meat for us and they even gave us new ideas on how to eat our meats! Hahaha.. . . Anyway, if you're craving some KBBQ check this place out its worth it.
