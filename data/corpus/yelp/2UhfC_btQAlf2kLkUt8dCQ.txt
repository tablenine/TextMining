KOJI....KOJI....KOJI....KOJI....KOJI..... . I've heard all the hype about this TACO Truck but every time I've seen it had HUNDREDS of people in line and NO WAY am I standing in a line like that for a TACO. So I'm cruzin' down Eagle Rock Blvd on Saturday night out for some TACOS was NOT planing on KOJI but when I saw it and there was "NO LINE" just bunches of people hanging around eating I pulled over parked and said now's the time to see if this Taco Truck lives up to all the hype.. . OK, So I ordered...... 2- Korean BBQ Beef Tacos. 2- Korean "SPICY" Pork Tacos. . First of all they are damn SMALL Tacos for $2.00 each!.......... I'm not sure what kind of corn tortilla they use but it was very tuff so after one Taco I ended up tossing the tortillas and just eating the meat out of the paper tray they serve it in.. . OK, the Korean BBQ Beef (not sure but think they were called short ribs?) it had decient flavor BUT the meat was barely warm! (NO BUENO AMIGO) the little slaw topping they put on top was pretty good, but I really found NOTHING special about these TACOS other than it's a "KOREAN TACO".. . Now for the "SPICY" ha,ha,ha Pork Taco, This was 100% crap absolutely NO flavor and how they call it SPICY? I have NO idea!, and again just barely warm meat.. . I know everybody has their opinion, likes and dislikes....SO this is just my OPINION.... KOJI does NOT live up to all the hype and at $2.00 per Taco or $5.00 per Burrito it's something different but NOT all that, I will close by saying............. . OYE KOJI......dejen los  TACOS a los MEXICANOS que saben cómo hacerlo mejor!
