Restaurant: BondSt
Category: Japanese
I have been to Bond St a handful of times over the past few years, and always had a pretty good experience. However, after the terrible dining experience I had recently, I will not be returning. The portions seemed to have diminished in size considerably, and the Toro Tartare tasted so off my friend nor I could bother to finish it. . . The gem of the evening was that after asking for the waiter's advice for a bottle of sake, he brought the wrong bottle of sake (unbeknownst to us, as we told the waiter we were unfamiliar with sake) -- they proceeded to charge us for the more expensive bottle, and even brought out the unbelievably rude manager, which evidently made a scene in the small restaurant. I was appalled, and, needless to say, will not be returning.
