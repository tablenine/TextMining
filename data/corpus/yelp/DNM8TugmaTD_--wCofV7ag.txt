Upon walking into Philippe's I did a preliminary cost/benefit analysis of waiting in the incredibly long line vs. potentially eating what had been sold to me as "THEE BEST FRENCH DIP. EVER.," and I'm glad I decided the benefits outweighed the costs, because it seriously turned out to be THEE. BEST. FRENCH. DIP. EVER. We went right before a Dodger game, which made the day that much more fun, and even though we were like the ninetieth people in line, it moved really fast, and you get your food right away. I don't really like asking a stranger if he can scootch so I can basically sit in his lap while I eat, but it's worth it. Especially if he's a cute stranger.
