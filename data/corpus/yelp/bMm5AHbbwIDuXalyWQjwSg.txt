i had heard a lot of great things about this place, esp since good greek food is hard to find in LA.  and my conclusion is that this place is overhyped.  we had a few kebabs, and a few sides... ordering was pretty much hell because the ladies behind the counter were smug and rude.  Food isnt that cheap, portions are small... perhaps i ordered the wrong stuff??? but how can anyone screw up kebabs right???  the food was just ok, but the roasted potatoes were amazing.  i would go back here, but i wouldnt fiend to go back.  . . i say give it a try, just once.... and come to your own conclusion
