Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
For Mother's Day this year, my kids decided to take me to a more simpler relaxing brunch rather than the usual buffet's we go to.  Ford's gave all mothers free mimosas which was really nice, unfortunately we got a waiter that was so mediocre I only got to get one glass :( ...  and our food took forever to come.. . The following food was ordered:. . Starters:. . Grilled Baby Artichokes - (beefoodie says yummy for your tummy) this was the best dish ... aioli was good and the artichokes grilled to perfection.. . Deviled Eggs - not my favorite but my kids really loved it.. . Entrees:. . French Toast Brioche with Blueberry Syrup - this would have been really good if they separated the blueberry from the french toast, by the time I got it the toast were soggy from the syrup.  The toast was not bad but will never order again.. . Trout with Arugula Salad and Couscous - this was the favorite of the table.  It was really good and tasty.. . Beef Brisket Hash with Eggs - my daughter said that it was really good and definitely clean up her plate. I didn't get a chance to try this one.. . Hangar Steak with Eggs - not bad not great ... just OK!. . Angus Chili with Cheese Omelette - this was good but wished there was more chili than what was given.. . Dessert:. . Baked Alaska - good but the mango mouse was so sour ... but i guess blended well with the meringue.. . I have mixed feelings about this restaurant ... I am not sure if I will come back but maybe for dinner to give it another chance.. . 'til the next beefoodie adventure!
