I get the hype, understanding the long line that goes throughout the doors. . . Makes me miss Cafe Lalo on the UWS and al the lil cafes there with the great desserts. The pastries here are indeed beautiful. . . The food portions are outrageous. . . CARROT GINGER SOUP comes in a boat. Friend thought it was too gingery. I don't even like ginger and thought it was perfect to give that extra zing. . . PEACH ESPRESSO CREPE too sweet for my tastebuds. . . OMELETTE good, meh. . . COFFEE we had to carry this large cup, about to spill, outside, down itty bitty steps, large crowds. circus acts can be fun. . . FRUIT TART CHEESECAKE pretty dang good! even though i have stopped to try every cheesecake i come across, this one i had to try b/c it was soo pretty and it was good. . . Would I go back? Yes. One of the bus boys was so nice as to make sure all the umbrellas were opened and everyone was getting shade. it's the little things.
