Food is definitely the king at Naha. Went for a business lunch. Great weather made al fresco workable. Had the pork belly appetizer; each item was discretely flavorful and perfectly cooked, from the meat to the fiddleheads to the morels. Also had the quail, on a celery root puree with a sweet curried shallot on the side. Once again stunningly well prepared and luscious. No joke, this was one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Somehow I expected it would be more delicate and "Mediterranean," but to great success the flavors were robust, even lusty. Will definitely return, with my wife for dinner. A little pricey but you can clearly see the skill that goes in.
