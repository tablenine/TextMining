Green sauce. It's spicy and I love it. The chicken is juicy, the yucca fries are yummy dipped in green sauce, the avocado salad is good and the sangria makes it just about fabulous.. . Fairly inexpensive, very small restaurant gets very busy on fri/sat nights. It's also a cheap date spot even if you just have green sauce (on anything) and a pitcher of sangria. You can't go wrong.
