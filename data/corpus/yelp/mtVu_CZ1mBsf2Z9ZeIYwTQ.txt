Restaurant: Belly Shack
Category: Latin American
I used to walk buy this building all the time when going to the Green Eye or the Western stop but at the time it was the cafe and I never stopped in. Now that its Belly Shack I meet some yelp friends here for a pre-dinner before heading out to Cole's bar. The menu itself is very sparse but If you are a vegetarian they have lots of options for you. The food is suppose to be some kind of Korean Puerto Rican fusion. The style of the restaurant is very sparse with tables and chairs here and there its a small place so not a lot of room. You have to go up to the register to order food and the only waitress is one that takes away your plates and serves you water. I had the lemon chicken sandwich dish and when I got it the dish was not served up as a sandwich, the chicken came separate from a pita style pocket bread. It came with some kind of topping which I did not try. The chicken itself tasted OK I have had way better at other cheaper places. I did not try anything else on the menu so this is only based on the food I had. Outside of the cute hipster girls and the interesting graffiti style art on the wall this place was just Meh especially for the price I paid for one sandwich. I would be willing to come back and try the other dishes.
