I just ventured to this little haven a few days ago on a friday night with some friends.  Although we were uber hungry, we didn't mind the wait because it was well worth it. We started off with the cold tofu which tasted like well, cold tofu. As an entree, I ordered the chicken teriyaki with sashimi (sashimi or tempura, I opted for the former for balance).  The chicken was absolutely delectable...or maybe I was just really hungry by then, either way it was fantastic. Nice and juicy on the inside with a hint of crispiness on the bottom, which I really enjoyed because it added more flavor on top of the teriyaki sauce. The dish also came with a side of salad and pureed mashed potatoes, which I enjoyed immensely as well. . . I left with a happily full stomach and quite sober....can't vouch for my other compadres though. ;)
