To get the boring stuff out of the way...I tried the Spicy Pork tacos and a slider just so I wouldn't wonder what all that hype was about. Yes, they were good. Although I'm not a fan of mayo and the slider had some kind of mayo-based sauce on it. The Spicy Chicken and Spicy Pork tacos, according to my roommate, were nearly indistinguishable from one another. She had to concentrate to decide which was which. Her fav was the shortrib taco. She said the flavors mingled the most nicely without being overpowered by the bbq-ness on the Spicy varieties.. . But, to the "meat" of my interests...the Tofu and the Vegan tacos. I supposedly stopped eating meat again for New Year's, but tried the meat anyway. Much to my surprise and mental well-being, the veg options that Chef Roy has masterminded are what I dream of. Pomegranate seeds on a vegan taco? Seriously? F*CK YEAH...SERIOUSLY GOOD! Who woulda' thunk? Well, Roy did and it rocks. As for the tofu...the flavors co-mingle perfectly. Everything is a yin and yang, give and take, subtle, yet profound. And yes, I'm still talking about tacos. Tacos WITHOUT MEAT in them.. . Thanks Chef Roy for doing us meat-tarded kids a favor and giving us vegetarian options that are top shelf instead of throwing us the wilted leftovers like most places do. To make me crave the tofu OVER the meat...well, my friend, you have performed a miracle and done me a big favor on my road to guilt-free eating.
