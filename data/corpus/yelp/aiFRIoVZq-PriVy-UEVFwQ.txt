I've seen the Check Please segment and have heard good things about this place, I'm happy to see that this place lives up to its expectations.  A great BYOB, probably one of the fanciest I've ever been to.  All of the food we ordered (group of 5) was great, especially the Crab Rangoon and the Sesame Chicken.  The Coconut Wasabi Chicken was rather unusual but I was into it.  The only reason why I'm not giving this place 5 stars is due to the acoustics.  It's not the smallest place, but when you shift your chair or talk to your friends when it's rather empty it'll sure feel like it.  I probably wouldn't say this if it was crowded (which it usually is from what I hear), but oh well.
