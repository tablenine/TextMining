My favorite sushi in LA.  It's really casual and loud.  It's not about presentation, it's about great sushi.  That's all.  They run around with a big chalkboard of specials.  Pretty much everything is small plates.  All of them good.  Fish is crazy fresh and melts in your mouth.  Prices are incredibly reasonable for LA.  And there are lots of bars in the area to have drinks before and after.  So it's all good.
