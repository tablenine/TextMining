I'm an East Coast brunch connoisseur and this place did not disappoint. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. The restaurant itself is beautiful and reminded me of some place in NYC. The only downside is the marble floors, high ceilings, and Sunday brunch crowd made it a little noisy.. . The brunch menu was great-- not too big, not too small. I had the egg white scramble, coffee, and a mimosa and loved every minute of it. Our table also shared a burrata pizza (it was that kind of morning...) which was fresh out of the brick oven in the back and soo soo good. I'll definitely be back.
