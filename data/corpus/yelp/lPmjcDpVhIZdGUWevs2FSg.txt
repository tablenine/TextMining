One of my fav places in the city... Especially when it's cold, rainy, late or you're tired and need food quick. This is like that comfy, old, familiar place around the corner from your parents house - except that it's not ugly, falling apart, and doesn't have that slighty-old-water smell. ;) It's SUPER modern, which I love. I also love 'hole in the wall' Pho too, don't get me wrong. But we're too used to crappy design and architecture in LA, so this place is a really nice change. While normally low-light places are best for dates, this is actually a really cool place for a date. Maybe there's something to be said for looking into someone's eyes while slurping up soup and making a mess? {smile}. . Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I love the stark white atmosphere and hanging lights... I'm only 5'4" though, so would never have a problem bumping my head on anything above! Yes the parking lot is tiny, but again, we have a warped perception of things in the urban-sprawl we call home: There is TONS of parking along Sunset, so park down the block or around the corner and WALK. If I can walk a few blocks in heels, I think you can probably survive. ;). . Back to the Pho... It's all delicious and always hits the spot (the fried spring rolls are great to share...). As soon as i feel a cold coming on I head here for hot soup and cold beer. Hehe...
