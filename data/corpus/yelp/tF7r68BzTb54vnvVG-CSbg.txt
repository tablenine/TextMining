Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I love Pinks.  Although many will say that it is over-rated, I have not had hot dogs as good as Pinks anywhere else...plus they have a huge variety and of hot dogs and fun names.  . . Their nacho cheese hot dog is delicious! as well as their chilli cheese fries (nacho cheese).  I do not recall the names of the other h.dogs I tried but my bf really likes their sausage ones.  . . The wait is really long, especially in the evenings, but take a warm sweater, scarf, and really good company and you'll have the time of your life.  We went there at 2am once and the atmosphere is gr8.
