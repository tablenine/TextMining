1. Mojitos = amazing. 2. Tuna watermelon ceviche = amazing. 3. The daily special appetizer platter = 4-5 kinds of amazing. 4. Seared ahi tuna entree and filet mignon entree (we shared) = salsa dance in your mouth. 5. Dance floor/dining room = uniquely entertaining. . I obviously enjoyed myself. That is all.
