I have wanted to come here for some time, simply for the fact that once a month Shaun caters to the gluten intolerant with a prix fixe GF meal. . . Came here for Sunday Brunch and started off the meal with a fabulous Strawberry Bellini. OK, actually I had two, but they were not too sweet and such light, strawberry goodness. I could have sipped on them all day. . . I had wanted to try the crispy soft shell crab, but the waitress checked with Shaun and confirmed that it was not GF. They did offer to make a special GF version, but I opted to go with the Flank Steak and Eggs. . My Flank Steak was cooked to order, perfectly medium rare, nicely seasoned, topped with two over easy eggs and served with a side of fries. My meal was delicious and I do believe I had the best meal in comparison of my dining companions. . . Good company, excellent food and drink. Shaun, I will be back to try that GF prix fixe meal!
