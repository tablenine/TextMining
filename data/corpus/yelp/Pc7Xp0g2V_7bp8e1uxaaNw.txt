My boss took me here on the first day of my job. . . It's a nice lunch place, with spacious beautiful ambience. The food was great too. The host was very friendly and alert. . . The service can get slow though. So if you're in a hurry, on an hour-long lunch break, make sure you let them know. But definitely recommended. . . For vegetarians: Spring Rolls and Eight Treasure Vegetable Tofu.
