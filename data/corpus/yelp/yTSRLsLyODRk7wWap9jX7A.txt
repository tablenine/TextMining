Yes the food is good.. I got one of each tacos. The tofu one is surprisingly really good. Might be one of my favorites. I like the greens on the top--the sauce they use is really good.. . I've never had it, but my friends say that the kimchi quesadilla is really good. Must try it soon.. . I went to a wedding where the food was catered by Kogi Truck! They had the tacos (unlimited Kogi tacos!) and the chef created special dishes just for the wedding! They were all so good! I can't remember they're names, but I think they should start selling it!. . Get here early. They run out of food quick! So if you want to make the cut, you will have to suffer the line.
