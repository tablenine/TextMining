i was happy with my manna experience today. walter and i took three other people out to dinner with us. we easily finished up a large lemon soju for our table. it was good. yummie, country time lemonade + soju= a good time. coincidentally, it was also my buddy chris cate's bday. he was there celebrating with friends. good times. anyway, the meat arrived at our table quickly and it was sad to see that the pork belly was frozen. umm...EH. anyways, other than that, the meat arrived quickly. the bulgogi and kalbi were soooo tasty. service wasn't always the best but it wasn't horrible. chap chae was tasty and not over done. the kimchi was just right but the salad was a bit too spicy for our guests. overall though, we had a nice time. it was a lot of fun. walter ate here for the first time tonight. he was pleased. it was about $120 for our table. sheesh! what did we order? we were at table #2. yay for our call button! that thing works magic. it's amazing. anyways, sitting at table #2 is my favorite. there is sufficient lighting and ventilation, away from the main dining room area. overall, we had fun and all but it was aiight. it's fun though with groups. i don't mind it. that's just me
