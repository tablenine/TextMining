Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The Apple Pan has been around for at least 50 years. Same guys have been the servers for almost that many. Quick service, consistency, quality ingredients, and amazing burgers and pie. I've been going there for 20 years.. .     * Pros: Hickory Burger, Steak Burger, Tuna Sandwich, and all Pies.     * Cons: They need a "take a number" system to seating.
