Category: Mexican
This location of Willy's has become a total guilty pleasure. It's not something I do often (less than once a month) but it's so dang close to my current apartment that sometimes it's just a hell of a lot easier than cooking. Plus, the guys in here are always super sweet, even if I come in looking like total hell. A chicken quesadilla or a taco, giant fountain diet coke, and a couple of handfuls of crispy chips: I'm a happy girl.. . That being said, I certainly don't view Willy's as an authentic Mexican spot. As a matter of fact, I was recently on a date with a Mexican-American and when I asked where he found good authentic Mexican food I was totally appalled that he mentioned Willy's in the same sentence. Sure, he said it after noting that there really wasn't a good option apart from making things yourself from the ingredients available at the many mercados around town, but still. I mean, this is Willy's. It's like saying that Five Guys is the best spot to get a burger. Sure, it'll do and it is mighty tasty and you may occasionally get a craving for it, but it's nothing worthy of any top 5 lists, much less top 10.. . +1 star because Willy's is definitely far above and beyond the other joints like it (namely Moe's and Baja Fresh). I'd go to Willy's over them any day of the week.
