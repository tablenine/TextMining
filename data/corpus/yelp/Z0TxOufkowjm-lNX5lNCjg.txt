My boyfriend and I used to come here regularly because of the quality of the sushi and the overall atmosphere.  The rolls are great, especially the Orange Crush and the Latin Heat.  However, I don't think it is worth paying $15 a roll.  Next time I go back will be for their half-price maki rolls on Saturdays or Sundays.
