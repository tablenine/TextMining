I have always loved Rodan, but I love it even more after my twilight zone experience of perfect service here the other night. . . I came in here with a group of friends on a crowded and busy Saturday night and was immediately approached by a waitress and asked "are you here for dinner or drinks."  I responded "drinks", which under normal circumstances means that I am no longer being considered for a table.  I was surprised when the waitress declared "hold on... I want to get you a booth".. . I am looking around the room at a full bar of people standing, perplexed by why I was being chosen to be seated.  I am not a celebrity look alike, I wasn't showing any cleavage, and I don't look like a baller who was about to order a bottle (although I don't think they have bottle service regardless).. . Anywho.  We were quickly seated, immediately given drinks, and we had the friendliest waitress ever.  Yes, it was weird.  And yes, it was fantastic.. . I love their lychee royal and lychee martini so we ordered a couple of those and classed it up with some PBR.  We also nibbled on some curry fries which were delicious!. . I was disappointed to see the bathroom did not have the reverse video camera functioning. I never cease to be entertained by that thing. Regardless, I love the atmosphere here. I am not sure why there are such mixed reviews on this place.  It is nice to have a chill bar with a different atmosphere than a sports pub.  Bars like Rodan are few and bar between!
