My friends and I call this place Furby. I like all their dishes on a stick, particularly the little hearts. The tongue tastes great too (as long as its piping hot). The only thing that I don't like about this place (and I'm not dinging them for that) is that there's a high chance you'll be sitting to some poser pretty boy trying to impress his date, or a couple going through some serious psycho-babble-codependency-OCD nonsense. For some reason, this place attracts that type of clientele but if you can block out their inane conversation, it's cool.
