WARNING!  This is not a vegan's paradise.  This is a place that only those who are wasted can find greasy food at 4 am.  If you go here sober I am honestly shocked.  . . I went here drunk many times over the last decade, and got dry toast because I was blasted, with equally blasted friends, and it was beyond late and we needed something to eat.  And it was awesome.  Mostly because everyone else there is in the same shape you are in, if not worse.. . But one time, early in the morning, while waiting for a friend, I went here.  I was stone sober from the night before's events (do not ask) and a friend and I were waiting impatiently for a phone call from the friend and nothing else around was open.  It's bizarre being there at 6-7 am.  The people are completely different.  They are there to actually eat.  It was a weird and surreal experience that I hope not to see again.. . A friend of mine, a prominent local DJ who is wheelchair-bound, said he has been pretty much ejected from the place the last few times he has been there and that makes me very angry.  They yelled at him and said he was blocking up the thoroughfare but what the hell else can he do when there is no handicapped seating areas?  Because of that I will probably never go there again.  I will forage through the spoiled crap I have in my fridge before I see this place again.
