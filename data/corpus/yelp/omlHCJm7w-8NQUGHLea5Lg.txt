Restaurant: Taqueria Del Sol - Decatur
Category: Tex-Mex
After seeing Taq del Sol featured on the food network last year, I have been waiting and waiting for a chance to go. That chance came when a group of friends went last week. . . I counted the minutes until my order made it to the table. I heard their guac is delicious, so naturally i guarded mine like a kid on Halloween guards the reeces. I also ordered a fish taco and the memphis (pork) taco.. . Well, here's the verdict. Guac: hells yeah. Fish taco: tasty but not full of enough stuff. Memphis: waste of money. Now I still maintain that I make the best guacamole around, and taqueria del sol certainly cannot compete with my guac, but theirs is mighty tasty, esp compared to many other mexican places around that serve guacamole that resembles tarnished peas with a few flecks of tomatoes. This was chuncky and fresh. The chips were warm. I was happy.. . The memphis taco really was a throw away. The flavor was all wrong and it was a bit greasy. The fish taco, however, had great flavor. The tartar sauce was interesting and a bit hot, which I like. I wish the taco had more stuff in it, though. Maybe a slaw of some sort of a pico-de-gallo...or who knows, maybe another piece of fish?!. . Anyway, I will definitely be returning, this time to try the fried chicken and the brisket and the cheese dip, all of which my fellow diners said were scrumptious. As far as taq del sol being featured on the food network; either their quality has Â gone down a bit in the past year, or food network doesn't have the highest of standards.
