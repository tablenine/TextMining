I had high hopes for this placed given all the positive write ups by Los Angeles mag and LA Times.  Walked away disappointed.  . . Staff was nice, but food was  mediocre.  Nothing stood out.  I had the duck and it was not even warm.  . . when you can't remember how things taste it must have not been good.
