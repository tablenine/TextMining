It's a little pricey, but not too expensive.  I met an old friend for lunch.  We originally were going to go to Tender Greens, but their line was out the door.  So, we got seated at Ford's right away.  I got a charcuterie platter with prosciutto, salame, and smoked beef, plus a blue cheese.  It was quite good, but kind of expensive at $20.  My friend got a burger that looked pretty good.  I would come here again.  Service was really good, the food was good.  Place was nice.
