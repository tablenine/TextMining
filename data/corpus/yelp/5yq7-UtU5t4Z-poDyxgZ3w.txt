Restaurant: Twist
Category: Sushi Bars
I went to Twist last night to celebrate my birthday. I had 16 friends with me and after everyone showed up, we were seated almost immediately. We were given the private party room, which really made everything enjoyable because we didn't have to yell at each other over the roar of other restaurant patrons. The servers were polite, funny, very attentive, and all our food came out extremely quick. I'd been to Twist a few times before this, and so far I have yet to be disappointed with the tapas. I think the prices and portions are fair; if anything, I think you get more food at Twist vs. some other tapas bars I've been to. The people in my party who had never been before only had good things to say. . . My "birthday cake" was the molten chocolate amazingness with almond ice cream. DEEElicious!
