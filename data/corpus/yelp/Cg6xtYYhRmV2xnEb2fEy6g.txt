The beef dip with blue cheese is my favorite, and the lamb dip is deeply flavored and rich and decadent (try putting some coleslaw on your sandwich next time, too). I have a ridiculous, irrational love for the picked eggs. The beef stew and chili are unique and excellent. . . An LA landmark, worth it every time I make the trip, even with a wait. Delicious, simple, dependable.
