We called for delivery... which they do not do any more despite what it says on this page.  Seeing as the location is super close to out apartment, we took the car over there and purchased the highly reviewed Potato pizza, no problem.  It has potato, bacon and corn on it so I was excited.  These are ingredients that I really enjoy!  I was disappointed with the first bite.  There are too many competing flavors on this pizza and the way the ingredients were cooked didn't make for pleasant eats.  The bacon was barely cooked and lay on top of smushy mushy potato wedge.  The texture of the fatty soggy bacon and the wet potato was gross and I couldn't taste the sweet potato in the crust.  The entire pie was liberally coated in mayonnaise or sour cream and there were crushed tortilla chips on it.  What?!  I'm pretty sure that marinara was the base sauce for the pizza (I thought a white sauce would have been better than the marinara and mayonnaise or sour cream) but I'm not sure.  There were peppers and bread and butter pickles on the side.  Maybe this place isn't for my palate.  I'm all for different but it has to be good.  The service was nice and our food was ready when we got there (we picked up a to-go order) which is why I gave them two stars.
