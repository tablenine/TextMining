Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
i agree with christina o.and kristen m-  the irony of a kfc right next door to this place... who is going to kfc when roscoe's is here?!. . chicken wings are awesome, batter is well seasoned and tastes so good with a little louisiana hot sauce.  i was a bit skeptical of the waffles, but once i tasted them, i was a fan.  spiced with a bit of cinnamon and sugar-so delicious.  skip the biscuits.  they are plain and pale in comparison with the waffles and chicken.  every other table around us ordered the cornbread, and it looked tasty- i wished we ordered that instead.  . roscoe's is another place with caloric staying power to last all day.  i wanted nothing to do with food after eating here for at least 24 hours.
