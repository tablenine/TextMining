Awesome food. Awesome line, in a bad way.. . went for lunch and to pick up some sweets for the fam for easter.. i had the pork and caramelized onion sandwich. it was good. very tasty and a good mix of textures.  the tender pork, caramelized onions, and the crispy crust of the roll were wonderful.  the plantain chips were great.. . to go we got everything. ok well not everything, but i'll list what i can remember.  we had potato rolls, meat pies, empanadas, apple turnovers, cheese rolls, guava rolls, guave and cheese rolls, and more. all were great.. . would i go back? maybe, its just hella far. when they open one in downey, yeah i'll probably go there.
