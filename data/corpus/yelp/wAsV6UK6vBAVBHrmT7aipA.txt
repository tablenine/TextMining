What IS it with pizzerias in Chicagoland?  Where I'm from, pie-sliced, thin-crust pizza is a given.  Here, you not only have to contend with the horror of deep-dish pizza (frankly, only cakes deserve such carby depths) and the bizarre practice of cutting pizzas into squares.  Is this a third-grade class party, or something?  I've had to deal with this for as long as I've lived in Chicago since moving from the East Coast, about 7 years now, and it never fails to shock me.. . So naturally we were disappointed to open up our take-out large cheese pizza with green olives and mushrooms and discover that it was thusly cut.  At least they didn't give us a deep-dish by accident, not that the curious lack of mushrooms wasn't a lot worse (I think I counted 3 slices on the entire pizza).  Well, ok.  At least the pizza was tasty and we didn't have to wait too long to pick up the pizza (about 30 minutes), which was nice considering dining in at the restaurant itself requires waiting in a line that stretches outside and around the building (note: pizza is good, but not worth that kinda wait).. . That said, the pizza was good and the staff who gave it to us, rang us up and (yay!) tossed into the bag several packets of chili pepper flakes were super cute and nice.  I'd eat their pizza again--after making all the necessary specifications.
