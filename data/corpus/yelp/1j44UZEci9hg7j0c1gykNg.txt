Anja/Buddha Bar whatever you want to call it - I like it. Its a beautiful space and I great place to go with a group (you can all share that way). side note: The drinks are delicious so don't be shy to just sit in the bar! This place has gone through some changes and I haven't eaten there since the shuffle.. so no updates on food. One thing you can be sure of is a trendy space and a $15 cocktail. If you're not up for that try elsewhere.
