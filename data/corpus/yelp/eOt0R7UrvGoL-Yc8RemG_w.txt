Porto's is AMAZING! I wish they would open one up in Northern California!! . . The scent of baked goods hits you the second you step out of your car in anticipation of all of their mouthwatering treats. mmmmmm. . On our last trip to Porto's my family went straight in line to order our pastries. I'd suggest trying:. -the cheese rolls (drools). -guava cheese strudels. -mango empanadas. - dulce de leche kisses. -red velvet cupcakes. -potato balls. . The cheese rolls are out of this world, and I wish I could eat them everyday! :). . Oh yes, and I tried one of their guava smoothies this time around-I would definitely recommend this flavor! . . We had lunch here after ordering our pastries; the Cuban pork sandwich with caramelized onions and this garlic mayo was sort of bland. However, we also ordered Â this marinated chicken sandwich with Cuban black beans, lettuce, and some other sauce; it was tastier. Sandwiches were served with a side of fried bananas. . . Come here for the cheap/amazing pastries, bustling atmosphere, and fancy desserts!
