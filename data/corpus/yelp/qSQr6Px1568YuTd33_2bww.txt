I ate here once years ago on a visit and remembered it being good, so when I moved here I was anxious to try it again. Maybe my standards have changed because sadly I did not like it so much. . . The inside was filthy. And water drips on your head while you eat. It's neat that they have pet parrots and doves outside in cages to look at, but when one of the bird tenders brought Â a bird inside for my daughter to touch during our meal I thought it was a little gross. It would have been charming at a pet store but at a restaurant, ...not so much. . . I've blocked out what we ate because to top if off we both got food poisoning from the place. I like the idea of this restaurant, a health food place where you can also get a hamburger, but I was disappointed that we had such a poor experience.
