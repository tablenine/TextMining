Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
For gourmet salads, Tender Greens is ok, although I've had better at other places.  Their BBQ Chicken salad is good, and I'm also a fan of the Tuna Nicoise.  The problem is, if you order to-go, they don't give you nearly enough dressing for the size of the salad.  Also, if you do the soup+salad combo, the $5 salads that you choose from are pretty much just a big plate of greens with dressing (boring), and their soups are maybe comparable to Progresso but oilier.  I keep coming here because the ambience is nice and the food is decent, but it's not one of my favorites.
