always always always love Two!. . Came for dinner for a bachelorette(?) dinner and everyone had quite a nice time.  The Hurricane is always my fave drink!  i tried the Purple Rain drink...if you like lavender and thyme, you'll love it, if not...don't try Purple Rain unless its on T.V.. . Now I must say, i'm very sad that the lamb lollipops were NOT on the menu :-(  however, the empanadas were SO GOOD! mmmm.. . can't wait to go back and eat more stuff.
