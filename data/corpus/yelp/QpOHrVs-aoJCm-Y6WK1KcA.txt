We went here a few weeks ago. A few people we talked to said it was "great," but after the meal (and the check), we didn't feel the same way.. . I had a steak burrito. It was big, which is good, but really boring. Very, very bland. The beans and rice that came with it were lacking as well. The beans were of the runny variety, and when you're a fan of thick beans, this just won't do.. . My wife had the cheese enchiladas with mole. Same as the burrito...pretty boring, nothing to write home about.. . The best part of the meal was the guacamole, which we had before our entrees came. The downside? It cost close to $8. . . And speaking of prices...everything is about twice as much as it should be. $10 for a burrito? $12 for enchiladas? No thanks.
