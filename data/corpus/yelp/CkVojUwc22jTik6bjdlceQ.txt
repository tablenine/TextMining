Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canter's is great for what it is: an old fashioned delicatessen, complete with blue-haired waitresses and 1950s decor. Must haves: the pastrami or roast beef sandwiches. You should also try a dessert from the bakery - some of the best pastries in town. Open 24 hours, this place is bopping at night and slow during the day. Spicy pickles served with every meal.
