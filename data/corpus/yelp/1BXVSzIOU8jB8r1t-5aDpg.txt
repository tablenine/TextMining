Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
First time eating here for a friend's birthday, so it was a good opportunity to see what all the hype is about. Got there around 7pm and our medium sized party had to wait a little under 2 hours to get our tables, so that was somewhat inconvenient.. but I figure if the food is as good as advertised then it'd be worth it. We get seated, order some drinks and ask for 2lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of crab legs, fried calamari and sweet potato fries.. . ..and the hype was definitely fulfilled!. . I dug the whole "eat with your hands" deal, from the bibs, the butcher paper table cover and crab leg cracker thingy. The place smelled awesome, it was kind of cramped but it had a good vibe to it. The service was fast and friendly and the birthday girl had a good time. All in all I would say this first time experience was a success!. . Now I just need to figure out when they're not so freakin' busy!!. . Recommendations: The shrimp and the crab legs were amazing! Next time I have to try the whole crab.. for whatever they charge I'm sure it's worth it.. . Warnings: The wait was ridiculously long and the parking is terrible.. but these things can be glossed over once the food hits your lips.
