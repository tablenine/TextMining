Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Feast is a good standard brunch place, but it's not something to write home about.  The food is solid and the service is usually nice, but we don't ever crave anything from Feast in particular.  If it's nice out and we're walking around, we may pop in for a quick bite to eat.
