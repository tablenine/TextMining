Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Oh man. This place is great. Beers for a good price (if they have beer I like, it's a winner as I am super picky), fantastic fries, and a kickass vegan veggie burger that is HUGE. If it were closer to me, I'd probably hang out here rather than Raging Burrito. . . I don't understand why this place is labeled as a dive bar, as I generally think of dives as dirty holes in the wall, and Manuel's does not fit that bill. . . Oh, and the free parking is great, if not a little scary - it's a bit close of a park, and I almost had someone hit me because they were going down the wrong way. So yeah, be careful!
