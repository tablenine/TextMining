As far as Vietnamese food goes, I've had way better.  The waitstaff was a little snooty and the seating wasn't very comfortable.  My tuna tartar was boring and the monk fish satay was over seasoned.  After the bland appetizers I decided to play it safe and have vermicelli with beef, which is a standard Vietnamese dish.  It was just okay.  My dad had the duck which was good, but came ungarnished and without any side dishes - just a big chunk of duck.  It was a little underwhelming especially because we had read all these great reviews.
