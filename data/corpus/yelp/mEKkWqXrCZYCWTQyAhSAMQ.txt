the pulled pork sandwich is just awesome. first bite i had was without the bbq sauce, second bite was with the bbq sauce, and it tasted a lot better without. the pulled pork wasnt dry at all and was very well seasoned. the pastrami on the other hand was not as mouth watering. i'd rather go to the hat for their pastrami if that means anything. tried the piggy fries and i like IN N OUTS animal style fries better, only thing good with the piggy fries was the dipping sauce you get, garlic aioli. ube milkshake is very thick and tastes excellent. outside seating today was difficult due to the sun's heat glarring, i damn near burned my arm resting it on the table!
