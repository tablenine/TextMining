Talk about sleek! This red, black in-you-phase posh decor is extreme for this little notch east of Atlanta. And what is up with the flat panel tv screens mounted on the blank wall? Is broadcasting movies the new trend in "art" ? Are we finally pass the IKEA mass produced black and white photographs to decorate our favorite sushi bar and have since moved to lighting and visual motion ? If so, then this place is certainly setting the trend into motion. . . As far as food goes, because isn't that why you are out to dinner, the sushi is decent. Not the quality you would get at some more expensive sushi bars, but definitely not grocery store bought. Let's just say I wouldn't order sashimi here, but when you wrap that tuna with avocado and rice, drizzle some tangy sauce on top, and torch it - it makes for a good twist on an otherwise traditional roll!
