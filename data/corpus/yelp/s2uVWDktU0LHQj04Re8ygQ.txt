Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
My friends kept on telling me that I had to try Roscoe's while I was in LA.  However of all the times I've been to LA, I never had time, or maybe I just didn't want to go on my own and try it.  So, when I was in LA with the friends that recommended this place, I went.  In our group, there were two of us that were 'Roscoe Newbie'.  . So we walked from Kodak Theater to here, 1.25 miles to be exact.  We got seated and I had to ask my friends what they usually ordered when they came.  They started to throw numbers, etc., so with that, I reviewed the menu carefully before placing my order.. I ordered Waffles with  dark chicken and side order of mac 'n cheese.  When my order came, I had two slices of waffles, a drum stick and thigh.  Maybe I don't know my waffles, but I thought they were same as waffles I get other places, so I wasn't impressed with their waffles.  I tried the mac 'n cheese and again, I was not impressed.  I had the fried chicken and outside of KFC, their chicken was good.  . I guess it was over hyped... not sure if this was the cause, but I must admit, I was not impressed.  Service was great, the lady took care of us, but I think my friends hyped it up too much and I was expecting gold and I got silver.  I still enjoyed the food, but not sure if I would go back again to spend $14 on waffles and chicken...
