This place is REALLY cute!!  They have great food and a wonderful list of wines to choose from.  My only problem was that they need some more options for food and they need to lower their prices...come on...who are you kidding?. . I had the endive salad, which was an interesting take on this idea with oranges and sugar snap peas.  I also had the mussels, which were really tasty and came as a good portion.  . . The wine was delicious and the staff was really nice.  And the decor has this amazing warm intimate ambiance, which makes you want to sit around and sip on wine all night long.. . I need to go back to try some of the flatbreads as I hear they are quite delicious.  Regardless of anything, I will definitely have this on my list of the better places to hit up when I am in the Wicker Park neighborhood.
