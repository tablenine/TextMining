What a disappointment ! I've driven past this place a dozen times and have always been in too much of a hurry to stop and try it. One day when I had some time to kill I remembered that it was close by and decided to give it a try. Cute pleasing exterior and interior decor, very clean and nice. I was sure that I had found a little culinary hidden treasure..  I asked the owner to make suggestion and he recommended the assorted BBQ plate adding that it was their most popular dish. He told me that it would give me a little taste of everything, chicken, beef and pork. When he set my plate down in front of me my heart sank. I really can only describe the chicken as looking similar to something that I've been served at the poorest quality Chinese restaurants, slices of dark meat chicken laced with fat, I'm not even sure if it's chicken! The beef was no better thinly sliced fatty beef attached to a piece of bone, the type of meat that stretches as you try to cut it, eventually you have to tear it apart with your fork and knife. The pork was chopped up into small pieces so that you hopefully wouldn't notice its fat content as you choked it down. I'm not even going to discuss the macaroni salad and scoops of other stuff that was served with this mess..  I rarely complain but I had to interrupt a conversation that the owner was having with some other customers. I told him that he had done a great job with his decorating and keeping the place clean and tidy. I also told him that that was some of the nastiest, cheapest cuts of meat that I had ever been served and told him that he could have my plate back. He took my plate and said "sorry"; Â Yeah me too.
