Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
Great wonton soups and cheap as hell food make for good eating on a tight budget.  However, the decor is pretty dirty Chinatown and the food is a bit of a sodium overdose.  It's open pretty late (2am I think) which is good if you're ever coming off a late bus from Boston, DC, or Philly.
