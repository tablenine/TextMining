My sister-in-law has been raving about this place for quite a while and I finally got a chance to check it out yesterday. Since she had been there a few times, she knew they would fill up pretty quickly, so we got there right at noon, which is when they open on Sundays. Sure enough, our table of 5 was seated right away - and at a booth large enough to fit us. She said the last time she came with 5 they got sat in a booth that is really only for 4 people, and it was pretty cramped. . . Anyway, the service was good, attentive without being pushy, nothing was forgotten or overlooked. The food was pretty good. We got an order of Mediterranean Bread (one order was enough for 5) and a Chef Salad (one order was more than enough for us, we had a little bit left over). We all got a half-pound pizza pot pie, some with mushrooms only, some with sausage &amp; mushrooms, some of white, some on wheat. It was pretty good. I liked the presentation, and the pie was hot and yummy. The mushrooms were fresh, and whole, no tiny mushroom slices that came from a can, so that was good. Â . . I'll admit, I was expecting the pizza pot pie to be fantastic (considering my sister-in-law told us she once waited 2 hours for a table when she took another friend here), but it wasn't quite fantastic, but it was pretty yummy. If I came back, it would only be if I knew I would be seated right away. I really don't think it would be worth waiting for a very long time. (I'm impatient, and besides, there are tons of restaurants in Chicago, why put up with a wait when you don't have to?). . By the way, they only accept cash.
