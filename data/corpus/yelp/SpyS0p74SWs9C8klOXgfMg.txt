Mana is spot-on all the time! Great food.. . The space itself has a bit of an awkward layout. It's not the size that's the problem, it really is the layout. I think working here would slowly drive me insane. There is no room for movement. But hey, small spaces make it look packed, like it's popular and deserves all the great hype it's getting. Which it definitely does.. . Good job, Mana!
