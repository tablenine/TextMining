I can see why people enjoy Wurstkucheghijutinadh.... . You've got beer, meat, and a chance to interact with other "cool" people sitting at the same table. I can't really say that I'm much of a fan and it all started within 5 minutes of walking in. Its nice to see that they have vegetarian options, but homeboy behind the register needs to calm down. You're working at a sausage place, relax. I got the Mexican Chipotle with Sauerkraut and sweet peppers and Andruis got the Apple Sage with no toppings, but they decided to "customize" one for her anyway. Meh. . I liked that we got our food (minus the fries that was ordered) very quickly but unfortunately we had to send it back because we were given the wrong toppings. Anyway, the food was REALLY good and I definitely want to try out their other Vegetarian sausages, although I think that I would rather get it to-go. It's actually the experience that only worth 2 stars because the food is totally worth 5. . . I'm not really diggin' how loud the music is, how a soda cost $5 and you cant even get refills, and how close the tables are together. I had this dude rub his rear end against the back of my head multiples times because he kept getting up to buy beer and sausages. I would comeback to a take out order, but not for the whole sit down experience. I really wanted to like you Wurstkucheyaijbsghtapaa, but I don't like your style.
