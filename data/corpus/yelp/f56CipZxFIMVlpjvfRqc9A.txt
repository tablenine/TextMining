Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I am not above touristy destinations, especially when the claim to fame is food. Pinks has been serving up hot dogs of various ilk forever and I hope they continue to so as long as they can. There are so many varieties of dos to choose from here that it's hard to keep track; the chili dog is good as is the Chicago style. . . Reasons to Go: . L.A. Landmark . Hot dogs are always fun . You might see a star . . Reasons to Pass: . You don't like hot dogs . You may have to wait in line for a long time . no real indoor seating
