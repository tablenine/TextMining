Went there before my very first live concert - The Fray - and was treated at this place in particular due to my date wanting me to give the fish and chips of this restaurant a try. . . The verdict? Pretty good, as I recall it. The fish was fresh, nicely well battered and fried. The chips were decently good. And the hush puppies were pretty good too. . . And of course, the view of the cemetery as you dine with date.. . Definitely a date to remember...
