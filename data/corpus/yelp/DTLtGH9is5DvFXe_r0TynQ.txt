I would say the food, while affordable, is pretty mediocre. The spinach salad was underwhelming, the chickpea-red pepper dip was kind of gross, and the jalapeno cheddar home fries were expensive (and pretty blah) for the price. Wouldn't go out my way to eat here again, but wouldn't object too vociferously if someone wanted to meet here to eat.
