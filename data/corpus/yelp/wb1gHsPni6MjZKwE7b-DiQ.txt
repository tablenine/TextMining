Sure, this place is famous, sure it has its Michelin stars, and sure, its normal, full-priced and prix fixe menus are probably pretty amazing. So featuring Spago in dineLA Restaurant Week might be seen as an attempt to bring the world of haute cuisine to the common man -- $44 prix fixe, you'd think, would be an incredible steal, right? Well, the dineLA food (in October, at least) was pretty much, well, just that -- decent, probably worth ~$44, but nothing out-of-this world. . . We had the CRISPY MONTEREY BAY CALAMARI - with pickled ginger vinaigrette and marinated cucumbers - and the BRAISED SHORT RIB RAVIOLINI, both of which were pretty good appetizers. The raviolini was flavorful, and the huge salad bed beneath the calamari was fresh and crisp. The calamari themselves were abundant, but overly breaded. Actually, all their portions were pretty generous. Entrees were good and hearty, but nothing to write home about. For dessert, we had the PRALINE AND COFFEE CRUNCH SOUFFLE with Nutella Gelato (yum! you have to eat all parts of it in the same bite to get the full effect) and an off-menu CHOCOLATE PURSE - a crispy, souffléed crêpe filled with ganache and sprinkled with powdered sugar. To offset the rich chocolate, raspberries and sorbet were included.. . Very satisfying bday dinner for the hubby, but overall underwhelmed. We might go back one day to try their "normal" menu, but we won't be back for Restaurant Week.
