Order the Ropa Vieja - it's the best in the city.  Their yucca is delicious.  I love their outdoor patio on a cool summer evening, and the best part is that it's only a block walking distance from my house!  You can't beat it for a nice intimate dinner, and they really take care of you there.  I love it.
