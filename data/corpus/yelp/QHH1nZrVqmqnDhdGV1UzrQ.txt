I like my Thai food strip-mall style, somewhere in the neighborhood of Buford Highway, crammed full of television sets blaring MTV Bangkok, a miniature ceramic kitty waving hello to me, folks in the kitchen screaming what I can only assume are Thai obscenities, possible knife-fights occuring in the alleyway behind the restaurant, etc. So, I was skeptical about a semi-upscale Thai joint on the Westside.. . Skepticism: unconfirmed!. . This is the best Masaman curry I've ever eaten. Rich, complex, fiery, creamy, screamy, crippling with pleasure. I wasn't expecting green beans, but they work perfectly with the other vegetables. The tofu consistency was excellent, chewy and as meaty as soybeans can get.. . So, I was wrong. I was prejudiced. This place means business. I'll be back.
