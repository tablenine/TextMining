One of my favorite cheap-no frill-eats! It is considered to be bar food, but i prefer to think of it as comfort food-- there is no way you can get anything as delicious as this at a bar.. The buffalo wings are some of the best i have ever had and are made fresh right when you order. I have a sensitive palate and even the mild wings make my mouth burn, so the "HOT" and 'HOTTER" wings would be out of the question for me. The beer selection is pretty good and tasty. The veggie burger is unlike any other veggie burger you'll ever have-- it is so flavorful and spiced to perfection, not bland like other ones. I highly recommend.. The burgers and sandwiches are pretty good also, the pulled pork is a favorite!. Go here for no frill, laid back good food.
