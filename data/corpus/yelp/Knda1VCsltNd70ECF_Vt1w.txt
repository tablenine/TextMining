Thanks for getting me laid, Bottega Louie.. . I took a special lady here on a date and I'm so glad I did. The atmosphere was awesome. It was clean, white and very open. The food was good too. I know it has been said a billion times, but the portobello fries totally made my (and my date's) underpants fly off. Total foodporn.
