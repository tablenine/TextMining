Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
Long live Cobras and Matadors.  While not exactly authentic, the tapas are so fucking good.  The service is good, but you should make a reservation because this one on Beverly is smaller than the Hollywood/Los Feliz one, and it's a long wait if you just show up.. . There is no wine available which sounds like a bad thing BUT, they have a wine store next door, FULL of Spanish WInes and a very helpful staff.  Grab a bottle and head to Cobras where there is no corkage fee and then fill up on their amazing food.. . I recommend the skirt steak, ALL of the cheeses, the Pa Amb Tomaquettes and just about everything else.. . Id give it 5 stars, but the no wine thing and the size of the place brings it down.. . For the 5 star version, head over to the one in Hollywood/Los Feliz on Hollywood Blvd near Wacko.  Same food and a huge wine list, as well as a much better chance with no reservations.. . All hail Cobras.
