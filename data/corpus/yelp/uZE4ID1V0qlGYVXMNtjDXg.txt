Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
Big bowls of soothing pho (a Vietnamese noodle soup) and whimsical tapioca pearl drinks keep this restaurant buzzing with people in need of a quick and healthy meal. The original restaurant is located in Forest Park, but the Buford Highway store is much more convenient and there is little difference in the quality or atmosphere.
