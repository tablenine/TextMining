Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Exactly the kind of greasy food and loud lines you need after a night of heavy drinking. . . I love any of the doubles with chili and the works, so many options though. . . Not for the health-conscious so go there once a week, get the fries, the onion rings and an extra dog for the road and be up at 7 hitting the gym with the rest of this superficial city.  . . God I miss that place.
