Category: Mexican
Another good choice in an area well know for good choices. Recently dined here for a business luncheon, and it is ideal for this or for personal outings. Small plates add a tapas flare, but also allow for sampling. And what could be more fun than sampling. When in the mood for topnotch Mexican, this is highly recommended.
