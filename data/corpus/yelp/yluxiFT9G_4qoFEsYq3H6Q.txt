Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
I love Butterfly! I started coming here shortly after opened and have been coming on the reg ever since... after all, it is only a few blocks away from my house. On occasion it gets super crowded on weekends and you need a reservation. It doesn't really matter because their sushi is soooo good! My favorite roll is the Sunset roll that includes mango. How can you go wrong? The head sushi chef dude is also always super nice and says Hi. Once I was riding past on my bike and he was walking out and still said Hi ! I have never tried the thai food, but I really don't think anybody would be disappointed in the sushi. Desserts are also very tasty and sometimes when it's not busy they have mango and sweet rice which is insane. The prices are extremely reasonable, AND they deliver.
