Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Contrary to many of the opinions of yelpers below, I think Lala's rules. Having had an absolutely ideal and perfect first date there, I can't eat there without getting just a bit sentimental and happy.. . I've had the skirt steak, a couple different iterations of the chicken, empanadas and several deserts...they've never been anything but tasty.  The mashed potatoes agree with me as well. Even the bread they bring to every table is way above average (I don't mind cold bread). . . The atmosphere of Lala's has gotten just a bit less cozy in the last couple of years as they've crammed more tables into the restaurant and patio area, but who's going to blame them for being successful?  . . I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who's down for Argentine food. I'd also recommend it as a date spot in the evenings as it's dimly lit and cozy.
