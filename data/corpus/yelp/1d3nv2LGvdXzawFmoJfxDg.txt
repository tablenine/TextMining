Here is some unuseful information that has nothing to do with this establishment, but with the fact that I should be in jail.  In the men's restroom there are a couple of Canadian geese floating above the piss emanating bathroom.  When I get disgustingly drunk (often enough) and am in the neighborhood I bet people to go in the men's room and steal the doll heads hanging off the Canadian geese.  I am pretty sure the employees know what I am up to, but they have never given me shit about it.  It's probably the only reason I continue to show up here.  The food is below par, but not as bad as the 101.  It could be worse.  It could be Denny's.  Thank God it isn't I'd never have had sex in the ladies room, passed Go &amp; collected 200 dollars!
