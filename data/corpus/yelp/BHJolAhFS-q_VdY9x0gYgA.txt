so i never heard anything about this spot prior to going so i didn't know their was any hype to it at all so i get to report back to all of you completely unbiased.. . first off i was kinda thrown off that it was a lunch truck, because my friends told me about it on the way their and never did they mention that it was a lunch truck, it didn't stop me though, because lunch trucks are apparently where all the good eats for good prices are.... . i didn't know what to order, but i did have plenty of time to decide because the line was long, but im a number one believer in that if there is a long line it must be good.... . i ended up ordering one chicken, one tofu, one short rib, and one pork...with the intention to share with my friend so that we could try everything, seriously wrong on that one since they're like 2 bites big with not too much meat/tofu in the taco itself.  however it was a tasy bite....if i would have known i would have passed on the short rib and tofu and just stuck with the chicken,... . the food was spicy but not overwhelmingly hot where i would refuse to eat (sorry i really hate spice food!) but it had a unique flavor. youdefinitely taste the korean bbq flavor.  buti wouldn't say it's a korean/mexican fusion because using a tortilla  and putting cilantro on something does not qualify it as mexican food...but it was something different. . another downside is they run out of food...but its a lunch truck not a standing restaurant so that's to be expected....but if they are running out of food that should show they are good... . . so overall...a good place to try if you want to have something new, go early, expect a wait, and bring your own drink because are drinks are expensive and choices are limited...
