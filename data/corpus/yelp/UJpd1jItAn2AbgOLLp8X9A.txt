Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
You'll either like Tito's Tacos or you'll hate them, and if you're the latter then it just means one less person for their "cult like patrons" to stand behind as they wait for their hard shelled tacos, enchiladas, burritos and tamales.. . My take on Tito's is that we can't deny the fact that there is almost always a line at this place, and so they must be doing something right not to mention the hundreds of Yelp reviews whether positive or negative.. . Their tacos are different and if there isn't a line when you drive by, perhaps you should try one or two and judge for yourself.  There are better places for the tamales and the enchiladas.  I wasn't a fan of their burritos as the grease overcame me by the second bite.  Whichever side of the argument you may be on, the reality is they don't look like they'll be going out of business anytime soon.
