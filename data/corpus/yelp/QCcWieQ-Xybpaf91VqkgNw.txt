Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
I had this food once at a work function and thought it was so-so. Nothing spectacular. The real reason I'm giving it only 1 star is because every single friggin month I get another visit from the Duck Walk menu fairy in my apartment building and come home to find another 3 fold waste of paper shoved under my door. I understand aggressive marketing but hey! owners! I HAVE ENOUGH FRIGGIN DUCK WALK MENUS!!!. . For this reason, when it comes to "what should I order?" the answer is never Duck Walk. Â Marketing tactic backfired.
