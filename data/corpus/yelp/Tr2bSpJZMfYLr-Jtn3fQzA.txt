Good, not great tapas place.  Much quieter and smaller than other places Ive been to.. Dishes I remember that were good:. The bacon wrapped dates were awesome. . Jalapeno gnocchi (so good and just the right amount of spice!), bacon Stuffed mushrooms.  . I also really enjoyed the seared ahi tuna.. . shspring08
