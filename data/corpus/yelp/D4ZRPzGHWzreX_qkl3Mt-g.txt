Restaurant: f2o Fresh To Order
Category: Sandwiches
I use this place as a super convenient take out (I happen to live next door). . . Most of the time I'm picking up their salads to take back home. The salads are fresh, the meat is tasty. However it's pricey. . . The place is a glorified cafe, where you order at a counter and the staff brings it to you. . . One downside was the wine selection. They advertise a pair of White wines for $12, and I thought that could be a real diamond in the rough. Instead you get what you pay for :( The wine was very bitter, and cheap. . . Pluses: Good salads, fresh (like the name!) . minuses: bad wine, expensive dishes . . Overall: a good place that's a half step up from the neighborhood sandwich shops nearby, but not quite a "restaurant" like the other places around.
