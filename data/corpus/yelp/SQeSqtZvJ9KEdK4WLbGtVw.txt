For all the things that make this restaurant the talk of the town for everyone else, it makes it just OK for me. I'm not a drinker, I don't like lobster, and I don't eat beef. All these things are wasted on me. . My husband's company had their Holiday Party here a few months ago, and we went back a few weeks after that because it left such an impression. . The inside is reminiscent of some antique brandy room. The deep rich hues of the wood, the brass finishings, and demure tone of the restaurant bring to mind something of another time. Â . I had the "East meets West" oysters, which were fantastic; the Hong Kong Chilean Sea Bass, which was pretty good; and the Ahi Tuna, which was also pretty darn good. We've also had coffee and dessert - also good. But that was basically everything that I could eat. . The food was delicious -- everything we ordered both visits. That being said, I don't think I'd go out of my way to go back. It's a wonderful restaurant - but it's just not my thing. Nothing against the establishment, but there aren't a lot of options for someone like me. If the company were having their Holiday Party here next year, I wouldn't say no -- but I'm not going to run out tonight to visit again.
