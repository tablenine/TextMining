Oh my god, I think I have died and gone to sushi heaven.  The food here was out of this world, and everyone was really friendly here which is a big plus in my book for anyone that has read any of my other reviews.  Every dish I had at the sushi bar was well prepared and really tasty, and the service was top notch.. . If you have never been here before, here are a few things that I learned:. 1.) The place is in a strip mall, don't let it fool you.. 2.) The valet will charge you for parking ($3.50 on Monday night), even if you park the car yourself.  So, do yourself a favor and let them park the car...because you are paying for it.. 3.) There is typically a wait, but it is well worth it.. 4.) Sit at the Sushi Bar if you can, it makes you appreciate how they make the dishes. 6.) Plan on spending $40/person because the food is so damn good that you will want to try many things on the menu. 7.) The spicy tuna with fried rice (something similar to that) is out of this world
