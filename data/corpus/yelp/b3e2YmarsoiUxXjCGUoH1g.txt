Restaurant: Honey Pig
Category: Korean
Tasty and you will leave full.  We had the namesake "honey pig"... very fatty, but good.  The waitstaff run around like busy bees - the place was packed!  They have a really cute interior style, with concrete blocks and a fun color scheme.  My favorite part of the meal was the fried rice they cook for you with your leftover food.  Delish.  I had way more fun in their bathroom than I should have... there is a light up sink and their toilet is super fancy.  Anyway, fun with a date or a large group.  Next time I go I want to try their mushroom bbq feast!
