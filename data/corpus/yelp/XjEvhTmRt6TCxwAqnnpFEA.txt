They have an interesting system . 1. order . 2. pay. 3. get a number, get your drinks. 4. wait to be seated. . I had a tuna melt sandwich which wasn't the best and the fries were a little cold. I tried a little bit of the eggs benedict and found it to be not one of the best I've had, but the focaccia bread lying under the eggs was delicious.. . The iced green tea pomegranate was refreshing for a warm Sunday afternoon. Our party of seven was seated in a enclosed area with a round table and wrought iron cushioned chairs and benches. The crawling leafy vines were surrounding the back fence with little birds chirping and hopping along the branches and waiting to be fed. It was a nice brunch in the lovely 80 degree weather day in LA.
