An: yah totally. me: all the lighting is red. very very dominantly red. there was a DJ. and he kept trainwrecking the entire time. service was bad. the waitress took our order. and then went to talk to the dj for about 5 minutes. An: oh man. hollywood BLOWS. me: the food was way overpriced. 17 for a roll??. An: jesus!. me: fuck me!. me: so there were 8 people. me: and the waiters were pouring water. but they were reaching across everyone. you know, you go to a good restaurant. you're supposed to come in from the right. An: yah. me: take the glass of the table. An: i know exactly waht you mean. me: and fill it off the table right?. An: yup. me: these guys were just reaching across everyone to fill the glasses. An: minor details but i notice it. esp when the food isn't good. me: yah same here. you expect good service at a place ike this. An: if they food is good, i'll let them do me in th ebutt. me: its not monterrey park. An: imean what?. me: lol. An: just kidding. me: indabutt. anyway. An: omg, i can't believe i said that. ive been holed up for days. anways go on. me: haha, no pun intended. anyway, food came out. An: lol!. me: each roll order was like. 6 TINY pieces. no more than like 8 inches. cut up. An: I'M MAD!@. me: SO MAD!. and it wasn't good either. An: I'M MAD FOR YOU!. me: i ordered this albacore carpaccio. An: thats nuts!. me: and it had like. garlic flavored fried chow mein on it. An: nothing urkes me more that overpriced food that isn't good. esp in holly wood. me: and the albacore kind of just dissolved. right?!. sigh. so we plowed through that pretty quick. and eveyone's looking around like. ok.... where's the main course. so, we order two orders of black cod. and it came out, and it was like. fish jerky. they cured it waaay too long. with too much sugar. so it was old, leathery and chewy on the outside. with a sweet sugary center. blah. An: aww dude. and you probably paid too much too. me: piss fucking poor. An: :(. me: i haven't gotten to that part yet. An: sorry kid. oh no. me: so, everyone's just kind of like. fuck this shit. just bring out the cake and lets go. An: omg. me: so, the waitress brings out the cake with candles. sharon blows them out. everyone's happy. but there's no plates or forks or knife or nothing. we're trying to flag people down. our waitress is at the next table flirting. with some greasy looking persian fuckers. we finally grab one of the water boys. An: ugh. me: and tell him they're supposed to cut the cake for us. because we paid $25 for them to do so!. An: dude, i would have been super annoyed. me: well i was. An: was sharon aware to any of this?. me: yah. she knew. An: that must have been tough for her too. me: so this cake. had like 4 kit kat looking things on it. An: to be somewhere where it makes you and your guests uncomfortable. me: like twix bars. An: i would have felt bad for my friends. me: circular cake. An: was it from the restaurant?. me: maybe about 8 inches across. no, albertsons. they take it to the back. and like 15 minutes later. bring it back out cut up. sharon gets the first piece. karen the second. i get the third, i get a kit kat. SWEET. An: omg. me: everyone else gets theirs. and no one's got a kit kat. of course, simon's super pissed now. cause he didn't get a kit kat. and we're just like, WTF did they eat our chocolate. so i grab the waitress and am like. dude, our cake had these 4 chocolate bars on it. we only got one back. can you find the rest. An: LOL. i love it!. me: real polite, but obviously annoyed. An: REGULATORRRR!. me: hahaha. she's gone for 10 minutes. comes out and goes. we found your chocolate bars. we're plating them. and bringing them out. five minutes later,. she brings out one. course, we don't touch the thing. An: at this point, i would have lit the establishment on fire starting with my napkin. me: anyway, whole thing ended up costing each of us $50. everyone had cash except for me. An: oh i expected way more. me: so i put it on my card. but we were like $20 short. Fuuuuuuuuuuu. An: of course. me: kelly gave me $20 and was like. An: awww poop. me: let's just get the fuck out of here. An: yah i bet. me: yah. well. $50 with no drinks. An: why did sharon pick that place??. OH. no drinks?. fuck that. me: one of her cousins, who was there, recommended it. yah dude. $50. everyone ordered one thing. An: holy smokes. me: and we shared two orders of black cod. $25 to cut the fucking cake. OH!. An: wtf. me: on top of that. An: FUCK HOLLYWOOD. me: we never got the other half of the cake back!. everyone got a sliver of the cake. so we lost two chocolates. one which was probably fished out of the trash. or spat on. An: some heffer in the back ate it. me: oh. yah. speaking of which. our waitress had huge tits. and they kept hitting karen in the back of the head. An: oh. me: plus, to add insult to injury. An: hm. me: the waitress got a $53 tip. party larger than 6. An: ugh. i AHTE that. me: absolute travesty. i hate hollywood. me: we ended up going to in n out. at 1130. and eVERYONE ate
