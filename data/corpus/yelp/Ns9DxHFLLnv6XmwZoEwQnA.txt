Restaurant: Dantanna&#39;s
Category: Sports Bars
I had one of the most OUTSTANDING dining encounters at this establishment with a girlfriend of my a few weeks ago!   For a Saturday afternoon of non-stop shopping in Lenox Mall, it was a PERFECT way to end the day!. . She dined on the Cowboy Ribeye w/Dantanna Rub, sauteed spinach, followed by the peach cobbler (to DIE FOR), and I had the NY Strip w/Dantanna Rub as well, garlic mashed potatoes with asparagus, followed by the  red velvet cheesecake by Joshua Johns, who is infamously featured on The Food Channel (and NOW I see WHY!).   With the food being of organic fare, the additional sauces actually detracted from the natural marinade of the tenderized meat, which was cooked to ABSOLUTE perfection!. . The menu in itself was SO very impressive, but our waitress, Allison, and her knowledge of the wine list and overall customer service deserves an EXTRA KUDOS!. . A DEFINITE reason to visit this restaurant on ANY occasion, and WELL worth the money!. . Conveniently located to the majority of ALL of the shopping malls and districts of the coveted downtown Atlanta experience, with MORE than enough parking if you time your visit right!  I would DEFINITELY include this restaurant as one of the MUST-VISIT spots to hit when in-town for a weekend or entertaining and impressing out-of-town guests for lunch or dinner!
