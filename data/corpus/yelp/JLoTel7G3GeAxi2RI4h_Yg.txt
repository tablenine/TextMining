A disclaimer: I am only reviewing the restaurant here, not the bar.  I went with my wife and a friend of ours who is in a wheelchair and found the service to be very accomodating.  We went early in the evening, before it usually gets crowded, so the ambience wasn't that bad either.  I does get a little crazy later in the evening.. . I wanted to give Landmark five stars just on the basis of their porkchop, which is a double thick monstrosity that is in my opinion, the best in the city.  (Cornelia's Roosterant used to make that porkchop but last time I was there it was thin and dry).  However, a restaurant experience is not based on food alone and although the hip lighting and decor is fun to look at, it's definitely more geared to the bar scene than the restaurant scene.  That is all I can really find fault with though, so I am giving Landmark a solid 4+ stars.. . All in all though, a very satisfying experience.  I have brought out of town guests here before and they always rave about it long after the leave.  Definitely worth paying a visit to.
