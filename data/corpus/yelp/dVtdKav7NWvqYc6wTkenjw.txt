Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
This place was a standby when I lived in Lakeview.  I love their Pad Thai with tofu. I dream about their pot stickers - and the sauce - YUM!  My husband loves their Bamee Noodles.  I always have to have bite.  Their deliver is super fast, their prices are totally reasonable, and the portions are generous.  If you can restrain yourself, there should be enough left over for lunch!
