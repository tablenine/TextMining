A great old reliable.  Above average food and service for a reasonable price.  Comfort food is their speciality and they do it well.  I change things up each time I go there but the meatloaf, grilled cheese (with Campbell's Tomato Soup), and hot turkey seem to be the most common in my rotation.  They are family friendly which is a plus.  The salmon eggs benedict is a winner for brunch.
