Just back from taking the extended family for Dinner at DBA.  What a great addition to the neighborhood!  Hospitality was first rate - especially considering the challenges dealt out by my two hungry kids and food-sensitive parents.  Our server was patient and attentive and brought out our cold beers moments after we ordered them.. . The food was spot on and excellent.  I'm a big believer that barbecue is all about style, and DBA is certainly coming into their own.  To this tough critic, the pork spareribs were top notch, and both the smoked chicken wings and brisket were equally excellent.. . As others have noted, the creamed corn is a signature neighborhood dish that should not be missed, and the collard greens were nearly as good as those served at Greenwoods.. . Most importantly, every item brought to us was hot, fresh, exactly as ordered and served with a smile.. . If I know my family, we'll be adding DBA to the weekly rotation.. . PS - DBA Team, add a white-vinegar 'n' hot-pepper barbecue sauce for those of us that grew up on Eastern NC style 'cue....
