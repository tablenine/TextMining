Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Still swooning in sandwich utopia. . . And did you know, Jerry's has expanded? Bid farewell to the once was gourmet chocolatier next door (Coco Rouge) and say an enthusiastic hello to Jerry's new and shiny live music + cafe space! Long lines and waits be gone - well, at least some of the time - for this in demand development makes seating much easier and gives us the benefit of local music played live on most nights to accompany the already tasty eats and downright extensive brew menu. . . New favorites have popped up since my days of being Hermann H exclusive and right now I'm really loving the Miles S piled high with turkey, cranberry sauce, ovoline mozzarella and basil, in addition to the Willie D that comes packed with fried eggplant, salami, coppicola, roast peppers, provolone, basil and tangy lemon mayo (and for the record is served best on the Jerry's Italian Roll). Yum-O! . . The street side patio is wonderfully spacious and populated with trendy neighborhood folk and large umbrellas, alike. Get back into Jerry's if you've been missing this long lost lover like I have! You thought 'ol boy Jer was good with his meat before? You ain't seen nothin' yet!
