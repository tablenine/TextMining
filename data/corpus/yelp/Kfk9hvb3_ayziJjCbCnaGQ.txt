awesome for going in groups - getting lots of small japanese plates to share. . . came here twice - once with my bf and got the great deal - dinner special - chicken, rice, miso soup, fried baby shrimp, salad, and shumai all for $12 each!. . the other time, came here with some friends.  awesome.  . the best dishes were:. fried baby shrimp - crispy and tasty - eat them with the shell on!. braised pork belly - succulent and soooo delicious. . chicken wings - dried fried - i personally like the spicy ones.  salty and tasty perfect with a cold drink.. clams with sake broth - oooh....save your sake glasses for the broth - perfectly briny, a hint of sake, and garnished with scallions. . beef yakitori - tasty and a little charred.  (better than the chicken imho). spinach bacon - a good excuse to get some veggies in with BACON!. . : )  good eats and drink with good friends.
