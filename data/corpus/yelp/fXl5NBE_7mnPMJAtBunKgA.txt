This place was absolutely amazing. I've heard a lot of good things about this place, so decided to try it out. I remember reading on their website that it was a hidden paradise, and it really was. we opened the door and it was like we stepped into a secret garden. if you guys have been to Il cielo, then you would know what i mean. the garden area reminded me of that, except it was more secluded. it was romantic, and it felt like we had our private space.. . I ordered the loup de mer, something our waiter recommended, and my boyfriend ordered the duo of duck - duck breast and leg. to my surprise, the fish was cooked perfectly. it retained the seafood taste of fish. It was flaky, which meant it wasnt overcooked, the skin was kept on but not too crispy, it was perfectly seasoned, perfect balance of salt and buttery goodness. the mashed potato the fish was rested on top was smooth, well seasoned, and just melted in my mouth. it was the one of the best fish dishes i've had. . . for dessert, we had a walnut chocolate tart. it was deliciously sinful. so much chocolate, it was pure evil. It definitely hit the spot, but too much of it can just be overwhelming. if i had to have the whole thing for myself, i dont think i'd be able to finish it. and I ALWAYS finish dessert!!. . it was an amazing experience, one of the best.. . PS DO be careful though, if you choose to sit outside the patio, people smoke - because it's technically outside. so if you're not a smoker and hate smoke...do request to sit inside or at least at the winter garden
