I promised myself I would review again when I returned with a smaller party, and I finally did last Saturday night.  The food was all cooked properly and was excellent!  The skirt steak was a huge hit.  The father-in-law couldn't stop raving about the steak, placing it in his top 3 ever (this says A LOT), the vegetarian had plenty of menu items to keep him busy, I heart the plantains, sangria, and Entrana, and I will definitely be back again very soon!
