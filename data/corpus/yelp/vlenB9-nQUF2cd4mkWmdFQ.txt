Category: Pizza
I thought everything was over-hyped but the bread.  The bread was very seasoned, almost too salty.  The pizza pot pie was just alright, but not the mind blowing experience I was led to belive.  I mean its sausage, pizza sause, and chese thrown in a pie made of pizza dough.  The grinders that the table next too us looked pretty good.  If I get convinced to go back, that's what I'll have.. . Service is good, I went on a weeknight so it was busy but not packed.  Maybe I should give it 3 stars, but I'm a hater and I think its over rated.   . . Peace.
