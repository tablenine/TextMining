I think I'm too old for this place.. . I'm only 43.  And I've been in plenty of real English pubs.  But this place really engenders that bad thing about pubs in England, that is, they turn into discos on Saturday night.  It was SRO inside and they were lined up (LINED UP, MIND YOU!) to get in.  And once in, good luck getting a beer, because its three deep at the bar and the loud music prevents you from shouting an order to the barman.  You could try sign language.  Or darts with little notes attached.. . I love pubs, and so even a marginal one gets three stars.  And they did have Tetley's on tap, another saving grace.  If you want to try this place I recommend a weekday.  Or skip it and try Churchill Arms.
