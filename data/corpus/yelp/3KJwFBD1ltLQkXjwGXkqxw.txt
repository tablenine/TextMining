Great late late night dining spot in Los Angeles. I've been told to come to this place many times. I was fortunate to be able to come here sober at 2am to enjoy with my drunk buddies. They came out with complimentary bread which was kind of dry. I ordered the Pechana steak which also came with black beans, yucca flour, sliced tomatoes, and plantains. The steak was a bit hard to cut. I really loved the beans and the yucca flour for the meat. My buddy got the stroganof beef. That sauce was just amazing that I had to order a side of it. When I come here again that sauce will be used to dip my complimentary bread and everything else.. . Recommendation: Beef Stroganof off the grill. with extra sauce.
