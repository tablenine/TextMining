Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Sigh Tico's Tatos, I wish we were better friends. I like the idea of a little taco place being so old and popular and cheap... but the chips are stale, the salsa is watery, the parking is crazy, the lines are long, it's cash only and the tacos are kinda bland. . . Sorry Teets to the Tahc, but 99cent Jack-in-the-crack tacos are calling :(
