Kogi is delicious :) I always get the burrito which has your choice of meat (or tofu) + salad+potato+onion+sauce... Its bomb. Personally I like the spicy pork the best but short rib is good too.. . I don't think the quesadillas here are worth 7 bucks, its not very filling but if you got some extra cash definitely worth a try. Its pretty good.. . Only thing I don't like about kogi is sometimes the lines can get pretty ridiculous. Me n my buddy showed up when the truck did and there was already a fat line infront of us and it took us about an hour n half to get our food :(
