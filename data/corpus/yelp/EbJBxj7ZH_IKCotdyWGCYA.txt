I'm sure had I visited this place BEFORE I visited Langer's, I would have rated it higher.. . The pastrami was average.  Just average.. . It was a little too salty and the bread wasn't quite right for it.. . What was absolutely fantastic, though, was the garlic sauce they give you for the fries!  YUM-MY!  I had to have another one of those.... . Go for the fries and garlic sauce, I'd say.  That should be satisfying enough.. . Oh, and the environment was pretty good.  They had on the Laker game.  Can't ever complain about that!
