This restaurant, hands down, serves some of the most authentic tasting meat dishes I've had in America. The vegetarian dishes almost always fall flat, but the tandoori chicken, beef boti, and chicken kalimirch melt in your mouth. When I eat the tandoori chicken it transports me to India--this is as good as it gets.
