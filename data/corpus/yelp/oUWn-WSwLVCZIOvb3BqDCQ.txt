I actually never had the food here, but this is the best music venue and value in all of Atlanta.  It has the quality of bands that play the 40 watt, but in a room that's even smaller.  Love it.   . . On another note, now that I am an adult and I don't like to stay up past 12 on a weeknight, I understand what all those people with real jobs were complaining about when I was in school and going to shows.  Can the headliner plleaseee start at 10 instead of 11 or 11:30?  It's Wednesday for cryin' out loud.  Anyways, that's all.  Earl = #1
