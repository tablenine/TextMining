Went here for drinks on the patio, then dinner, then more drinks on the patio.. . Started out with the white sangria, and when asking what liquors were added to the wine to give it a peachy flavor, the waitress stared at me blankly, mumbled and said she had no idea. I used to work for Brown-Foreman (liquor distributor), so I expect staff to have knowledge of what they're actually serving. Guess they bring these girls on just to be eye candy.. . Dinner was decent, nice presentation, but the waiter was pretty bad. Had to flag him down whenever we wanted to order more drinks, and he had NO idea what drinks to recommend. More mumbling and stammering. Uh ok, I ask for your opinion on a good drink, but I guess you don't have one. Fantastic, great service. Also while taking our order, he was looking around and talking to other servers. Hello, rude!. . We were told we couldn't bring our drinks from dinner back upstairs (no reason given as to why), so ordered a fresh round when returning to the patio. Love the view, but there are plenty of other rooftops that serve drinks just as tasty. The service was even worse the second time around, and we ended up going to the bar to order drinks since the waitress kept passing us by.. . All in all, this seems like a place where pretentious people want to be seen by other pretentious people. And they don't care about the service they provide. Sorry, but I'm going back to Roof, where the view, service and drinks kick a**.. . Coconut martini was good though.
