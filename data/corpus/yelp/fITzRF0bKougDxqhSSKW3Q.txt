Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
I love the sauce here! It's just smoky enough, but has the sweet tang and vinegary bite that a good sauce should, along with a subtle coffee undertone.. The pulled pork and chicken here are wonderful, with that great sauce and a nice big tasty bun. . . The Mac &amp; Cheese is equally as tasty, baked in a crock with semi-firm noodles bathing in a blend of creamy cheeses. The crusty topping adds another dimension or texture.. . However, there is one big problem here. . . Cilantro in the Cole Slaw. Nasty, stinky, Cilantro.. . All pulled BBQ must be eaten with cole slaw on top, by law. Not possible at Smoke Daddy because of the evil green weed.. . However, it is for that reason that I discovered the wonderful Mac &amp; Cheese.
