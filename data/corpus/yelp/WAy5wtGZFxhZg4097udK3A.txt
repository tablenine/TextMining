Category: Sandwiches
Saturday morning and you wake up in downtown L.A. with vicious beer munchies. What to do, what to do? Philippes! Your mouth already starts salivating for French dipped sandwhiches, lemonade and ice tea for cents, and a cheesecake slice so delicious, you wonder why cheesecake factory even tries! . . The lines are epic, but who cares? You rub shoulders with people who make LA go round. Quick service, chat it up with the cold-faced employees serving me food, Â make em crack a smile and head on up the stairs to grab a table. Beauty of this spot is that my friends and I can always point out our names we tagged into the wall along with the millions of other people. The food hits the spot, perfecttly roasted meat, gently dipped so its not too wet and not too dry. The iced tea and lemonade go down smoothly over a few laughs with friends and the half eaten cheesecake remidns you that youll always end up buying a shit load more food than you can eat at this place. Hit it up!
