tasty j! i love your place.. . great service and amazing food. i like how when you're waiting in line to use the restroom you can talk to the chefs and usually they'll make me laugh.  . .  i get the zarzuela which is a seafood and tomato dish that has slices of bread served with.  the shrimp are cooked perfectly and the muscles are mild and spot on. i have no idea why but i always get red stripe when i go to coobah. . . the steaks rule and you can't even mess with the sangria. forget about it.
