I feel like I betrayed the place. Or the spirit of it. . Dunno but it felt kind of wrong to walk in there on the warmest day of the year (so far) when this place has an incredible warm decor and TWO fireplaces.. What is wrong with me?!? (umm...actually forget the question. I am afraid of the long list of possible answers).. But it was not the only non-puby thing I did - and please Oscar forgive me. At least I tried to redeem myself by listing to my sweetie (aka "An Ideal Husband") the great works of yours I read..... For me pub food is all about shepard pies, curries, fish and chips, sandwiches and lots and lots of beer (and oh beer we had!!). Not about mussels and mac and cheese. And man were they good!!!! Probably some of the best mussels of the city so far - and I am on a mission, believe me. Perfectly cooked and nicely flavored with white wine, green onions, garlic and just a touch of curry. Fabulous melt-in-your-mouth garlic bread on the side. Finger and dish licking worthy.. As for the mac and cheese....the story has already been written by others. You can read on, I won't be offended. True story though.. Now - I realize that I am no specialist when it comes to pubs. I am just an exile lost in the Anglo-Saxon world who eats her way up. Just Â "A Woman of No Importance" who pays homage to this wild Irish guy whose last den is my City of Light. But trust me on this one - Wilde is worth the trip to this infamously busy part of town.. And Oscar would have loved it.
