Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
I had a friend coming over that wanted to eat at a vegetarian place. Now, I'm all for healthy food but I was drawing blanks when it came to vegetarian. Yes, there is "The Spot" in Hermosa but I wasn't impressed.. . My husband suggested "The Veggie Grill" in El Segundo. Now, my husband eats cookies, cakes, burgers &amp; steaks. For him to say that this place is good, I'd say I'd give it a try.. . My friend &amp; I arrive there on a Saturday afternoon. The line is of a moderate length but it moves quickly. I liked the menu selection but I admit I was a bit weirded out by the soy "meat" products they had. Nonetheless I ordered the Grillin Chickin' Yes thats Chickin', not Chicken, like I said I was a bit weirded out but I went with it.. . The food did take a bit longer than expected but not to the point where our stomachs were growling at us. It finally arrives, the presentation is great &amp; the food? Yummy! It's full of flavor &amp; it actually fools me into thinking its really chicken!. . Overall I'd come back here again, the cashiers were friendly &amp; knowlegeable, the restaurant was clean &amp; the food was great. I'd probably come off peak for the time being as well.
