If you haven't eaten Ethiopian before and think it might be 'too out-there', think again.  I went there with a group of people, and every single one had something good to say about it.  And if you have had Ethiopian, well, this is a great one.. . I usually get the Veggie Combo and Shiro and both were excellent.  At Desta though, I sampled a variety of food here and it was extremely good; all of it.  . . For drinks, the Honey wine is always good (sweet, but not like sweet wine), and had some Ethiopian beer which was also very tasty.  Try both for the authenticity.. . Try this place, and when you are done - try some other ones.  All the Ethiopian restaurant are within a 3 mile radius of each other.
