Restaurant: Surin of Thailand
Category: Thai
Finally went there with a group of friends after hearing about this place for years. Food was ok. It was mediocre Americanized version of Thai food at best. . . - Coconut soup : tasty till last drop. Highly recommended.. - Spicy beef salad: quite nice but too heavy on MSG. . - Thai noodle (aka pad thai): bland.....very bland. - Kao mok kai: Â marinated chicken and rice.....flavorless. - Beef noodle soup: similar to Vietnamese pho but way,way lacking in flavor. . Parking is a real pain and with all things considered I don't think it's worth 20-30 min finding a parking spot. You can find better Thai food elsewhere in ATL.
