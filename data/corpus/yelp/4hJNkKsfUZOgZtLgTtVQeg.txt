So yum! Came here on Saturday for brunch.  The food was delicious: I had the cheddar cheese baked eggs as well, my friend got the pulled pork sandwich.  The steamer was broken that day, so I had to forgo the tea for a mimosa instead- and it was probably the best mimosa I have had in the city.  Fresh orange juice+ sweet bubbles= joy.  The service was great too- I think the waitress had ESP because each time I even thought I might need something she was magically there!. We arrived around 12:30 and only had a minimum wait, by the time we left there was slightly more of a crowd though. I can see why.
