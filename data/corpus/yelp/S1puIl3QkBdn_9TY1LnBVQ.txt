Fabulous!!  I went here for dinner last month with a group of girlfriends, and all of our food was delicious.  The place is definitely pricey, but the food was exceptional.  Our waiter was great and handled us well -- we were a tipsy (drunk?) group of loud talking, hysterically laughing, inappropriate story-telling ladies.  I also like that the place has a relaxed feel to it -- not stuffy at all.. . My only complaint was in the lounge/bar area.  We got to our reservation early and decided to have a drink in the lounge.  The bartender/server was incredibly slow. . . Aside from that though, the meal was perfect.  I had the whitefish and highly recommend.  One of my friends had the ribeye steak which was enormous!  It was covered in a decadent, bacony sauce and came with an absolutely delicious blue cheese macaroni side that we all loved.  I am not much of a dessert person, but the dessert we had was delicious.  I cannot remember specifically what it was but it was deconstructed with such interesting and unique flavors and textures that all went really well together.. . Definitely recommend!
