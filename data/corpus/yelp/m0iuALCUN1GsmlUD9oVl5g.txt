A perfect hipster 24/7 diner, the likes of which are sorely missed in the Bay Area. The upholstery details were not lost on us. Awesome handmade lamps at the booths. . . The Dime Bag: Best Looking Breakfast Combo ev-ar. Thai Cobb salad was really satisfying after a long weekend of heavy eating. I wanted to choke the clearly insane diner ignoring the shrieking child in her care, but otherwise, I felt completely at home.
