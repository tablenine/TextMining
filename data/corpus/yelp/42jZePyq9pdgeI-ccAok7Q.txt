Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Jerry's is a great place for dinner with a difference. The sandwich menu is stunning in its breadth and depth (for those with the ability to make a decision). The sandwiches tasted great and the ingredients were top notch. The beer menu is also very impressive with helpful tasting notes. . . Service was also prompt and attentive. I'm not sure whether things have improved since the previous reviewers visited but in 2008 Jerrys was great (sorry) for us.
