Great place to hang out (props)... that is if you can deal with the lengthy waits on weekends (bummer).  I had some friends take us to Bluebird... after finding out that it either has the same ownership or management of Webster's Wine Bar, I almost had a heartattack (read: I'm not a fan of Webster's).  However, Bluebird absolutely thrilled me - laid back atmosphere, selective, but nicely collected beer list, fantastic mussels (of course, you need some to go with the beer) and some of the best rabbit ragu I've had in awhile.  Yum.  Can't wait to go back.  Maybe, I'll go tonight.
