I really don't like writing bad reviews...but...I'm sorry...this cannot go on. . . Perhaps Oinkster was great before they were featured on Diners, Drive In's, and Dives.  Maybe they just don't know how to deal with the sudden appearence of hungry masses. This place must've been good once...I mean, Jonathan Gold wrote them up in '08 for godsake.  . . But SOMETHING is WRONG. . . We went on a Saturday around 4, and thankfully there wasn't much of a line.  But by the time we ordered our pulled pork, oinkster ruben, fries, plantains, and 2 beers (with a burger to go for my father in law), and paid our $40.00, the line was out the door, 40 deep. . . When we got our order, our fries were cold.  We switched them out, and dug in.  ...um...I really wish we never had. Never in my life have I had two, TWO sandwiches that promised so much, yet tasted like the same wet sponge.   . . ...I'm sorry...I feel guilty for typing that...maybe it's just the residual anger from the stomach pains I'm still suffering here on the couch 4 hours later. . . But I feel compelled to tell you...it was the blandest, most oily, meal I've had in years. Each "belgian french fry" exploded grease into my mouth with every bite. In a bad way. And if it wasn't for the (meh) mustard and watered down BBQ sauce on the side, I coulnd't've choked down the half of the half sandwiches that I did. Even the plantains tasted like chalk--which is almost a feat in it of itself! How do you do that???. . I'll be fine never knowing. . . Oh, and that burger to-go is still sitting on my counter...we're all too scared to try it.
