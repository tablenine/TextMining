So the first time I was here was because my friend and I arrived too late to get into a show at the UCB Theater. We figured that we may as well eat dinner, so that was that. It had a wonderful bar with a great selection. (Stella on tap= Fantastic!) Anyway, the wait wasn't too long and the curly fries were delicious. I went back another time with a different friend, and the bartender had a great suggestion for a "sort-of girly, not a cosmo cocktail." The curly fries were still awesome.
