Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
This place is awesome.  It's one of the best Korean bbq places I've ever been to, and its just a very fun environment.  Went here on a saturday night and had such a great time watching everyone enjoy their dinner. The Korean "Happy Birthday" played like 15 times during dinner, but it got more and more fun everytime we heard it.  We watched 2 guys put on snorkel masks, only to be completely hosed with champagne.  The service was good (there are waiter call buttons) We waited a very short time for our table.  They didn't bring out the correct order, but we ate what we got and enjoyed cooking and talking. Two thumbs up, very fun.
