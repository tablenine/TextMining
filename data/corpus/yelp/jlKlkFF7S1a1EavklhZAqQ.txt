My cousin and I were in the area for the weekend and she wanted to go to Little Tokyo to try this supposedly great ramen place.  We were there on a Monday at about 12:30 and the wait was about 15 minutes so not bad at all.  The place is on the small ish side but surprisingly comfortable inside, even sitting at the bar in front of boiling water on a hot summer day.  We both had the Daikokuya Ramen with the Kotteri Broth which is basically their broth with some added goodness of broth that has been boiled with the backfat of a pig.  . . The noodles were slighty chewy, you get a whole egg which is slightly undercooked on the inside, beansprouts, plenty of green onion, some pickled veggie that was delicious and we can't forget the pork that was sooo incredibly tender although I wish they gave more.  Needless to say, we hardly acknowledged eachother throughout the entire meal.  This is the best ramen I have had so far and subsequently has made all Ramen in San diego non-edible to me.  Good food, nice atmosphere and having a Yogurt land right around the corner makes it even better.
