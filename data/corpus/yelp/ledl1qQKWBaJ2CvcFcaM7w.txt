I took a bite out of Porto's mango mousse, followed by a taste of their guava cheese pastry, and I swear that if I could have died then, I would have been a happy happy woman. Rich, creamy mousse, bursting with mango flavor, with a chocolate cracker on the bottom. I slowly savored every last bite. The guava cheese pastries were similarly delicicious. I don't even generally like guava, but the crisp pastry, stuffed with the sweet guava and the creamy cheese made for a delectable combination. I could have consumed a dozen of them. Lastly, unlike a lot of LA places, Porto's is cheap. I picked up 3 delightful pastries for only $3.50. Practically unheard of . Â Dont come to this place, because the lines get long enough....actually, just avoid this place at all costs so I can keep coming here again and again without having to wait!
