This place is great for just the kind of Chinese food that I want to be brought to me when I have had a crappy day. . . delicious. Greasy, but not too greasy . . . yummy yummy . . . AND the servers are prompt and very nice. The atmosphere is so perfect for a Chinese restaurant too. . . fish tank and all, but this fish tank is clean (thank god). It is my new favorite local Chinese restaurant.
