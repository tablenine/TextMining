First - Free parking!. . I went on a Wednesday night and it was surprisingly crowded for a Wednesday - all the outdoor seatings were taken. There were a couple of seats at the bar which boasts about two dozen taps (probably more).. . The photos from the meal are all here: . http://gourmetpigs.blo.... . . As some of you may know, I was craving the Cusquena Negra I had in Peru.. I still haven't been able to find it in LA, but my eyes immediately tried to find something similar at FO and thus I really only studied the "Malty" section of the beer menu.. . One description caught my eye. Rich caramel, chocolate ... dry finish. Sounds good. And it was!. Probably the closest thing I'll be able to find to the Cusquena Negra, the Oskar Blues Old Chub Scottish Ale is a little sweet, rich and malty. I think the Negra is still a tad smoother, but this will do, this will do. At least to tide my cravings.. . And of course I had to order the Office Burger (with caramelized onion, applewood bacon compote, gruyere, maytag blue cheese and arugula.) $12. Amazing burger. Instead of burger buns they used these sandwich buns that I really like. And arugula! Much better than lettuce. The burger is a dry aged beef which is amazingly juicy and flavorful. I ordered medium and it looked more like medium rare though ... next time I will have to order medium well.. . The burger is pricey at $12 without fries, but it is one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. This may actually kick Grace Burger off its throne - maybe, I will have to go to Grace again first. The only thing FO lacks for me is milkshake.. . Currently though FO has both my favorite beer (north of Peru) and favorite burger. They also have some amazing classic cocktails - small menu here, but really good stuff. I'm thinking of just keeping a tab open there ...
