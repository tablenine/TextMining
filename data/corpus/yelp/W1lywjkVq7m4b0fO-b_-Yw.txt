Daikoku-ya is the best damn raumen joint I've ever been to.  If you order their raumen there, get it with kotteri (extra rich) if they have it...and if you think you can handle it.  I avoided it my first time there...but had to try it my second time.    Shoulda got it the first time to say the least. ;-). . Some advice, if you want kotteri, go early.  Also, my old roommate (who's a regular there) stated that Wednesdays have the best tasting broth...for whatever reasons.
