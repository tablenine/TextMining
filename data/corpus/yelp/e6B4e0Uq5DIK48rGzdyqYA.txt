Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
Though my Cuban friends say Versailles is not a "real" Cuban restaurant, I still think this restaurant is awesome!. . It's a casual place with several locations in Los Angeles, but I've only been to the Culver City (original branch) and Manhattan Beach locations.. . This particular location is always crowded.  A lot of students from UCLA frequent the place for their reasonably priced meals and delicious sangria.  . . Their specialty is the garlic chicken.  You can order this as half a chicken, or a chicken steak (chicken breast fillet).  The garlic sauce is tangy and it is served with onions on a fluffy bed of white rice.  They also serve plantains and black beans on the side.. . This place is a must try if you're ever in LA!
