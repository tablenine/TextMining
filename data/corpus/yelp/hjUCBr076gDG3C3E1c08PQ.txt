Every time I drive I see huge lines. So I decide to come by at 5pm on a weekday. No line, no wait.. . Got the famous Hainan chicken (6.50) and the almost as famous curry beef stew (according the waitress) (6.50). Â The food came out 2 minutes after we ordered. Seriously. At that point, I thought things looked bad: food came out too quick.. . The beef stew was tastier than the Hainan chicken, but that's not saying much. My friend was saying that her dad could make better curry. I agree.. . The hainan chicken? Are kidding me?! People wait in the for THIS?! Phoenix right down the street has a far tastier hainan chicken.
