I went to Fraiche for Happy Hour last week with a group of friends.. . We ordered one of each of their happy hour appetizers.. . The shrimp cocktail had just 3 shrimp, they were pretty fat shrimp but the value just isn't there when 3 shrimp costs $5.. . The meatball sliders had 5 sliders, but each slider was about an inch and a half wide. I barely tasted them when it disappeared after 2 chews.. . Arancini (Risotto &amp; bread-crumb poppers) - 5 Â deep fried poppers sitting on top of a cocktail sauce. These tasted pretty good and stayed crispy despite the sauce.. . The cheese Fondue w/ gruyere and fontina cheese was served with bread and green apple chunks. I really liked the cheese, even with the apples, which sounds like an odd combination, but wasn't half bad.. . Their french fries with house-made aioli was average. Crispy and garlicy, but generally unremarkable.. . I also had a Fraiche Fizz cocktail, which was light and fruity but not too sweet; served in a champagne flute and spiral lemon peel. . . Other than being overpriced for a happy hour menu, my other gripe is that their outdoor lounge seats were made for skinny midgets, if you are neither skinny nor short, you will be uncomfortable sitting at their tiny low tables.
