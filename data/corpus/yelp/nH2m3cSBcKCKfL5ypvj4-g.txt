Yummy scrambles.  Go here for breakfast/brunch.  The wait is never that long and the food is worth it.  The only downside I can see about this place is that the menu is so big, I always have the worst time deciding...do I want breakfast or do I want lunch!?  I have so far never been dissappointed by the breakfast.  I love it when you can build your omlette or scramble.  The ingredients are fresh and the waiters are super friendly and nice.  Always a huge plus.
