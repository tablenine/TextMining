Wow. The first experience is probably going to be the best. There is something fun about tracking down the truck and trying a new style of food. The food itself was pretty good. You have to understand despite the hype and nice graphics it is still a roach coach. I'm a big fan of Korean food and this was a perfect blend of fast food greasy Korean "fusion".  I ate the short rib burrito and the kimchi quesadilla.  Both were very greasy and very good. . . Go for the experience of hunting down the truck, waiting in line with friends, and pigging out on Korean/Mexican food.
