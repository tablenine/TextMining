I tried this place for the first time today.  I read reviews prior to coming here so I thought I'd check it out.  My friend and I had the munchies after taking a hike up to the griffith observatory so we came by here to get some sunday brunch.  . There was quite a line once we got in, but it moved and we were able to order our food and find a table in a timely manner.  The food came within 15 minutes of ordering and it was excellent!!!! I tried the smoked salmon breakfast.... bomb! It came with fresh fruit and was the perfect size.  My friend got one of the panini's and she enjoyed it.  They offer a lot on their menu, so i'll definately be back to try other entrees.. On our way out we also saw that they have a private back room for private parties!. The only downer was valet parking, but its not surprising, you always gotta pay for parking in LA!
