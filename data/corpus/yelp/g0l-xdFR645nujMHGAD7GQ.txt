Popular Jap restaurant in the area with reasonable price. Ordered the Uni set....loaded with uni on a fancy plate. Sashimi is fresh. Down to earth Japanese food. Nothing too creative about it tho. Â I dropped by the supermarket next doors and highly suspect they got their uni box from the same distributer or something.
