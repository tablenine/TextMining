Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
Food: always serviceable to good (but I think all the restaurants in Greektown share the same kitchen and they use those vacuum tubes like at the drive-in bank to transport the food items to the individual restaurants).  I do wonder why they give you rice AND potatoes -- are their customers just not fat enough?. . Service: efficient but impersonal.  . . Room: pleasant, bustling. . . But the best: free valet parking (although you can get this at any restaurant in Greektown).
