Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
For 2 years I lived 2 blocks away from this place and it was my most popular eating destination. Simply loved it.. . Bossa Nova is a great value, yet it does not compromise on the quality of the food. It has a HUGE menu and practically everything I've tried is great.. . Although I'm quite the carnivore, I really love their salads. In fact, I've probably had their salads more than anything else. The Bossa salad is excellent and I love their house balsamic. I also love their skirt steak salad.. . You wouldn't think a Brazilian place is necessarily good at pizza or pasta, but they absolutely are. The BBQ chicken pizza gets my vote. As far as pasta, I split my orders between Tiriri's pasta and the Sunset pasta.. . Everything is reasonably priced and I just think it's refreshing to have a place in West Hollywood where you can get some plantains and caipirinha's from real Brazilians. And yes, most of the staff is Brazilian.. . The only real negatives are that the dining room is small and pretty spartan, and that take-out orders are sometimes delayed a bit during "rush" eating hour.. . Still, I give it top marks for the food, the value and the service.
