Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Today i finally ended up checking out Porto's. I have seen tons of people flood this bakery over the years and decided today to check it out. I was very impressed as soon as I entered. The display and the appearance of the shop was very impressive. I ended up getting a few pastries priced at just over a dollar...not bad at all. I was a bit hungry so I decided to get a hot pastrami sandwich to my surprise tasted very good and just $4.85. I will definitely be back to Porto's... 86/100
