We've been going here for five years now and always get garlic noodles which are amazing.  This time though they were not up to standards.  They were not fresh and tiger prawns were rubbery.  Maybe an off night.  I will go back again soon and give it another chance. Because you cannot find these noodles anywhere else. Not even NYC
