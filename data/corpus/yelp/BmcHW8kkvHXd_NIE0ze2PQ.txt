Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
I have to say that I was less than impressed by Reza's, not just because their service wasn't that great, but their food seemed a bit bland and overpriced. . . Now mind you, I went to Reza's during Midsommarfest, so Clark St. was crazy, but the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I decided to sit down and enjoy Â a meal, rather than order from their tent outside. BIG MISTAKE! They claimed they were out of Chicken Shwarma, so I had to settle for falafel. Only later, as I exited the restaurant, did I find out that they did have Chicken Shwarma --- it was all at the tent I had passed up earlier. Why couldn't they just walk right outside and grab it for their indoor customers is beyond me.. . A cardinal sin was committed with regard to their falafel sandwich --- they put it on a spinach wrap and not on a traditional pita. Now, I'm no expert, but aren't most middle eastern restaurants supposed to have pita?!. . Bottom line, this place is just not that great. Their menu is overpriced, sub par, their wait staff can be rude and the food just sucks.
