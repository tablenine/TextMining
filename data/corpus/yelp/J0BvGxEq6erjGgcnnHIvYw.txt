I've been wanting to try the original Katsuya for a long time now, but the drive all the way to Studio City has always kept me away. I finally made it out there last week, and I wasn't disappointed =). . We had the Tuna Steak w/ Japanese Salsa - which came with about 12 slices of tuna in a ponzu-like vinaigrette with diced tomatoes and a tower of sliced avocado.  I highly recommend this dish, especially if you like tuna.  We also got the jumbo scallop w/ yuzu (which comes slightly seared), albacore sashimi, and yellowtail cut roll - all of which were very fresh. The baked crab roll was good - except I would have preferred it without the mayo mixed in.. . I also ordered the tamago sushi because I have yet to find a better tamago than the one at Sushi Gen. Katsuya's was very good - still not quite as good as Gen, but definitely close. Another thing worth mentioning is that Katsuya's sushi rice is perfectly seasoned and a lot better than other popular sushi restaurants such as Hide or Komasa. . . Parking is basically non-existent on Ventura Blvd, but valet parking is available in their lot for $3.50.
