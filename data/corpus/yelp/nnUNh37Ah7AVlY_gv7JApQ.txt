I was a little apprehensive to go out for a girl's night at Mirai because it seemed like the yelp reviews were hit or miss..... but luckily mine was a HIT! We sat in the bottom floor and the decor was great. Service was fantastic (and our waiter was the twin of Christian from Project Runway). First we started out with a couple drinks - which were really tasty, but not very strong. . . Everything on the menu looked good so we tried Â little bit of everything. I really enjoyed the tuna tuna salmon, spicy mono and shrimp tempura special rolls.....mmmm. I also tried the gyu maki, but wasn't very impressed. . . We ended the dinner with the green tea mochi ice cream and chocolate mouse cake. I'm not a huge fan of mochi, but everyone else said it was good. The chocolate mouse cake was good, but really rich. . . The dinner wasn't cheap, but the quality of fish was worth it. And plus, you gotta treat yourself sometimes!
