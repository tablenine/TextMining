We had reservations for 5 people at 9:30 on Saturday. We were seated in a booth right in front of the dance floor, which turned out to be quite entertaining. We decided we would order tapas style, but don't let the mini price tags fool you - they add up quick! Real quick! . . For the most part, everything we sampled was delicious. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The Shrimp and Scallop as well as the Ahi Tuna and Watermelon Ceviches were fantastic!  However, we weren't a huge fan of the Empanadas - they weren't very flavorful.  The drink menu is fun and has a little something for everyone.  I highly recommend the Nacional Mojito it's got a really great flavor.  . . Before you go just keep several things in mind. It does get very loud and pretty hard to talk, once the dancing begins.  The dancing is entertaining, but watch out for the older men circling around your table as you try and dine.  They are a little too eager!  And the final reminder, tiny tapas with what seem to be tiny tags add up to a not so tiny tab when you are with a large group.  With all that said, enjoy!
