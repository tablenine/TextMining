First I want to say that I am a fan of Tom's from Top Chef and have enjoyed a nice meal at Craft in NYC but I am disappointed in this outpost of his restaurant.  I've eaten in the main room where I sent back a dish (never do) and thought the food did not justify the price point.  I also did not like the multi-server style of service that was presented.  I returned for apps at the bar before they introduced "Craftbar" and had a pleasant "wine and couple of apps" experience.  I was in the area for an event and  decided to try the new Craftbar experience and I was extremely disappointed.  They basically served amuse bouche portions(enough for a taste) at expensive prices. Honestly a rip off and I felt an embarrassment to the establishment.  I actually ate my 8 choices with my guest, paid the bill and drove to another restaurant to have a real dinner because I was still hungry.  Full reveal,  favors were good not great but Tom I expect more from you.  Please Tom, save this outpost.  I want to believe!
