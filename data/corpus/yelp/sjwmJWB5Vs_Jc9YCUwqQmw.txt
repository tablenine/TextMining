Now I'm not an expert on crepes by any means but I really didn't enjoy what I had here. A few friends and I had a quick bite after seeing a movie across the street. Since I hadn't eaten dinner yet, I chose a savory crepe. The best that I can say about it is that the crepe itself was tasty. It was a little toasty and while I understand that that's probably not how they're supposed to be, I liked it. However, the fillings left a lot to be desired. My crepe came with broccoli and cheddar inside and some sauteed mushrooms on top. There was very little cheese and what little was there seemed to be in a lump on one end. I understand that sauteed items are done so in oil or butter but that was all I tasted. The mushrooms were OK but the broccoli was swimming in unnecessary fat. In fact, it took until the morning for my entire mouth not to feel like it was coated in a giant layer of oil. My stomach was very upset the rest of the night. . . We were seated in the back, which was nice since the front of the place was so hot. I probably wouldn't come back unless I was dragged here and would stay away from their savory crepes.
