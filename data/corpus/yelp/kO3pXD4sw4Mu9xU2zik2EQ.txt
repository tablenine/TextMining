Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
If I had to pick one place in LA that has great food and represents the city, it would be Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.. . Excellent fried chicken, good waffles, butter, great maple syrup, and Red Rooster hot sauce all in your mouth at the same time. There's no wrong way to eat a Roscoe's.. . I've been to this location and the one on Pico and Labrea. This one's open later to cater to people getting out of clubs/bars. Hence the occasional bathroom disaster.
