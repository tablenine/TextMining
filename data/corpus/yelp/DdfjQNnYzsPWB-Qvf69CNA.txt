Man, I really miss this place! When I fly into LAX, It's gotta to be here or In'N'Out. Best Pastrami ever! While living in LA ,I would offer to even pick up friends so I could sneek down Sepulveda and get my fix. This place is old school. Tiny parking lot in back, but you manage to find a spot. I read about this place the local LA Mag raving about their coca-cola was the best in town. Don't forget the pickles!
