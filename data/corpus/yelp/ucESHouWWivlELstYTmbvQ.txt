Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
I've been here a couple times. It's your standard, run-of-the mill Chinese Restaurant. The food is good, but nothing special. You'll find better places in the neighborhood. It is nice for hitting late night. Despite Noodle being in the name, it doesn't excel in noodles, though they aren't bad. Just, well, 3 star.
