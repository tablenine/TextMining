Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Well, it ain't health food and if you're even close to vegan stay away. But if can enjoy some dirty, yummy, cheap food made with years of skillful frying than this is your place. If you've never had a Mexcian Dad make salsa for you then you won't be used to their extra liquid-y recipe. But having grown up on salsa straight from my papa's blender Â this taste just like home! The tacos are addictive! The tamales are a brick in your stomach, but a very tasty brick at that! If you stick with chips with a side of guac, beans, and salsa you'll be one happy camper!
