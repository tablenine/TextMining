Hispter feeling... I don't think so. More of just a great place for breakfast / brunch. Nothing about this place makes me feel like they are trying for a look. This is just what they are and if you don't want to come in, then stay at home. This spot isn't a place for all the people looking for the next greatest brunch place. When I went I didn't have to wait in line at all, which is why I have avoided places like Milk &amp; Honey and Lulu Cafe.. . Overall the brunch was great and service was excellent. I wasn't too happy about spending $3 for a donut , but it was good. Â They don't have a huge menu which is perfect.. the last thing I want is too many choices for how I want my eggs.
