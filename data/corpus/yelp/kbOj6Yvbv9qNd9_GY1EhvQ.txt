Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
very good xiao long bao. one of the few chinese restaurants that gets an 'A'. i don't think you can go wrong here since the food is less greasy and there aren't as many fried dishes. plus with the big windows in the front, you can see how clean the kitchen is. i'm going to be a snob and say, if you ever get a chance to go to taipei, the two restaurants there are better.. . the only downside is the wait.
