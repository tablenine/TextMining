Do not go unless you are definitely hungry and ready to eat!! . . Where else can you go to stuff your face with unlimited meat and panchan for hours? It was $14.99 when first went a year ago, but I think they upped the price to $16.99. Still worth it, if you ask me. . . It's partially outdoors, but you still leave the place smelling like K-BBQ. They have your typical meat choices: kalbi, chadol, deongshim, bulgogi, chicken and pork. They also have shabu-shabu but I've never tried it. Their side dishes are typical, the salad isn't that great and the waitresses aren't the most attentive (thank heaven for the service bell button!!!) but the sheer amount of food makes up for it.
