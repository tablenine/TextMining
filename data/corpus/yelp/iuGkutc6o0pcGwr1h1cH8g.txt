mac and cheese pancakes?! we always bailed the atrociously long lines when they were in the west village and i kinda will always regret that. not that essex market isn't cute, but completely different feel, i'd imagine. food was excellent and prompt. don't know how i feel about the move to hipstery greenpoint, but the menu alone might be worth it...
