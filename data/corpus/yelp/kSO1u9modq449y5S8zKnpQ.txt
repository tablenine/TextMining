I was really excited to see The Grange open up even though I will miss the Angel.  The Grange brings a much better beer list to the table than its predecessor, although still nothing compared to Brick Store down the street.  We started with some Risotto balls for an appetizer...very unique and even more delicious.  Make sure and try the Guinness-marinated Beef Brisket, Meat Pies, and Mashed Potatoes with Gravy...none of those will lead you astray.  The portions seem a tad small for the price, but the food quality was very good.  I look forward to going back and seeing this place develop into a Decatur hot spot.  Standby for 4th star.
