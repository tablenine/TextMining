It's been a while since I've  been here.  I usually go for family events here and they always treat us like V.I.P.  I love their swirly margaritas.  It takes a while to get you car though but it's O.K. though I could have some more drinks while I wait.  They have a hot plate which is like a grill with meats, chicken and sausage.  Its good for a group of 4 or more.  I will definitely come here again.
