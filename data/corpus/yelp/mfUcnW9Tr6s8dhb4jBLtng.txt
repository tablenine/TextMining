The best bakery ever!  I always get cakes here for friends and myself, and everyone raves about how good they are.  I haven't tried anything I didn't like.  The sandwiches are so good...tortas, media noche, turkey croissant.  The potato balls and meat pies are fantastic and always fresh.  Basically, you can't go wrong, even the smoothies are delicious!
