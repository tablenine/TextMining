I just visited Langer's for the first time last week with my fellow Yelper (and Foodie Friend) Paul.. . I ordered number 19.. . People, memorize number 19.. . It's their signature dish: pastrami on rye with cole slaw.. . Now, I must say, I'm no cole slaw fan, really.  Just never been a mayo type gal and I can get ridiculously picky about how I have my cabbage done.  But it wasn't bad.  I would probably get it without the next time, just to avoid the calories, but for those of you who are on the fence about cole slaw or just love it, then you'll enjoy.  . . Incidentally, this sammich is HUGE!  Two people could leave full off this thing.. . The pastrami melts in your mouth; chewing is totally unnecessary (though I recommend it to satisfy those pesky taste buds and prevent your colon from exploding).. . And few things make me happier than rye.  Only thing that would have been better was if it was whole grain wheat.   (I actually prefer the taste of wheat to white strangely.). . It's a part of L.A.'s landscape and should be, this place.  It's expensive for a sandwhich, but well worth it.  . . Next time I'm trying the sausage.
