Whenever I come here, I order the Oxtail Stew, without fail.  The plantains are eh, the rice/beans is whatever, but that Oxtail...so succulent, so hearty, so out of this world awesome.  Stop thinking that it's weird or gross to eat the meat on the tail of an ox.  Cuz if you do, you'll be missing out.. . The other thing I've tried here is the garlic chicken, which I found way too dry...but who cares, now that I have Oxtail Stew I don't need nothin else.
