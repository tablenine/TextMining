Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
The Magic Castle is always a unique experience if for nothing else, because you feel special that you got the invite.  The building itself is amazing and very easy to get lost in if you start to frequent the many bars scattered through-out.  One magic show was great, the other was a total disappointment.  The restaurant reservations are done in 1 1/2 hour increments I believe...and be prepared to spend some money because I remember them doing a minimum for how much you had to spend!  Ridiculous.  But overall, it's a fun experience that everyone should have once in their lives.
