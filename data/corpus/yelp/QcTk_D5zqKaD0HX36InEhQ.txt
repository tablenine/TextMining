Flavor explosion in my mouth.  That's probably the best way I could describe eating at Green Zebra.  The servings are small and meant to progress in flavor and complexity, which will also lighten your wallet.  The only thing that I was not a huge fan of was the amuse bouche, which resembled chocolate pudding with carrots.  (Yeah, I didn't get it either.)  Other than that, I loved every single dish, including the soup with meringues (no longer on the menu), sunchoke ravioli, and the poached Prospera's Farm egg.  I think more non-vegetarians should check out this place.  Though located in a seemingly random area, once you're inside, you'll be welcome by a modern but welcoming aesthetic.  Be sure to check out the specialty cocktails as well.
