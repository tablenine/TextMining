Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Now this is some gooooooooood Korean BBQ!!!!!. I cant give it 5 stars though because mah ninjas moms got the real goods......and until someone can top that.......its all 4 stars...........big up KOREAN MOMS (and DADS) with the secret recipes.. Ima actually have to give it the "official" Â . 4 and a HALF STARS!!!!. . Had the seasoned rib eye, shrimp and kalbi.. Pretty good flavor - B. MEAT WAS HELLA FRESH - A+++++++. and the service was very good - A. They even change the grill top when its time to cook the kalbi.. And they chop up the onion right at the table and put it on the grill with the meat.....DAMN THATS THE SHI****^%&amp;%$^^%!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Overall an A grade experience.
