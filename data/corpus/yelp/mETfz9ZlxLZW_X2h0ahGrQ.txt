Wwwhhhhyyyyy PINKS?!? You're supposed to be this SUPERAWESOMETASTIC LA spot, and yet.. I was unimpressed.. again! . . Yeah, I still don't get what all the hype's about.. The hot dogs suck, period. Greasy and way way too well done. Tommy's makes a WAY better chili cheese dog for half the price and an hour less time in line. The fries were ok though.. I wouldn't wait another hour in line for them alone, but at least my wait wasn't a total loss since, as previously mentioned, my hot dog wasn't up to par *at* all.
