Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
"IT'S JUST A F***IN HOT DOG" is what I yelled as I was driving by this place one time. I've been here about 3 or 4 times. Yes, the hot dogs are pretty good but I just don't think it's worth the wait. Each time I've been there, the wait time just kept getting longer and longer. It used to be about half hour wait but now it's more like 45 minutes to an hour. And the parking just sucks. Their lot is super tiny and there are no nearby street parking. I got a parking ticket last time I was there. Bastards. It's worth a try if you've never been or have visitors stopping by for the first time, but definitely not a regular place to get your dogs.
