You don't need to put syrup on these pancakes.  If you do, there's no need to drench them.  They're just so good on their own... the right combination of fluffy, buttery, greasy, and  lacy on the edges.  The flavor is rich and satisfying.  Be prepared for a wait on weekend mornings... but come hungry.  The portions are really generous.
