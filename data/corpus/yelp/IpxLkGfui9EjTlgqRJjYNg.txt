Def. the best sushi i have tried in Los Angeles so far.  the sushi is sooooo fresh! my favorite was the scallops, sweet shrimp and the uni! ooh and the miso soup with sweet shrimp head was awesome too!  sooooooo goood. i cant get over it.  the service was pretty good, not excellent but what i expect a normal service to be.  the place is tiny but worth the trip =)
