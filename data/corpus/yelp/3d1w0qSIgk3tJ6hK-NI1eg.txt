Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
I attended the Style Chicago Fashion week party here.. It was very nice.. It was also my first time to Pops.. I was afraid that the staff would think we were just a bunch of women looking for some free champagne (hell most of the women there were). But everyone was very polite and treated myself and friends graciously.. . I have been back to Pops once since then on a date and it was lovely. Very fashionable clientele.. A nice place to go on a date where you can actually hear one another over a nice array of wine, finger food and of course champagne!. three cheers!
