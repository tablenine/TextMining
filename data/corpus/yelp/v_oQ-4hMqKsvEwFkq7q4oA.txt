I don't know if I was dreaming or not, but there was a time when I came here and there was no line at all. I hope it wasn't a dream. Shoot, it was pouring one night and there was still a damn line the first time I went here.. . I heard about this place few years back through word of mouth. Yenno, it's how you heard about stuff before Yelp came along.. . Since then, it's been a go-to place to take tourists when visiting Socal. Grab lunch here, then tour LA for the day. All that sight seeing will help you burn the calories ate here; this isn't a diet friendly place.. . I like getting the speciality dogs with a side of chili cheese nacho fries. Yeah, it's a fatty meal, but it's soo good. On my latest trip, I had a Ozzy dog which consisted of a polish sausage dog which had a nice kick. . . If you like water with your meal, I'd bring a water bottle. They only have really small styrofoam cups and a really small water cooler providing the h20. . . Parking is tricky and heavily enforced in the surrounding lots and streets. I like to park behind Pinks by the school. . . Enjoy the wait in line! PS. If you're super hungry in line, there's a Pinkberry around the corner to quench your hunger.
