Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
I quickly snapped up the Groupon when it appeared in my inbox because I have been wanting to try Green Zebra for a long time. I was not disappointed! . . Since it was my date and I's first time, our waitress explained to us that the plates were small and that it was best to order about 3 per person. We took her advice and picked a couple of things from each portion of the menu. We also each chose a cocktail--the Bees Knees and Tequila Snowstorm--both were fantastic, although I think the Bees Knees was slightly superior.. . Some of the highlights of our meal: Mu shu wraps (my date's favorite), shiitake mushroom rolls (my favorite), thai coconut soup, creamed spinach crepe (incredibly delicious and a filling last course).. . I agree that it is a little bit pricey, but I'm a sucker for small plates as I love to try lots of things and share with my date. I read a couple of reviews that complained about the service, but I thought the service was honestly impeccable. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. . . The only part of the meal I was disappointed with was the dessert. My date doesn't do dairy, so we went with a vegan option--the pear strudel. It was only ok, and just confirmed my belief that dairy belongs in dessert. . . Overall a delicious and satisfying meal, even though I love meat! I would definitely love to return, and for a special occasion it is the perfect spot.
