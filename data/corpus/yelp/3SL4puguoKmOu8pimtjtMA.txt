My friends and I decided to go here a while back because we heard all the hype about it. It didn't disappoint.. . The place was pretty packed, and we would soon find out it had a reason to be. . . Of course, you have to get the french dip sandwiches. The meat was tendery and juicy. The bread was great too, dipped and all. My friend and I were still hungry after the sandwiches, so we got their clam chowder. It wasn't that great, as far as soups go, but it was still pretty good. One of the most memorable things about this place is the hot mustard. It is something special. I tried just a little bit at first, and it shot through my nose. There's not much at the very beginning, but it hits you hard after a while. I really like it though. Definitely a nice kick.
