This is one of those things that seems great in theory but doesn't quite work out in application..... . I've been several times bc it's conveniently located. The service is usually really slow, so be ready to order the first time they come around. It's prob also a good idea to get your first drink at the bar before sitting down. Â Their stuff is a bit over priced, but what movie theater isn't? If you get a cup of coffee here be prepared.... It's huge! I think it came out in a soup bowl.. . The real issue is that getting some adults to be quiet or restrained during a movie is tough enough, but when you mix in eating, drinking, and servers moving around it can all get a bit loud and distracting. . . I haven't been to the Starlight Drive-In yet, but I'm betting it's a better alternative.
