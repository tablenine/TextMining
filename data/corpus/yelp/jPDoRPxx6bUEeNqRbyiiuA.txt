Restaurant: Community Q BBQ
Category: Barbeque
For me, this place rivals Fox Brothers as the best BBQ in Atlanta.  It's a small establishment tucked away in a strip mall a couple of miles from downtown Decatur.  It is easy to miss, but hard to resist.  . . I'm a Carolina boy, so stick with the pulled pork and disregard all other alleged BBQs.  The sauce does not make the BBQ, no matter what you Georgians say or think -- you have much to learn grasshopper.  It is about the meat, and the careful smoking process that creates a tender, moist, and smoky flavor.  Community does a consistently good job in this regard.  The spice rub they use is very flavorful and the outside pieces will melt in your mouth with joy.  Occasionally, you will get a piece of fat and have to do your own trimming.  They don't need to be embarrassed and cover up their product with sticky sweet sauces.  But if sauces are your thing, they have a sweet tomato based sauce that is okay.  The vinegar sauce is something akin to what we would do back home, so I go that route.  . . It is cliche' to brag about your favorite restaurant having the best mac-n-cheese.  But their mac-n-cheese has a special place in my heart.  It is cheesy beyond belief (a side product of that is some oiliness) and topped with what I think are crunchy panko bread crumbs.  The collards were good when I tried them.  The sweet tea is really sweet, and should be enjoyed in moderation.  Some of the other sides can be inconsistent.  . . I recommend ordering the pulled pork sandwich and one or two sides, it will be enough food for most people and will cost about $10.  The lines can get long at certain times of the week and can be frustrating.  If you go a few times the owners/managers will remember your face (if not your name) and greet you like a friend.  They are very personable.  I'll keep going back.
