Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
El Tepeyac is just okay, nothing to root and rave about. . . We eat the Manuel special burrito maybe once a month in my house because it's so huge and one of those babies can feed an entire family. It's nothing great, it's just big. It's definitely quantity over quality eating. The meat is just not good to me. I always pick out the meat because it's so tough, dry, and hard. I feed the meat to the dog usually. It's tasty and filling, but nothing great.. . The Hollenbeck is really good, I really love the shredded machacha pork. The taquitos are also good. My dad says El Tepeyac is really known for their guacamole and I agree, it's some really good guac.. . It's good if you're in the area, but it's a pretty sketchy part of town. I think the Manual special would probably be great party/Superbowl food as it's big and can feed a bunch of people. Other than that, I wouldn't go out of your way to try this.
