IMO, the best pastrami around. After eating at Langer's, I feel I need to go update my review of The Hat and downgrade them from 4 Stars to 3 Stars. The pastrami is amazing here. The cut is very thick, tender and flavorful. The best I have ever tasted so far. . . Their most popular item is the #19. That is a whole hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing on rye and a side of cole slaw. Since I'm not a big fan of most cole slaw, I got the #10 which is a #19 sans the slaw. Two half spears of pickles accompanied this sandwich also. The first thing I did was took a piece of pastrami and ate it by itself. This was one tender, tasty piece of meat. Then I dove in the sandwich. The bread kind of threw me off for a second. The rye crust is pretty hard, while the rest of the bread was very moist and soft. They were complete opposites but went well together. . . Langer's is awesome, but like most good deli sandwiches, not cheap at all. It was almost $13 for my sandwich. But, I do believe it is worth every penny. They also validate if you parked in their lot on 7th and Westlake, just a block from them.
