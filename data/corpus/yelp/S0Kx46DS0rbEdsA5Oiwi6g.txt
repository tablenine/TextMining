The dude who stated it costs $60 for two pizzas and 2 glasses of house Chianti was right. But all the other 100+ people who said this pizza is some of the best in the city and this place is worth it all are MORE right. . . When I think of the term "worth it", it feels like there's a downfall to endure to get to the good stuff. But from my experience tonight, there was no wait on a Friday night, the wine and salad came within 2 minutes of us ordering, and the pizza came within 5. No joke. I was impressed.. . The only reason why I give it 4 out of 5 is because the Chianti is very flat and sub par and the atmosphere wasn't at all what I felt look it should have been when I walked in - full of expectations from hype my boyfriend and I read in TimeOut. But if you're going for the pizza, and not a stylized ambiance, this place is snacktacular.
