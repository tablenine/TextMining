Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
You don't need me to tell you that this is a good restaurant.  I ate here about 7 years ago and went back this weekend for Dine LA.  Both times were great although the first time I went it was really amazing.  . . I love the fresh horseradish.  . . The prime rib itself is very good but I guess there's a problem now: it's really average.  After visiting so many Las Vegas buffets and eating at various steakhouses, I have concluded that it's hard to really mess up prime rib.  What they serve at Lawry's is good but it's not special and thus I have to knock it off the 4 star list.  . . When you combine that with the price that they charge, you aren't really getting a "great" deal.  Even with the Dine LA we ended up paying about $50 a person and that is a pretty hefty price.  I will say that the "California Cut" of 6 ounces was already pretty significant.  (More than enough for most ladies and probably enough if you are a regular dude who doesn't want to eat till they burst.)  . . I would try it if I have never tried it but I'll probably move on to other steakhouses from now on.
