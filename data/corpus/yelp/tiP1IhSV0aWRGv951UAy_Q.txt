They say there is usually a long line but it must've been a lucky day cuz we only waited about 4-5 minutes and our table was ready!!! Now where shall I begin!! All of their dishes are sooo good!! The one that stood out the most was their chicken wings!! Gosh, these wings are marinated with a special seasoning that makes you dreaming for more!! They also have this beef dish that has one of the best sauces...even though i don't eat beef, I would have them make me a side of that sauce!! Yum yum..it goes really well with the chicken wings! :P. . Hmmm...when can i go down for more wings???
