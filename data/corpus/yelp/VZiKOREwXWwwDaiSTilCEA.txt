Restaurant: Big Star
Category: Mexican
Well, after the 2.5 hour wait and a 1 hour meal, we finally got a clear idea of the "rules" at big star.... . 1.the costumer is never right-Seth will ask you to leave before you've finished your drinks, because "other people are waiting and how dare you question him..." . 2. You can't stand outside while waiting for a table because, "we're not that kind of establishment.". 3. Orders may be wrong, but its the customers fault, just except, eat, enjoy, pay, then leave quickly. . 4. Accept cash only-. . Well, my second time there and I'm left with such a sour taste, I certainly will never go back and I'll discourage other people from going there as well. I enjoy high end eateries, but typically the service and staff are cordial and accomodating, you Will NOT find that here!! They're pretentious and rude. I'm surprised because if you walk across the street to violet hour, same owners, although a much nicer bar, the staff is great!. . Won't go back, won't recommend, won't ever say a nice word about the place. . If you want to feel like you're at ed debevnicks for adults, go there, but instead of laughing you'll leave furious. Shame on you owners for accepting this behavior from your staff. Too many great restaurants in chicago to allow this.
