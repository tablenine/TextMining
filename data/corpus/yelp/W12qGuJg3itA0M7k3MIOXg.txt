Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
Love this place. The menu is small but well-rounded. Their soon du bu chigae is perfect --- the broth is so spicy and flavorful and clean-tasting (my mom pointed out that it's because it had no msg...I have no idea how to tell but I trusted her judgment as a cooker of awesome Korean food) and the tofu is a perfect consistency. They use large, full shrimps instead of the pinky nail-sized micro shrimps some places use. Their denjang chigae is the epitome of comfort food for me and Cho Sun Ok's is the one I crave when I have a cold. I love their mackerel -- perfectly grilled and juicy . Love the banchan, particularly the very fresh kimchi, and the soybean sprouts and potato-apple-mayo salad thingy. Just wish this place weren't so crowded.
