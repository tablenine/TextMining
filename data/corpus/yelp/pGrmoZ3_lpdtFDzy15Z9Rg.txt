I came here with a couple of old friends whom I hadn't seen in years and it was a great place to come and just sit down and catch up. I was here on a Sunday night and it wasn't too hard to find a spot. However I have heard it can be very difficult and sometimes you have to wait a long time for a spot. . . I had The Office Burger which was amazing. I do not even like onions usually but in this burger they tasted just right. I also had the sweet potato fries with the garlic aioli which was great and really made the fries taste great. . . I had 2 Alagash White's since I wanted to keep it on the lighter side that night and the beers were great. They had a great beer selection and it seemed to have something for everyone's preference.. . My only complaint was the lack of customization for the burger which can get annoying but luckily I liked what was on the burger so it did not matter.
