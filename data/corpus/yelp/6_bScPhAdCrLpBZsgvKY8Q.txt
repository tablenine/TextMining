omgahh... DROOOOOLLLLL.. . I went here two days in row it was THAT good. enough said right?. . First time my friend and I got: Mom's French Toast and 'Some like it spicy' eggs. BOTH WERE SOOO GOOOOD. French Toast was hands down the best french toast ever. I don't even like bread but this just melted in your mouth. My friend and I about died when we took our first bite and went to french toast HEAVEN. GET MOM'S FRENCH TOAST. just do it...!! 'Some like it HOT' eggs was also delicious. The perfect combination of eggs, chicken, veggies.. they give a side of chips so you eat it like chips 'n dip. It's really really good. I LOVE eggs and this made me look at eggs and breakfast in a new angle. You won't be disappointed!!. . Day Two: Four of us go this time. BLACK MAGIC-- Oreo Pancakes: HUGE HUGE HUGE. My guy friend ate about 1/5 of it. Super sweet, it's like eating dessert for breakfast. GOOD but not my type of breakfast. "Say Cheese"-- Cheese Omelet was whatevers. Another friend got Mom's French Toast and died to french toast heaven.. I got the "Chicago Charlie's" Scrambled eggs.... pretty good but I wasn't orgasming in the mouth. Seemed like atypical omelet. I liked the "SOme like it HOT" scramble better.. . You should def go here. There might be a crowd but I didn't have any trouble sitting around 11a-12pm. Good stuff. Maybe my go-to breakfast place :)
