Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Great food and fast service at an incredibly affordable price.  My parents and extended family all enjoyed the food, but thought the music was a little loud.  It's just Thai Elvis rockin out with his karaoke machine--it's totally part of the experience!. . I always get the shrimp fried rice and the clams with chili paste, SO good!!  i've also tried all of the following dishes:. . pad thai. pad see ew. pad kee mow. garlic pepper chicken. green curry. tom kha kai soup. . And probably a ton more I don't remember right now, but, everything has been really yummy!  The slushie boba tastes good--the boba is soft, chewy, and sweet.  Palms Thai is also open til 2-3am, which is great for those late night cravings!  The food here always hits the spot!
