This place probably needs at least 5 visits to really get a good feel for the variety that they offer. Some love the cheese, some love the sweets, some the salads... I've been there once, so you can take my review with a grain of salt. . . This place is frou-frou. a place to be seen. a place to go after your appointment with your plastic surgeon at cedars-sinai. . . We did lunch when I went, and i sampled the chinese chicken salad, which was blah, the BLT, which was solid, and some fresh mozzerella, which was tasty. Now, If i can only get back there and order every sandwich on the menu.... . Overall, this place is Â scene with good food.Definitely a good lunch pick.
