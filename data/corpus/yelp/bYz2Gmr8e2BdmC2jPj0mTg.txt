This is how casual dining should be.  We went on a weeknight and had no trouble getting a table outside.  The atmosphere is really nice and the douchebag factor is pretty low.  I had the local albacore dinner; it was not the best tuna I have ever had but it tasted fine, and I appreciate that they source local fish.  The sides were great.  In particular, the mashed potatoes were outstanding!  Others had grilled veggies and grain salads and everyone seemed pretty happy with their dishes.  Highly recommended!
