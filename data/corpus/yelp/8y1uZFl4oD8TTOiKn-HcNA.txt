Let me start by freely admitting, I am a sushi novice.  I am sensitive towards eating fish and strange foods.  That said, I have really enjoyed many sushi meals to date, but this one was only okay and I probably won't return.  I didn't get that fresh feeling from the food.  It also seemed like everything was mushy.  There was no variation in texture, even with cucumbers and what not.  It just didn't do it for me...
