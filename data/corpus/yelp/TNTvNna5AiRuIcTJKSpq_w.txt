Apparently this place is much more popular now after being mentioned on TV..Man vs. Food (great show btw, go watch!). . Yes, all of the dips are good, but mine will be dedicated to the underdog.  The lamb french dip sandwich is sooo tasty! And if you like lamb, you have to try it!  LAMB FRENCH DIP!! I know ingenious, right! And its fresh--cut straight from the hunk of meat! The potato salad was pretty good, although I wish they used more paprika instead of just sprinkled on top as garnish. I always order extra pickles.  The famous hot mustard is very very hot, so use with caution.  If you love that sting your nose and bring tears to your eyes feeling of wasabi, you'll love this mustard! Dab a bit on a knife (fork, if you're accident prone) and taste it first.  This jar of mustard will definitely be used on future homemade prime-rib, my mouth is watering already!. . Long lines, beware.  Especially weekday lunchtime.
