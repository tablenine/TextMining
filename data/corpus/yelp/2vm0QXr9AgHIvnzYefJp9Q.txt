Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
I was a bit harsh with my earlier review. I would go for 3.5 stars if I could, but I guess if I update it with a 4 it kind of evens out. Anyway, for a Hawaiian restaurant in the Southeast this is an easy 4. A little taste of an island thousands of miles away. I can appreciate that. The flavors are on par and I solved my previously mentioned rice woes by cooking rice and getting the food to-go. Stretched my meal by a full 100%. Good stuff.
