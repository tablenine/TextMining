Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
I'm on a real "customer service" kick lately. Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder is the kind of place that feels a little customer unfriendly, and that gets my goat. Here are my issues: 1) Unless it's a hot dog stand or something like that, a restaurant should take credit cards. 2) Charging by the glass for soda is just mean-spirited. Especially when you serve, like, 8-ounce glasses. 3) 90-degree wooden booth backs are hell on your back, and are made even more irritating by the fact that they're not anchored very well, so you get jostled every time the person behind you changes position.. . That being said, the food is really good. The salads are better than they have a right to be, since they're pretty much just lettuce on a plate, but the two dressings that you mix together bond chemically to form crack. The pita-ish flat bread is really tasty. And the pizza pot pies are original and yummy too.
