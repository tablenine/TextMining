I don't know what to say about my recent experience at Vortex.... . The burgers are delicious, the beer flows, the vibe is cool and unique, and the location is prime.  Just don't bring your family!. . I read the signs saying "No one under 18 Allowed" due to a smoking ordinance of some sort...I have never heard of such a ridiculous thing in my life so I didn't take it seriously considering I was with my elders. (My brother is 15).  I also assumed that it was targeting groups of young people and not families with parents that are willing to subject their 15 year old son to the dangerousness that is, second hand smoke.  . . I now understand that under no circumstances can a person under 18 enjoy the Vortex and that's fine (I'm sure they do good enough business to be able to turn a few kids away every now and then).  The issue I do have is that my family and I waited 30 minutes to be seated before being asked to show identification.  I'm pretty sure I am older than the gent who asked for my i.d, so that was kind of a slap in the face, and my brother doesn't carry a wallet, considering he just got his learners permit and he never pays for anything. (Not to mention he looks like a baby). . In retrospect: upon reading the signs I should have been more forward with the hostess instead of speculating and I will know in the future that this stipulation exists and they don't make any exceptions!. . Despite poor judgement on my part, and lack of judgement by the waitstaff I would still recommend grubbing at the Vortex...just leave anyone who can't vote at home!
