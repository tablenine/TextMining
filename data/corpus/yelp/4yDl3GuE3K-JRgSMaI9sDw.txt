Pros: they turned me onto Good Karma Carrot Cake rice cream/ice cream. Seriously one the most incredible things I've ever tasted. If you go to RFD for dessert have that with ANYTHING. Holy Crap.. . Cons: Is it just me or do some of the dishes seem like they are pre-cooked sitting out on some counter somewhere drying up and being DEAD. The idea of REAL food to me seems like it would mean as fresh and as real as humanly possible. Â Perhaps it was what we ordered but it seemed kinda gross. I wish I felt differently. I wanted to be excited about this place.. . Maybe I'll give it one more try but I've already been twice and though EH.
