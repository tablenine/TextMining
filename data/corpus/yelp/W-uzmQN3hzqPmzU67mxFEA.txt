Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
Hugo's Frog Bar is one of those restaurants that you have to try if you're ever in Chicago. The place is super crowded and loud, and expect a long wait even if you make reservations, but the food and service makes up for all of it.. . I had the crab cake appetizer and the miso seared sea bass special. Like all the other yelp reviews say, the crab cake is amazing. The sea bass was also delicious and tender. Our party also ordered the seven-layer "Meaning of Life" chocolate cake, which is the biggest slice of cake I've ever seen. We couldn't finish it, even between the 7 of us, but it was reallyy good, especially the banana-chocolate-mousse layer.. . I would come back, if only for that cake.
