I've been here a number of times, and every time I've been quite pleased with the dining experience.  The food is superb, and the kitchen is very accommodating--on one occasion, they whipped up a non-menu three course vegetarian meal for my gf (I'm sure the affiliation with Green Zebra helped), and on other occasions they have been willing to substitute or delete ingredients without complaint.  The service has been wonderful--we've requested Jeff Dudak (sp?) multiple times, and he's delightful.  One of my favorite places in Chicago.
