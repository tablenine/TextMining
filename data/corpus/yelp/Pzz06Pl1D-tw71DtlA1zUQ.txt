The pastrami here is AWESOME. But I have to stay that the bread here is the real star. BEST BREAD EVERRR. Its crust is crunchy but the inside is so soft, it's incredible. They double bake it (they get it partly baked from a bakery, and they finish it). The number 19 is the one to get. I've only ever had the NICEST servers, my favorite is the older English woman. She's a sweet heart. . I've had pastrami in NY and this is way better. I'm giving 4 stars cuz it's a little pricey (but definitely less than an equivalent New York deli) and for their hours (they're only open for breakfast and lunch).. [come here for pastrami, Canter's for potato salad, corned beef and late nights]
