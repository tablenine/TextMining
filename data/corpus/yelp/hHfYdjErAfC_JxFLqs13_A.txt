It was pretty good. We took our cousin from out of town to eat there. She got the Pad-Thai and the rest of us (my 3 other sisters and me) got the Spicy Szechuan stir fry. I could tell our server was trying very hard and she did pretty well. She was there when we needed her but she wasn't hovering or anything. She even did this little "luck" type thing with a paper straw wrapper that my sister taught her. Something like you tie it in a knot then pull. If it breaks at the knot, then someone is thinking of you. My sister was even pretty harsh by exclaiming "Oh! No one's thinking of you!" when it didn't break at the knot.. . Anyway, the food was pretty good as was the service. Of course, near the end of dinner, the battle of who gets to pay began (does that only happen in my family?). I ended up winning by nonchalantly asking where the bathroom was as an excuse to get up. She still caught on but I was able to make it to the register. At first the lady at the computer said that my server would bring me the bill but after I explained to her the circumstances, she understood and smiled. After that, we got our leftovers boxed (without having to chase down a server!) and left. I think we'll be back...
