My only complaint about this place was that I made 9:45PM reservations and we weren't seated until an hr later!!!!!!!!!!!. I was STARVING!!!!!!!!!. I prob should have thrown a fit but you never know what they do to your food back there!!!!!!!!!!!. They said they would let us know when the table was ready, well it would have been nice if someone at least kept us updated with the status!. My boyfriend went and asked what the deal was and they said they are waiting for people to leave.... So then this girl comes over and tells us she is sorry, you would think they would have at least comp'ed us something since we had to wait for an hr!!!!!!!!!!!. anyway after we finally got seated Â and they bought the edameme over, and I ate like every bean since I was sooooooooooooooooooooo HUNGRY!!!!!!. the service and food was good after we finally got our table!. I thought the sirlion was kinda tough..... The tiger shrimp and asparagus/mushroom risotto was delicious!. I had the aloha crush which was pretty good!. The Choc lava cake was really delicous!. . In case anyone is going there it seems like jeans are ok to wear there...
