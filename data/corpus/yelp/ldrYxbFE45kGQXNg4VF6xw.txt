If your not a fan of Hainan chicken then it's best to stay away.  Personally, the dish doesn't suit my pallet, so I opted to try something else on the menu and realized quickly that Hainan chicken is about all they do.  The place is a nice hole in the wall size with a mob like wait, so don't make any plans.  Again not a fan Hainan chicken so for those that enjoy it I'm sure this is the place otherwise, save your money avoid the crowd and go elsewhere.
