Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Several friends recommended Kopi Cafe as the best spot in Andersonville for vegetarian fare. I felt transported to the 1960's the moment I walked in. I may be a vegetarian, but I don't care for hippie culture (or shall I say counter-culture). Kopi definitely has a cozy bohemian vibe to it. The menu offers a nice array of breakfast and lunch items, but there are also specials. I could eat breakfast any time, so I had the "Sunshine on Shingles" (eggs and vegetarian sausage on top sourdough bread). It was mediocre, but the wood-smokey, charred taste was very off-putting. Oddly enough, nothing was burnt. Curtis had a burger, and it came with chips. No, not your average potato chips, but plain tortilla chips. Oh, come on!. . Okay, the food was average to below average, but the service = FAIL. The waitress was inattentive and ridiculously slow. (Perhaps this cafe is too laid back.) I wanted dessert and chose the carrot cake on display literally three feet away from my table. It's RIGHT there! It took more than ten minutes to reach my table. Not everyone has an entire day to eat a sandwich, damnit.. . Food was okay, service sucked. Would I come back? Probably not.
