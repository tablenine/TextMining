Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I've visited The Wiener's Circle several times, in hopes of getting my share of the promised attitude and profanity.  I've always been dissapointed, ordering my food and simply eating it, sans personality.  The food is decent for what it is - but by no means gormet.
