Great food, great ambience ( i love the set up), but the price.  Incredibly pricey for what you get.  I had the k-bbq sammwich, which was great, but not really worth its price point.. . The service was great though. What really sold me on the place though is the ice cream.  That alone has me believing heaven is on earth :)
