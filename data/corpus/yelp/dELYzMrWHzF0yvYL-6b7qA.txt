they are always busy! but so good at accommodating even the little ones...they serve boba, which i think is top notch in terms of how boba goes, especially the green milk tea, but their food is above usual boba cafe foods, which makes it a great dinner outing spot for those boba lovers. i'd recommend their "a-tsai" (sorry don't know how to use pin-ying), but it's a great veggie dish.
