Don't even try to find a parking spot in the neighborhood around it. You are just on a fool's errand doing that. Just park at the mall across the street and walk over. It's not that far.. . I was expecting it to be packed on a Saturday afternoon. Although it had the appearance it was, we ended up waiting for only 5 minutes. The place is small and there are only 2 guys handling the orders, but man are they efficient. One of the guys got our order within minutes of us sitting down and the food followed minutes after. . The burger is real tender and real good. I liken it to a higher grade In N' Out burger. On the other hand, Â the fries were just OK. The frying was done perfectly but it was a bit bland. That was solved by a little touch of salt though.. . Even though we were full, we decided to do the apple pie. I thought it was too sweet. You know it's too sweet when you have to use the ice cream to cut the sweetness of the pie. . . Overall, I like this place alot. It's cheap and it's good. I would def return.
