I don't use the word "adorable" very often. Recognizing adorableness requires something akin to a soul; that's a luxury I've been without since I found myself turning the channel during "Brian's Song" because, hey, Lando Calrissian doesn't cry. And definitely not over the guy from "Alien Nation."  I mean, c'mon!. . However, even in the depths of my black, black heart, I can recognize how frakin' ADORABLE Lottafutta is. Across the street from the grooviest Art Deco condos in all of Atlanta, this smoothie/sandwich shop with a South American twist makes this corner in the Old Fourth Ward a little slice of Miami--just without the gold chains, linen pants and douchie attitude. . . So yeah, most of what is served here is fruit in a cup. Sometimes soaked in OJ, sometimes served up with what I think is crème fraiche. They also serve light sandwiches as well as fruit smoothies. In fact, in an attempt to be what might be considered whimsical (for me at least), I ordered a smoothie and it was quite good. It could've used some bacon or a hamhock, but that's because I'm a disgusting slob. Most people would drink it as is.. . But it's a charming space and you're served up with a smile there. And don't look now, but hey, up in the corner! You're on TV!  Wave! What? That's just the security camera system? Dammit. I thought I was starring in some strange show on Univision or maybe a live version of 24 which, come to think of it, would be the worst season of 24 EVER.. . 2pm-3pm: Watch Ivan get a Diet Coke and continue surfing on Yelp!. . Anyway, 4.5 stars to Lottafrutta. I'd round up to 5 stars if only they'd change the name to LottaBacon.
