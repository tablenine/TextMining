Great...wonderfulll.....pretty.....they have really pretty ceilings......its just a really big open dinning area.....with very plush seats....waiters are really nice.......food is bomb....... . i would definitely suggest the BBQ SALMON...although i must say it took me like two years to get this wonderful item because u have to go get it on a monday or tuesday early in the evening around 4 or 5..... because they run out of it quickly....which was the problem the two previous times i had went to order it! Omg when i finally got to taste that bbq salmon it was well worth the wait. and the mashed potatoes were good too! Love that place...i would probably order the bbq salmon everytime I go!
