It's going to be difficult for me to find anything that lives up to my expectations after going to Sidney's Cafe, but this was pretty amazing. I had a Philly Peppersteak Sandwich and it was much more Philly-Cheesteak-ish than the sandwich I had last night. I ordered it with the small salad, which had this amazing balsamic dressing, and sprouts, carrots, croutons, and sunflower seeds. TALK ABOUT AWESOME! I love salads!!!!! My sandwich was great, but the weird banana/almond/chocolate chip bread I bought to go was nothing special. A little dry and bland. Blech.
