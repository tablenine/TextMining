As far as sports bars go, this is a good spot provided you have invested time in 30306. I prefer the drinking here first and food is a bit of afterthought. I have never really been able to land on a food item I love. I guess the wings and fajita wrap are my staples. . . While there is ample tvs with full on satellite style games, there isnt a great seat in the house. Chairs and room is tight. . . I would say - go there if you want to watch a game in background but not when your team is playing a big game.
