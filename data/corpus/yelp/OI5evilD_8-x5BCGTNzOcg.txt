I think this place is really great.  There's a really good vibe going on here, although I will say that the demographic always surprises me: while there are plenty of young and hip folks, I'm always surprised by the fact that this place is a hit with the older demographic.  Shall I say...boomers?  . . It's good southern food.  Good for groups as well.  I had a birthday party here, with twelve people, and they were happy to accommodate.. . The best part of this place is the upstairs bar.  It's this small room with good ambiance and fun live music.  Never seems really crowded, which is also a good thing.. . Definitely try this place out, if not for the food, check out the bar!
