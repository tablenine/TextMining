Mmm, mmm, GOOD!  I could eat at Tender Greens every day and not get tired of it.  In fact, every time I've been there, I've had the same thing and I'm not tired of it!  The food is simple, tasty and fresh.  Nice outdoor dining area, and it's not stupidly expensive.  Damn!  Just writing this review is making me wanna go back.  Bye!
