Restaurant: Sun In My Belly
Category: Caterers
Stopped in for lunch on the spur of the moment because I was starving.  Got a good sandwich and soup with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.. . There were a number of people in there and the decor was nice.  Good atmosphere.. . So, why only two stars?  Well, the place was uncomfortable. No one smiled.  None of the employees made eye contact with me.  I also had a pretty long wait for the food and no one came to ask if everything was going well. . . In the end, I asked for a box for the second half of my sandwich and left.. . Bottom line: good sandwich, good soup, good orange juice; the service left a lot to be desired.
