Mmmmmm, french dip sandwiches!. . My brother told me about this place, so being new to LA, I had to try it.  . . The first time I went it was packed!  There was a mass of people crowded in front of a row of waitresses behind an old fashion diner counter.  I finally made my way into one of the loooong lines and waited to order.  The wait was worth it.  The sandwich bread is soaked in the au jus, and is very tasty.  I will definitely come back!
