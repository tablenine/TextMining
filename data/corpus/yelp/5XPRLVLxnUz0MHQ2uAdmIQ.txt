i had a delicious standard brunch at this 3.5 star joint.. . i started off with the spanish coffee, which is a coffee drink mixed with Triple Sec, Kahlua, and Bacardi 151. normally i'm not much of a morning drinker, but this was delicious. . my brunch companions and i decided to order several dishes and share. we ordered the Three Napkin Meatloaf Sandwich, the Fresh Spinach and Tomato Eggs Benedict, the Banana's Foster Apple Pancakes, the Duck Trap Smoked Trout Hash and Eggs, and the Corned Beef and Yukon Gold Hash and Eggs. . . the meatloaf was juicy and came with a homemade cole slaw. tasty, but nothing special. . . the benedict was also pretty standard.the eggs were poached nicely, and the hollandaise sauce had just the right consistency. . . the apple pancake had a soft texture and was smothered in caramelized bananas (it tasted more like dessert than breakfast). . . the trout hash had a creamy texture and had a nice smoked, savory flavor. . . finally, the Corned Beef Hash was another well done standard item.. .  from the regular dishes to the inventive ones, everything came in gigantic portions without sacrificing quality. Â even though it was a diner, there was none of that "rustic" or overly greasy diner feel to the food.
