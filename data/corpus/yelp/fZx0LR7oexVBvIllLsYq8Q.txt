Restaurant: Belly Shack
Category: Latin American
Don't be fooled by the dark, drab, and sorta scary interior.  Belly Shack serves up some really unique eats that shouldn't be missed.. . I can't imagine the brussels sprouts with chorizo will stay on the menu through the spring and summer, so get them while you can.  If you're extra lucky, you'll be there when the Korean beef and plantain sandwich is offered on special.  This $10 treat mixes the elements of a traditional Puerto Rican jibarito (long slices of plantain fried into "bread" planks, garlicky mayonnaise) with loads of marinated beef and rice.. . Be sure to save room for dessert.  Sure, anyone can make soft serve.  But you'll never find it topped with huckleberries and lime zest at McDonald's...
