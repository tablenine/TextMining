Have been here a couple times, always with coworkersf or drinks/appetizers during the week. Enjoyable atmosphere with TVs (but not too many), great drinks and good appetizers. Nachos are great. Popcorn shrimp is good, but a little heavy on the popcorn. . . Worst part, as others have mentioned, is the disappearing waitstaff who are never around when you need them. Last time I was there, our waiter not only completely forgot to bring one of our appetizers (and never did get around to it), and took forever on the drinks - his loss, since he lost out on another round from us since we had no clue where he was. . . Overall: good place with a nice atmosphere, but only go if you can have a good time without a super-attentive waiter.
