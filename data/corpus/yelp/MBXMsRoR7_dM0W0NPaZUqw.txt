Is another 5 star review necessary?  No, but here's my 2 pence worth. . Holy crap Porto's is great. where the fuck have I been? Have driven by it for 20 years and only now am discovering it's awesomeness???. . on first visit had:. -steak torta sandwich, a perfect sandwich. The cuban flat bread they use is awesome and the steak slices are super tender and cooked at a good medium. the plaintain chips it comes with are good, sort of flavorless but a nice bitty to munch on. One sandwich is big enough for 2 to share if you are normal size eaters.. . -potato balls. awesome. like having a bite sized shepherds pie (well maybe 3 or 4 bitefulls as each ball is pretty big). the meat filling is just great and it's a perfect ratio of meat-potato.  Deep fried but not oily and greasy. . -cheese rolls. what everyone comes here for and with good reason. the best cheese danish I've ever had and they are amazingly cheap, as is most of the pastry section. . -chocolate cupcake. again, just awesome and moist. great flavor.. . -guava danish. All of their danishes look amazing, will have to try them all. . -meat pie. the seasoned ground beef in a flaky pastry. Again, awesome. Only .70 ea, can that be for real???. . Prices are cheap, I got 2 steak tortas, 9 potato balls, 12 cheese rolls, cupcake, danish, meat pie, 2 drinks for $36. . We came for an early sunday lunch and it was great.  The street parking was empty so you had your pick of spot, and the bakery was about 80% full so it was packed as the place is HUGE, but not so full that you couldnt easily find a table and I only stood in line for about 5 minutes.
