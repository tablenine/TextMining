Wow... I'm surprised with all the reviews... My friend has been telling me about this WOW super good restaurant and when she finally took me, I didn't really remember much about the food... What I remember was, the cook and the manager screaming and fighting at the back kitchen, plates breaking as they fell on the floor (maybe they were even flying across the room)... and the food... waited for a long time... not so good... never put the chef in a bad mood...
