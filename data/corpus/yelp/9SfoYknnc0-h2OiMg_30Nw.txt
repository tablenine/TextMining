Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Though the lines are long they serve some damn good hot dogs. I got two different ones because i was feeling ambitious and don't like having healthy levels of cholesterol.. . So the first one was the Mulholland Drive dog which had nacho cheese, bacon, onions, and mushrooms. Though it was good honestly it was a bit much, too intense for my taste buds, there was alot going on and it didn't mesh super well. the cheese was overpowering and your arteries scream at you after every bite for Â clogging them with cheesey bacon. Still tastes pretty good but its hard to eat more than half of it.. . The second one was the Lord of the Rings Dog, which was a hot dog (obviously) with onion rings and bbq sauce. Though simpler than the mullholand drive dog this was one of those cases of K.I.S.S. or keep in simple stupid and to say the least it was amazing.. . So despite the long lines pinks is pretty good, the spicy polish sausage is really spicy so be careful and when u order i would steer clear of things that sound super crazy because my LOTR dog though not as insane sounding tasted alot better.
