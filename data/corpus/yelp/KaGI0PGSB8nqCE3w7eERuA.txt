The fries were some of the best I've ever had. That's where the good ends.. . I was really excited to try this place out. Unfortunately I learned quick that it's just a big gimmick. I easily make better sausage at home for a fraction of the price.  All of the exotic ingredients mean nothing because they're all just ground up together. Also the service can be rather sub par. Even if you come in at a time when the line isn't out the door, you never know if the person behind the counter is going to be a total d-bag/queeny/ snob. .  Also, you get a choice of two topping for your sausage: onions, peppers, sour kraut and I think there's another one. The problem is if you want onions and sour kraut but you also want your sausage spicy you're out of luck because they don't offer any kind of hot sauce at the tables.. . This is also not the place to go if you don't like rich dark beer. The lightest thing they could offer me left a terrible taste in my mouth all night. . . I was really hoping to like this place but it's just another overpriced and underwhelming LA food hole for the tragically hip and tasteless.
