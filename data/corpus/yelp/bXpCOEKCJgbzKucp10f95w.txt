After hiking 4 miles, my friends and I headed over to Oinkster for lunch.  I knew the place was good because the line was already out the door.  I ordered the Oinkster Pastrami and an Oinksterade.  The Oinknster Pastrami was amazing.  It's probably the best pastrami I've had hands down.  The meat was tender, flavored just right and not overly salty like some other places'.  They have a chipotle ketchup along with a garlic aioli sauce for your fries.  Before we left, I decided to really undo all the calories I had burnt that morning by ordering a cupcake.  They ran out of the carrot cupcake so I had to settle for a PB&amp;J one.  The cake is peanut butter flavored (think a PB cookie) and it had jelly filling in the middle.  It was a little weird for me and not my type of cupcake.  But overall, this place was great.
