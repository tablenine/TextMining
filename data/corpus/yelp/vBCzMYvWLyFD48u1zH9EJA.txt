The waiter service is wonderful! The guy was attentive to me and my friend. I ordered the Lamb Curry, and the waiter told me he'd tell them to make it Indian Spicy..but to be honest it was ok spicy.. not to crazy.. which I actually enjoyed.. The lamb was soft and not chewy, didn't take much work to eat it, and the meat was flavorful.. and they give you alot of food. You can literally order the lamb curry for 2 people.. and some appetizer.. I kid you not. Â The inside decor is nice, and cute, not your typical overzealous decorated Indian style restaurant. The Garlic naan used real garlic- but the naan itself was not super fantastic.. naan should be butter HUGE..fluffy ...buttery.. and leaves a nice film on your lips.. that's how naan should be.. this was more like a pita with garlic on it.. The place is healthy Indian food, not alot of grease.. . If I could I would give the place a 3.5 star for food and a 4 for overall. Surprisingly they have descent cocktail selection.. and I saw Lychee Martini which I mentally noted as a Next time.. thing to try!
