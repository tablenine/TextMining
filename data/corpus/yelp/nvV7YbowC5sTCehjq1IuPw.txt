Upscale izakaya dining experience (essentially, Japanese pub dining, or like tapas) in Williamsburg.  Recreates the popular izakaya booth set-up where each party sits in a wooden booth with a curtain, giving a sense of insulation, and a call bell for service.  Have been to plenty of izakayas in Japan and loved them, but never went to an upscale one; have been to Zenkichi twice and have to say its a fabulous experience different from what I've had before.  Exterior is unassuming and you'll probably miss the entrance the first time.  Very dark interior, channels a classy zen look.  You're led to your booth, lit by a single spotlight high up.  Food is the highlight as you may have trouble seeing your tablemates well.  I've had the omakase both times, and was suitably impressed with the variety, quality, preparation, presentation, and flavors.  I did not think portions were too small, but as there is a distorted view of what constitutes proper portion sizes, I can see why one may think so.  I had the sake flight on one visit and loved it; these were complicated, layered sakes.  I plan to try ordering ala carte on my next visit; just have trouble turning down an omakase.  Service is excellent; fast, respectful, and attentive.  Overall, a great dining experience.
