I've been to Fraiche a few times and it remains a solid four, which puts it on the two-or-three-times-a-year list as far as eats.  . . The drinks and desserts are always amazing.  Some of the specialty cocktails are easily the best in the area. I don't eat pork or lamb, which does limit the menu somewhat, but I've always enjoyed the fish, chicken, or pasta/veg entrees I've gotten.  People I've been with have raved about the duck and monkfish. . . I would never sit inside for dinner though, I'm surrounded by enough people throughout the rest of my day that I don't need to be crowded by them at dinner.  Out on the patio, things are quite pleasant, barring the occasional siren. . . I have noticed in observing other tables (hard not to do with everyone so close), that while the servers are generally pleasant, they are most definitely thinking tips first, which means the better dressed people, those on business functions, and flashy daters get better service. If you naturally dress to impress for dinner out, no worries, but those on the t-shirt and flip flops plan shouldn't wonder why things are a bit slow or menu recommendations less forthcoming.
