although it's located in a nice area of downtown, i would have to say that the food was terrible. The tortilla chips they give you and the appetizers we ordered weren't bad at all but our main courses were awful. I ordered the duck and when I got it, the presentation could have been a lot better and to make things worse, it was cold.  Thankfully, they replaced it with a hot plate.  We ordered dessert and i thoughtthst the mango sorbet was going to be good (who can mess up on that?) but it actually tasted quite bad and i was happy when it melted because I didnt want to eat it anymore. So all in all we spent 250 bucks on a shitty dinner.
