I dont know how to explain this place just like everyone else.  Always wanted to try it (being a sox fan and all), but it just wasnt good.  More of a place to be seen than to relax and eat good food and drink.  Had some lamb appetizer and tasted the sauce more then the lamb.  Had a burger and I thought the cheese was disgusting.
