Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
As much as I LOVE garlic, the Stinking Rose is more of a smelly rose. This location (for me) is simply more of a cool place to go for dinner with friends. Yes, it's got a garlic theme, but I'm not the type of person to buy-in to gimmicks and eye candy. The place is very decorated inside and (for some) a bit much, but I always focus in on the food. The food is much better than the decor. Garlic seems to infest almost every single dish on the menu, from salads to ice cream (yes, even the ice cream). I really enjoyed the 40 clove garlic chicken. I also ate up the garlic ice cream. After all the garlic you might ingest frrom dinner, the garlic ice cream almost tastes like vanilla. Try the martinis (with a pickled garlic clove, of course) and if you get the caesar salad, see if you can order it chopped. Otherwise, you'll be dining on romaine stalks...rabbit-style.. . Although a bit pricey, I still keep going back for more. I suggest giving it at least a second chance since the menu offers more than you can really take in from one meal...unless you dine there as one in a party of fifty people.
