Restaurant: Joya
Category: Thai
I've been eating at Joya once a week(min) for almost a year now. Out of all of the Thai restaurants in New York (including sea, spice, &amp; land Thai) this is my favorite place for Thai. All of the other restaurants have been hit or miss but Joya has always been extremely consistent. . . I love their Pad see ew &amp; my boyfriend loves the pad Thai. For an appetizer I used to get their calamari. It's great but its way too much &amp; I hate wasting food. A small order can easily feed a group of 4. We now get the tiger shrimp rolls &amp; Thai spare ribs. Which is great. I've never had any problem with service &amp; since their service is normally so attentive I sometimes even tip the water/ bus boy also. . . The restaurant is very nice for dates but I wouldn't recommend it for large groups or children. There isn't much leg/ standing room. I recommend going during the beginning of the week when it's not as crowded. During the end of the week you'll normally experience an hour wait &amp; you'll feel as if you're standing in a packed night club (but it's worth it). I LOVE JOYA! Bill is normally around $30!!! (including to appetizers and 2 entrees!)
