It almost feels redundant to write an awesome review for this place because it seems like everyone had amazing experiences. When I walked through the sliding glass doors MY first time this was mine: seized panic as in "omg, I think I will buy out that bakery case RIGHT now" and "holy sh*** that was a pastry? That was so GOOD".. Ugh...had I not gone to this place I would have gone through life and never known what the "perfect bakery" was.. . With the awesome assistance of one woman Liz (oh Liz, you are the sales lady of the century) who not only showed me what to buy and what they're known for but let me have whole entire FREE samples of everything just to prove to me how good it was, I had a box full of danishes, cookies, potato balls and meat pies which were ALL delicious. I'm sure they do that often, but I do recommend the lost puppy look...might get you more!. . I know this is the longest review known to man, but one more thing to add is the price. It's so cheap/affordable which makes this place even better! I expected to throw down like $25 with all the stuff I made her pack not even asking how much each thing was and it was only $15 for like 22 items.
