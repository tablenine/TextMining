The first time I went to Canoe was for a rehearsal dinner and it was truly lovely.  The restaurant itself is very nice, but the tent they put on their back lawn for the event, against the Chattahoochee River, with white strings of light all around, was breathtaking.  The food was delicious, and since the groom was vegan, they went out of their way to accommodate him by coming up with special foods he could eat, as well as the many vegan guests that were there.  . . This is definitely a restaurant you have to go to at least once, if not many times!  Just the view outside the windows is worth the trip to Vinings!
