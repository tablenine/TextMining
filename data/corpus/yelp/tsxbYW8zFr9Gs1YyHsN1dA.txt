Very disappointing dining experience!  On the plus side, we had a reservation for a Friday evening and were seated immediately but things went downhill from there.  The wine list is overpriced and I was disappointed with my $9.00 per glass Primitivo selection.  The Vegetarian pizza was soggy as if it hadn't been in the over long enough--not what I remembered from previous visits.  The waiter rushed us and practically removed the plates before we finished.  We won't return unless the quality of the pizza improves, per glass wine prices decline, and the service becomes more relaxed.   It's a shame because it used to be a fun place for a casual meal.
