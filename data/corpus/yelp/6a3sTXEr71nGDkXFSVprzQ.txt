I've been here twice.. . Once for breakfast, once for lunch.  Much like alot of people say, this place is definately a "hot spot."  Definately a scene on the two times I've been here.  . . The first time, I came for breakfast/brunch on a Sunday and it was definately croweded.  We were celebrating my friends birthday and by the time I got there everyone was seated, so not sure how bad the wait was.  The parking was a bit hard on a Sunday if you don't valet it though.   I ordered the Berry Wonderful French Toast.  It was verryy good!!!  A decent size too.  Packed with berries and a bit of a sweet sauce.. . The second time I came, Natalie T. and I went for a weekday lunch.  We must have been in a falaffel mood since she ordered the burger and I ordered the wrap.  It was pretty good.  Definately a bigger portion than I thought.  I barely could even finish 1/2 of the wrap.  . . Service was mediocre both occasions. Toast isn't anything too spectacular.  Its a fun place to be if thats what you're wanting and its a great time to sit out and enjoy the warm LA weather with friends.
