Restaurant: Osteria Mozza

Heard this is one of the hottest restaurants at the moment.. . The place is vibrant and noisy, but loved the counter top dining. Â Valet parking is $8 (rip-off), the place is booked 1 month ahead for table for 6 persons (lack of 6 persons tables available- which for restaurant means table for 2 serves quicker and restaurant can turn the table more often for profit ).. . I only remembered most of the dishes are vinegarette-laden and came charred black for pigeon, lamb and other meat dishes we ordered. Also, the pasta came uncooked. A big No-No!. . Service is slow (b/c of full house). We are served the mercy of the staffs.. . When I go to restaurants, I like to be pampered, not to be ignored.
