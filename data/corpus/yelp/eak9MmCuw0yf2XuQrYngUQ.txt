The food is good, but the service is so-so.  I think they might be nicer to regulars (fair enough, I guess).  It's not outright hostile or anything, just on the cold side of indifferent.  Cool, you might say.  Doesn't stop me from going there, so it's not that bad.  Sorry for the wishy washy review - I just feel wishy washy about A Taste of Heaven.
