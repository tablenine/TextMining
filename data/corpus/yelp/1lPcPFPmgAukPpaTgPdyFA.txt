Good: Great food. Bad: Confused service. Nutshell: Top class joint, that needs to step up to stay in the upper echelon.. . I went here for a New Years Eve dinner with several other couples.  I'm afraid our big table of 8 overloaded their staff.. . As other reviews have mentioned..the marinara and cheese spread they bring out at the beginning is amazing.  The rest of our food was good, but kind of a "down hill" from the bread.. . For the place's atmosphere I expected more out of the waitstaff.  They were attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, and had quality recommendations.. . But the trouble came when the food started coming out.  Only about half our appetizers were delivered at first...leading to a long delay before the rest came.  . Someone who seemed to be the front house manager came over and offered a weak apology.. . Now I'm a pretty forgiving person and was willing to overlook it, but. the trouble continued.. . We had ordered the wine pairings with our meals, but several times the wine showed up half way through the course.  Several of our table got white wines when they are ordered the red (had to be corrected by going back to the bar).. . I would understand if it was a rushed meal, or they were short staffed, but it seemed to be neither.  This was 8 p.m.  New Years Eve, a restaurant should be prepared for dinner that night.. . If this was a mid-range Italian, I would have written off the errors, but when I'm paying top dollar, the service NEEDS to match the food.  . . A final note:  One of our group was a vegetarian, and the restaurant had to go off menu for them.  Why not have 1 or 2 veggie options?
