Category: Pizza
The first pie I had here was not what I expected. It was firm, not overly greasy, but it had a red-wine sauce instead of a traditional one- I guess that threw me because I remember thinking "meh". . . Round two was much better. The sauce was a regular, slightly spicy tomato variety. The toppings were ample, the dough well cooked and not too much grease. . . It is a bit expensive compared to other pizza joints.
