I came in last night for a cup of tea before I went out to dinner. I didn't get any of the food, but maybe I will some day. Nice girl at the counter got me my hot water promptly, I put my change in the Uncle Jesse tip jar. Tycho was playing at a good volume and that alone put me in a good mood. Simple review, I just like to hear myself type. Go here.
