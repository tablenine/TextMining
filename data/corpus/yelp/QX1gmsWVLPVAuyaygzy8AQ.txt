I discovered this pizza when two friends were in town visiting and wanted authentic deep dish pizza.  Instead of an estimate on delivery, they tell you the precise time your pizza will arrive.  It may be an hour after you called, but you know they won't be late.  In fact, they're usually about 15 minutes early.. . They really layer the toppings and they go heavy on the veggies, which I love.. . The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is that it's only good while it's smokin' hot (the cheese gets tough as soon as it cools down) and I often feel quite ill after downing two or three slices.. . If you want to get real Chicago deep dish, I believe this is the place to go.  I've never had crust like this, it's fabulous.
