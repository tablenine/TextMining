I thought the food here was fantastic!  Finding good Chinese food around tends to be a bit difficult and I definitely think this place scored big time!. . Aside from the wait that was over an hour, everything was great!  Although it was a Friday night and we did not have a reservation (which I highly recommend), it was beyond unorganized there.  Luckily, I didn't have any place to be and I wanted to try so we waited.  Good thing there's a liquor store right across the street cuz I forgot it was BYOB - perfect location!. . We had the potstickers and crab ragoons, both very tasty.  Then the mongolian beef and pork fried rice - large portions and really very delicious. . . It's in a pretty strange location, almost hard to find, but I would definitely go back!
