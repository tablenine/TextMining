I thought this place was pretty neat. . . I am not much into the hipster LA scene as I work in LA, but don't actually live in LA. I went here for drinks and food after a loooong hard day at work. . . My friends and I found parking pretty easily on a Wednesday early evening, but I could see where later or on the weekend this would get annoying really quick. It was actually also pretty tough to find. . . We stood in a pretty long line, but one of the workers answered questions for us while we waited about different types of beers. I HATE beer so this place was looking super sorry for me, but after talking with him he recommended the cider or the Apple Ale as they both do not taste like a typical "beer." BOY am I glad! The Apple Ale was DELICIOUS!!! . . I also ordered the chicken, mozzarella, and sun dried tomato sausage which was quite yum with sweet peppers-I also sampled all of their mustards! My friend ordered the fries which were quite tasty with the dipping sauces. . . The prices were a bit much-I think my friend and I ordered together (2 sausages and 2 beers) and it came to like $36! but again hipster LA...need I say more? . . Atmosphere pretty sparse, but was the perfect thing we needed after a hard day.
