Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
The first time I was here, I was taking a photography class and saw a bunch of people out the door. I decided to check it out and went inside to take a closer look.. . The place was packed and the food looked great. I discovered that there's a Thai Elvis that sings. In the front of the stage, there's a large Elvis statue (bronze, maybe). Â I did end up with a shot that I used.. . When I returned out of curiosity and tried the food, I found that they had a great lunch special. I have returned with neighbors and on my own by bus just to eat there.. . It's one of my favorite Thai food places to eat. It gets busy on the weekends...Cool place to bring friends and good prices.
