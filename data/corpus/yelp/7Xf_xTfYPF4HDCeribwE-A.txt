I like this place. That pretty much sums up my experience here. My pasta meal was tasty, service was great and prices were reasonable. This seems to be the kind of place that is great when you have a small group of friends who can't decide what they want for dinner because Feast has a little of everything it seems. Went on a Tuesday night with a friend so it wasn't crowded by any means and we were able to have a private conversation without much interruption.. . Interestingly enough, the thing that stood out the most to me on this particular evening was the pomegranate punch martini, soooo good. Part of the dangerous martini collection; the ones that taste so good you don't realize you've had 4. But yeah I stuck to one...it was Tuesday ya know :)
