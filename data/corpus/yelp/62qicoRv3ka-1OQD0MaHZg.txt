Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Dailkokuya serves the BEST ramen in Los Angeles.  Although we're always number 12 to 25 on the wait list, Daikokuya's Daikoku ramen and gzosas are absolutely worth the wait.  To pass the time, while waiting in line, we usually grab a drink at the Far Bar, located a few doors down (south), in what looks to be an alley or courtyard.  After we've had a drink, we make our way back to the restaurant and our table is ready.  As we are seated, I notice their unique Japanese music, which transports me to the 'It's a Small World' ride at Disneyland, and like the ride, I have a very pleasant and enjoyable experience.  At Daikokuya, you will consistently receive very friendly and quick service.  I've been here countless times and their ramen continues to be soothing and comforting.  Not too heavy, not too light - just right.
