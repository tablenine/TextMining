People aren't kidding about the lobster. I have to say, the lobster here is one of the best I've had anywhere in dare I say it, the world. The sauce is more spicy and flavorful than most Chinese style lobster. They are enormous too, we asked for the smallest one and it was still about 4.5lbs.. . Also ordered the French style filet mignon shaken beef (bo luc lac). Those were excellent as well. Very tasty.. . Added some snow pea leaves for veggies and Tsingtao for liquid refreshment. Turned into a self-induced gorging.. . Parking can be pretty bad, and the place is fairly small. Go late or go early and you won't have to wait.
