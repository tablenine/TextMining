Delicious. I never really loved crepes, but now I am craving these crepes. You can choose sweet ones or ones with cheese and various meats. I had the Roma with the lamb sausage and I am sitting here really wishing they delivered to the Loop. The vegetarian selection is also excellent. This is a great place for a group of friends who all have different tastes. I would also consider ordering catering from them too.
