Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Just goes to show that azns can do and make anything, and better at that. A tightly edited Cajun style menu of crab, lobster, shrimp, crawfish, and fish...choice of boiled or breaded and fried. I just go with the "whole shebang" seasoning, which is a bit of everything (lemon, garlic, something else I can't remember). Seasoned fries, and my personal favorite, sweet potato fries. The wait can be painful at times, especially if you're hungry. But the crew works quick here, and as long as patrons don't lollygag forever, you should be okay. My friend and I ordered more than we could eat last night and split a very modest 35 dollar bill.. . Not exactly recommended for large parties (I'd say 6 max). Also, apparently the best times to go to busy restaurants are rainy days.
