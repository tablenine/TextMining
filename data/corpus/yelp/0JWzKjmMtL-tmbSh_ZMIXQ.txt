I LOVE this place!  The Latin inspired food is so tasty!  I always have to order my two favorite tapas the tilapia tica ceviche and the papitas criollas along with a glass of their red wind sangria which is one of the best I have tasted in Atlanta.   The service at Pura Vida is always excellent! They are very friendly and  know the menu well.  This place is great for a couple or a group of people.
