i am definitely a fan. korean and mexican foods are my two favorite foods. combine them TOGETHER? omgs... * angels singing * haha. my friend and i went and tried the whole gamut of tacos: the spicy pork, the bbq chicken, and the short ribs. the spicy port and bbq chicken were DELLLIIIISH... but next time i will try without the lime... the short ribs... i was expecting more of a bulgogi taste... but oh well. um... the kimchi quesedilla was cheese + kimchi... i dunno about that. but it was interesting!... . ...i think what made this even better was the adventure/experience itself! a korean taco truck! just the moniker is an experience in itself. haha. only in LA right, as my buddy would say? i'll definitely track this truck down again the next time i'm in LA.
