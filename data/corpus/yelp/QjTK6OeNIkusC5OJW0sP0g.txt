WOW!!!! . . I'm from Hawai'i and this is my first time eating chicken and waffles. At first I was quite apprehensive about the combination itself.... fried chicken, waffles and maple syrup??? My taste buds found it difficult to comprehend the combination. But alas!!! It was absolutely wonderful! The southern fried chicken was perfectly crispy (not soppy with oil like KFC), their gravy with onions was to die for!!!, and their waffles... it was a better version of Eggo Waffles, but of course homemade! Â Everything just hit the spot! . . It was only a few min walk from our hotel (we stayed at the W on Hollywood) and went around noon. The wait is about an 1 hr, but it was well worth it. Though they did specialize in chicken and waffles, their combination plates were also quite yummy with greens, corn bread, mac &amp; cheese, and of course their famous fried chicken! . . I can't wait to go back again! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water..... yummy =)
