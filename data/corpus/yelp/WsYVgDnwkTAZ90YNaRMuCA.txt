Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Well, as most everyone had said, this place is great! The bowl is huge and you get plenty for what you pay. It was my first time at Orochon but not my first time having Ramen. Compared to Ramen shops in San Diego, This place deserves 5 stars.. . Not really a negative for me but more like a pet peeve but I found the tables to be too close but since it's a fairly small place, i'll let this one slide. . . Now onto my first experience, I went there the other day for my first time and ordered the special #2 Miso. I wasn't planning to take the challenge and have my pic planted on the walls but I just thought I should go ahead and try anyways just to prove to myself and friends that it can be done. When I first received my bowl, I took my spoon and tasted the broth. I was beginning to have regrets. Now i'm Thai/Lao so i'm used to the spiciest of dishes so at first it was tolerable but when you got 30 minutes shoving dynamite in your mouth, you can only take so much! I was down to 5 minutes and had finished all the noodles and peppers. I could have just gulped the bowl but I had plans afterward and didn't want to risk getting my shirt soaked. I'm pretty glad as well because after we paid and left, as I was jumping down the stairs, i guess the soup stirred in my tummy and it started to hurt really bad. Not the kinda pain where one needs to use the restroom, it was like someone was punching my tummy repeatedly!!! and that pain lasted for 2 hours! Stupidly enough, I drank a coke hoping it'd help but somehow it made it worse! haha. . My friend is white and isn't used to spicy foods but he also ordered special #2 He took 5 spoons and gave up. What a waste! . . This goes to show you what you should expect if you're going to try the Special#2 challenge. It's no joke! It's not impossible though.. . I'll definitely come back and order the special number 2 but this time, I wont try to beat the clock. I'd rather take it slow and savor the awesomeness.. . ++++++++++++++++++++There are some hot babes working there
