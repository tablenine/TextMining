Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I have been going to The Apple Pan since as far back as I can remember. I think the same holds true for my parents generation and grandparents generation (not that either in my family are from Los Angeles).. . Simply put, this is a special place. I'm almost offended when I see people comparing it to In-N-Out. And yes, I like In-N-Out.. . The Apple Pan is an LA institution. The place has looked the same my entire life... There is only counter seating, there is grandmother-type wallpaper, and the cash register is 500 years old (well, basically).. . The employees here have been there forever. I recognize the day workers and the night workers. They are ALWAYS the same people.. . The burgers are absolutely delicious and totally unique. They are very filling, much more-so that most other burgers. They have a unique apple-based sauce. The fries are great, and for some reason the Coke just tastes better out of the little paper cone that they serve it to you in. The Tuna Sandwich is very good, and so I hear... the Egg Salad Sandwich is also very good. Not to mention, you must try the Apple Pie.. . This is the type of place where you get regulars like me who have been coming in again and again for their entire lives. You will see that many patrons will know the guys behind the counter on a first name basis and visa versa.. . Nothing but 5-stars from me... I really want to go there for dinner right now.... . And yes, expect a wait... at all hours of the day or night.
