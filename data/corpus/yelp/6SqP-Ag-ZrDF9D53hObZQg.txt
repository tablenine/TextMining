This would be five stars, if not for the long lines.  But the long lines are just a testament to how good this place is.  I can eat the potato balls 3 meals a day, 7 days a week.  The wait is worth it just for the potato balls themselves.. . Since Porto's is in Burbank, I think it might be lucrative to buy a bunch of potato balls, fly up to Oakland or SFO from Burbank, BART into San Francisco and start selling potato balls on the corner of Beale and Market.  You'll still make a profit after factoring in transit costs.  They are that good.
