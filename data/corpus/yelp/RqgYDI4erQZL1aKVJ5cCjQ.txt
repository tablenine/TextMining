I went here with my girlfriend, mom and sister and had a lackluster experience.. . We arrived early and got seats at the back bar to get a drink and wait for our table.  The service here was actually very nice and friendly.  The bartender helped my Mom pick a wine which, unfortunately, she didn't enjoy.  He was quick to offer up a new glass of another wine, on the house, and apologized for not meeting her tastes. . . After leaving the bar, the experience quickly went downhill.  After navigating our way through a cramped and noisy dining room, we were seated near a table of roughly 20 people who were quite loud.  Some sort of lamentation could be heard to fade away as the employee seating us was entirely too busy to listen to us and immediately spun on her heals back toward the door and other waiting patrons.  . . Our server seemed nice on her first visit to the table, but seemed to become more rude and disinterested with each and every infrequent stop at our table.  She never inquired to see if we enjoyed our food or if we needed anything else.  It also appeared as if she was TRYING to ignore us from time to time.  It was honestly some of the worst service I've ever had in this fair city.  . . I enjoyed my food, and I think my girlfriend did as well, but I know my Mom's steak was cold and my sister was mostly uninspired.  It was a poor decision for us to go here, but luckily, I am able to learn from my mistakes and won't make this one again.  It may have just been a rough sequence of events that led to me not enjoying my time, but it was enough to keep me from coming back.
