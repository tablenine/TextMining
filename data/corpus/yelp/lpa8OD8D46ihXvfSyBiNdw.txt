Fries = Great. Beer Selection = Even Better. Sausages = Best. . The perfect hangover cure...or....the perfect place to cause your hangover.. . This place gets so busy but it is worth the wait in line. Another place that I feel like I've eaten a majority of what's on the menu and been here almost every weekend that I've lived downtown. Every time someone asks me to meet them here I say "yes." . . Take your mother, take your brother, take your vegetarian sister who hates life (bc they have veggie sausages too) . . Order the fries WITH truffle oil...worth it. And if you go, call me! I will come too!
