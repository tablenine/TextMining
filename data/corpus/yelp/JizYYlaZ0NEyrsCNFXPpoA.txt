One summer, I smelled like chicken . . . . . My first waitress job was at Tanner's Chicken Rotisserie, Roaster's precursor (same owner/s). And the things that were good about Tanner's are better at Roaster's!. . My picks:. . Great chicken fingers. Very great salads - lots of greens (and not just "white" iceberg, a peeve of mine) - with grilled or fried chicken. Good mac and cheese as a side. The creamed spinach as well as the healthier veggies are good too. If you like cornbread, you'll like theirs.. . Super place for take-out, if you're in Buckhead (as others have mentioned, the parking lot is easily filled) and easier to eat-in if you go to the Smyrna location.. . This is also a good place to pick up lunch for an in-office meeting as they are very good about large orders, etc.. . I don't smell like chicken these days, but when I want a trip down memory lane, Roaster's is my pick!!
