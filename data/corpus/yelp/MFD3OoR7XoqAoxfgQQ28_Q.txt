Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
All I have to say is FANTASTIC. Three of us went. We had the burrata caprese salad to start. I was in heaven. Each of us had a pizza and those did not disappoint. Village pizzeria on Larchmont is my favorite pizza place, but Pizzeria Mozza is now right up there. The flaky crust - AMAZING. Other than that, the service was wonderful and we sat at the bar Â - so entertaining to watch the cooks make the appetizers and pizza. I already know what I want to try next time I go. I highly recommend it!
