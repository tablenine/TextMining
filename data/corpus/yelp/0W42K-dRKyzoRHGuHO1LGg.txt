It was a toss up today.. between trying the BBQ place or the sandwich place.  With the pressure on... I went with the closer of the 2.  . . IThe sandwich was really really good.  Super juicy.  And the bread was decent.  I thought it was a little fatty though, im actually still feeling it 4 hours later as being a bad choice.  And it was a ripoff.  It was $20 for a sandwich, fries, and a drink.    The sandwich was a 4.  The fries were a 2, bland, boring steak fries.  And the diet coke was broken or something.  It had wayyy too much sryup in it.  I know this is finicky, but just putting it out there.  . . I was glad to have discovered that it is open till 2:30am (3:30 Thursday-Satruday).  I can see this being a 5-star place at that hour.  We'll have to see...
