Great Food.  Great drinks.  Good to Great Service.  I'm SOLD!. . Came here twice in one weekend.  The chicken tortilla soup is delish.  The happy hour is great to save money.  You can fill up on half priced appetizers and $5.75 martinis!. . I do NOT reccommend coming here on game days unless you get there super early.  You will be waiting forever.. . I reccommend the Peach Martini &amp; the Pomegranate Margarita.
