I went here for my last night in NYC with my cousins and friends before I moved to LA. Â In my opinion, they have the best sushi in all of NYC. We had so many dishes...lobster, artichoke and fuji apple salad, tempura, seared tuna, kobe beef...all soooo amazing. The drinks were also some of the best...I especially loved the Litchee martini and Litchee shots! Great scene with a lot of hip and beautiful people.
