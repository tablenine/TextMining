5 minutes to be seated during a calm day + 10 minutes to get our order taken + 30 minutes to get our first order (coffee) + 30 minutes to receive cold food = a restaurant fail.. . When we received our cold food we brought up the issue with the staff who was indifferent at best to their own poor service. They offered nothing in return for waiting nearly an hour and a half for an ice cold breakfast. . . In all fairness, the service could be one person's fault but the staff's "so what" response proved a wider incompetency.
