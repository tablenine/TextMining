Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I never believed in my life that chicken and waffles would ever go together. But seriously, they do. I LOVE their waffles. And I LOVE their chicken. And I LOVE them together. My tummy gets full quick so I usually get a small meal, like the Carol C. Special (1 SUCCULENT breast and 1 DELICIOUS waffle). . . When I have came here, I only waited the most for 10 minutes. The waiters are really nice and attentive. Also, try one of their mixed drinks. They are quite intriguing to the eye. I usually get the Sunset drink. Also, my friend went here once and met Shane Sparks (one of the judges on MTV's America's Best Dance Crew). So if you come here, you'll get good food and perhaps a celebrity siting!
