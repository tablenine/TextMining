Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Good food, good service, but ridiculously expensive. Â . . The love: . - steamed mussels. - truffle gouda -- probably my favorite cheese in the world right now.. - oysters...! I love raw oysters.. - the braised short ribs sandwich was delicious. . . The dislike: the prices... I love to play pretend like I'm a rich, classy and sophisticated woman but damn, this is way too expensive for me! (What can I say? I'm trying to be frugal here!).. . I don't remember which of the champagnes/wines I drank though... Needless to say, I drank quite a bit and got kind of tipsy with the amazing company I had. But you know, I actually dislike champagne... I only came here for the company I was with. Would I come here for food? Don't get me wrong, it's delicious BUT (yes, it's a big one), no it's way out of my price range.
