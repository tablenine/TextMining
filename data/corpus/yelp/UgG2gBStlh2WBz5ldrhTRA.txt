I had the regular #2, which was just fine....not too bad at all. I think I can make it to the Special #1. The noodles taste very flavorful. I thought it would just be fire....but the soup and noodles actually had flavor. I think the big thing behind the challenge isn't the spice but the amount of food. The noodle portion is good but to drink all the soup? Its a big bowl!. I would definitely go back again for the ramen....yum!
