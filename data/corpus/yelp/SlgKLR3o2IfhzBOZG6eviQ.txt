Yumm!!!  We live in walking distance and went there for the first time last week - I have no idea what took us so long.  We've already been back.  Both times we went for breakfast &amp; we loved it.  BF likes it so much he wrote a love letter on their comment card.  The service was friendly, the food was fresh &amp; delicious &amp; the soy lattes are perfect &amp; so lovely...  It's the little things...  First time I had the Old World &amp; BF had the Migas - fabulous.  The second time I had the Muscle Beach &amp; BF had Hangover Burrito.  All fantastic.   I'm going back Tuesday morning for a business breakfast &amp; I can't wait.
