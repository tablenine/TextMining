Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
So is this place Brazilian/Italian fusion? Because there is a lot of Italian dishes on the menu. Is that what they are eating in Rio de Janeiro? . . Anyways.. . I ordered an appetizer of Chicken Brochette which is fried chicken wrapped in bacon laying in a bed of gorgonzola sauce. Cute little toasts were sitting on the rim of the plate. Cute and good. The "courtesy" Â bread that they sit on the table was gross. It was cold, not fresh, and wasn't accompanied by any butter, dip, or sauce...eeewww!. It was better after I dipped it into my gorgonzola sauce. . . I'm not a fan of patio furniture indoors, so it's not the kind of spot where you can relax in your seat for long. Well, after the glass of Pinot Grigio I ordered, maybe I could've let the good times roll, but the others in my party didn't want to "set it off", so we basically had dinner, some hilarious conversation, and cut out. . . Maybe I'll come back with my ace crew and we can see how long we can party until those hard ass patio chairs make our butts hurt. Okay, Okay...I'm over the garden chairs already. . . Since Bossa Nova is open till 4am, maybe I will designate it my "after party spot...you know we all need somewhere to go after last call. Did I mention I freakin' hate last call? . :)
