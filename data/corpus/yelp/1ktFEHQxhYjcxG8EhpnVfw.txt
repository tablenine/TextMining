Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
So I've decided to write about all the places that either have been truly outstanding or ones that I would never step in again (in case we post a recognizable photo)...regardless of when the last time I was there.  Sushi Gen is your no-frills sushi bar/restaurant....and I miss this place sorely.  And having read some of the reviews, it seems that they have not skipped a beat.  FRESH, FRESH, FRESH.  (Although I still never got why they serve that piece of cooked fish...could it have been yesterday's special?)  I faithfully ate at this place as often as I could with my coworkers starting about 9 years ago (oops.  I just aged myself.  Anyway, who can pass up a super fresh sashimi lunch, when you're only making beans, counting beans...I love you, my old TCW buddies, our long lunches...oh, those were the days...sigh).   Then it all came to an abrupt stop about 3 years ago, not b/c I changed jobs or stopped working in downtown....but b/c #1 came along, and when I tried to go after #1 was born, I was denied twice  b/c they were closed for lunch for remodeling?!  (so this place better look drastically different)  Then #2 came along, and...yes, now it's been 3 long agonizing years of separation.  It doesn't help when the Husband gloats when he eats lunch here.  Anyway, I was debating whether I wanted to write about this little gem of a restaurant and have my little secret plastered for the world wide web to see...b/c it seems that more often than not, when I ask people about this place, it seems they have not heard of it.  But shoot...80+ reviews already?! this secret has been blown wide open...in fact, half of you folks who have written reviews already, I'll probably see in line if I ever make it out there again....so I hope to see you real soon!
