Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Pho Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat ever!!. Everyone is talking about the pho, but its all about the bun!!!. #16 with an iced coffee is the way to go!. Cheap for LA and so light &amp; refreshing!. I like the bright lights, contrary to what everyone else says! Its not a nightclub, its a place to see your food as you eat!. Yummmmmmm!
