Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
OK. Portions are enormous, lines are always long, and I just don't get a very cleanly feel from this restaurant...there are definitely other places I would suggest before Griddle. If you're going to wait in a line, try BLD, Kings Road Cafe or venture over to Gjelina in Venice on the weekend for brunch.
