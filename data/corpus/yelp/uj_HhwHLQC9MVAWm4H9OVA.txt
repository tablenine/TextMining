Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Great KBBQ spot.  Not one of the many AYCE spots that are popping up around K-town these days, but still a pretty decent spot.  . . They're very generous with their side dishes, and very friendly.  Friendly isn't always the easiest to find amongst jaded waitresses who are used to people getting drunk and rude.  . . The food, was pretty good.  A little bit too much on the sweeter side with a lot of the dishes, but it's made up for by the great service.  Interesting that they actually use the charcoal on the grills.  As much of a carnivore as I am, I don't necessarily taste a difference with meat cooked over charcoal.  . . Oh, and for those who might be afraid of venturing into a Korean restaurant without a Korean friend to help you out, the servers here looked very patient and helpful in the tables around us.
