Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Yes, yes i did succum to the hype and had to try Roscoe's chicken and waffles.  Honestly the combination sounded weird and kind of gross when i first heard it, but i was proven wrong!  Being from the bay area, i dont get to enjoy the Roscoe's experience often, but when I do visit LA, i always make it a point to go!. . I always get the breast meat + waffle (forgot the name but i think it's #12 on the menu... hehe) and both times i've been here i've cleaned the plate.  I dont know if its because i always come here hungry or if their fried chicken and buttery waffles are really that good!. . oh, and i never... and i mean NEVER... eat the skin off my chicken, fried or otherwise.  but at roscoe's i gobble it up!  if you are in the LA area, i'd definately suggest you try it once!
