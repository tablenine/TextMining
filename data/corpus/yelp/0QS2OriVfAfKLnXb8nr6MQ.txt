This place is bigger than I thought! I only went here to pick up some bakery goods due to the request of my mother. She loves the cheese rolls, as do I. Seeing as to yesterday was Valentine's day there were a million people waiting in line for treats, and I'm sure this place is pretty much crowded on any normal day. I was surprised I didn't spend more money, about 8$ for a box of a dozen yummy goods. My only thing is that I didn't like the mango empanada, I guess a regular empanada is a better bet.
