Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
We had lunch at Pizzeria Mozza today. I called at 10:15 am and could reserve a table for 12:15. Maybe I just got lucky.. . We ordered the classic a pizza margherita, which was thin with a good crust, simply delicious. In addition we ordered the daily special: Veal breast stracotto, which came with a side of polenta. Mhmmm - The veal was slowly cooked in a nice sauce, with some nice fatty pieces. And the polenta was done just right.. . The restaurant is small and the tables close together. This has the advantage, that you can see what other people eat, and plan what to eat next time - yeah there will be a next time. . . Pizzeria Mozza is just good italian food, for a price that is comparable to other italian restaurants.. . I did not know that Â Mario Batali is one the owners, I only realized when I saw a picture on the valet parking stand when I left the restaurant. I thought he plays a guy who likes Italian food - but know I know that he really knows Italian food!
