What can be said that hasn't already been about this place!. . It's a treasure trove in Brooklyn, serving some of the best, cheapest breakfast you can get. EVERYTHING on this menu is good...and I'd know, I've had most of it already. The pancakes are great (especially with the different butters), the hash is great, the corned beef is great, the omelettes are great, the sausage is great...seriously, nothing here is bad!. . What's more than the food (what, more important than food!! - ok maybe not "more", but "in addition") is the spirit of the place. Â Tom and his staff make you feel as though you were curled up in your home's breakfast nook...which is a feat considering this place is small and packed! Whether it's the bites of food and coffee served while waiting in line, the speedy service, the attention to details and wanting to ensure every customer is happy, or yes even the great food - this place is a breakfast mecca.. . Cash only. Deal with it :)
