Love, love, love Stanley's Sunday brunch.  All the comfort food is great - mashed potatoes, fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, mac and cheese.  They also have fruit, muffins, waffles, made to order omlettes...etc.  I've been there once late on a Friday night and they serve free mashed potatoes at midnight!  The service may be a little slow but it's usually crowded and they're all still friendly and responsive.
