went here this past thurs to take advantage of the prix fixe dinner and i'm soo glad i did. we started out sitting outside but then the storm rolled in so they quickly moved inside and we were seated. Â though it was really busy they did a really good job with moving people in and getting people seated though the place is a little small. . the hostess was so nice and our waiter was really helpful with making suggestions about food and wine. you get to pick from the whole menu, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert for 21.95...oh my! i had the chicken with potatoes, bruschetta, and the profiteroles...my friends chose other things so we all shared and everything was completely delish...the housemade sausage was great and i loved the tiramisu....if you're looking for some good food and want to go to a cute little place and not a chain then make sure to add this one to your bookmarks!
