Restaurant: Co&#39;m Vietnamese Grill
Category: Vietnamese
Went here on a weekend with some friends so it took a while for us to get seated and started. Dinner itself was a pleasant affair, the food is definitely tops and from what I understand one of the best places in Atlanta for ethnic quality Viet food.
