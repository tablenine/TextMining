If you are at Water Tower Place, I recommend that you must stop by to give it a try.  Variety of Bow are all quite tasty.  I like the veggie one and my husband the Thai Chicken Curry.. The salad is good too.  I also like the ginger Ale which is really ginger!. The reasonably priced, tasty, quick, easy..... What else can you ask for?
