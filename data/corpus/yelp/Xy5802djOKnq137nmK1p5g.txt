Restaurant: La Fonda Latina
Category: Latin American
I've had the unfortunate experience of eating at La Fonda three times. Each time it's worse than the last. If the second and third times weren't for friends' birthday dinners, I never would have gone back. . . They have very few vegetarian options. Chips were waaaaay too salty. Salsa was definitely out of a jar. Service was horrendous all three times (and 2 different locations- candler park and ponce). The most recent visit took about an hour longer than it should have because our service was so painfully slow. . . All of the chairs are a horrible light aluminum that makes your butt feel like it's being pressed against a waffle iron. If you must eat here, do yourself a favor and bring a pillow to sit on.
