I've been here twice.  It's a great concept, fast-food casual but well cooked, quality food.  And alcohol.  I went there with a group, we brought two bottles of wine, and the staff opened them for us and brought plenty o' plastic cups.. . I have a bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over again, so I've only had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, which is ridiculous.  As much as I know about BBQ (very little), this is actually Carolina-style BBQ, not a sweet thick smokey sauce, but rather a thinner, more tangy sauce.  Not cloying.  Add to that caramalized onions.  And a red cabbage slaw which makes minimal use of mayo.  Awesome.
