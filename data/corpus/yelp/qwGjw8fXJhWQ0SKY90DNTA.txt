Pretty good experience overall.  Food isn't great, but it's not terrible.  Though, if you're coming for the food, you're not getting your money's worth.  However, the view is great and the little trail/garden outside added a nice touch.  Inside, the decoration was just whatever.  And from where I was sitting in the restaraunt, I had no view.  All I could see was the parking lot.  Don't come here if you don't have money to waste.  Parking is valet only, and our bill came out to $250.  Lol.  Ouch.  But great for a date.  (:
