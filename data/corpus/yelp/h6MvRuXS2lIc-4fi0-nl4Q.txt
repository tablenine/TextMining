The happy hour special can't be beat. Half price rolls 5-7pm Sun-Wed. The rolls are huge and are like heaven in your mouth. I'm a sushi fanatic and this is definitely one of my all time favorite places. The place is small, but it's BYOB. Make sure to try the honey roll, crab rangoon roll, and red dragon.
