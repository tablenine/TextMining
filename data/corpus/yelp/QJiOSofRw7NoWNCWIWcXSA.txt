Dear LA,. . Thank you for having one awesome dim sum spot.  I can't believe it is all the way out in Arcadia.  Get your act together and figure out how they do it and get involved with a fresh dim sum option like this one.  . . The juicy pork and crab (soup) dumplings were pretty awesome.  Served in groups of 10 were perfect to split with my fiance.  The fresh pork buns were enormous and perfectly cooked.  The pork and fried bean curd soup with glass noodles was a bit bland, but the hot peppers we added made the dish jump with flavor.  The appetizer that came out after all the other items were delivered was really refreshing.  A mixture of tofu, shitake mushrooms and glass noodles combined with some dressing was a nice contrast.. . Thanks to Din Tai Fung, I have a new appreciation for Dim Sum in LA.  . . See you again soon.
