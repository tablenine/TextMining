Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Fred 62 is gourmet diner food.  . . I used to come here all the time when I had many late nights.  I'd get the munchies and come here for their desserts!  Punk tart with ice cream on top is very sweet, but good (as long as they heat it up.  once they served it non-heated and it wasn't as good).  The red velvet cake is really good too, but sometimes they run out.... . I like their pancakes and hamburgers, and LOVE the onion rings!. . This place is owned by the same person who owns Airstream diner I believe, which is another "gourmet diner".  So the food is similar in taste although the menu is different.. . I only warn those who come after 2am, because the freaks come out.. One night there was a drunk perv sitting next to my booth, and on one of the stools was a caucasion man with his face painted black.   . If that wasn't strange enough, as I was leaving, there was an Asian guy outside the door free-styling to his imaginary audience like he was Eminem in 8 Mile.
