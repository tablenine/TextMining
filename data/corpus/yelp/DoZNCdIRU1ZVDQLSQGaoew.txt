For the neighborhood, awesome I have to say.  Not much around for cheap food - well, thats not indian in the area.  . . As for the food, I liked how the bread was very fresh - and a little shiny too. I have to say I did enjoy this place.  I will be honest though in saying I would go down to Broome Street to Saigon Banh Mi before this spot without a doubt.  But for Murray Hill this place does it for me.   Oh, and it is a little more expensive than other spots, but not significantly.  i think it was spicier, too.  I got the pork.  good portions of pork.  evenly distributed with the rest of the ingredients.
