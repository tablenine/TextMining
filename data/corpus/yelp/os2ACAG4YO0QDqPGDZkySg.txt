4* means definitely must come again!. . The chicken rice is well-portioned and tasty. Chicken is tender and juicy, and the ginger and hot sauce are a plus,  best enjoyed when mixed together with the dish much like you would a bibimbap. The only downside is the rice doesnt have the fragrant chicken broth taste like an authentic Hainan Chicken Rice from Singapore would. Definitely a must-try but if you're expecting a Singaporean hawker center quality chicken rice, you would be disappointed.. . Parking is off the street and a premium. Usually you'd either wait around or park 2 blocks away in the neighborhood streets. What's also funny is EVERYTIME I go there I never fail to run into a group of Indonesian kids...  They must all  be fans of this place.. . Indoor seating is near to impossible wih only about 10 - 15 seats available, so bring a jacket and a bundle of warm company if you go there on a winter night.
