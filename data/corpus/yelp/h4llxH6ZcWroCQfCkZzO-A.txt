Something about fried chicken and waffles together is just completely right.. . I ordered just the simple fried chicken leg and waffle.  No sides.  Just the chicken and waffle.. . And it was yummmmm!  Soooo good.  The best waffle I ever tasted.  Accompanied by some bomb diggity fried chicken.. . The only complaint I had was the hostess.  She has MAJOR attitude.  There was 6 of us, so they had to find a table big enough for us.  She acted as though it was so hard to do that.  Once our table was ready, she was pretty much shouting at us to follow her (and there wasn't anyone in front of behind us in line!).  . . While we were eating, we saw Charles Robinson (Mac from Night Court) and he was kind enough to come to our table to say hello and smile.  Pretty cool. =). . Our waitress was great.  No complaints.. . Street/metered parking outside.  . . I'll definitely come back for more!
