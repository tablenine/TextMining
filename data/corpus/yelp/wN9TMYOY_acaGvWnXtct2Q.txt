Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
Officially my number one favorite Italian restaurang in LA now.. The only downside to Osteria Mozza is the fact that you have to plan ahead and make reservation at least 2 weeks out to get decent table. Extensive menu for the mozarella bar - who does not like soft, fresh buratta/mozarella cheese. The classic caprese is the best, but there are others like buratta with bacon and kale that is also delicious! Other winning dishes include orechiete pasta with sausage and the raviolo with soft egg and brown butter/sage sauce. The main courses that my family ordered were almost all excellent: Brasato (beef short ribs) amazingly tender served over perfectly cooked polenta, monk fish with spicy tomato sauce, and the quail with bacon. The only think I was not a big fan of was the pork chop, a bit dry.
