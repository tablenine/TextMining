When students need a break from the books at the University of Chicago, "The Med" is the local choice for having a great time. Everything is made from scratch, including the famous "garbage pizza" and the juicy half-pound Angus burgers, all for about $8. The graffiti-covered booths allow for a hip and trendy dining experience.
