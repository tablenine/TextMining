Wow. I just saw that my friend who I didn't even know was on Yelp just wrote pretty much everything I had to say. Thanks Jill!. . So yeah... Bari. Go in here, walk to the back, and order a sub. Any sub. The tuna? Homeade and like no tuna salad ever. The Italian? It's like the archetype of what all Italian subs want to be. But my favorite? The meatball sub with red sauce and mozz with peppers. To goddamned die for! I have never, ever had a meatball this well cooked and seasoned before, or since. And the clincher is the phefuckinominal bread they use for their subs, which comes directly from D'Amato's bakery next door every day. So f-f-fresh.. . Also, if you are buying your cooking oils, gourmet olives and such, and giardanera from anywhere else, you are a complete idiot. Except not really.. . Sorry about that idiot comment.
