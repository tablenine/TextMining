Great place to go when you're over waiting for Flying Biscuit, although we did wait around 20 minutes for a seat.  The place is pretty small.  My only beef is the limited menu.  The sweet potato pancakes are great.  The tex-mex omelets are just ok.  The minimum credit card charge ($10) isn't a deal-breaker in this plastic world.
