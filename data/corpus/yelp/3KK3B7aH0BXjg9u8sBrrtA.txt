Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the price. . . For 10 bucks, I expect a burger that rivals The Counter or Father's Office. . . I think they need to up the portion or drop the price. . . Other than that, this place is awesome. Such a savory burger. I could seriously eat 3 in one sitting.. . The Mexican Cola-Cola is a nice touch! . . I've tried the Truffle Burger which is amazing... but hands down the Umami Burger is the one to beat.
