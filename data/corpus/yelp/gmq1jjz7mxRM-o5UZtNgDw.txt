Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
i could eat here every single day. i would be 700 lbs and broke, but i'd thoroughly enjoy myself. heehee.... . i've never had a bad meal here. one of my fav salads. lawry's or california cut depending on my appetite, cooked rare/medium rare, no mashed potatoes (waste of space), side of creamed corn and that's about it. i am always happy with that meal.. . definitely make reservations. out of the numerous times i've been here over the past several years, only once have we had to wait for 20-30 minutes past our reservation time.. . as for decor/ambiance, it's not extremely romantic or intimate if that's what you're looking for. we go for the food and that's about it.. . service is usually very good. no complaints there.. . join the VIP rewards club if you plan on going back. it's totally worth it!. . i'm almost drooling thinking about the creamed corn and prime rib. sigh.
