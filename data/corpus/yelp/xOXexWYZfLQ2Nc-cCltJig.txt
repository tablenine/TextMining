Since writing this review, I have gone back to Feast at least 6 times. I still have the same opinion and I still recommend it. I see some comments about the staff, but, beside couple of the hostesses having no personality, I have no complaint. There is one waiter M. and he is just great!!  Long wait for the food? I am truly surprised as, no matter how busy they are, we never had any problems.  Prices are fair. The wine selection is inclusive of some very good, yet cheap, wine bottles. . Life is good at Feast! (well, it is for me!)
