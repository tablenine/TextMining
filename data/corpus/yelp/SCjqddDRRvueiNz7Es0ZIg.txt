Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
This will probably be one of my briefest reviews as I just don't have much to say about this mediocre place. I just don't understand the hype about this place. It seems to me that a lot of people around here list this place as their favorite deep dish pizza, but I just don't love it. Maybe the fact that I'm from the east coast means I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to deep dish, but it's not that I don't like it - I just don't like Lou Malnati's pizza. I felt like there was way too much tomato sauce in the pizza and not enough of everything else. The crust was meh, and the wait was at LEAST an hour. I was told this place was amazing, though, so I figured the wait was worth it. I was sorely disappointed. The pizza wasn't inedible, but it wasn't great, the service was mediocre, and we had to wait a long, long time for our food even though we ordered it before we were even seated. Never going back here!
