I only order the corn chowder soup, and the cup size was enough for me. The soup was kept warm the entire time, and it was very good.. I would go back just to try other dishes.. The one thing that I liked the most was the fact that it wasn't just a restaurant, it was also a coffee shop... you could feel very homie and comfy there.
