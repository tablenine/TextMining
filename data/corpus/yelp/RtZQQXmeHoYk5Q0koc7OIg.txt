food, service, quality, all great.  Their bloody mary is amazing.  Delicious!  Brunch is perfect, not overpriced...if you want huge portions, go to Dennys.  Everything from their sausage, creme brule french toast, eggs bene, all solid.  Their dinner service is amazing, threw a bday dinner for my friend, they were so accommodating, from the reservations to the special order dessert.  There are not many places where they will bend to your needs.
