Category: Tapas Bars
Hmm.. Where to start? Having tapas is a pretty cruel experience for me... I like food. I eat it a lot. I eat in disgusting abundance... I like the idea of having small plates to order plenty and sample pretty much everything, but the problem is that it doesn't get this ninja fed!! Ok, on to the review.... . We went in a pretty large party, and from what I remember, they didn't take reservations. Eh, bummer... The restaurant itself is pretty small... They might as well just get rid of the existing furniture and replace it with long picnic tables a la Shakeys since you're literally THISCLOSETOTHENEXTPARTY... I for one, like to have my elbow space, but that's just me. The food was good, but nothing that stood out. The potatoes were delish and the bacon wrapped dates were sweet. This place is BYOB so I'm free to get lit off of all the Trader Joe's 2 buck chuck all I want and the waitress can't cut me off! Woohoo!
