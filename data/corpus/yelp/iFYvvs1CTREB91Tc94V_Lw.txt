Yep, believe the hype.  I waited in line for 30 minutes and would gladly do it again.  My friend had been there before and and said to order 3 sausages so that's what I did.  Bratwurst, Louisiana Hot Link, and Duck Bacon Jalapeno.  All were very very good sausage with no weird aftertaste like you sometimes find with sausages.  . . The Beligian fried are ridiculous as is their selection of dipping sauces and beers to wash it all down.
