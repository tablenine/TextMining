Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I really like Tank. After all my years in the city I think it's my favorite sushi! The enclosed tables in the back are super cool if you're special enough to sit there. Personally, I love just to eat at the bar.. . The fish is very fresh and sometimes they have sashimi specials if you ask the kitchen! Once I had baby flounder that was like butter. The small plates and apps are also delicious, and the fried oysters have always arrived perfectly cooked. Obviously the maki are excellent, although I believe they took my favorite off the menu. I think it was called Green Island, the one with edamame garnish. I miss it so!. . The atmosphere is just fine, although sometimes my table feels a little crowded, like I'm rubbing elbows with my neighbor. But that's just fine, I rather they shove this place full of covers if it means no wait on a Friday.
