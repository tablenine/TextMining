Ate lunch here the other day.  It's very small and definitely worth either making a reservation or being ok sitting outside (there were lots of openings at 12:30 on a weekday).   I thought the food was great (had the BLT - not only was the bacon super-tasty, there was a delicious sauce that made it very unusual).   My only issue was the service - ours was very slow.  Might have just been a fluke, but it seemed like we had to wait quite a while for our meals - as we watched others get and finish their food - and the same happened when we were done and waiting for our check.  Overall, I would definitely try it again.
