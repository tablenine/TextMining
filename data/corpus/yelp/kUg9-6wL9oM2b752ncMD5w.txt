i must concur with the five hundred or so people who noted the awesomeness of the coach farm pizza, the squash blossoms and the most wonderful butterscotch budino. you can't not try these things. . as for parking, there were plenty Â of spots on highland, at least when we got there at 6 there were. despite not having a reservation, we were seated immediately in the wine cellar, much more quiet and pleasant than the main area, which was totally packed and too loud.. . and when i went to the bathroom, i noticed the butterscotch budino recipe from a ny times article on the wall! can't wait to screw it up;p . . . http://www.nytimes.com....
