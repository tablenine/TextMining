The pizza pot pie is an original idea, which turned out to be a fantastic treat for all you pizza lovers.  The amount of cheese and the flavor of the bread will blow you away!  The salads on the menu are pretty good too.  I really enjoy eating there, and have done so several times.. . My only complaint would be that they do not take reservations, and the wait can be fairly lone (up to 2 hours on the weekends).  But, if you are a pizza lover, it's probably worth your wait to at least try out this crazy style of pizza.
