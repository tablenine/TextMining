Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
I'm wondering why its so far to find really really food thai or Malaysian food in atlanta. Maybe I'm just too picky, but the food here just doesn't seem that good. The curry plates are plentiful and come with unlimited rice, but they are kinda expensive, all $10+. the Appetizers here are kinda small for the money, and I feel that the dishes here are all overly salted. . . I got the naan w/ curry (the best appetizer there), the malaysian pancake (which ended up being ground beef wrapped with puff pastry) and i also tried a few of the curries and tandori chicken. . . The naan with curry is awsome because you get an appetizer with the naan, and then you can combine the leftover curry with rice. The problem with Top Spice is that they are less generous with their curry then other thai restaurants. The Tandori chicken which I tried actually came with more vegetables than chicken, which I thought was kinda weird. . . And they didnt have hainan chicken..... I'll go back there if my friends ever want to go but thats basically it.
