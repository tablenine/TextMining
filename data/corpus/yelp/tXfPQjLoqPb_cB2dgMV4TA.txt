I really genuinely like the Oinkster.  The fries are FANTASTIC and the pulled pork is as good as pulled pork gets.  I was not WOWED by the pastrami but I certainly enjoyed it.  I encourage everyone in l.a. to try this pulled pork sandwich at least once.  . They also serve alcohol and have a happy hour. Nuff said!
