Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Apple Pan is this hamburger joint in LA with legendary status. Apple Pan is famous for its hickory burger and apple pie. Add to the fact, it's been around since 1947, that's around the time when my parents were born. . . The uniqueness of this hamburger joint starts from how it's laid out. It has this station island where they flip burger patties and buns. Outer part of island is the u-shape counter where customers sit on high stools to enjoy their burgers. In between the station and the counter is where servers take orders and serve you food with minimum distance to travel. All corners of the restaurants are for people waiting to find stools to sit. There is no waiting list. . . Besides from the interesting restaurant layout and the hickory burger, Apple Pan isn't that impressive. Burgers and fries were over priced and overrated. 3 burgers, 1 fries, 2 drinks, adding tax and tip cost me grand total of $30.
