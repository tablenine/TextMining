Sooo... i'm bumpin it on up to 3 stars.. I bought a $25 Groupon to here for $10 or so (I don't remember). Came in here Wednesday night with the hubby to use the Groupon before it expires, and I was somewhat pleasantly surprised.. . First let me start with the not so great:. 1-The pricing is a little silly. I mean, it isn't some crazy contemporary chinese food. It's standard fare for $15-$20 per plate.. 2- I HATE HATE HATE paper on top of the tables. I'm not a child, and I don't need a giant sheet of paper set on my table. I have no idea why this bothers my so much, but it does. Also, their large dining tables are just fold out plastic tables. I think they can do a little better.. 3- The service was mediocre at best and VERY slow. . The good:. The food was pretty good.. The potstickers (6) were big, and filled with a pork mixture. They're the really thick doughy ones though, and I prefer the wrapper to be a little thinner. The hubby had the garlic peanut chicken. It was just okay. Not really anything special here. Chicken in a peanut butter sauce. He was planning to have a dish called "red special" chicken, or something of that nature, but found out from the waiter that it was the exact same dish I was ordering in the exact same sauce, so he didn't get that. I had the coconut lime curry shrimp (16). While I thought that the amount of shrimp that they gave was very generous, the sauce wasn't fantastic. It was WAY too bitter, but once you were used to the bite, it was very edible. . Service was pretty decent until we were ready for our check at which point we sat at the table for another 20 minutes waiting for someone to take our card and bring it back.. All in all, I'd go for the $8 entrees on Tuesday, but I wouldn't put this on my regular list of place I frequent.
