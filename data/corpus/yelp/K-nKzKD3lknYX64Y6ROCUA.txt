Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Is Canter's the greatest deli around? No.  But I will be so sad when someone decides it needs an updating. The room off the Kibbitz room is so freaking fantastic. Every time I eat there I want to steal the light fixtures for my mid century modern house.  I just love the atmosphere. The staff has changed over the years. It used to be full of old crotchety women who I would tip extra because damn! I was 60 years younger than them and they were running around faster than i could have moved.  Now it's just regular waiters and waitresses mostly. The cashiers are total jerks too. They have these ridiculous signs above the counter " Cash line here. Credit cards here." God forbid no one else is in line and you walk up and stand two feet to the left and are paying by credit card. They make you move over and enjoy telling you to do so just a little too much.. . I really like the matzoh ball soup,  grilled salmon entree, and pickled herring.  Good fries. Potato pancakes, not so good. The coffee is great too. . . Turkey dinner sucks. . . My daughter always gets a free cookie at the bakery where they are super nice.
