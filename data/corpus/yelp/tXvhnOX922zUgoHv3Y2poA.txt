Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Ok. I was told not to expect too much from this place. Stood in line for 45 mins and had a great time watching people getting their cars towed left and right on either sides of the street. Got the LA Philharmonic Dog. It sounded very exciting: Good concept, but it lacked flavor and spices. They hotdog itself was pretty plain tasting. I appreciate the history behind this place. They have free valet parking. Cash only!
