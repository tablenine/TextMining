I would vote between 3 1/2 and 4 stars, but with that option unavailable and no word that it will be at any time soon, let's go with 3.. . I think there's a difference between a place that tries to be earthy/hippie and a place that is cooler/quirkier.  The food was very good.  No complaints here.  The jerk chicken pizza had no "jerk" spicing, but was tasty all the same.  And the Mediterranean trio plate was flavorful as well, even though I don't eat olives the hummus and eggplant spreads were good.  The pitas were a little too greasy though.. . Here's where my review loses points.  If you want a cocktail, would you prefer yours with violet liqueur, candied hibiscus flower, elderflower nectar, or homemade all-spice liquor?  Well I didn't, and the friend I was with said she and some of her friends had recently braved ordering and trying some of the above (as well as other strange/funky drinks) and ended up sending most back!  We're not ladies to send back drinks.  Just too weird for me.. . The brunch menu looks good, but if you see any of my other reviews where I can never seem to make brunch happen, well that's just wishful thinking on my part.
