hmm, this place was OK.  the service was really strange, our waitress was really trying to push us to buy drinks and appetizers and when we didn't she acted all weird and defensive.  also, note that the chips that come with the sandwiches are shrimp, so if you're vegetarian, don't eat them!  and the coleslaw was really wilty and tasted fishy to me too. i'm not mad about the fishy-ness of things because after all lit is a vietnamese place, just beware. the sandwich was kind of disappointing...also there was a strange attitude in the air...hipper than thou type of feeling?
