The burgers were sooo freaking good! I went with three other ravenous folk and we each got a different kind of burger with a different kind of side: french fries, fried sweet potatoes, tater tots ("Hey, Tina. Get some tots!"), and... fried zucchini. . . Our seven-foot tall waiter hunkered down to hear our little, breathless-voiced orders (you know, we almost didn't have energy to speak because we were so hungry), and everything came out just as we had specified- add the cheese, less onions, more lettuce, more sauce, less this. Whatever. . . The end of the meal had us all leaned back, fully sated, hands on our full stomachs, eyes half closed with happiness.... . I only wish I lived close enough to go several times a week... *sigh. Haha, I like the huge sexified posters of the female servers.
