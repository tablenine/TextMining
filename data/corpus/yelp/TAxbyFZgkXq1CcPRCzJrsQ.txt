Pastrami sandwich here is outstanding! By far the best in Los Angeles and better than most in New York. . . Seedy area it is located in should not discourage you but look out for the odd hours of operation. Unfortunately for me whenever I really crave it and am in the area it is closed. . . Has that campy 70s diner era decor and deli smell but the pastrami is top notch!!! It is pricey for what they serve but why spend less only to leave unsatisfied. Much better than equally pricey Canter's, Greenblatt's, Art's, or Brent's.
