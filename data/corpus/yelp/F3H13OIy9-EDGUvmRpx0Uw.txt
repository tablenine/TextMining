Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
My first trip to the area. Came for business with a colleague. We stopped into Mastro's for a celebratory dinner before heading home and were not disappointed. . . A NY strip the size of my head. Perfectly cooked, delicious, still sizzling on the 400 degree plate. The mash with gorg cheese. Mmmm... Â The pom martini... perfect. . . If you want a whole side of beef, everything to taste fantastic, and a there-could-be-a-gangster-in-the-office-upstairs kinda vibe. This is your place.
