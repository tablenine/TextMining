I heard about the special #2 challenge, and I kind of  wanted to try it.  But then my better senses came to me and I figured I'd try something a few level below it.. . 7 is the least spiciest and 1 is the spiciest.  Then they have the special 1 and special 2 (the super spicey one).. . I opted for the soy ramen with level 1  (2 levels down from the special #2), with an extra egg and garlic.   . . Oh boy...when it came out, I could smell the spiciness!  First few bites into it, it wasn't too bad.....and then...a few sips of the soup and a few more bites....ummm I started to feel my lips throbbing...like the cartoons!  every time I drank some of the soup, I could feel a warm layer of fire starting inside my stomach.. . The ramen itself was just ok, It wasn't the best.  But the spiciness sure did live up to the talk.  I don't know who would want to try the challenge #2 and if there is someone, I don't know why they would do it cuz ummm I'm pretty sure they will have B.A.S  Burning Ass Syndrome...(translated over from a korean saying).. . It was fun to try....but tastewise a 2 star....fun/novelty factor gave it one extra star.
