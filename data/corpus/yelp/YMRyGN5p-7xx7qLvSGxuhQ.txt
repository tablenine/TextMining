Lunch costs only half as much as dinner does, but the crowd is always big. It's not as bad as it looks as long as you get there early. The sushi quality and quantity is great. The parking lot is small, so you may have to park on the street and walk over. If the crowd is too big, just go somewhere else. The sushi is indeed very good, but not good enough that you can't just skip waiting and eat elsewhere.
