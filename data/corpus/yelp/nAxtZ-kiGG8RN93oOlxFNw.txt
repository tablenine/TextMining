Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Still Good, But It's Glory Days Are Long Past. I really wish I could take half a star back... giving them three stars is a little generous.. . When I first started going to Tito's back in the late 70's, they also had one in Anaheim. Back in the day, everything was hotter, fresher, the service was fast, all the checkout positions were open. Fortunately, Tito's hasn't gotten as bad as most other joints that earn some presumed and over-rated "cult" following, but if I'm being honest, they are headed that way. Personally speaking, I ust don't think the place is the holy grail that some people want to believe it is. . . Having said that, I have enjoyed many a lunch or late dinner... usually two tacos and a all-meat burrito, as recently as last week. But where I used to make the trip specifically to go to Tito's every week, I now might make it there once a month or so IF I happen to be in the area.. . If you take away the hype and take it at face value, there is a good chance you'll like Titos. Otherwise, you may be in for a letdown.
