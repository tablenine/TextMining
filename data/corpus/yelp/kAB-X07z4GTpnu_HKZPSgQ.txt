I'm gonna give this place an extra star because for the month of July I have decided to try out Pescatarianism (vegetarian who eats fish...it's a real word...I promise).  I really feel like I'm lacking variety in my everyday cuisine.  However, this place is great.  They have a lot of vegetarian options and they all sound delicious.  . . I tried the huevos rancheros for breakfast and it was good.  It's just nice to be able to order something off a menu and not have to substitute half of the items to make it vegetarian.. . Thanks Rodan!
