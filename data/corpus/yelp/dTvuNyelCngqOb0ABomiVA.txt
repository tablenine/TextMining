The expensive spinach cheese dip is amazing but really small, probably only good for 2 and not the 4 of us the waitress said it'd be fine for. We got half yard beers all around and each were $13. They've got a nice looking bar and the staff is friendly enough, too many hostesses in the front though. The bathrooms are a bit odd, the sink is almost like it is at little league fields but like metal instead of plain white lol I should've taken a picture but yeah that's the only way I can think of explaining it. They were clean though! I'll probably be here again next time I'm in town since the pear beer is amazing! I still like my apple withier the best.
