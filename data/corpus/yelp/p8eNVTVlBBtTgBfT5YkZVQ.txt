I had such high expectations for this place after reading all your reviews.  But I was really disappointed with this place. Their cuban sandwiches were sad excuses,. The bread was dry, their roast pork was dry, not enough gooey melty cheese, not enough butter, not enough crunch and tartness from the pickles.  I've had cuban sandwiches in  the LES in NYC for half the price which were way tastier. Their iced cafe con leche was basically a shitty iced latte, not the kind I'm used to from Juicy Lucy's. Their guave and cheese pastry was decent, but did not dazzle. And the line inside was ridiculously long during their lunch hour. I think NYC definitely has the edge when it comes to Cuban cuisine. Sorry, but I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.
