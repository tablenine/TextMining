I been to Newport before they moved the food was excellent. I have come to the new location and said the food is excellet.. . The big problem is the line which could circle the building ! Nonetheless a hour wait is a small price to pay for the delicious crab in black bean sauce. the beef loc luc is wonderfully peppery sweet. and the noodle dishes are plates of gold.
