Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
"Pink's!". . [First impression]. Yet another 2hr line! . . So it's a bit overrated but how could you not go to Pink's when in LA? I won't go as far as to say it was worth the wait. But at least I can say that I went. Also, the thought of running into some celebs or hot shot made the wait a bit exciting. Hey.. you never know when in Hollywood. The Travel Channel was shooting a special while we were there so cameras were everywhere. . We ordered the famous chili cheese with jalepenos, the Ozzi and some O- rings and washed it all down with a Bubble Up. . . [Suggestion]. *Go for tradition-- Chili Cheese! . *Onion rings are crisp to perfection.. . [Tip(s)]. *No tips really. You would think the line dies down later in the day or late night, but it doesn't. So it's best to just get in line and wait like the rest.
