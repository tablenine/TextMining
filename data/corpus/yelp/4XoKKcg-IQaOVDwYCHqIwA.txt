EXPENSIVE &amp; TRENDY. . Visited this place about four months ago and it looks like not much has changed.. . Not impressed. I will have to say that if liked one thing, it would have to be the Bacon-wrapped Filet Mignon-keep it coming!. All other meats were generally overcooked.. . I will have to say for you to save your money and head to the south-bay for some better tasting food-By Brazil
