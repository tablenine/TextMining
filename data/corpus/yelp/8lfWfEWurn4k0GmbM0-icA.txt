This is a perfect meeting place downtown.  I went down there to meet the guys for an old fashioned sausagefest on a Saturday afternoon and we all enjoyed it.  There were dozens of Belgian or German beers on tap plus many other bottled beers.  The seating area is spacious and you can order more alcohol from the bar in the back.. . You order your food up front and they have about 20 types of weenies.  Bob bad the Bratwurst, Kirean and Brian had the rattlesnake and rabbit, and I had the duck bacon jalapeno.  I dunno what John had b/c he ate it in about 7 seconds.  Anyway, everyone enjoyed their meal.  The setting was casual and comfortable.  (See my pics) The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.
