Korean food + tortilla's? At first I thought that this mix would taste like shizzle...I was wrong! The meat is flavorful, burritos bomb diggy! My only knock was on the kimchi quesadilla, but I don't like kimchi so maybe that's why Â I knocked it! I will definitely make a trip to the Korean Taco Truck!
