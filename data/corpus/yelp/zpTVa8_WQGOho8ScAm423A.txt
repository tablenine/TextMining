Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
3.5. . When you walk in, you see something elegant. High ceilings, clean white space, enticing pastries by the door. But then it begins - the noise. And before you know it, you can barely hear even yourself. .. This is terrible for catching up with friends or getting to know people, but it's good for casual nights out or bad dates. . . With that said, the food was okay. The Louie salad was not that good. It was small, visually unappealing, and tasted just okay. The portobello fries were pretty good though, but there wasn't much, and the bottom was all just batter. We also got the sausage and napoli pizzas. The sausage pizza was pretty decent, but nothing extraordinary. . . Service was excellent. We were seated within 10 min, and our waiter was cracking jokes all night. . . There's a parking garage across the street for $3. (We went around 8 pm).. . This place was decent. I think a little overhyped, but definitely try it once! . . (Oh and don't sit facing the windows unless you want to see a Subway.)
