I first heard about "Leche" from my Sister who ended up just randomly stopping their after a Drive down Melrose. I was instantly informed that she just had eaten the Absolutely best Â Red Velvet Cupcake, that she has yet to put into her mouth. I had to go try this place of my self, and I have now tried just about everything on the Menu.. . Their Red velvet are still so amazing with their taste and balance of flavors.. . The Banana flavored Ice Cream w/ Butterscotch. OMG! This is one of my favorite items on their menu.. . The Strawberry Shortcake is better if you eat their, once I got it to go and it was half the size and did not taste as good as the one that you get when you eat it table side.. . Bottom line is I love MILK. I just wish that morse places could pull off having such amazing Desserts as Milk does. This place is Absolutely Fabulous!
