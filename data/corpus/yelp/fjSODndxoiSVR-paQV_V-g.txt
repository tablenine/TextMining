Mmm a good greasy spoon to put something in the belly after carrousing in the Highlands.  I recommend leaving VA Highlands just before last call so you don't have a long wait here.  Waiting to be seated somewhere at 3 AM makes me switch from euphoric to cranky mode pretty quick, and no one wants to see that!! . .
