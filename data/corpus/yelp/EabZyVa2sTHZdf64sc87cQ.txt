Great service and awesome location.  This is the perfect place for brunch on a bright and sunny weekend. I recommend sitting outside. . . I had the hibiscus iced tea which was very refreshing, shared a serving of the mac and cheese, and the poached eggs and polenta. All were very satisfying. . . I'm not sure if it was because they had a full house, but it took awhile for all of our dishes to come out (35 minutes) and the entire meal ended up taking 2 hours.. . Reservations on a nice weekend will make getting a seat easier for you!
