you have to order and pay inside first, and then the food will be delivered to your table outside according to your number.  there's only about 5 tables outside.  i had a tuna melt which wasn't at all what i expected.  it came in a sandwich with crusty french bread, tuna salad and mozarella cheese.  it  was good though.  i had cous cous and mac-n-cheese as a side.  and they had orangina too!  it was tasty.  it definitely beat the lines at  doughboys and toast.
