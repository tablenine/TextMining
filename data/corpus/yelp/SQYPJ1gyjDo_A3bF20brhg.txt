Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Loud, obnoxious "happy birthday" music that sounds like it was written by the same creator of the sound track to Dance Revolution. LONG, LONG, LONG wait, over one hour... And yet, we still go there. Are we masochistic? Maybe, but we still keep going there. $14.99/ person all you can eat... they finally upgraded their restaurant status to an "A". ( I think they used to be a "C."
