As long as you don't get Big Mama started, your entire meal will go down better. . . Keep the elbows off the table and life will be all that and bag of chips. Fo real!. . I went for Herb's Special (half chicken with gravy, 2 waffles). Dude, before I finished my first waffle, I was already getting drowsy! Everything was tasty, filling and food coma inducing. You felt like you got twice as much food as your ordered. We were also stupid enough to order extra bisquits with gravy! Were our EYES bigger than our STOMACHS? You bet they were.. . Big Mama liked us and she took good care of us (service is outstanding), always asking if her "babies" were doing okay. Everyone could use a little "love" and this would be one of the few places in LA where you can get it.
