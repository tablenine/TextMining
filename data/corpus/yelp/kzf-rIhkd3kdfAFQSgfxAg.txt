Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Located in Little Tokyo, Sushi-Gen is considered a more "traditional" sushi restaurant. I've only been there a few times now, and each time the dining experience has been excellent. The fish is fresh and delicious, and you're not going to break the bank. . . Make reservations on peak nights.
