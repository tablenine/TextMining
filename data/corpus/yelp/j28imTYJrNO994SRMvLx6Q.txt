It has been a long time since I've had Savoy's Hainan chicken and it was as good as I remember.  I've made Hainan chicken from scratch before, but it's much too labor intensive to be worth the effort.  Maybe I'll try again someday, but for now -- I'm okay with driving out to Alhambra for good food.  . . Savoy is tiny -- ask for the outdoor patio and be prepared to wait for a table because it's super popular.
