Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
First time going to Father's office on a Thursday night... and omg the place was PACKED.  We went there around 8pm for some burger and beer (I had wine since I am on a diet and beer seems like more calories...) with friends.  We somehow managed to get a table in the back room.  It was pretty small and cramped but at least we had somewhere to sit and eat our burgers!. . I got my burger done Medium, a little pink on the inside and oh boy they impressed me again.  I really like their crispy thin fries too!. . Out of all the times I been to Father's office, I think the best time to go for me was a Saturday afternoon for late lunch.  It's less packed, plenty of seating available, and gives me an excuse to start drinking early :)
