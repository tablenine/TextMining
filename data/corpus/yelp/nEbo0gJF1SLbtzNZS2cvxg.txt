ewwwwwwwwww. Why does this place have four stars when it tasted like Dennys?. . 1: The first time I came here, it was pretty late and we already had dinner, so we just wanted dessert. When the waiter found out that 3/4 of us wanted dessert, he openly showed how aggravated he was, closed his book, and said "alright" and walked away rudely. if you don't like that, then don't work at a 24 hour deli. The dessert I had was highly bland and not memorable.. 2: So, after finally coming here for dinner, it wasn't that much better. First, we tried to order dinner entrees, but we were told the kitchen stops making them at 11. It was 11:02. Okay, fine no big deal. After going through the menu, which was expensive, huge, and highly unorganized, we ordered. I got the Tuna Salad sandwich, to which my server asked me, "Just lettuce?"....and that made me go..."ummm...i guess"... Apparently, to get other stuff on it, its extra. I also got it with potatoe salad, which looked like cole slaw and tasted like death. Sandwich was okay, but I've had a much better one at subway. Sadddd!!!!. . The pickles they serve here are good, but you can get them anywhere. Everything was old, except their menu prices. My friend had the eggs florentine, which he said tasted really bad but he ate it anyways. My other friend got a bagel with his breakfast, and when he asked for cream cheese, they told him it would cost extra.
