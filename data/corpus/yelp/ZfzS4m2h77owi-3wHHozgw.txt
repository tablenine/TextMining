"BEST RAMEN ULL EVER HAVE IN UR LIFE, BABE" . bf says. hmmmm.... o ya? ;) . although he's a picky eater who tries not to act like it :). . HYYYYYPPPPEEE?. . nevertheless, we wait... hmmm? 30sh minutes or so?. I've waited longer to eat nothing at all compared to........ . the BEST FRIED RICE IN THE WORLD.. . aaahhhh. got the side of the fried rice to start off and.... WOW. . my mouth is watering and heart, breaking just thinking about . it..........*sigh*. . I'm going to ask God when I get to heaven if I can eat it everyday :P. . very cute quaint place along row of cutesy little shops (doesn't hurt while it waiting) crowded and small, but does give a more authentic feel.. . and yes, yummmilicious ramen.. . I do personally prefer lighter, thinner, curlier noodles? daikouya's is a bit on the thicker side- but cooked well. nice texture, not too squishy/swollen. the perfect boiled egg in there was very happy. the soup was incredibly rich and flavorful. sluuurrrrp.. . but, the fried rice.... sigh. yes, the best u'll ever have - evur :)
