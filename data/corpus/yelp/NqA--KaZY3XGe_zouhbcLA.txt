Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canter's is SOOOO good. It's also an LA legend. They have had tons of celebrities eat there. I was recently watching a TV show called Clark and Michael and they were sitting in Canter's talking about plans for a new TV series they were gonna make. This place is a money restaurant and features a bar with a live band. If your in LA this place is a MUST and if it's your first time going, get the Reuben.....enough said.
