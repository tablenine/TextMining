The food was excellent...so why only two stars? The service! My husband and I went there together for our first (and probably last) meal there to celebrate my birthday. When we arrived the restaurant was practically empty except for a table of what we assumed were "VIP's", since practically every server was hovering around them the entire evening. Meanwhile at our table, we waited over 15 minutes for water &amp; bread. In fact, as we saw other diners get seated after us receive water &amp; bread we had to ask our server what the deal was. She said that they usually wait to serve you those things until you've ordered. Seriously, EVERY table was served before ours even though some of them were still holding menus. On top of that, the table we were seated at was extremely wobbly and the server didn't bother to move us or fix it after we pointed it out to her. As our evening wrapped up my husband mentioned we would grab dessert elsewhere since it was my birthday but in a last ditch effort to make us happy enough to leave a decent tip our server brought over what she said was "cake" in a to-go box. Opening the box later revealed that it wasn't cake but what looked like an assortment of cookies. But I guess I shouldn't complain since they were free. Still, after dropping $200+ on a meal at a Michellin rated restaurant only to be treated so poorly left a very sour taste in my mouth.
