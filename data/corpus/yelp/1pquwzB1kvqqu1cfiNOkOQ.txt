The seating system at this place is insane. We arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday evening for dinner. There were about ten people in line ahead of us and we were told it would be a 20 minute wait, that we could get drinks at the bar and they would find us when our table was ready. 20 minutes later I noticed the people in front of us had been seated. 45 minutes later no one had "come to find us" as promised, but I noticed more and more people getting seated. We checked in to see if they had accidentally skipped us and they said no, but it seemed like they were seating whoever was hanging out by the maitre d', so we decided to give that a try. Finally, an hour later, we were seated. . . The food was mediocre and not at all worth that wait.
