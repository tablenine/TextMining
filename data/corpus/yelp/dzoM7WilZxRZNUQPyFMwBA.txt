The "freckled" OJ (strawberry puree mixed into orange juice) is awesomely refreshing but not cheap at $4 a glass. My basil/gouda/spinach omelette was great and the red potatoes served with it were a nice complement. Overall a nice place that we'll add to our breakfast circuit. It would be 5 stars if they had a bigger dining room and a slightly cheaper menu.
