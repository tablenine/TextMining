Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
Delicious!!! . . The Italian Village was visit #3 in the spring-break-a-thon of visits that I received. This time, it was my aunt, uncle, and cousin. My cousin was staying at the Palmer House and my aunt and uncle drove down to see him and go for dinner (or as my aunt still says "supper.") We picked Italian Village because it was close to the Palmer House. . . The food was YUUUUMMY!!! My aunt and I each had the swordfish and my cousin and uncle both had steaks. All were delicious! We managed to get some dessert in our full bellies too. Creme brulee and dense chocolate cake. OMG, so drool worthy! . . I didn't get to look at their wine selection or try any cocktails because this was an ice tea and water dinner, but next time for sure.
