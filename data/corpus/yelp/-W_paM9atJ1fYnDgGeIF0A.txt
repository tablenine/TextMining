I came here with a group of my friends one night after going to Royal/T. I first saw this place on a review on LA Magazine and found it quite appealing. . . I tried the burger, because i LOVE burgers, and it tasted great! The spinach tasted funny, however the meat was so juicy and the bread didn't give up. I also ordered the regular fries and the sweet potato fries. The house fries are full of flavor and not too salty. The sweet potato fries are alright, I think I had them too much in other places to appreciate them. . . Their beer selection is very narrow, since they are just a small bar. I like beer and the anvil was my overall favorite. My girlfriend loves the peche beer. However, our stay there that night didn't go cheap. . . There's no waiter service at night so you have to wait behind indecisive customers wondering what to get off the menu until you get a chance to order a drink or food. So get there early, I'm awaiting to try the oysters..mmm
