Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
I could see how The Boundary could get packed and annoying on a weekend.  However, for a week night it is a good Wicker Park option - especially if you like to cheer on the sports.  Boy, do they have a lot of TVs!  The Boundary also has a lot of comfy booths around its edges and plenty of tables in its spacious middle.. . The food here (as many have noted) is above average bar food -  the price reflects it.  Not a good stop for cheap eats, but excellent for a twist on the ordinary.  I went with a party of four (one more and I could have said Party of Five.  Dang it.  I love you Scott Wolf!) and we were served right away by one of the most accommodating waitresses I have had in a long time (she changed the TVs to Red Sox and Cubs games without any hassle - woo-hoo).  We ordered some AMAZING beef skewers to start and also some damn tasty queso with chunks and chunks of chorizo.  So. Good.  The pita triangles were cooked slightly which gave them a great smoky flare.  I went with the Cowgirl salad (Santa Fe style with chicken).  I wish I had gone with a burger because they looked better.  And I so did not dig the shredded chicken in my salad - NOT meaty enough.  . . For beahs, we sampled plenty of the wide selection  - Three Floyd's, Tremurs, etc.  The prices were pretty high but so was the beer quality.   Not a deal but not a disappointment either.. . Overall, I like the Boundary.  It's sports bar sleek and a good weekday stop for sure.
