Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
One word ....OVERRATED!!!!. . It's just a Hot Dog people!  I've had better at 7-11!  I live near Pinks and it is funny seeing how long the line is everytime I drive by.  I guess all these people don't have a life since they spend 1hr+ waiting in line for a hot dog!. . Plus...the one and only time I ate at Pinks...i was in the bathroom for a good hour after!. . Pinks theme song should be . "When you're sliding into First and you're pants begin to BURST. Diarrhea...Diarrhea... "When you're running Home and you're pants begin to FOAM. Diarrhea....Diarrhea..". . PASS on this place!!. . The hot dog vendors on the streets that you find when the clubs let out ...that offer grilled hotdogs on their tiny carts along w/ green peppers and onions beat Pinks hot dogs hands down!
