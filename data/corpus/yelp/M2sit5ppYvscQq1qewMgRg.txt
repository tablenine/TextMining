I think my tummy is going to explode after eating so much. This place was awesome.  First, we took a risk by agreeing to be seated at a big table with people we don't know.  But I'm so glad we did, because it was soooo fun.  We even met a fellow Yelper (Hi Joanna E!!)!   . . We had the chicken noodle soup (yummy) and then pigged out on some dumplings.  The Juicy Pork and Crab dumplings were exactly as they sound - scrumptious!!  The shrimp and pork dumplings were oh, so good.  But, I must admit the juicy pork and crab were my faves.  Everything that everyone else was eating at the table had my mouth watering.  Oh how I wanted to reach across the table with my chopsticks and steal a piece from everyone when they weren't looking.. . I don't normally have a sweet tooth, but today I was craving a little sumthin, sumthin.  So, we ordered the sesame buns.  They were okay, but not what I was expecting......white puffy balls with slightly sweet crushed black sesame seeds. Probably wouldn't order it again.  But, my husband devoured his and the rest of mine. . . One of my favorite chinese specialties is baked Bao with BBQ pork.  They don't carry it, but I got my fix at the amazing JJ Bakery in the same parking lot.  . . All in all, it was a great lunching experience.  We'll definitely be back soon.
