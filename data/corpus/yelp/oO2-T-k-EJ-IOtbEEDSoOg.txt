It would be a tough challenge to find another bar/restaurant in this neighborhood that offers a better price/quality ratio. Got there right at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon, literally one minute after they opened, and within a half hour the place was full. As other people have mentioned, there's not a ton of seating, which is unfortunate for people going there to eat as well as drink Â - the food wouldn't really be easy to eat standing up, so if that's what you're going for, I'd recommend getting there as close to opening time as you can, or there will likely be long waits for a table. . . But onto the food. It was amazing - I had the fish taco, which was by far the highlight, huge (for the $3 pricetag) piece of perfectly cooked fish topped with slaw and avocado, this is a must-try. I also had the taco with pork shoulder and pineapple, which was also ridiculously tasty, great melding fo the pork and the slightly sweet roasted (?) pineapple, and again a huge portion for $2. The guacamole "made to order" was very good and served with a heaping portion of chips, but it didn't awe me as much as the rest of the meal. Definitely do not leave without trying the three salsas -- they are already at the table, and all you have to do is order chips to go with them (though if you order the guac, it comes with more than enough chips to serve for salsa as well) - there is a red salsa, a salsa verde, and a very spicy, but deliciously complex salsa. . . The drink list looked great, I had one with bourbon and ginger beer. They're reasonably priced at $7/cocktail, which considering the quality of bourbon and other ingredients going into it is a good deal, if not quite a "steal.". . Highly recommended, especially if you can manage to avoid the crowds. . . p.s. the hours listed on this site aren't correct -- they don't open till 4 on Saturdays (as I found out today)...
