Was disappointed after reading all the good reviews.  I would much preferred the thai restaurants in Alhambra.  Ordered the pad se eew, morning glory, thai boat noodles, and papaya salad.  The flat noodles were broken into pieces.  The thai boat noodles was a disappointment.  I ordered the papaya salad mild and it turned out spicy.  Would not make an effort to go to restaurant again!
