Nice fancy restaurant in the hills, with a spectacular view. This place is a go to for special occasions, a romantic dates, birthdays. I love the ambience, the lights are dim with Amazing Views of the city. If you get there when the sun sets its so pretty. The first thing you see if a Japanese style house when walking in. Their are different types of rooms to eat in. . I love the Darth Vadar Sushi rolls, and the Californiacation rolls. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't come with any other entrees. So You have to put a meal together if you want to get full add a salad or soup. Â I have also eaten full dinner Entrees The Sweet and Spicy Shrimp it good, and also the Asian Vegtables Entree is great.
