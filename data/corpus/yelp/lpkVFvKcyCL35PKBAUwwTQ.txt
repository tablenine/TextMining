Restaurant: Chego
Category: Korean
Fat for mouthfeel, starch for gutfill, yuppies for family style dining companions. Two comforts, one jook in the eye. The further west you go in L.A. the more stuck-up the people become. In our Santa Monica neighborhood it's the most expensive car at the intersection that gets to go first. At Chego people save table space with the perception of our doggie, Gaynor, who won't go through a partially opened door. She judges that there ISN'T ENOUGH SPACE. . . BTW, the waiters are your friends when it comes to wedging yourself in between self obsessed space hogs. Sort of like pushers on the Tokyo subway.. . But the food! The food is very good!. . Linda loved: The $12 Salad - baby spinach, mizuna, goat cheese, cranberries, pecans, seasonal pickles, miso $7. . Linda, Siobhan and I loved: Steak in the Heart - prime rib sandwich on grilled ciabatta, wok-seared onions, roasted garlic, Irish butter, cheese, green sauce $8. . I liked: Buttered Kimchi Chow - hot and buttered, w/ fried egg, red chili tofu, edamame, gaenip, garlic soy jus, chicharrones, furikake $7. Daughter found it a bit hot as did Linda... as did I after a while. Probably won't try that again in favor of other dishes.. . Did I say again? Yes, there will be a return trip. This is what we live in L.A. for. First, a place we haven't gone to yet. Second, cheap ethnic food. We lived for a time in a small town in another state. No lines! For anything! No reason to line up, is what the problem was. Have you been to the Thai place? the natives asked. THE Thai place. Hoo boy.. . To sum up: lines? bring 'em on as long as the food is great! Cheap satisfying ethnic food? Yum! Dining with the yuppies? Meh.
