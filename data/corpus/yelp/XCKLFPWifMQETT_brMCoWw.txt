I went on a Friday night. I was actually scared to go in there. It looked like high-class dining. They even had a live jazz band. Everything around it gave a high-society, upper-class vibe. Since it was Christmas season, I didn't have money to splurge. Luckily, it was a fairly cheap place.. . A couple of people recommended Bhojanic for Indian food. So I went. At first glance, it looked like a tapas place. And maybe their tapas are good, but I was in mood for Indian. If I go back, I might try their tapas.. . I had their "The Bhojanic:" the 2 meat and 1 vegetable dish. It came out in a cafeteria tray. Like typical Indian cuisine, it looked deceptively small. But it was a lot of food.. . The food was very light and not oily like most Indian food. Even the Naan I ordered was light, thin, and fluffy.  I've eaten at a lot of Indian buffets where the oil factor was high, and this place was a welcome change.. . Also, the food was very spicy. I guess that makes it a bit more authentic than the pussyfied, Westernized Indian food. Since I'm used to extremely hot Korean food, it wasn't bad for me. But my girlfriend was dying from the spiciness.. . Even though the food was light and fresh, I actually prefer oily Indian food.  So I wasn't into the taste as much. It was good, but not something I'm going to drool over. Also, I didn't like how loud the music was. But at least the food was affordable.. . My girlfriend loved it because it was so light and fresh. She does not like the oily style Indian food. So it depends on what type of Indian you like. I thought it was just decent. I can go here again, but it's not a place I'll crave.
