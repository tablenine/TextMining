We came on a Wednesday night and had a bit of a wait for a table, but we were also a group of 7. Then again, it was like 11 pm or later. But I told everyone there would be a wait. . . Got some drinks for the wait -- good prices, every night has a $3 shot of whiskey and though I do not remember what Wednesday's was, it tasted good.. . The tacos were tasty as hell. Definitely worth it for a slight mark-up (you can definitely get a cheaper Al Pastor at any authentic-ish Â local taco joint). The al pastor and the fish tacos were both pretty awesome (fish taco being served on a harder flat shell, fyi) but the pork belly taco was AMAZING. So good, I ordered another. Yum. Seriously, eat this.. . Overall, this place will be crowded and there are not many actual tables, but the food is delicious and we had a good time.
