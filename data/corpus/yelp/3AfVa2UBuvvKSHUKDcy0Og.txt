Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I've been wanting to try this place forevers! Thanks to Sabrina L and her hubby for taking us here and treating us to a delicious meal! Located in Culver City in a new strip plaza, Father's Office stands out from the other locations with their outside elongated patio area. It's the first time showing my ID to enter a restaurant (rather than a club..haha) and order your food at the cash register. There are seats inside but if your'e lucky, grab a seat outside (since it does get crowded even for a Sunday afternoon) and enjoy the breeze. The burgers were delicious - on baguette breads with blue cheese and mixed greens sandwiched inside. Their beet salad was fresh and yummy and my favorite..the sweet potato fries were just fabulous and a perfect complement to the burger. Also, had a great light beer recommended by one of the folks there too! Definitely would like to come back here again!
