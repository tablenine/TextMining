Restaurant: Craft
Category: American (New)
One of my favorite restaurants. I have eaten in the restaurant, but I actually like CraftBar better because it is more casual with the smaller and affordable menu. Texan chefs have brought some southern love to Craft recently which is different and very good. Hush puppies, grits, etc.  Wonderful service and attitude from the girl in the CraftBar along with food runners and bussers!   Love the "Coat Check" doggie bag touch as well as the free muffin that they give you when you leave!
