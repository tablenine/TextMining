I have really enjoyed my experiences at Grand Lux.. . The wait staff are really attentive.  The bread is wonderful.. . I usually go for lunch with my mom.  She actually flirted with the waiter last time and he flirted back!  Fun!  He was sweet guy who took the time to answer her questions and was quite kind.  So, it's a good mom-taking place.. . But, that said, I usually get the salad with pasta, lunch portion, which is always way more than enough.  The house salad is good - I get the blue cheese.  For pasta,  I get the carbonara, and it is spot on!  Al dente with not too much cream and enough bacon and goodies to make me happy.. . I have had other things too, and they have been good.
