Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I stopped in Sunday night while cruising la cienaga for a bite to eat. As a norcal guy, I had never heard of the place, but hey, it said prime rib! The valet was especially friendly and parked me in front....oh the perks of having an eye-catching date.. . First thing I noticed was the great decor in the waiting area. Second thing was how overdressed a lot of the younger crowd was. Sure, yelp says 'dressy,' but not DRESSY, complete with white socks and oversized dad shoes. Must have been prom time or something. No reservations, but we were seated within 5 minutes. Â  . . Our waiter was easygoing and explained the whole process / recommended a few wines. Unfortunately, the spun salad was underwhelming, as were most of the sides. The prime rib was cooked properly and was infused with enough flavor without being overpowering. Free ice cream at the end. . . I took a loaded potato to go and ate it as I drove north on the 5 back home. Not bad, not bad.
