Awesome Sunday brunch! Nice selection and cheap - $13 buffet. I took a friend there who is originally from Charlotte and she exclaimed that the mac n cheese is as good as her grandma's. It's a bit of a circus, but the jukebox over the P.A. system surprisingly had a decent mix (old R&amp;B, classic rock, indie, etc.); you can grab drinks as you wait; and the tables move fairly consistently. The 10 minute wait was no biggie. It's great comfort food (loooved the fried chicken) and you're guaranteed to have bigger eyes than your stomach.
