Oh my gosh, it's all about the chili cheese fries here!  If you are any fan, you must order it.   I mean I can only eat chili cheese fries once in a blue moon (I will like to live a decent amount of years), so when I do dive in I want it to be damn good and OH IT IS!  I love how they're thin cut and seasoned to perfection.  Mmmm...how I miss thee!  I'm still trying to find a place that has something similar to this. . . Yeah, the dogs may not be I'm going to die and go to heaven quality (I mean you guys do know what dogs are made of right? hahaha), but the crazy toppings makes it so awesome for a decent price.  . . Oh if you don't want to wait, then don't go during peak hours!!!
