Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
I like martinis.  And I like happy hour.  And Lola's has a wonderful combination of the two.. . Lola's is one of those great places where you can meet a group of friends for happy hour, have a romantic evening with a significant other, or celebrate a special occasion with friends and family.  . . Let's start with the martinis.  They are good, strong, and Lola's has an extensive martini list that should please anybody's palette.  From your basic martini, to fruit infused martinis, and dessert martinis, these martinis are good, and as many people have been saying, STRONG.  Definitely worth the $12.  ($5 on select martinis during happy hour).. . I was pretty impressed with the happy hour menu as well - for $5.50 you can choose among a variety of delicious appetizers including yummy Chicken Satay, Calamari Fritto Misto, Sweet Potato Fries (totally addicting), and mini pizzas.. . Lola's dinner menu is also quite good.  I'm a big fan of the Seasame Crusted Rare Tuna Salad and and the Stir Fried Veggies and Chicken.  A few of my friends also recommended the Burger and the Crab Cakes.. . Prices can be a little steep but the Happy Hour menu is a definite steal.  I'll definitely be coming back.
