Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Chicago is all about two things: construction and BRUNCH. As a longtime Logan Square resident I was of course on my way to Lula this morning with some friends when the 45 min wait  and terrible hangover stomachs caused us to relocate to Dunlays. Like many local residents I was apprehensive about a chain moving into our darling little neighborhood. Turns out I was right. Stale and Generic. From the bloodies to the decor. We waited 25 minutes to be seated which would be fine if the "manager" wasn't so annoyed with his job and I think people in general. The food took almost an hour and was cold. The bloodies were tasteless and awful. Our waitress was a doll but that was totally overshadowed by the slow kitchen, furious manager, and cold food.  Not to mention,  as a waitress myself when people wait that long for food you compensate them somehow. We didn't complain. Why bother . But I did have to write this. Next time, I'll wait th 40 mins at Lula. Life lesson learned.
