Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
So, the other day I was in the mood for Mexican and decided to check out Zocalo. The place is always packed and this is definitely a good sign... or so I thought. As it turns out the food is quite simply ok. The consomm√© which is a watered down version of Mexican posole is definitely not very impressive. The cochinita tacos are also nowhere near authentic. However, the Micheladas are definitely right on... A Mexican Michelada is basically beer served over ice with lime juice, hot sauce, tomato juice salt and pepper with a few variations. That being said the casual atmosphere and the Micheladas make Zocalo a guaranteed good time. Now that the days are heating up its good to know of a place with yummy Micheladas to help cool you down.
