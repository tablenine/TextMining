I'm glad to see that Yelp users have sufficiently lambasted what I thought was an extraordinarily overrated experience.  While I absolutely love the idea of ordering korean bbq late at night, I was missing how its fusion with tacos actually created an allegedly subliminal experience.  Instead, what I got was decent pork marinated in a very spicy sauce that was unceremoniously stuffed into a taco with decent accompaniments.  Is the price point generous?  Absolutely.  Is at least somewhat inventive?  Sure.  Is it even close to the best late night mobile food truck in Los Angeles?  Well, I tried five trucks last night.  I would have rated it right with the Border Grill Truck and just above the Nom Nom Truck (and I'd still go to Nom Nom over Kogi because the line is shorter and the guy serving the food is hilariously awesome).  It definitely did not provide the flair of the Flying Pig truck or the down home goodness of the Grilled Cheese Truck.  Sadly, this was just a three star experience.  I'm not sure I could recommend stalking this truck especially given the long line of fans waiting to try something that simply doesn't stick out in the Los Angeles mobile food truck scene.
