I'm salivating as we speak.  I'm just picturing my first slurp of the soup and I'm tempted to drive down to J-town to surpress my obsession.  The ramen here is sooo darn good!  Kenneth knew my love for soup noodles so he took me here after viewing the 400+ reviews of this tiny restaurant.  Sure, we had to wait for a table  but it was well worth it.  We sat right in front of the wok which was steaming hot.  As I look over the menu, I fell in love.  The daikoku ramen was exactly what I love in my bowl of noodles.  First off, there was a marinated boiled egg, a few slices of pork belly, bean sprouts, green onions and my all time favorite...BAMBOO SHOOTS!  I also added the kotteri flavor which increases the flavor of the soup.  I was not disappointed.  The soup, the noodles...just EVERYTHING was beyond my expectations.  We also ordered gyoza to top things off and that was yummy as well.  I love all the green onions that was placed on top of the gyoza.  It gave a great kick to the whole dish.  . . There is one thing that I need to complain about.  There was no air conditioning.  I was sitting right next to the kitchen and I'm eating a hot bowl of soup noodles and the A/C was nonexistent.  I never sweat but this time, I was sweating like I just finished the L.A. Marathon.  Nonetheless, I will return to this restaurant and munch on MY bowl of noodles.
