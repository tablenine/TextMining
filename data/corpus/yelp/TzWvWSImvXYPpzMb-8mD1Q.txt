There are soo many reviews of this place that I really don't need to write one, but I will.  I love this spot!  It's beautiful little jewel box of a bar is perfect for an after work drink with a friend or a romantic chat.  The drinks are insane and have so many delicious, interesting ingredients.  I had one with freshly grated cinnamon on top---wintery and wonderful.. . Definitely drop by after work if you want to get there before the crowd.
