Would you like a bite of my Hot Italian Sausage?. . After hearing so much about this place It was immediately added to my must try list, and for my birthday a friend of mine asked me where I would like to go, and this was my first choice!. . After not having a decent sausage since i moved out here, coming from Lancaster, PA and having a surplus of German &amp; Italian joints around I'm glad to say that I've finally found a great place to get a good sausage or brat. . . We came in on a Saturday afternoon, and there was not much of a line, but man the place was packed. After we ordered they gave us our number signs and we took a venture around back and ended up sitting outside. They brought us our food no more than 10minutes later, and we dug in!. . MMMmmmmmm!! Finally a real spicy hot Italian sausage just like from back home! It was juicy and grilled just right! top it with sauerkraut and it was perfect! My friend got the Filipino one which was a sweet pork sausage and being the small child she is, she couldn't finish it and I got the last couple bites! It was certainly sweet, and she said it definitely reminded her of Filipino style cooking.. . Overall the place has a very cool feel, and is located in a pretty decent neighborhood, just a few blocks away from Little Tokyo. I recommend it for all who love a good German sausage, and I will be back without a doubt!
