Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The food is amazin! I eat here every month. My favs:. -crawfish (awesome flavor, little meat). -sweet potato fries. -dungeness crab. -friendly service!. . You have to get accustomed to the drawbacks. -ridiculous wait time for dinner (1.5 hrs on a Sunday). -no vegetables (except corn). -no biscuits. Who serves seafood w/o biscuits in the south!?. -only beer and wine. . I highly recommend The Boiling Crab!
