Since I was in the neighborhood and they scored great reviews, I decided to check them out.. . We ordered a few of their salvadoran and mexican dishes.  Although everything tasted okay nothing stood out or warranted the numerous five star ratings.  Although I added a star for their fantastic service, I will be back at a later date to try a few of their other specialties.
