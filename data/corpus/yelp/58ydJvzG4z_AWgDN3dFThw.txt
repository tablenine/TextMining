Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
Cafe Selmarie will always hold a special spot in my heart. . . After my fiancee proposed to me in December (in Giddings Square), we went to Cafe Selmarie which stayed open just for us and a had bottle of champagne and dessert waiting for us. My stomach was full of butterflies and there was so much excitement running through my body that I couldn't eat anything, but I really appreciated everything they did for us. We sat there for a while, sipping champagne and they were in no hurry for us to leave. I will be going there for a wedding cake consultation!!
