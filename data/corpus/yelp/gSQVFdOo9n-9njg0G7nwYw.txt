We were still hungry.... The sushi was fresh, and good, but nothing spectacular, the portions and rolls were tiny, and we were left starving after everyone at the table shelled out $20 a piece.  we had to go to yogurtland afterwards to fill ourselves.. The wait was long, and the service was a tad slow.. If you're a trust fund baby, it's a great place to get sushi.  If you're not, go for lower quality, but at least it's filling sushi, elsewhere in little tokyo.
