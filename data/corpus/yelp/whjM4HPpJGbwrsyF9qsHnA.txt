Excellent food, top-notch service, and a cozy atmosphere that is straight out a movie.  The movie is about this guy who wants to impress this girl by taking her to the most romantic restaurant he can think of.  Naturally he pays for the whole meal because not only is it the gentlemanly thing to do, but because he knows the bill won't break him.
