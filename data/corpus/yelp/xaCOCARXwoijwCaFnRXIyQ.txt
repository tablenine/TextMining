They ignore you when you walk in and it's hard to figure out how to order at first.  -.5stars afterward the service was friendly and helpful. . Aside from that the rest of my experience was great.  what we had. . Chicken salad sandwich: The bread is perfect soft fresh and slightly sweet with a nice chew. The chicken was fresh and clean tasting cut into perfect chunks all breast meat no stringy bits. Dressing was light and flavorful without being to tart. We asked for extra mayo and grain mustard on the side which elevated the sandwich to perfection. . . Croissant w/egg and asparagus: light buttery and served at a perfect temp loved it.  This is one of my favorite croissant I've eating not too buttery not too dry, basically the Goldilocks of croissants. . . Apple Danish: amazing best I've ever had makes all the Costco and supermarket Danishes seem like a cruel cruel joke. Perfect crunch to buttery flaky ratio. Sweetness so light that it didn't over power the flavor of the apples. Generous amounts of apple.  I would stop by just for the Danish.. . this place is worth the trip and effort
