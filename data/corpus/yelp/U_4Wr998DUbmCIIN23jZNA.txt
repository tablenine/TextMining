Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I came here since some friends came from nor cal and were staying in hollywood and wanted some breakfast after a night of partying.. . The boyfriend and I met up with them that morning and took them out the eat at Griddle Cafe!  After hearing so many reviews about them and their portions and plus their pricing, I figured it was best to take them here.. . Coming in with 9 people, I was worried that we would have to wait half the day in line for a table, but the guy was cool and told me it would be a 15-20 minute wait.  Yay!  So about 20 minutes later waiting in the scorching HOT sun, we got seated inside! Yay!  We sat at a booth right below the only working ac vent in the building!  Double YAY!  . . We all took our orders and everything came out excellent!  I got the banana nana pancakes but sadly, mine got lost and it never came out which I wasn't too upset because while I was waiting for those, I shared my boyfriend's baked potatoe omlette which totally filled us and it was really yummy too!  I also got to try the chicago omelette too which was also really good!. . Half of me wish I could try the pancakes as big as my head but half of me was glad that it didn't come out because I don't know how I would have been able to eat it!  Its ok, next time!  It's just another excuse for me to come out here and try it again!  Yum!
