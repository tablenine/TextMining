This was - undoubtedly - the BEST meal I had in Atlanta.  It was absolutely perfect.. . I had a peachtini - yum - tasted like a peach jolly rancher. . My group shared some appetizers - the fried green tomatoes, grilled shrimp, and pulled pork.  All were yummy.  . . Then I had the fried chicken with greens and mac n cheese instead of potatoes and green beans.  Soooooooooooo good.. . I shared the chocolate pecan pie.  It was good - though the key lime sorbet was better.  The crust was just a little gummy on the tart.. . All in all delish - perfect - I'd go here again and recommend it to people visiting ATL
