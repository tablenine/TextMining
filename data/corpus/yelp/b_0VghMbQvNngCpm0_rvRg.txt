I'm sure that this place has a lot of reviews for it already, but I like to document all the places where J. and I have been to, so I must post a review of this restaurant.. . As everyone knows, the bubble tea is probably the best in the city. About 90-95% accurate on that statement. While I have had bubble tea at about a 1/2 doz. other establishments around Chicago, they don't compare to Joy Yee's. However, the bad part about Joy Yee's bubble tea is lack of consistency. For instance, I have been hooked on the avocado bubble tea ever since J. introduced it to me. It's to the point where I've had it at least 10 times in the last month. Sometimes it's really frickin' tasty...great blend of sugar, tapioca and not too watery. On the other side, every 1-in-3 bubble teas isn't at that same level. It can be watery, too syrupy and/or bland. I've had to send a few back so they can get it right.. . As for the food, it can be a bit on the pricey side for "average" food. Like the bubble tea, it can be good, but just as likely it can be...well, not so good. Although eating chicken out of a gutted pineapple or a large, wooden boat is a nice touch; it was just not enough to help out with the rating. Not much else to say about it, since the bubble tea is the main reason to go here.
