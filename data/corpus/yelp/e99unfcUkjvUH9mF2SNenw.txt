I can't believe I never reviewed Joy Yee's, seeing as it's one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Their extensive menu is sometimes hit or miss, but it's more hit than miss.  As has been stated over and over, the best thing here are their bubble teas, they are truly amazing!  They're all freshly made with huge chunks of fruit and they're not overly sweet.   I always tell myself I'm going to get something new, but 7 times out 10, I get a mango lychee freeze like always.   . . I have no idea why, but I've always been stupid lucky about seating here, we've never had to wait more than 15 minutes.  Dining in isn't much better in Evanston, it's still so loud that you can't have a conversation, but at least you get a seat quicker.  . . I love love love love the fried rice with eel.  It's awesome!  Anything with eel is awesome though.  Come here with lots of people and force them order everything you want to taste, that's the best way to do it.  I had some noxious thing with fermented fish and over easy eggs here once, but of course I loved it because I love gross, stinky fish things.  The menu here can be intimidating because it's huge and you don't always get what you expected.  Even if you're not very adventerous, don't worry!  There's tons and tons of "normal" stuff here too.  Vegetarians should try the Buddha's delight, it's really good!  Lots of fresh veggies, yum!  Also,  the Malaysian seafood thing is really really good!  And it comes in a little hollow log with a lid so it tastes better because it's cute.
