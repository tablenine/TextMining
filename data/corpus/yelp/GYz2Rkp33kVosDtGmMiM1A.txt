Restaurant: Carroll Street Caf√©

I love Carroll Street! And I must say after going there a few hundred times for brunch, I've come to realize that it isn't necessarily the food I love but the total experience. . . Don't get me wrong, the food is usually really good whether it is brunch or dinner but I would never describe it as the best...as a matter of fact, I don't think I've ever craved anything off their menu. What I do crave is sitting in one of the cozy corner booths so I can look out at all of the other patrons, check out the art on the wall and the hanging plants on the porches across the street all while sipping on my coffee and talking with my friends. It's just an amazing place that way. When you brunch at Carroll Street on a pretty day, you will feel that all is right with the world for just a little while.. . The service can be spotty and inconsistent but usually not enough to break the spell of the place itself...unless you are just a densely negative person, then it will probably annoy the hell out of you.
