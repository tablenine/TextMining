best thai food so far that i've eaten recently. used to love samnanlang back in the day before they got really popular and they're still good for their noodles, but all the other dishes, esp veggies rock here at ruen pair. the only bummer is that parking gets crowded and you have to accept the fact that some of your chopsticks and dishes aren't as clean as i 'd like them to be. i had to ask for new bowls the last time i was there because they looked stained. anyways, i think that's just the way it goes with some of these hole in the walls. but yummy food. great soup, great veggie dishes and a la cartes!
