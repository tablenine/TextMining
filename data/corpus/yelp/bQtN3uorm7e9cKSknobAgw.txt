Good, but not worthy of all the hoopla surrounding it.  . . Maybe it was my own fault.. I hyped this up in my head to be the end all be all of taco trucks, when in fact, it was only moderate.  We found the Kogi parade in Eagle Rock one Friday afternoon and decided to go for it.  We had tacos, a burrito, and a kimchi quesadilla.  The burrito was the best/tastiest thing we ate, stuffed full of Kogi goodness. The kimchi quesadilla felt really weird- is there something inherently wrong with kimchi + cheese + tortilla?  I like all things in and of themselves, but together I thought *head explodie*.  Turns out, me no likey.  The tacos were decent, but not worth the wait.. . Go, but only if you're in the area and the line is short.
