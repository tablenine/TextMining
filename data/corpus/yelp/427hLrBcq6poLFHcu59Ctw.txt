I give Kogi definite props for blazing a new trail. Using Twitter to draw in a crowd as well as giving people a fun little game of chasing this place around the city-- yep, it's a new frontier being duplicated as we speak.. . The marriage of Korean and Mexican flavors could be disastrous-- can you have too much of a good thing? Don't two rights make a wrong?. . In this case, Kogi does it good enough. I've had their short rib, spicy bbq pork , spicy chicken, and tofu tacos. All of them warmly filled my belly, a nice treat since I caught the truck was going to be down my street after work. The best was probably the short rib. Plus, even though they deal with huge crowds, the staff is very friendly and call out line-cutters if they catch them.. . So whyyy did I give this place 3 stars? I don't know if it's the hype, but something about these tacos fell short for me. It's a taco truck, the best you can get from a truck, but is it worth waiting an hour? Definitely not. If I could wait less than 20 minutes? I definitely would.. . If you have time to kill, are outgoing enough to make friends in line, and enjoy the fusion going on here, hit up the truck. But as for me, I'm hoping at least some of the hipster foodies disperse so I can have a reasonable wait.
