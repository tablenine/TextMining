Very simple yet satisfying food here. Nothing fancy. Slightly overpriced for what you get (ie Gandhi bowl= brown rice + boiled vegetables) came out to be 12 bucks, but the portion was pretty generous so I'd come back regardless.. . Just something i noticed...I hope that people dont misconstrue that just because something is marketed as "healthy" and vegan that it is actually good for you....like most places you have to pick and choose wisely...there are alot of items on this menu that have meat substitutes that are made of soy &amp; are fried. Soy contrary to popular belief is not as healthy as you may think....for this i take off one star because there are other vegan meat substitutes that they couldve incorporated into their menu which would be much healthier than soy.
