Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
I've been to Square One enough times now to know whether my bad experiences there were a fluke.   They weren't, unfortunately.   I had breakfast today that was just not very good.    The Frittata was burned in the little skillet it was served in, and full of disgusting chunks of pork fat that were supposed to be bacon.  And it was tiny for $10.   It wasn't inedible, but the flavors were so off I had to go home and brush my teeth.. . I'm going to give Square One a rest.
