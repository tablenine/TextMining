Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Joan's on Third is a great place.... I call it "The Dean &amp; Deluca of LA". . Come for lunch and the place is packed... and it's nearly impossible to find yourself a table outside, ordering inside can take forever. . . But.... it's worth it. . The food is of outstanding quality. . Prices are quite steep, but good quality. . . It's a feast for the eye to walk around and take a look at their yummie deli selection and imported goodies. . . Love this place.
