Always a great place to end the Hillhurst - Vermont drink and drink walk. we start the night at Vinoteca Farfalla, hit Tangier, and enjoy the Dresden. At the end, I must have my French Toast at Fred 62.. . Some nights it's hard to get a seat and some night drunk ass just falls on a Â chair and I'm being taken care of. Hmmm, at 2am in the morning or whatever God awful time it is, anything tastes good. But I always go for the French toast. Everything thing on the menu is reasonably priced, just like at Norms or Denny's.. . But I'm with friends, good times and eating. That's the best, right? We always try to get to know the waitress. Always some raven haired, tattooed young lady from the east coast with some story that she's trying to make it as a musician or she followed her boyfriend or she escaped some sort of danger from her ex. Blah,blah...I'm totally not listening at this point. Then I realize - moment of clarity - most of my night on the Hillhurst Vermont drink and drink walk has been spent chasing young naive women like this. Then I eat my French Toast, go to sleep then prepare myself to do this again tomorrow night.
