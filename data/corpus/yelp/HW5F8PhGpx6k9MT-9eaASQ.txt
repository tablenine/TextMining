Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Refugiado Â (guava and cream cheese strudel), Parisian chocolate cake, potato balls, chicken sandwich and Cuban sandwich with banana chips...Porto's has it all. I tried to convince myself that they're overrated because Glendale is not short of amazing bakeries (Has anyone tried the "poncheeks" at Art's Bakery??). But I caved. Porto's is amazing and it's very fairly priced. I had a guava and cheese strudel and Cuban coffee for $2.50. When the cashier confirmed with a slightly confused expression, that I was indeed paying for both my pastry and my coffee, my friend laughed at me and told him to overcharge me. I was blown away. Pockets full + stomach full (of good food) = very happy me.
