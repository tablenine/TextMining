A classic meat + 3 sides kind of joint, this place is actually better for it's pasta, in my opinion.. . The spinach tortellini with the creamy marinara sauce (alfredo + marinara mix = genius!) is what keeps me coming back. You can get a meal AND a beer for under $10, and that's what keeps me coming back even more.
