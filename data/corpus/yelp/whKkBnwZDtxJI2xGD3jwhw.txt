I went here for a work team dinner, and they put all 7 of us in our own little private nook. We felt like we had our own private dining room, and didn't need to keep our voices to a minimum. Â It's a classy place all around, and the food was aaaaaaaaaaaawesome!!!! I had the lobster ravioli, and yum-meeee! I can't wait to go back and eat more!
