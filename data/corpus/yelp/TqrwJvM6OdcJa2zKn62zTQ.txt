Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Bread n spread combo is the bomb. Spicy prawn pasta, the bomb. Louisiana shrimp soup was bomb. Garlic prime rib super bomb. Grilled mussels? What's it called? Bomb! Nice hip restaurant. Located among other fancy restaurants but this is one of the best &amp; reasonably priced. Garlic ice cream - the bomb. Curtains separate tables from each other, creating a sense of comfort, privacy n a dimly lit environment creates a subtle romance. Service is okay, nothing particularly good or bad there. Never had to wait in line, maybe except for valet pick up. We r definitely repeat customer n will continue to repeat.
