This one in Studio City and the one in Encino are a lot better than the ones in Glendale's Americana and I assume the other locations. . . Their sashimi are fresh, the crispy rice spicy tuna and the crispy onion albacore sashimi are to die for. My husband, who did not eat raw fish, loved these two items. We could easily be gluttonous anytime we have dinner here.
