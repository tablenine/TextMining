Let me get this out of the way: the food was very good.  We ordered things at a measured pace and they arrived that way.  We constructed a meal out of three appetizers, an entree, and two desserts.  It was all delicious.. . Now with the service.  I had to ask three different people where our waiter was.  I'd say that we waited longer than 20 minutes to see the waiter, which almost prompted me to walk out.  However, she did come, and apologized profusely, and then the manager sent over a free appetizer, and when our entree came, FOUR people delivered it in sort of an attack force, and everything was extremely good.  I would give five stars for this kind of service, except that I'm sure we wouldn't have gotten it if I hadn't made my displeasure known early. . . So, great food; service questionable; manager more than able to make it right.
