Best cubano sandwiches and pastries to-go ever. Such an awesome place to visit, baked pastries everywhere, people searching for what to eat and what to take home for dessert, its an awesome place.. The have this feta cheese, basil, and tomato sandwich on their fresh baked bread thats absolutely wonderful.. Their creme brulee and empanadas are amazing.. I have been here or had family bring desserts and sandwiches from here over two dozen times and never once was i dissapointed
