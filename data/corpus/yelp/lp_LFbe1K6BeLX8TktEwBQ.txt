Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
From word of mouth, I heard about this new seafood shack. This stretch of Buford Hwy is mostly pho shops so it's nice to have a little change of pace. Upon arriving, you'll notice that there are only 3 tables so it's probably better to get take-out. . . On the menu is an assortment of seafood and of course, crayfish. Today, I got the catfish and shrimp meal with an order of crayfish a la carte. The fish and shrimp come either lightly battered in cornmeal, crispy or plain boiled. All meals come with one side and I chose the buttered corn on the cob which was awesome. . . I'm glad this place opened up and I hope they stay a while too. I work close to Buford Hwy and was getting tired of pho, and fast food joints for lunch.
