Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
I think Fred 62 is above average.  For $30 my husband and I enjoy delicious salads and Fat Tire beer for dinner.  The creative atmosphere and menu appeals to me.   The mac and cheese balls are intense, while the burgers and noodles are good.. . We just had a 62nd birthday party here for Fred.  We filled up the table near the entrance with nine people.  The service was pretty good and the owner Fred gave our Fred a free raunchy T-shirt.  People ordered the chicken pot pie (looked very impressive), the brisket (Fred cleaned his plate) and turkey meatloaf (to each his own).  Stick to the beer, though - the wine was not good.. . Parking can be a challenge, depending on the time of day.. . Insider tip: You can drink beer inside, but not outside.
