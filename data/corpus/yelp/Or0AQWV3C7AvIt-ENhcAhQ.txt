MILK it does a body good!  . . Small, local place to get some good comfort food and awesome desserts.  The staff is very friendly and ready to provide suggestions.  Generous portions and oh so delicious!  I had the BBQ meatloaf and it was deliciously filling.  Then I capped off the meal with their toffee milkshake.  An excellent way to end an excellent meal.. . Not great for large groups and parking is difficult, but definitely worth the trip.  I'm sure I'll be back because the food and especially the desserts are just too good to pass up.
