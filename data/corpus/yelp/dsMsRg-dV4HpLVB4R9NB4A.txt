Heard about all the commotion regarding this Korean taco truck, so thought I'd check it out at the JANM in downtown since I was there for a play around the corner anyways on a Thursday night. . . When that white truck w/ the big Kogi sticker came around the corner, people actually got up off the sidewalk, screamed "Kogi" and started clapping.  Wha-???  It seriously seemed like a celebrity siting or something!  All that excitement made me want to start chanting "Kogi Kogi Kogi".. . After a half hour in line, our little crew got spicy pork, tofu, chicken and short ribs tacos (the full taco menu), as well as a burrito (forgot which flavor).  We then walked around the corner, sat in front of the theater and wolfed down our tacos in very cold weather.  I love how it looks like an 'almost' typical Mexican taco, then when you bite into it and taste the sting of the kimchee... woo-hoo!  Flavorful, juicy and tart.  I loved the combination of flavors.  I ordered 3, but really could've eaten 6!  Next time Kogi, next time...
