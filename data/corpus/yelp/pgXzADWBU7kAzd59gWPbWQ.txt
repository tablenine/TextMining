Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This place is almost always packed, when i get lucky and is not, i go ahead and eat there. I just semm to get the same thing everytime, cant really seem to try the specials. and the lie is not at times worth it. Unless I am very hungry or craving pinks, Ill stay otherwise ill just head over to nearby carneys. (which has better chili cheese fries). The thing I love the most is the black cherry soda...its a must!.....everytime i go i order at least three of them.But if ur in LA and love chili, then Pink's is a must!
