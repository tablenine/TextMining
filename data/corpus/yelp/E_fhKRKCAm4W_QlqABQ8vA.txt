Believe the hype!!! I finally got my friends to go, and it was every bit as good as everyone says it is. This is my new spot for KBBQ. I don't think I will want to go anywhere alse after having been here. We ordered a Combo B. It came with a bottle of soju, brisket, galbi (their specialty marinated beef ribs), tri tip, and we substituted the pork neck meat for BBQ pork.  I'm so glad we did because that was my second favorite meat next to the galbi.There was more than enough meat for the four of us, but we ate it all up. I wished there were more galbi and less brisket-it was yummy but that was my least favorite. All the sides were delish, and they brought seconds when we were done with them. I loved the thinly sliced radishes. I put the meat inside and wrapped it up with spicy sauce  yummmmm...We were really stinky when we left, but that's to be expected. Everything was cooked over real charcoal. I can't wait to go again!!!!!
