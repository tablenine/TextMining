Similar sentiments from one of the other reviews.. I came here a few years ago and it was one of my favorite spots.. it has kinda dipped a little... still good, not the same pazzazz though.. . Here's your rundown on why this is a good spot:. . Location-- not much other indian food around this Los Feliz area..so if you live anywhere close to here, this is a great location... . Hours-- not too many places are open past midnight?? so this place does get some props for being open later than most places if you are feelin Indian on a late night. . Bar-- pretty decent bar and a good beer selection too.. . Ambiance-- it is a really good place to have a cozy dinner with your date, especially in the booths. Â A little more private and reserved and the music isnt too loud. . So this is why I'd say this place has slipped just a bit.. . . The food-- it went from being pretty good, to... decent, maybe slightly above average depending on the dish you get... we had the dinner for two with the lamb boti.. lamb could have been seasoned a little more strongly, and cooked a lil more tender,chicken curry was okay (uneven chunk sizes of chicken), the veggie was good though (surprising to hear a meat monster say that huh?). . So take this for what it's worth and decide if you want to come here.. From an LA perspective, I'd call it an neighborhood joint..
