I love this bar. The food is very good and the bartenders are some of the friendliest and most competent in a neighborhood known for sarcastic, impatient bartenders / servers. . . I prefer the cheap mexican beers over PBR tall-boys and this place has a good selection at reasonable prices. . . I will sometimes opt for a PBR bottle, if available, instead of a Tecate (my favorite Mexican beer). My favorite menu item is the black bean and green chili quesadilla; it rocks!
