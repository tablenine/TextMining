Nice to see this spin on the taco truck, late night on Sawtelle. Perhaps a few  more twists might give it something extra, otherwise I see the freshness date on this idea set to expire rather soon. Why not do:. . 1. Kochujang sauce, with a dash of habañero, present it in Tapatio-esque bottles or on the side.. . 2. Iced barley tea, as you often receive with Korean food in restaurants...it must exist in cans somewhere, right?. . 3. Extra kimchi garnish on the side, ala pickeled radish, jalapeno, and carrots commonly available from the burrito bandwagons.. . The branding might work better with the presence of some Hangul script., more for image than function, just further playing up the theme.. . A 2-3 hour wait? Most definitely not. I'm at my limit for 45min to an hour wait for the Shabu Nazi. Not here though, not for this.. . Best of luck Kogi kids.
