Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery

As soon as you walk in, your first thought is "This is going to be an amazing meal", and it never quite does it.  . . I love the look and vibe of this place.  The food is good, don't get me wrong, but it should be a lot better.  The little potato balls are always a good treat, but not much from their menu blows me away.. . However, it's better than 90% of restaurants in the area, and the vibe makes it worth it.  I just wish something on the menu really stood out.
