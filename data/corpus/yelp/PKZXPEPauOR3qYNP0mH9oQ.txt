Best Ramen in town, Enough Said! Well actually, i'll say in Southern Cali! One of the major reasons why I love LA. The pork broth is brewed to perfection, and the chasu is unbelievable awesome with its right tenderness of its noodle. I've fallen in love over and over... . Try it and you will be back for more, and you'll find me almost once a week in here. You'll defintely hear me say Kaikei Oneigaishimasu..
