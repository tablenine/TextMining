Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
DELICIOUS!. . this Porto's bakery location is much better than the one in glendale. bigger, theres more pastries that were much better presented, the lines were really long.. but it seemed to move fast. btw, they have the best red velvet cupcake ive had.
