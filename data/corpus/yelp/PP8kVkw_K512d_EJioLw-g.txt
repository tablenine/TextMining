This place used to be awesome, but it past three years I've been coming here it has been really going downhill.  The food is still the same, just higher prices.  I wouldn't really mind the price increase, but at least have good customer service to go along with it.  I've never come here for the service, but I will leave because of it.. . It is not okay to watch me as I write out the tip and sign the receipt!!!
