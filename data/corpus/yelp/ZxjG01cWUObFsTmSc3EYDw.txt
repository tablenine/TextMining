Good burger, not GREAT burger. Average when you consider the price tag. . . Good to Great to Amazing is all relative to how much you pay for it. Why do Shake Shack &amp; 5 Guys having AMAZING burgers, well because you are paying $5-10. For $20-$30 you'd expect a little more. And thats where Rare Bar misses the mark. . . I brought my gf here last night thinking we could grab a quick bite &amp; head to Rare View for some drinks...Unfortunately Rare View was closed, so we had to settle for dinner here. Together we had the Assortment of Fries, the Frickle, Ribeye Burger, and the off menu Fajita Burger.. . Assortment of fries &amp; dipping sauce was boring. The sauces were good, but the fries were very plain, nothing a typical diner wouldn't serve. Overpriced at $10. Frickle was good, only my second fried pickle, and i really enjoyed the dipping sauce that came with it. And it was priced very well at $5.. . Now on to the mains, the Ribeye Burger was well topped slighty underseasoned and was a good medium rare. But it wasn't mouth watering have to come back amazing and frankly thats what I'd expect for $20+. The Fajita burger was basically a burger wrapped in a tortilla served on a skillet with red/green peppers and onions. Really nothing to write home about. It was just OK.. . However, the wine was quite good. We had the Wishing Tree Shiraz priced at $36 for the bottle, Very well priced for a good wine. This place gets an extra star for that. You got it folks a two star high end burger place earning a third star for well priced wine.
