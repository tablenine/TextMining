Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Crazy that this place has almost as many reviews as NOPA in San Francisco! LA loves their hot dogs. . I must admit I'm a bit of a hot dog snob. I love me some wieners (how do you not make a hot dog review dirty?). I prefer the large girth dogs though, not these skinny ones (that's what she said-ok I'm done being dirty). . My fav dogs are street vendor cream cheese dogs in Seattle that you get after a night of drinking. Nothing like them. Costco ones loaded with spicy mustard and kraut are a close second. I even had a great Chicago style dog at a speakeasy the other day loaded with celery salt, cucumbers, mustard, so good. Ok, you get the point, I LOVE hot dogs. I thought I would LOVE Pink's. . The line wasn't that crazy, we were there a little before 12. My friend and I split the Walk of Fame, which was a 10" topped with coleslaw and tomatoes, and the Lord of the Rings, another 10" topped with BBQ sauce and onion rings. LOTR was definitely the winner of the two, but it was still crossing the finish line way behind most dogs. . Wish we had eaten at Farmer's Market instead.
