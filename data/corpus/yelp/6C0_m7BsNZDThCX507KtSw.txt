The OG place.... . . Well lilo and I were thinking what to do for lunch before a Dodger Game... . . We decided to try this place since we pass it almost everyday and never been in there.. . . We parked and walked inside through the side door and noticed a big counter with a bunch of people standing on what I figured were lines. . . We waited in separate lines to see who would get to the counter first. Lilo won and we began to order. . She ordered a The Beef Dip, macaroni salad, a pickle and Iced tea . . I noticed pickled eggs in a purple juice. It really got my attention. I was thinking it was "Jamaica" juice, but I asked and was told it was BEET JUICE. I ordered one with the LAMB DIP, ColeSlaw, A jar of Mustard and a 16oz Stella. . . We tried to figure out where to sit cause the lines of people were right behind the people sitting at the tables eating. . . I didn't want to be smelling someones ass while I was trying to enjoy my DIP... SO we luckily sat at the very end of a table with no asses rubbing on our backs. . . Lilos BEEF DIP was waaaay better than my lamb. . her Macaroni salad "was all right" . my ColeSlaw was good, especially with the pickled purple egg mixed in it. Turned everything purple... Cool!! . . The Mustard was greeeeat. It was all horse radish with a splash of Grey Pouppon... . . The experience was OK... . . Lots of tourists and white folks, . a few Mexicans including some tacky ones. . It was a big melting pot of people. . Nothing fancy or exciting about this place . . Just a good sandwich.... . . Try it!! See what all the fuss is about! . . GL3
