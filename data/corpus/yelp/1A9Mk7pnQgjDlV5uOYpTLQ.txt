Yamashiro's use to be one of my favorate restaurant / lounges but, over the years their service has gone down hill.  . . I was there one saturday evening (like have have been many times in the past) and the lounge seating was reserved for "diners only".  I asked what happened to the lounge seating and "The Manager" pointed me towards the Bar (which had 2 tables and the seats at the bar) and said, have a good evening.... . We left and went to The Peninsula
