I love this place. It was suggested by someone 2 years ago and have been coming down there ever since. . Sandwiches are amazing. If you are coming down there during lunch call ahead your sandwich or be prepared to wait a long time. . . Ok so the service can be a bit lacking but if you are nice they will be nice. It's an old fashioned deli so you basically stand in line and wait your turn. . If you ever need raw meat they have a butcher too he's one of the owners. . Selection of Italian meats is great. But have to disagree about the the veggie options - ok there aren't that many (well it's an Italian deli). but I thought their veggie sandwich was good. I get it with sundried tomatoes for extra charge but it makes it awesome. . Appearantly they also sell rabitt. It says that on the display case. Never bought it though.. . Grocery stuff is normal overpriced price for the neighborhood. Lots of stuff pickled like atichoke hearts, red peppers and olives. Lots of olives. . Owners Frank and Ralph are really nice once you get to know them. . It's worth a trip
