I was craving HIDE's good quality sushi this week, so I made a drive to Hide and had the most memorable sea urchin, yellow tail, tuna, and salmon. I love Hide. Hide never disappoints me. The sushi is orgasmic goodness that leaves me giddy. I loose myself in the savory goodness of each sushi bite. I just reflect on the greatness of the sushi and think, "this is the most wonderful sushi." Â Hide's sushi never is a bad experience.
