Your typical Greasy Spoon establishment. But how do you think they lasted so long in a dynamic neighborhood? Their food is GOOD.. . It will make your stomach full and happy. For mere 5-6 bucks you get either a plate full of pasta built your own way with available ingredients, or a jerk or lemon pepper chicken with a ton of veggies and starch.. . Don't like killing animals? Get a vegetarian platter and be proud of yourself.. . There are two separate lines for pasta station and chicken station. And if you like chicken, and your date likes pasta, you'll be standing in two lines and paying twice.. Don't ask, I don't know why.. . The place is quite worn out and it's one of those places where I'd think twice before going to the bathroom. . . But did I mention, the food was good?
