Tried the blueberry pancakes, chocolate french toast and regular french toast. Blueberry pancakes were huge, fluffy, and thick but I thought it tasted rather like a blueberry muffin drowned in syrup.  The regular french toast is decent.  Portions are huge, though the taste isn't all that stand out.  Chocolate french toast is good though, warm, and lots of cocoa flavor.  The main room is quite crowded, noisy and busy.. . The manager said that Jessica Alba, and two other fairly big celebs - I forgot the names, came in the same day we were there. Paris Hilton had also called to inquire about the wait.  There are also two private rooms in the back with a sofa, and table. Shared parking lot with Rite Aid, that was pretty full.  Back door is adjacent to the lot, front entrance is on Sunset. A bit hectic here, three and a half stars, rounded up for the scene and the portions.
