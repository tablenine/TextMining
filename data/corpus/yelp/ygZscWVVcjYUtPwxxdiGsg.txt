Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
The Vortex is one of a kind. . . First, you can turn any of their burger fixin's into a veggie burger (nix the bacon, of course), which gives it the biggest vegetarian selection in Midtown BY FAR. I die and go to heaven every time I step in the door - which is often - because it seems like half the menu is vegetarian-friendly. . . The waitstaff and bartenders are great people and the "stuff you should know" list on the front of the menu explicitly states that if you're going to act like an idiot or a jerk, you're going to be treated as such. It's a no-nonsense place where the servers aren't afraid to take a shot at you for asking a question with an answer right in front of your face (reading skills are required), and that is what makes it such a fun place - the regular customers are laid back and easy to talk to. It has a surprising neighborhood bar feel, considering the size and location. . . All said, the Vortex is definitely the kind of place some people will love and others will hate. It's a great place for a weeknight beer or casual dinner with friends, and it's a weekend hot spot for the bartenders' infallible knowledge of all manners of shots, liquor drinks and beers. Weekends get extremely busy since this location is in the middle of the places to be in Midtown, but show up a few times when it's slow and chat the bartenders up, and they'll know your face in no time. At this place, knowing the people is the key when it's busy. . . The food's not half bad either - you haven't eaten at the Vortex until you've had the Nacho Tots - which you can also get vegetarian-style :)
