LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!. . It's really hard to find something wrong with a fantastic 7 course tasting menu, a beautiful bottle of wine, and an over-the-top eager date.. . I'm one of the pickiest people out there when it comes to service at a fine dining restaurant.  If' I"m gonna spend what some people make in a week, I expect perfection!  I must say, Hatfields earned every part of their 25% tip.  For example, I dropped my napkin three times (my date was horny and kept on playing footsies with me) and they replaced it everytime w/o me knowing I even dropped it.  Wow, how's that for service!!!!. . You know,  I've had tasting menus at many places...at most places, the apps are strong, or the dinner, but rarely the dessert.  But wow, all three were strong tonight.  I think I might of found one of my new fav fine dining restaurants in LA.  . . I only yelp when I'm buzzed.  This is the honest truth...and hatfields is the honest sh*t.  . . Bring a date here and she'll want to put out afterwards. But I was a good boy b/c I'm turning over a new leaf in life...yes, I am.  Food slut, but not a slut.
