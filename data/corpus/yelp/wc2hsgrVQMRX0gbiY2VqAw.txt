i can admit when i'm wrong; i'm a full grown adult. that's true.. . anyway. i came to eat dinner with my boyfriend and our friends on my birthday this year. it was totally empty, the food was really good, and their drinks are great. monday night $3 lychee&amp;champagne? sure! it was also cool because the owner of lagunitas was there playing guitar and bought the bar a round. i had a fun time, went home drunk and happy. that's what birthdays are all about. . . also rodan and i share the same birthday. weird?
