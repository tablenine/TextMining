Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Good prices, above average food, super service - a delicious trio, served under ungodly bright lights... Isn't delightful taste enough to illuminate the path of weary bellies? Must you assault my retinas?. . The Pho Cafe is often brimming wall to wall with Silverlake hipsters - those who would ordinarily shun such a bright beacon (or anything that might reveal their unkempt hair - often a sweltering mass in which various rodents find their roost.). . This is a testament to the delicous Pho Cafe.
