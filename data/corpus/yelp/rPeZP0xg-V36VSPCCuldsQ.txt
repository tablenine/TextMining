This is a total LA hipsters hang out, which makes for amusing people watching.  I've eaten at Katella Deli and at Carnegie Deli, and thought that Canter was pretty average.  I got half a pastrami and cup of vegetable soup and he got the grilled cheese and chicken noodle.  The pastrami was sliced thin, I just wish the bread was a bit warmer.  I got a few cookies to go, the guy working at the counter was not the most helpful.
