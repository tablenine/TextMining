Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Although I had one bad experience at Lola's before (hostesses were rude and ignored our questions when the bar was completely empty), I usually have a good time here with friends. It does get crowded and a line forms outside on Friday and Saturday nights, but it moves fast and we usually get in quick since my friend's a regular. The martini options are endless and the cheese plate almost never disappoints. At $10 a piece, the martinis are not cheap, but they're definitely bigger than average and very strong. Try the White Chocolate Martini - absolutely yummy. The bartenders are usually pretty attentive too. And Todd is cute :) Good place to hang out with some friends and even play some pool if you are not there during busy hours when the wait is long).
