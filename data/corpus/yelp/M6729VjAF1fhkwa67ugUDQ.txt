Restaurant: Al Di La Trattoria
Category: Italian
def. in my top 5 restaurants of new york. first visit was incredible. we actually ate in the wine bar which was totally fine. the wait staff is great, the food... the food is incredible. you can't go wrong. it's very crowded but worth the wait. it was 30 minutes at 8pm on Friday. Not so bad. The vibe is that of a great restaurant. busy, serious, casual... people are there to EAT... LOVED the cavatelli and also the pork loin. i'm going back to make sure it wasn't a fluke and that this restaurant is really all that.
