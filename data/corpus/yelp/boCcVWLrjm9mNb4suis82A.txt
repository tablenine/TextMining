Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
I have been eating at Fatt Matt's for years because I live right around the corner. But the close proximity is not why I keep going back. The ribs are fall off the bone tender and the sauce is neither too sweet or smoky...just right. As far as the other menu items, typical bar b q fare. I do eat at other rib joints as well but I will always go to Fatt Matt's if I need to satisfy a major rib craving.
