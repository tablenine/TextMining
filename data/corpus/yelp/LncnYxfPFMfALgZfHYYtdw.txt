OMG. Is that what all the kids say?. This place is awesome. I went here after watching some show on the food network and couldn't have been happier about my food. The pastrami was juicy and tangy and the chili fries were so yummy as well. Make sure you get there early though, we got there at 11 and by 11:30 on a sunday the line was outside of the patio area.. MMMMMmmmmm.
