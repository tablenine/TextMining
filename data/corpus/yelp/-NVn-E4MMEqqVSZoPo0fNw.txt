Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Yamashiro has a great atmosphere and ambiance about it, but the food is sub par when compared to everything else.  When you pull up to the front you are instantly greeted by a spectacular view of Hollywood and pretty much all of LA.  The interior of Yamashiro also has a really nice look to it and is a perfect romantic type of setting for a date or a special occasion.  . If only the food was up to the standards of everything else.  The sushi is some of the least appetizing sushi I have ever had, and I would even go so far as to say that most store bought sushi tastes better and fresher to me then what they serve at Yamashiro.  The entrees are much better, yet still not great.  Like a typical fusion type of restaurant, Yamashiro attempts to mix and match various types of food together that just don't mesh.  At the very least, I would call Yamashiro's food creations interesting.  I just can't say that everything on their menu tastes good and is worthy of the price. . There are a lot of great things about Yamashiro, but the food is not one of them.  Go here if you want to experience a great view and atmosphere, but if you are looking for great food I would suggest looking elsewhere.
