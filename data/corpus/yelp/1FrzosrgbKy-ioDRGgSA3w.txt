If you have had the Pastrami sandwich from here and are also a huge fan of Chris Farley you will know what I mean when I say that I could not get Chris Farley singing "Fat guy in a little coat..." out of my head while looking at my sandwich. My two little slices of rye bread were on my Pastrami like David Spade's tiny blue blazer on Farley's massive frame. . . I want to give Manny's more stars but I can't because for only a few dollars more than my Pastrami sandwich I could have been eating the heaven sent Mango Mole and Pork over at Mixteco. I just don't think a sandwich + 1/2 sandwich and soup + two coffees should come to over $30 dollars. This place makes ANY other sandwich place seem cheap. I also wanted just a little more bread for my mountain of meat because the meat was amazing when tasted with the bread and without the bread it just tasted like heart attack. My matzo ball soup soup was good. I like that there are free coffee refills but after all that meat I couldn't even drink another cup of coffee. . . My favorite thing about this place...the pickles!!! Do not eat so much that you have no room for your pickles. That would be insanity. I ate three pickles today and if I had a death wish I would have had four. Any place that gives you more than one huge pickle is tops in my book if they taste that good. Bonus points for the free parking in back, that's a rare treat in this city!
