Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Honestly, I expected a phenomenal hot dog. ESPECIALLY with the wait of a whopping 60 minutes. I have to say, their fries were better than the dog. Â I would go for the $1.50 Costco hot dog any day over Pink's.. . MENU:. ozzy spice dog - spicy polish dog, nacho cheese, american cheese, grilled onions, guacamole &amp; chopped tomatoes split three ways (this was an afternoon snack) with an order of fries and 3 sodas - orange, cream, and black cherry. . PRICE:. ~$13 total (the meal was on me). . fresh's 2 CENTS:. if one day, you feel like being a tourist with the line-waiting and the not so satisfying hot dog meal afterwards, give it a try, but you'll realize the place is super over-hyped.
