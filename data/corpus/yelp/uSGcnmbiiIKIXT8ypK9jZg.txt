porto's is amazing for cakes and pastries.  they have the best fruit tart in town and they have really good croissants too.  the prices are definitely reasonable.  and its also a great places to have breakfast or lunch....their croissant sandwiches are really great.  definitely can run into a wait her since its so popular but its always worth the wait.
