So my review is more of a 3.5 than 3.  It's actually pushing 4-star, but I feel I've given out a few too many of those.  Plus, it was wicked hot in there on Saturday night.. . Significant other and I went there Saturday night because we were both craving sushi and had to be at Ri-Ra for a birthday thing later on.  The Ri-Ra review comes later.. . First thing, is this place is massive.  I mean, bigger than MF Buckhead large.  It's very open and trendy.  Sometimes trendy bothers me.  Other times, I find it pleasant.  This was more on the pleasant side.  . . Second thing is people watching.  Due to its size and location, Ra is a superb venue for people watching.  I saw silicon in high quantities.  When Significant Other comments on it, you know there is a lot booberiffic exposure.  I saw a guy who was obviously 50+ years old walk in with a girl that was barely out of high school or maybe the Cheetah.  Guy probably makes more money in a month than I do in a year.  I digress.. . The high notes include the appetizer.  We got the Ra Chips n Salsa.  This was awesome.  It was basically Tuna Tartare with Guac and Salsa mixed in using Wonton Chips as the Chip.  This was awesome.  The Rainbow Roll was ok, but nothing stellar.  We also got the Chili Ponzu Roll, which was very good.  . . The best part of the whole dinner was PRICE.  I was fully expecting a MF Buckhead type of bill and walked out for $52 including tip of 20%.  Not too shabby.  4 small carafes of Sake, 2 rolls, and an App for that?  Yep, I will be back.  . . I know the reviews vary here, but I had a pretty good visit with the lady.  Especially since the proximity is good for both of us, we will be back.
