Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Good stuff if you are not a fan of Deep Dish since this is pretty much the exact opposite.  Its a thinner crust that tastes fantastic from the coalfire oven.  Without this oven it would be just ANOTHER pizza, with it though its a masterpiece waiting to be eaten.  ENJOY
