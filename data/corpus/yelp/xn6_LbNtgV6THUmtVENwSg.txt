Restaurant: The Water Grill
Category: Seafood
AWESOME place if you love seafood!  Everything here is fresh.  Oysters = awesome, all the fish = awesome.  . . As for dessert, well...they are just average.  I would stick to the seafood and get dessert somewhere else.. . Parking is a bit hard to find though, so when you get on the block where the restaurant is located, make sure to slow down and carefully look for the valet entrance.  Also, please note that the sign for the restaurant is not obvious.
