Wow.  Never ever will I come here again.  . . We tried about 7-8 dishes.  All terrible.  We didn't even finish any of our food.  I chose to eat bread to fill up.  And the sangria...even the sangria was awful!  How can you screw up sangria??  . . Both my friend and I got sick within an hour of dinner.  woohoo.. . I gave an extra star because we got to eat outside and I like eating outside.  Oh and complimentary valet....gotta love that.. . Don't waste your money.  overpriced garbage.
