Restaurant: Five Seasons Brewing
Category: Pubs
Now that the construction at the Prado is relatively finished, Five Seasons is much more accessible.  No longer do you have to valet - there is plenty of parking.  . . I'm not a beer aficionado, but do appreciate a good microbrew.  The bartenders are friendly and I just tell them what I enjoy in a beer and let them choose what I will have.  Haven't been disappointed yet!  I did not eat here so can't attest to the food, but one of my friends ordered the cheese fries and the fries were smothered with lots of ooey gooey cheese.  Cardiac arrest in the making!. . Atmosphere inside is lodge like and they have a huge patio that looked really nice, especially as it was getting dark and candles were lit on the tables.. . For the service, atmosphere and self parking, I give Five Seasons 4 stars.
