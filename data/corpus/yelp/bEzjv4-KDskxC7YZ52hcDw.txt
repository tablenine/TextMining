Restaurant: Twin Anchors Restaurant &amp; Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Tough to beat Twin Anchors.  Probably not head-and-shoulders-better than other ribs I have had before, but it is tough to beat the atmosphere and the BBQ. . . The BBQ pork baked beans are seriously underrated as a side and should be a part of every meal ordered.  Our waitress last night was amazing as was the food.  Batman fans will enjoy basking in the wake of The Dark Knight, but all will enjoy the ribs/pork/beans.
