WOW WOW WOW. Definitely ran into their truck in Carson's IKEA on a night of mayhem. It was a very long line, but DEFINITELY worth the wait on a cold, windy night with a group of friends. I bought tacos and they were the best I ever had. SERIOUSLY. Hands down. And being drunk did not even account for its amazing taste. I'd definitely want to order 20 next time (no exaggeration there). I can definitely eat it all since it's just soooo damn good.. . REALLY expensive ($2) for small tacos, but idgaf! Like I said earlier, it's waaay too good, and it's worth the 2 bucks for each taco because you can't get it anywhere else.. . YUM! I must run into that truck again. DEFINITELY following it on twitter now. I am currently salivating thinking about how good it is!
