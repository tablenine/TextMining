Restaurant: La Tavola Trattoria
Category: Italian
I cannot believe that I have never told you how much I love La Tavola. One thing that I appreciate about all Fifth Group restaurants is that everything is made from scratch and La Tavola is no exception. The food is great and the prices are appropriate. My honey and I went there for a casual dinner last night. The service was warm and friendly. The orecchiette with house-made sausage was lovely (as always. . . I crave it all the time). The wine menu was impressive with many unique choices. The atmosphere is intimate, but lively and avoids feeling pretentious or stuffy. Â It is a great date spot or place that you can go and feast with friends.
