Too bad this restaurant DOES NOT take reservation!. Even for 12 people!. However to my wait and expectation the food was delicious!. My boyfriend had to order a pizza, a plate of tapas, the Portobello fries and two dessert! (The chocolate souffle and the Peanut Butter Terrine). It was his Birthday so we also had cake... . I would definitely go back for Happy Hour!
