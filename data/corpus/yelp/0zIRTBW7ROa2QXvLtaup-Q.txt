Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
I am a new yorker and I love pizza.  Lets get one thing straight, there is no true NY pizza here (Atlanta) and Antico is not NY pizza, its better.  As Giovanni described " this is street food from Naples".  This also is the reason there are no places to sit, its is supposed to be quick, which is why it only takes 3 minutes to make a pie.  All of the ingredients are imported from Italy (minus the water), in fact while I was there a random dude walked in with 2 boxes of Buffalo Mozz, right from Italy!  . . We ordered the Margarita and the Pomodorini (very similar), and they were both amazing.  If you hang there to eat, they have minced fresh garlic, cheese, oregano, and great little hot peppers ( I found them sweet).  The pizza was perfect, all of the flavors melded together like a bit of heaven!  Definitely stay there and eat and enjoy the great hospitality.
