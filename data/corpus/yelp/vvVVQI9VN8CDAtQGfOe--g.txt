Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's isn't bad, but it isn't that great either. If you want a lot of tacos and aren't overly concerned about quality this is the place to go. I dislike how the parking lot is always overcrowded, it's cash only, seating is limited and the lines are unusually long. I usually just head up the street to Cinco De Mayo where parking is usually available, they take card and the food is better.
