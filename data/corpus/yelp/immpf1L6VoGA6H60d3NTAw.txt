So good! I was super excited to come here because I've been wanting to try their blue velvet cake for months beforehand. Let me tell you that crack cake is AMAZING. It's so moist and blue (it does affect the color of your bm :p) and the frosting is perfect. I love love love it. I really hate that I live so far from this place. . . I came here with my bf and I forgot what he had. I had a salad with chicken and it was pretty good, but I was on a mission for blue cake. We came back again later during our trip to SoCal and took home tres leches (which was alright, not amazing), ultimate chocolate pudding (which is pretty intense and not for the light-hearted), and one more slice of heavenly blue cake. He also got a butterscotch ice cream pop which was pretty good. . . The staff was very friendly and the interior was squishy to spacious. They have outdoor seating as well. I want to try one of everything ahhh. . I would move to LA just for Milk!
