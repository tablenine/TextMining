so i went here for my birthday in december 2007 (that feels sucha long time ago!!) and the experience was ok but nothing special.. . since i had more than 8 people in my party, they told me that minimum order per person had to be $80....i should have reconsidered the restaurant at that point, but being the young 19 year old girl who was going through "i just want to dive into the hollywood experience" phase, it was against my power to say no.. . service was BAAD. also waited 45min for our table (i think the reservation was at 8:30) and by the time we wanted to take pictures with the geishas, they were GONE!. . food was....i don't even remember a.k.a. not that great.. . for the same kind of style, you would probably be much happier at Katsuya which is probably a block or two away.. . pretty much the 2 stars i gave them is for the ambiance. . . one thing that was memorable was their entrance with a bunch of "torii" (red japanese gates seen at shrines).. . cool place, but there's so many other similar restaurants out there with better food and service.
