This is not only a great sports bar wth plenty of energy, but the food here is great as well.  Th service is really nice and quick and the waiter that I had was he nicest guy.  Good dessert recommendation and he even sat down with me for a second to talk.  Very friendly.  The appetizer salad that  I had was really tasty, as it had so many different flavors with the sweetness of the fresh berries (raspberries, blackberries and blueberries) and tropical fruit to the other flavors of the mixed greens, tomatoes and crab meat.  Very delicious.  The entree was a special for the night that was was chamazing with pecan crusted pan seared halicut cheeks with sides of mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus with also a side of sauteed spinach.  I love my greens.  The dish was a hefty portion, but so good.  The combo of sweet potato with the halibut made for a killer taste.  For dessert, the waiter said that the bananas or the peanut butter mousse cake were the best so I went with the mousse cake just becaue he said it was addicting.  It was goo but not the best dessert I've ever had.  Very good though.  I'll have to get the bananas next time.  There are televisions everywhere with plenty of noise abound.  There was about a twenty minute wait but that's fine with me.  I walked some college football and baseball while waiting.  Those crazy Red Sox.  TVs everyweher so no worries there.  This is great for a night out with some buddies or for a business pow-wow.  Enjoy.  It's hard to find, but right behind the Lenox Mall on the first left on Peachtree after the mall.  Surprisingly, priced very well for what you get.
