Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
My favorite korean bbq place in ktown.  Their meat is very high-quality and just so delicious.  Their cold-buckwheat noodles, side dishes and salad are very delicious as well.  My bf tried their chicken soup dish and he loved it ( he said he felt more energetic after, haha :) //  . . Their service is not always consistent.  If you get a good, attentive server, you get a good service.  If not, you kinda get ignored and need wave at the server to get some service.  But usually, their service has been pretty good.  . . These pictures make me hungry!
