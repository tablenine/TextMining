I went to Opera this past Friday for lunch and the food was ok.  I had the sweet &amp; sour chicken (which was a little spicy and took away from the flavor), but the highlight for me was the lobster spring roll...yum, yum.  There's a lot to choose from on the menu and I would definitely go back to try something else on the menu.
