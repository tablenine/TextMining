Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Currently my favorite burger place. Even though I consider myself an adventurous foodie, at the end of the day, there is absolutely nothing that can compare to a cheeseburger and fries. Umami is boutique style, cute, unpretentious. Lovelovelove how the meat is cooked to medium-rare perfection and the extra-crispy fries reminiscent of well-done in n out but in steak fry form. . . Some may complain that the portion is too small, but I say that sometimes less is more.
