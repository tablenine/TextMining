Restaurant: Belly Shack
Category: Latin American
I was really excited about Belly Shack from reading all the reviews. I had the BBQ sammich that everyone was raving about and their blonde brownie dessert which was wonderful..but the there's a vietnamese sanwich ( banh mi thit noung) that is as good and half the price at nhu lan bakery. All around it's a pretty cool place to have a taste of Asian infuse food.. Oh, and there little Asian drinks are way too small, if you're thirsty you are better off getting a regular drink.
