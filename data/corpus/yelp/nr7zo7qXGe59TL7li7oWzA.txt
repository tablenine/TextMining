Wowzers, there are a zillion reviews for Porto's! . . Ah heck, what the hell. Let's add another, shall we?. . I'll keep it short and sweet and I'll try to cook up some new editorial for you inquisitive readers out there. (Is it just me, or is it *yawn* to read the same review from 50 different perspectives?) . . First of all just know that Porto's has been open for a looooong time and I just recently stepped foot inside. Their lines are el terrible' but I thought I'd try it out and find out for myself what all the hype is about.. . Their pastry and dessert cases are so beautiful. It's like the Willy Wonka of pastry and desserts. Their dulce de leche latte gives my usual Starbucks caramel macchiato a run for its money. I liked it so much I had to order it consecutively for the two days I managed to muster up reasons to be at Hollywood Way and Magnolia.. . 5 stars alone to the staff who are quick, efficient, friendly, and smiley. They also ask to see your ID when you pay with your debit card, which is something I can appreciate. At least I can rest assured knowing that a thief can't bamboozle me if he tries to buy some goodies at Porto's! Haha, take that!
