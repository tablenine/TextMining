so, there's basically always a wait at selmarie (and not a very large area to wait in). the breakfast is good (i recommend the wild mushroom omelet) as is the coffee. and the desserts...oh the desserts. its clear that they put the enormous pastry case in the front (next to where you wait) to keep people from leaving while they're waiting for their table (as they inevitably will be).. . the patio is great in the summer; it sits directly on the square and has a good amount of seating. prepare to wait even longer for a seat on the patio.. . basically what i'm getting at here is: DON'T come here if you have a raging hang over and you need some greazy eggs in your system. DO come here if you'd like a lovely brunch with your mother.
