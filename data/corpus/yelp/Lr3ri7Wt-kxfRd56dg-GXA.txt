Wow. I am seriously impressed. After getting the munchies (weeee) and turning to my trusty -Yelp.com- (about late night delivery in my area)....I discovered Bossa Nova. . . After reviewing the extensive menu, I called Bossa Nova at 11:00 PM to place a delivery order (they deliver until 4AM.....score!). . . It's 12:13 AM...(you do the math)...and I have since eaten and enjoyed my delicious "Aurelio's Favorite" Sandwich...(fresh mozzarella cheese, basil, sliced marinated tomatoes, olive oil and black pepper on toasted Italian bread)....and it was delicious!. . Speedy delivery, fresh food, good prices....AND delivery until 4 AM....awesome!!!
