Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Alright so i think it was pumped up a bit too much by Adam (Man vs. Food) but i must say it was pretty good. I had a mixed Manuel's Special Burrito which is not on the menu, but thanks to the great service staff they hooked it up, the gigantic burrito was being placed on the table as i returned from the restroom and since i was starving this gets big props from me for fast service. It was two of us and we thought we could finish the Burrito, man we were wrong. El Tepeyac states that this Burrito feeds about 4, I know for a fact, it can "stuff" 4 people. so they get credit for the huge portions as well.. People kept coming in non stop while i was there and everyone came in with a smile and ready to pig out, im sure..... The restaurant is small, but it seems to be kept very clean and the prices are more than fair. ($16.50 will stuff 4 adults with the Manuel's Burrito). I am definatelly looking forward to go back to try some of their other dishes..... by the way, we arrived around 3:30pm on a Thursday and walked right in and sat down... no waiting..
