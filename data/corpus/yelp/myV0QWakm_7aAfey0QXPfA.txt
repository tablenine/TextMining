I had dinner here Wednesday for the first time, I had read many reviews here before.. . The Sashimi Deluxe platter was $35 and worth every penny.  There was an excellent assortment of raw fish and plenty of it.  Plus there was ample garnish and even some smoked salmon too.  Did I mention raw crab, octopus, king clam, tuna, shrimp and a bunch of other stuff I don't remember.. . The Sashimi + Tempura platter was $26 and also VERY good.  The Sashimi was everything on the deluxe except for the shrimp, just a slightly smaller portion.  Plus the tempura aspect came with 2 shrimp and 3 or 4 large vegetables.. . The staff was very nice and pleasant and I did not have to wait for a table.. . Everything was very nice.. . I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Sashimi.  If you're looking for "exotic" kabuki-esque rolls you probably are not in the right frame of mind for this place.  If you're a carb watcher, this place is an excellent place too.
