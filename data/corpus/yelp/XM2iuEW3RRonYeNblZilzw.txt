Dear Langers, . . I am so sorry for all these years I have neglected to get to know you.  I have always passed over you week after week on the streets but never decided to stop in to see what you were all about.. . I enjoyed everything you had to offer. Your matzo balls were awesome and the chicken soup left me wanting more. Your pickles were perfect and crunchy.  Your fries were so nice and crispy.. . Your #19 didn't fail to deliver and your #88 is such an auspicious number that I had to try it too... pastrami and corned beef, yum.  . . Please forgive me again for neglecting you. I heart you. Let's start dating.. . Love,. Joel
