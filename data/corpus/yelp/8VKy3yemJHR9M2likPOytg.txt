This will probably be one of those "future editing needed" reviews, since I've only had the chocolate milk and fried macaroni cheese balls, but... C'est la vie. What I had was really good, and 24/7 is ALWAYS a good thing (even if it's almost an hour away from where I live). However, the service wasn't that great. But then again... it's got people-watching down pat. Well, hipster/indie people-watching, at least.
