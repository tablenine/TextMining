Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
If you come here thinking you'll get great sushi, you are a FOOL. Accept it for what it is, a place to have a good time and spend lots of $ boozing. Sure, the place looks like crap and smells kind of moldy... but that just adds to the character of the experience. Â It's a place that sets you up perfectly to go clubbing afterwards, assuming you can find transportation to a club.. . The strategy for having a good time: go in a big group (at least 10). The more the merrier holds true at this fine establishment of culinary mediocrity. You order the beer that comes in barrel kegs and what could be more fun than having your friends drink out of the bottom of that keg?. . The entertainment value comes after you order the food and drinks, because at this point its pretty much just a show. (Note: Always assign a designated birthday boy/girl to your group, as this person will be required to dance on his or her chair.) I really liked the birthday dance off (Shirley you got beat by that 7 year old sober boy), the chicken dance on chairs, and the dude that rocks out in the american flag outfit.. . By the end of the night, everyone is having a good time dancing to the music on their chairs. Warning: don't fall, its embarrassing for your friends. If you got the barrel of beer, and there's beer left over at the end, I'd recommend forcing someone to finish it. The alcohol is pretty pricey and you wouldn't want it to go to waste. This is how one of our friends ended up getting lost the entire night, wandered around hollywood alone, and couldn't be found until 5AM the next morning. Tokyo Delves: Where Amazing Happens.. . I'll definitely be back soon, and I can't wait. Just take it for what it is.
