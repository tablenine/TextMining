Of course like most people I came here cuz of TOP CHEF.  But then I fell in love with the food/service here and realized that Tom is definitely the TOP CHEF!. . The servers are wonderful and the food amazing!  The wine sommelier is so nice and has amazing selections.  The sommerlier at Providence could learn a thing or two from him.  . . Also a muffin to take home for the next day is awesome.  Although, I think they should work on the recipe a lil but who am I to complain about something gratis?!. . In any case, my mr.phi and I will be headed down to LA just for the peach tasting menu.  (They have a share in a peach orchard omfgahhhh!)
