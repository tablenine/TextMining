Service is good.  This restaurant is huge.  If you go for dinner later in the evening (like NY'ers do :)  then you won't worry about having to wait long for a table (they don't take reservations on weekends).  The portions are HUGE.  I saw most of the people around us wrap their food to take home.  I got the duck tortellini dish and was not pleased because the sauce was too sweet and the duck filling in the tortellini was extremely dry.  Am also convinced that the food made me sick later that evening.
