Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
this is one of those places that has no advertising (no sign out front) and yet everyone seems to know about it. it's a fantastic value, which makes it (so far) my favorite vietnamese place in LA.. . pho cafe has essentially only 2 items on the menu, pho (soup) and bun (rice noodles).  either dish can be paired with any combination of shrimp, tripe, summer rolls (fried), etc.  the ingredients are super-fresh (they say organic/free-range) and infuse these otherwise conventional dishes with excellent taste.. . as an appetizer, there's "vietnamese crepes" which you put together yourself using thin spring roll wrappers (rice paper), but the wrappers stick together and make eating this otherwise greasy and yummy dish a chore. they also offer spring rolls (not fried, comes with good peanut sauce) and a small selection of asian beer.. . the dining room is one long row of tables on one side and an open kitchen on the other. the glass bulbs that hang over each table are retro hip but bright! the waitstaff is not overly friendly or talkative but attentive and fast.. . the parking lot is small but i've never had trouble finding a spot nearby if it's full.. . (this is an edited version of a review i did elsewhere)
