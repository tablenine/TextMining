Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
When I moved to the bay area several years ago, Roscoe's had opened a new location in Oakland. I drove my high maintenance ass to the ghetto streets of Oakland to get my Roscoe's fix. Sadly the quality didn't compare to the Gower Roscoe's at all.. . People not in-the-know here in the bay area always ask me "Chicken and Waffles? Together?". . Little do they know when their flavor powers combine you will experience something more powerful than Captain Planet and his five little minions.. . Four stars for the chicken - and the waffles. Not to mention the greens and mac salad. Good luck with parking, try not to go during peak hours, and bring money for the meters out front!
