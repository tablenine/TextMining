Pupusas! Pupusas! Pupusas!! Ever since finding out about this wonderful Salvadorean dish, I've been hooked. I ordered two Revueltas (Pork and cheese) and they were delicious!! Chico was a great host and his staff was super friendly and attentive to our big group of Yelpers. Chico suggested a soup for Slicky and it looked friggin' good!! It was a soup with a red broth and the legs of the crabs were hanging off the bowl like it was preparing to immerse itself in the broth. Next time, I'll try other dishes, wearing stretchy pants, so I can waddle myself out.
