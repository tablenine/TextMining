Stop by here after lunch over the weekend to try their pizza that I have heard so much about.  We were there at about 2:30pm, placed our order with the hostess right away with no waiting what so ever and half an hour later I had my little 10" pizza in hands.  Definitely very very good pizza, excellent crust although the dough has an unique taste to it that we could not  figure out but it was good.  Will definitly come back for lunch and looking forward to try more stuff on their menu.
