I LOVE LOVE LOVE garlic, so naturally, I would love this place!!  The roasted garlic is a must-have every time.  soooo good with the bread. yum yum.  I also love the garlic prime rib and the garlic ice cream.   BUT, no 5 stars because I really wish they would be more inventive and add or change their menu!!!  There are much more dishes that can be created with the wonderful garlic flavor.
