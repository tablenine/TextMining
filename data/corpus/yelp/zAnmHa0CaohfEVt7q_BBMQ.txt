My hubby and I came here to celebrate our anniversary because we both have a love of pizza.  We had reservations at 8 and got there a little early and waited at the bar with some glasses of wine until our table was ready.  When we were seated I felt like I had joined another party because the tables were so close!  On one side of us was a cute older couple enjoying their meal and trying just about everything on the menu.  The couple on the other side was discussing how important they are and how much money they make...ick.  Bottom line, the tables are really close together so come ready to cuddle with a stranger.  . . We started out with the arugula and Parmesan salad, which was okay, the vinaigrette was light and refreshing.  We also had the mortadella &amp; prosciutto panini, which was AMAZING and why I give this place 4 stars.  The panini alone was enough for me.  Finally, we had a pizza, which I thought was okay as well.  Our waitress was awesome and attentive to our needs.. . Will I come back? who knows?  The 30-minute wait to make a reservation over the phone is redonk.
