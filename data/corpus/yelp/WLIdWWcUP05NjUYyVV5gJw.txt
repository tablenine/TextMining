Restaurant: Spice Market
Category: Asian Fusion
We hit Spice Market for the first time this week. It was Restaurant Week, but we opted for the regular menu as my wife had already tried some of the dishes offered for the set menu.. . Instead of bread they serve poppadoms. * TIP * Instead of the spicy tomato chutney that accompanies them normally, ask for a side of the cilantro yogurt that comes with the samosas. . We both started off with the samosas. They were okay, kind of greasy and something about the ground meat inside just made them really average. We didn't much care of the Miso soup either. It came with a huge clump of dill on top, and it's flavour was over-powering. It smelled like a bonfire to me! . . For our man dishes we had the green vegetable curry and the pork vindaloo. I'm not a big green curry fan (I prefer panang/red curry base) and so I didn't really like that dish. But, the pork vindaloo I had was excellent. Nice, big chunks of pork and a really really spicy curry base. If you've ever been to England you'll know that a vindaloo is our hottest curry, so this was good.. . My only complaint was that it too came with a huge bushel of herbs on top and it just took away from the overall fragrance of the dish. I think the food is flavourful enough that it doesn't need big pile of weeds and overly-pungent herbs on top.. . Overall, if your looking for good indian food, I think there are better places in town. The atmosphere is good and the service is top-notch.
