We all have them in our family..you know..the Berkeley educated, intellectual, listens to classical music "for the baby" still in the womb no less, Saab literati type. The type that suggests coming here for dinner because anything "New/American" just has to be good and also, because they have a lot of money to blow. First glance at the menu and I'm like....fuckity fuck fuck...what am I going to eat? You see, I'm not a huge fan of meat, and this place is definitely a HUGE fan of meat. Well, I made do. I started off with the sweet onion tart and goat cheese, which immediately gave me hope for this restaurant. I love tarts, and this was a tart unlike any other. Second course, I had the stinging nettle and ricotta tortelli....oh em gee...now I KNOW stinging nettle sounds quite unpleasant, but it tastes similar to spinach and has a high protein content, and honestly, there was no way I was going to eat lobster tagliatelle. It was a great combination with the rich ricotta cheesiness and the perfectly cooked pasta. Satisfied. Having a pregnant woman as one of your dining companions automatically translates into: SHE PICKS DESSERT OR YOU SUFFER THE WRATH!!!!!!!!. So, we had the peanut butter cup, served with caramel gelato, and the dark chocolate mousse, both of which were fantastic. I loved the creamy smoothness of the mousse and the delicate array of flavors coming from the rose cream and syrup infusion.. . Moral of this review? If your yuppie relatives invite you out to dinner, GO!
