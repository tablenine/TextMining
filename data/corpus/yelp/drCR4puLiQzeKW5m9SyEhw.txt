Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Being from the bay, the closest thing to roscoe's was eggo waffles and kfc chicken. Finally got a chance to hit this place up, and I was not disappointed. I was expecting this place to poppin all the time with ridiculously long lines like Pink's, but it was not, maybe due to the time. To my surprise, the menu featured items that are not chicken and waffles. I ordered the house combo with 2 chicken wings, mac and cheese, greens, and cornbread with a side of waffles. The chicken was finger lickin good and the waffles were larger than expected. The side dishes were good as well and portions are generous. I can see why Snoop Dogg eats here all the time.
