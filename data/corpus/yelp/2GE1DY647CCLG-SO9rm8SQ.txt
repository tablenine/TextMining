It's not like this place needs another review, but I liked it alot. Â . Food 5/5, a slim selection, but great taste, I had a burger &amp; sweet potato fries. Drinks 5/5, great beer &amp; wine variety. Price 4/5, a bit pricey, ended up spending $60 on beer &amp; burgers. Service 4/5, friendly staff, but no table service, I had to ask for one of my orders twice b/c they forgot. . Overal 4.5/5
