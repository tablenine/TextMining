Category: Southern
I don't know what Kale B. is talking about...Roscoe's is amazing, sober or otherwise!  . I went to Roscoe's two days in a row, I loved it so much.  The Hollywood location is really cool, cause they have that bouncer guy at the door with a really deep, rattly voice and really great service.  The first day, I got chicken and waffles, cause obviously, you have to get chicken and waffles.  Perfect fried chicken, basically the best I've had (minus the Southern Cafe in Oakland, which is now closed.) The waffles are really good too, though not as crispy as I'd like.  I also got a side of grits- they were drowned in butter, and thus very good.  The second day I went to Roscoe's in Pasadena.  The one in Pasadena lacks the same kind of charm that the one in Hollywood has- it looks like it used to be a McDonalds.  However, the food is just as good.  This time I got the chicken with greens, cornbread, and mac and cheese. SO GOOD! Mmmm.  Next time I need to try the chicken smothered in gravy and onions, and the sweet potato pie.  I would totally make the 6-8 hour drive from the Bay Area just for Roscoe's.
