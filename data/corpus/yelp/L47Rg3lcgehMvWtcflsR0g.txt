FxxK these people!  I hope the jackass lady taking names at the cash register slips and falls on the greasy floors and cracks her rude head open.  I came here on a Friday night with my wife and kids.  Yes, the place was packed. I guess they didn't think we had enough people for them to make money off of us.  When I told her "4", she said "NO, we don't have table for you".  I said "how long".  She said "NO table" and turned away.  She wouldn't even put my name on the list.. . The guys with the big rubber gloves and aprons cleaning the dirty grills right in the open is nice.  I wonder why the floors are all greasy everywhere?
