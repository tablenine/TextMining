Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
Crepes are faaabulous!  Liquor is expensive.  Booze it up elsewhere!. . I'm obsessed with La Creperie.  The chicken and goat cheese crepe is next to heaven.  But!  I love goat cheese.  I would eat goat cheese with Reeses Pieces if I could.. . Ratatouille crepe with goat cheese is fab, too.  Oh, goat cheese!. . Great date spot to boot, especially with the back patio!  Love it back there -- tres cutee!. . Not an everyday spot, but a great one nonetheless for a crepe or two.  Just never order the house red.  Devil's water.
