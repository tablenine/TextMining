I don't often give out this many stars, but for Ciudad I am obliged.  Before moving to LA, about two years ago I came to town to interview for a job across the street twice from Ciudad.  A couple of my to-be co-workers brought me here for lunch.  I only remember the waitress and explaining that the Lakers would never have beaten the Timberwolves in 2004 if Cassell weren't hurt.  That time I had the breaded Chicken Milanesa.  . . I never liked mojitos until I started drinking them here.  One time at happy hour, my boss sent three cougars across from us, shots of Patron silver and then threatened to go over and set me up.  To avoid that humiliation I compromised by going over myself; like my parents had made me apologize for kicking my soccer ball into their car, except that I was kind of into the married one.  . . After being set up for lunch with a girl working in a law firm down the hall, I brought her here after work one night.  I had the soup; I think I always have the chicken tortilla soup, regardless of time of day or size of appetite.  That night their live band played bossa nova.  I liked that she drank beer.  She was the only girl I ever met in LA that I liked more than that tortilla soup.  . . When I lost that job, I went here with the secretary that set me up on that lunch.  I now love the pollo Ciudad as much as the tortilla soup.  I've tried most of the menu, but the chicken here is king.  I never before realized how much of my life in this city has started and ended with this restaurant.
