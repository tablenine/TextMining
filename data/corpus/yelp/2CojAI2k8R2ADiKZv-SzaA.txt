I'm picky about Indian food, but I can easily say that this was the best Indian I've had since coming to the U.S. 18 months ago. Or maybe I've just had really bad luck? Veerasway's curries have an attention to detail and flavor that I really appreciate (anyone can do lentil curry ... but an elegantly flavored careful lentil curry is pretty special... That said, $13 for lentils is kind of annoying).The Paneer was very rich and tasty. The fresh herbs were a nice touch. . . The samosas were delightful. Truly. I'm still thinking about those samosas.. . More vegetarian options would have been good, although we were very happy with the vegetarian dishes we selected. . . Our waitress was a little strange, and took away my friend's wine glass before she'd finished it, which we sort of interpreted as a bit of a F-you because we had declined two suggestions that we order more wine.
