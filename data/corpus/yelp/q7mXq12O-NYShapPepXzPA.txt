THE BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD: Hands down the best pizza in the world! The appetizer menu is scant, but the focal point of this restaurant is the pizza. They only offer pan pizza, with a variety of toppings. The restaurant is small and can seem crowded even with a few patrons. The prices are very reasonable. You can place an order to go, or you can pick up one of their half cooked, frozen pizzas for home. You can also sit at the bar and watch the game. Great place for a date, and yes they are open late.
