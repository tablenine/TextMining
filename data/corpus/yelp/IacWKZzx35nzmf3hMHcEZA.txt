I had a gift certificate from a student of mine, and was really excited to try out a new restaurant this past weekend in the 6 Corners area I have frequented often in the last two years.  . . We were promised a 15 minute wait by a waiter who was filling in at the host station, which became a 45 minute wait while we had a glass of wine at the bar.  15 to 45 never brings anyone joy.  There were three different people covering the host stand: two waiters and one hostess who I don't think ever saw my name written down.  We finally got seated, and had to eventually ask for bread after 15 minutes of seeing other tables with bread!  Like other reviewers have said, the bread and butter were excellent.  Yum!  As for the menu, I had the pesto and chicken with gnocchi-ish pasta which was tasty.  My date never received the soup he ordered :( and then got a mushroom linguini which was sub-par at best: dripping with too much olive oil and lacking any other taste.  Yuck!  The location is awesome, with so many bars around.  I won't be back here :(
