Yummers! Spend a rainy afternoon here, and you won't be disappointed. It was helpful to know that the location is the one with the BLANK sign in the tiny shopping center. The rows of tables give it a nice minimalist touch without the surroundings being too "cold.". . The broth? Fantastic. It kept me warm all the day long. I liked that the ingredients are all very fresh and the service was super sweet. Great beers for $3.50 and warm Saki to help with the doldrums of unemployment. . . This is a straight-forward little restaurant. If you have any sort of common sense, you'll be able to find it. And when ya do, go eat something! Cash only.
