The ramen was definitely what I was expecting and so was the soup base. I got the original Daikuko Ramen and two of my friends got the cold one where they separate the noodle from the soup. However, the soup included in the cold noodle was a bit different than ours, a bit more salty. . . I just with they would give you the ability to add items to the ramen like they do at shinsengumi.
