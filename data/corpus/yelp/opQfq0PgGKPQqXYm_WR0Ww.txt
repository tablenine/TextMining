Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I returned to orochon after a long absence due to a few brave friends who decided to try the special #2 challenge. I'm not one for spicy ramen, but what I had was alright (a bit heavy handed with the bean sprouts though). As I watched 2 out of 4 people in my group complete the challenge, we all applauded their efforts, and proceeded to clown them for such an unneccessary achievement. lol
