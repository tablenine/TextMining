Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Okay, I went back to Roscoe's today because I didn't have a choice.. . This time I ordered Number 13, which was a chicken breast and a waffle. . Dang girl, DANG.. That was the best waffle I've ever tasted in my life, and the Chicken Breast, wtf mate? Uh... I thought it was the whole damn chicken. I was sitting there looking at my friends and wondering why the hell it was so big. I was like, dude, that chicken's breast is bigger than mines. O_O. ...not really, I have pretty big boobs, but that's not the point.. No, really though, it was pretty delicious. The meat was kind of dry but I enjoyed it nonetheless. This time, the waiter did pay attention to us and came to check up on us pretty often. They seated us pretty quickly considering that we had a group of 7 and the restaurant isn't that big. . . I'm definitely a fan of the waffles, but not so much for the chicken. It was a bit too dry for my taste, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.. GG Roscoe's, GG.
