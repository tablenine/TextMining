Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Mediocre food at a local favorite pretty much sums up the appeal of Joy's Noodles. Situated in the heart of Lakeview, the extent of its culinary options include curry, rice, and, as assumed, noodles. While the food is fairly average, the service is generally top rate. This includes the very pleasant tranny hostess (one would expect nothing less from Boystown) and attentive staff. All that being said, its a great place to meet for a BYOB meal where you are sure to see plenty of friends and acquaintances.
