Restaurant: 4th &amp; Swift
Category: American (New)
I was hesitant to visit the restaurant so soon after its opening, but was pleasantly surprised. We visited the restaurant on Friday evening and were greeted by a very approachable and friendly hostess.. . The atmosphere is lovely. Very minimalist with great lighting and modern touches on the table. The silverware is especially fun and interesting. . . Two things that need some tweaking.... The service: Overall, it was quite good as almost everyone was very enthusiastic. They are almost too eager though and we found it disruptive after a point. You guys are doing a great job so take a deep breath and relax a bit.. . The open flame on the table: This part was rather amusing, but could be disastrous. Given the way the menu unfolds, it is easy to innocently get it too close to the small votive set in the middle of the table. I *almost* caught my menu on fire. My companion and I got a laugh out of this, but were holding our noses when the guy next to us actually did set his menu on fire. A burning menu does not produce a pleasant aroma.. . Most importantly, the food was excellent. The crab cake appetizer was amazing and the Market Menu was impressive. However, the most memorable aspect of the dinner was the dessert. And when I say memorable, I don't mean for this meal, but for the rest of my life. We shared the Passion Fruit Sandwich and just about got in a fist fight over who got to finish it. Honestly, they could put the passion fruit part in a jar and I would wear the stuff. . . 4th and Swift is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. As a resident of The Old Fourth Ward, I'm thrilled Chef Jay opened a spot here and will be back soon.
