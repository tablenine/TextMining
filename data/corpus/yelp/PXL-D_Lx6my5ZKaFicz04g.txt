Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I went out to lunch at Umami with a few co-workers knowing that this place had a bit of a buzz surrounding it.  For my meat-loving, burger eating friends that like a nicer ambiance compared to The Counter or even In &amp; Out, this place is for you.  . . Umami makes a handful of different burgers (none vegetarian, of course) such as Pork, Turkey, and even a lamb burger.  I truly enjoyed their Port and Stilton burger and give props to the Umami and the Triple Pork burger.  Each burger is delicately crafted almost like it's ready for a photo-shoot and each burger tastes as delicious as it looks.  Wash it down with some sodas made with real sugar such as Mexican Coke, Sparky Root Beer, etc.. . My only negative comment here is that Umami is a very small place with only a few people on staff so it does take a little longer for them to get the food out quickly or things run out quickly on the menu.
