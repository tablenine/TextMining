after a waitress totally talked this place up, we got there and were sort of let down. it wasn't clearly as cool as she made it seem; however, i could see how if busier, it could have been cool. drinks were pretty standard, prices as well. the crowd sorta sucked when we were there... with the kind of guys who talk to you and then when you give them the polite brush-off, can't take a hint and linger around, until you and your girls decide to venture to a different bar.
