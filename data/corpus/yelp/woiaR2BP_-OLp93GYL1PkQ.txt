Let me say that I am a big fan of fried chicken.  As a kid we had friend chicken all the time, and it's a surprise I haven't had to have a coronary bypass yet.. . The chicken at Roscoes is decent.  Not the absolute best chicken I have ever had, but overall it's very tasty and moist.. . The waffles are also just decent.  Nothing to brag about.. . What makes Roscoe's worthy of a 4 star rating?  Well, the fact that when you put a decent fried chicken with a decent waffle, synergistic magic occurs, and you have a very tasty meal.  It something that at first glance doesn't appear to go well together, but damn it tasted good.  Waffle syrup and fried chicken... hmmm!  I don't know how the locals feel about this place, but if you are from out of town you should definitely make a stop at Roscoe's for some good fried chicken and waffles.
