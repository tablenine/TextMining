Category: Barbeque
I'm a Fox Bros fan through and through. I really can't say anything about about this place - every visit and every meal have been amazing. And as an added bonus, I can smell all the meaty goodness when I take my dog for walks.. . Living less than a mile away from a local BBQ favorite can be quite dangerous. Family coming into town? Take 'em to Fox Bros. In laws want to have dinner, how 'bout Fox Bros? Hungry and tired? Let's get Fox Bros take out! And btw - take out is super easy, fast and the portions are ginormous.. . My first in house experience w/Fox Bros was on the patio for brunch with a big group of friends. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was ok, but I wanted more from this place I'd heard so much about. I remember the service being awesome for our group of 8 or 9 people. . . Then we moved into the neighborhood and got take out twice our first week. YUM. I'm totally sold on the brisket, sliced. The pulled pork is a close second. I'm not a huge fan of the wings though, something about the sauce was not for me. For sides, the only one I think is gross is the fox-a-roni, brunswick stew over mac and cheese. It sounds like it could be awesome, but I couldn't take it. . . The last visit we had great service. We got a drink at the bar while waiting for the fam and were seated right away when they arrived. Our waitress was awesome, perfect mix of helpful but not intrusive. Even when we were sitting around after paying our check and the wait was starting to build she was very professional about scooting us out the door (subtle about clearing our glasses and getting the table ready in advance for the next party). . . I really would like to see this place become an Atlanta institution. Let's keep Fox Bros in business for a long long time.
