Pork belly and al pastor tacos are insanely good! Tacos are small but resonably priced at 2 bucks.  Recommend getting at least 3 tacos.  Inside the staff, atmosphere and music rocked.  After my experience inside I was also really excited about was the pickup window but unfortunately was let down.   On a Sunday afternoon  the service outside wasn't friendly and the wait was long.
