I've been here for both lunch and dinner. It's a nice choice for a downtown business lunch setting.  However, lunch service is a leisurely service that some might consider slow.   The food is good, but I would not put it in the ranks of the top Chicago-area steakhouses.. . Service is attentive.  Appetizer choices seem seafood-centric in that so many of the appetizers include a seafood component (e.g, fried calamari; breaded fried shrimp served with a couple of dipping sauces in a white carton accompanied by chopsticks, crab stuffed mushrooms, etc.).   Lunch portions are right sized and include ample salad selections (many with a protein component), a few sandwiches and some nice entree selections.  Not to be missed are the wonderful string (almost thread-like) french fries.
