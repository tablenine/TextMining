Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
This place is fantastic. First off, the portions are perfect and I do mean perfect. You will finish everything on your plate and feel full but not too full. Know what I mean? Second, the meat is so tender and tasty it'll just melt in your mouth. Last but not least, the onion rings are quite possibly the tastiest I have ever encountered. . The restaurant is tiny but nice, so call up your favorite person and go now!. Oh and for those of you wondering what umami means, it's one of the five tastes. It comes from japanese and means Â savory - as in sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami.
