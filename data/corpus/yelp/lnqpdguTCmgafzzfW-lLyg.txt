NOTE: THIS PLACE IS A BAR WITH FOOD, NOT A RESTAURANT WITH A BAR.. . Well, all I can say about this place is I love the beer selection.  And the food selection is scant but adventurous.  It is basically bar food with a country French twist.  . . Yes the cheeseburger lives up to its reputation.  And there are some exotic eats like bone marrow on baguette slices and bacon wrapped roasted figs.  But don't be surprised if the food is fatty because it is meant to be consumed with beer.  This is not the place to go to DIET!  . . Great beers too.... . Enjoy your fatty day off and hunker down in this place.  But come early as the guests tend to be very territorial over the tables they are saving.  . . Also, bad point is the barbacks are not very knowledgeable about the food nor are they that friendly.  Not your typical neighborhood bar.  Dichotomy between upscale and being a dive.  depends on your visit.
