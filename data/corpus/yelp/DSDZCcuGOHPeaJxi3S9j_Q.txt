Well I have finally had the pleasure of trying Pinks Hot Dogs. I made a last minute trip to Disneyland for my birthday last weekend, I actually booked the hotel Saturday morning after getting off work at 6:30am, went to bed then got up and drove from Phoenix to Anaheim by 10pm that night. Great fun! Monday before I started back home I tried to remember someplace I have always wanted to try in California. The only place that came to mind was Pinks. Of course it was a 50 minute drive in the wrong direction but what the hell right? . .  Â  Well, I arrived to find a rather short line which I was happy about. I was not sure what I wanted to order so I figured I would get one of there special dogs and then have another one the way I usually have my dogs, ketchup, mustard and onions. I ended up with the Brooklyn dog with American instead of Swiss and the previously mentioned dog. The dog with the ketchup was very good and I would go back again for it again but I dont think it would be worth standing in a huge line for. The Brooklyn dog was amazing!! The pastrami was very tender with great flavor. I was not sure it would go well with the dog but it did. I did not try either of the dogs until I was back in my car driving away. If I had I would have ordered another Brooklyn dog it was that good. . . The next time I am in L.A. I will be in line for another dog from Pinks. Another place checked off my list and on to the next.
