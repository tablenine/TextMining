one of our waitresses was kind of a bitch and made it clear that she didn't want to be there. the space was really big and impersonal. we got our food before we got our drinks.. . but on a different note, i think the white eggplant pizza here was probably the best pizza i've ever had. i laid in bed before going to sleep just thinking about it! perfect crust, melt-in-your-mouth cheese, and juicy tasty eggplant with the perfect kick of white chili flakes. would go again just for the pizza.
