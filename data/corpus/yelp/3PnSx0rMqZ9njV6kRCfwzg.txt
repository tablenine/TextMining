The place would be 5 stars if the wait wasn't so long and the service a bit quicker. Came here on a Sunday around 1pm and had 5 people.. . TIP: If you have 6 or more, you can make a reservation.. . We should have found a bum off the street so we could have 6 and make that resevation because we waited for about an hour. We ended up getting the best table in the house, a large booth in the back left corner, but it wa a long wait. . . The food was excellent. The pancakes are large and you get a lot of them. I had the pesto shrimp melt which was great. It came with large pieces of bread and surely was enough for 2 meals. Their steak fries are great and remind me of Red Robin fries.. . Our food did take a while to come out but their kitchen is small and it was packed as usual. Great things can't be rushed I guess.
