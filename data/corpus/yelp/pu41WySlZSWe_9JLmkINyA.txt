Restaurant: Murphy&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Murphy's is definitely one of my favorite places in Atlanta.  Although I've never had dinner at Murphy's, their brunch menu is amazing.  On Saturday/Sunday mornings they have a brunch special that usually contains poached eggs cooked with a mix of different ingredients like spinach, avocado, salsa, etc.  I've enjoyed the special twice so I highly recommend getting it if you can't figure out what you want off the actual menu!. . Some of my other favorites for brunch are Chilaquiles (tortilla, chicken, egg, avocado, salsa and sour cream), Eggs Virginia Highland (their variation of eggs benedict), the Fritattas, and the Crab Cakes Benedict.  You also can't get brunch at Murphy's without one of their refreshing mimosas or bloody mary's.. . They also have a small wine shop with very attentive and knowledgeable staff to help you pick your perfect bottle!  I usually grab a bottle of their wine and take it over across the street to "Wired and Fired" to paint pottery.. . The bar area is quaint and attractive with a view of the dessert counter--sometimes you'll get to see the baker preparing the day's desserts and baked goods :)
