Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The waffles are great. The chicken's good. The sides are ok.  The service sucks.  . . Especially cause this place is busy all the time, be prepared to be neglected by your server and be prepared for dirty looks when you finally need to ask another server for something.  At slow times, the service vastly improves, and i'd give this place 4 stars instead of 3.
