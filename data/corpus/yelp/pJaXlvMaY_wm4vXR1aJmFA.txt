I think this place is overly hyped. The setup is pretty unique in that it has a patio area, a couple of tables and booths and a counter. The prices are quite high for the size and quality of the food.. . I love pastrami sandwiches and I figured that this would be a decent place considering the reviews. So, I took a stroll over to Oinkster as I passed through Eagle Rock. I got the Oinkster Pastrami, my friend had the Cheeseburger with all the fixings (bacon, avocado, chili?), and we shared the Chili Cheese Fries. . . Needless to say, these are Belgian fries and even though I'm not sure what that exactly means, it looked like double-fried fries to me. It had a good crunch, but beyond that, it was bland. The chili on it was bland, it didn't even taste, much less look like chili. The cheese was decent. I had to add some ketchup and some chipotle ketchup to spice it up. But the chipotle ketchup wasn't that special.. . Onto the pastrami, it was smaller than I thought for what I paid for it and it fell apart quite easily. Upon first bite, I noticed that it's not that salty (good), but it lacked some flavor and it was a bit bland. So, I ended up dipping it in the Oinkster mustard and that saved it. The Oinkster mustard was the highlight of my meal. . . As for the cheeseburger, it was ok, but it wasn't anything special. According to my friend, it was like an In &amp; Out burger and The Counter burger mixed together and a bit lacking in flavor despite the plethora of ingredients. . . Also, I tried their special iced tea...it was supposed to tangy and fruity, but it just tasted like watered down iced tea to me. I'm not sure what they're going for, but it just missed the mark.. . Overall, not a great experience and if anything, the Oinkster mustard is pretty good and they should probably just bottle it up and sell it.
