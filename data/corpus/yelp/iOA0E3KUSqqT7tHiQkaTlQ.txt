Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
Finally I tried CUT and $400 later I was completely disappointed!!!. The good- great service from the hostess, to server to food runner, great attention to detail, food runners dropping your food on the table at exactly the same time. . Starters- we started off with the tuna tartare and bone marrow . Â Both were excellent. The bone marrow might have the best I've ever had, great presentation and a must have on the menu. . Now the bad- the bread basket, we had pretzel bread some other brown bread both cold and bland. For this upscale of a steak house you would think wolfgang could serve better bread. Yes I know we are not going for the bread but again attention to details in fine dining steakhouse please! . the steaks- don't eat here unless your ready to order waygu or kobe, you can have a regular ribeye or a filet anywhere. we had the american waygu ribeye and filet both cooked medium rare. Steak was cooked perfectly pink. The taste- waygu and kobe both melt in your mouth however CUT seasons the top of the steak with a layer of salt and pepper which completely ruined the steak for me. Why?? Steak to me should be ordered without sauces or rubs, I wanna taste the natural flavor of the meat. I ended up having to cut the top of my steak off in order to avoid the salt pepper crust- completely overpowering. . The sides- we ordered the potato tarte tartin and the brocolini. Both were very average. The side choices were disappointing as were the desserts which we skipped because nothing seemed that great. . Overall CUT was disappointing. Service and quality of the meat was excellent however taste of the food and menu options need improvement.
