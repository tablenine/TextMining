I went there for my birthday last Saturday night and was quite happy with it. Our waiter was very nice to my young daughter (was not expecting the crayons and paper to be provided, thank you very much indeed) and they were flexible about making her chicken chow fun without any icky green veggies.  (The 4 1/2 year old with the hollow leg ate the whole adult-sized entree!). . I had the Singapore noodles, which were extremely tasty and I would absolutely have them again.  My husband had the black bean shrimp (a tad blah) and the lobster spring rolls were fine if a bit standard (y'know, the mango sauce on the side).. . The chocolate dessert was very nice too, if not very Chinese.. . Overall, if I were looking for a place to go in the south loop I would certainly go back.
