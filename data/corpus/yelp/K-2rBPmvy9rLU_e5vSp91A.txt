The burger here is certainly something different. A good different, but not worth the hype.. . The onion rings ARE amazing. On the other hand, the pickle plate is disappointing and the fries come with a bad homemade ketchup (yuk). If you want to spend ~$20 a person for an above-average burger, then this is the spot. Otherwise, if you want a superior burger you should head to Fathers Office or the Apple Pan.
