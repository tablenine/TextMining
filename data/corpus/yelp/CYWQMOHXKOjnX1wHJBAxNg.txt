Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
YUMMY - just like the Din Tai Fung locations in Singapore, everything here is simply scrumptious!  . . Sad to say however (*sniff*) that this isn't the best dumpling house in L.A. county.  It's fantastic, authentic, and good, but the prices are a nuisance ($$$ instead of $) and sometimes during busier hours (lunchtime, anyone?) everything is just a tad over/undercooked.   Another quandary:  Parking and lines (regardless of the Din Tai Fung Two across the way).. . I'll stick to the hole-in-the-walls to be found in Monterey Park, please.  What, didn't you hear?  Monterey Park is the new Chinatown/Japantown/Koreatown/the-new-black.  It's got EVERYTHING, more than I would have anticipated for a neighbourhood like that ...
