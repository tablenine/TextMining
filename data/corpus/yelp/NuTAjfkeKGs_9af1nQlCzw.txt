3 and a half stars! I always hear about long lines at Toast, but every time I've gone to this place, I was immediately seated by really friendly staff members! But parking is quite difficult to find, so expect to be circling and making numerous U-turns up and down the street.. . The menu is quite extensive, with both breakfast/lunch/dinner items, and a HUGE array of desserts just waiting to be ordered...by me. =) I love breakfast menu items, so I love how they serve breakfast all day! The past few times that I've gone, me and my friends have ordered the French Toast (SO GOOD!), eggs benedict (the bread was a little dry, but the sauce was sooo yummy), and the Portobello Pressed sandwich (LOVE IT). I'm all about the sweet potato fries, and Toast makes some of the best! All of the food was extremely well portioned (I've always had to take leftovers home) and the prices are really reasonable!. . But the best part of Toast, is the red velvet cupcake! Omygah. Its really hard to find a really good red velvet cupcake; most of them either being too dry or the frosting being way too sweet. But Toast really knows how to bake em! The cake is really moist, with just amount of frosting to sweeten just about anyone's day! A definite order for those loving red velvet.. . Overall, a great place to catch all your favorite brunch items, and satisfy your sweet palate. And the staff has always been so nice! A definite place to keep coming back over and over again.
