Sooo happy this location opened!. The parking is a cinch.. The burger is awesome.. I even get excited about the beer. (i'm more of a Wine-O). They have great wines (nice stem ware). I sooo love the Hitachino Nest!  Yum.  . Can get super crowded, but if you're friendly, make some friends, offer someone a beer, and queeze into a boot with 'em.  We've made some fine foodie-friends that way.. Enjoy!
