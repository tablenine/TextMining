Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
We simply loved every aspect of this small and very well-run restaurant.. . The wait was long, but we chose to hang by the small bar in the corner and have some margaritas (which as fantastic!). So the time did fly by. . . Before coming here, I read many yelpers talking about the shrimp tacos. I ordered these bad boys and was more than happy. [high five to yelpers]. The portion sizes for EVERYTHING are GI-NORMOUS. All entrees came with a nice assortment of steamed veggies, rice, refried beans, and guac. Everyone could not finish their plate and had much leftovers for the next day. Â . . El Barco is known for their fried red-snapper and many folks order this entree - looks good but def is for two people. Quite simply, I will be coming back to this restaurant for its great food at a good price.
