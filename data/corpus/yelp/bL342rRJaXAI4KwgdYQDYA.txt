Food is so/so if you decide to partake of dinner in the restaurant portion of the place.  Nothing to write home about but not bad either.... . In the bar part...you can hear the classic tunes of Marty and Elaine (made famous in the movie "Swingers"...sit around the piano for a delightfully entertaining experience!!. . They have a specialty drink that, if you like tropical-esq bevvies, you must try.  It's called, "Blood and Sand"...comes in a martini glass, blended ice, the bottom is a sand color and the top is red.  Yummy goodness.
