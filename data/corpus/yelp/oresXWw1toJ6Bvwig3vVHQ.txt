I love 'em.  It's the chili.  Try a stretch job with grilled onions.  Awesome.. . As ripe as this place is for visit catastrophe I've somehow managed to not have a bad experience.  I've always gotten parking, only once had to wait more than 15 minutes, and I've never had to share the line with anyone more famous than me.  HA!. . $5-$10 per person.  Don't be afraid!  Don't be stuck up!  5 stars.
