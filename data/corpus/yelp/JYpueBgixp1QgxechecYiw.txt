I'm reviewing the weekday breakfast specials only, with this review.  I have had food at other times of the day, but the breakfast is what has a place in my heart.  So I always...always....always get the french toast, 2 eggs easy over and either bacon or veggie sausage.  The french toast is a sour dough bread with cinamon swirl, and then they dip the bread in a batter that is more like a liquidy pancake batter than the traditional milk and egg mixture.  The outcome, delicious!  The price, dirt cheap.  Week-ends the same breakfast costs more and thats cool if you are in for the champaign breakfast (expect lines, and happy drunk people and noises surrounding you).
