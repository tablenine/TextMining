Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
Great place to go for Mexican. The menu is a little bit different from your usual Mexican joint. When you go you must try the Cemita which is their signature sandwich similar to a torta. Theres not much seating in the place but its normally not a problem. Parking on the street isn't to bad, a place can always be found.
