I have been here twice...it would've been 5 stars but the wait is waaaaaaaayyyyyyy tooooo long!!!!  The food is really good...we normally come in a group of 4 (no more than that....then you will wait like 3 hours) and we usually order the King Crab legs and catfish platter (with fries)...You should not wear your favorite clothes to this place - more than likey - you will get dirty.  I recommend that you get bibbed and ask for plenty of napkins.  You have no eating utensils (you use your hands) and no plates.  Everything comes in a bag or a basket...The parking sucks but I must say we have been lucky enough to get a spot the two times we have been there. Yes, they only have about 10 spaces.  I would come here more often but the wait turns me somewhere else.
