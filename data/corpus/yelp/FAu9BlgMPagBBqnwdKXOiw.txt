I am so surprised by the low rating of Fiddlehead Cafe. I have been there for brunch and was uber impressed. . . I love the decor. It was warm and inviting. Many of the hangings and patterns I could see in my own place. The atmosphere was comfy, friendly, and unpretenious. . . The menu was quite impressive as well. I found so many items that I wanted, it was hard to choose. My friend and I were both extremely satisfied with our meals. I also found it impressive that they have such a wide selection of fresh squeezed juices! A perfect morning treat. . . I am looking forward to my next visit at the Fiddlehead Cafe! Maybe next time I'll try it for dinner.
