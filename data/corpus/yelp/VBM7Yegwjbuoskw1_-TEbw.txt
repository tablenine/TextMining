Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Ran into this place by accident today as I was looking for another place.  I'm recently on a quest to find my favorite Ramen in L.A.  I heard about it casually and seeing it jarred my memory that this is the newest "goto" restaurant, at least one not on wheels...   ;). . I ordered the Miso #4 with egg and Garlic added, $9.75 before tip.  #4 is their middle of the road spicy and fine enough if you like heat.  I think going higher is just for fun/torture.  Anyways, it tasted well enough. I personally would have liked green onions to not be something you pay extra for ($1.25) but that's me.  The portion was huge and the noodles were the way I like them... sorta 'springy'... BUT....   I took a nap an hour after eating here and woke up feeling like I ran a marathon in the desert this morning and drank whisky all afternoon.... DEHYDRADED as all hell !   I hate MSG and this place must use it like it's about to expire.   Owner to cook...'Dump as much as you can in each bowl' ... sarcasm alert... don't sue me or Yelp.
