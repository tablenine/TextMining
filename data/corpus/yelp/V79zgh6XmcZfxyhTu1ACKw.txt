Category: American (Traditional)
Thanks to El Jorge's review, we grabbed some pastrami sandwiches from here and I think I just gained another ass.  . . I thought the sandwiches were pretty good but the fries were hella nasty.  If they were intending for it to taste like stale burnt fries, I guess they were on point with that.  . . In any case, I'm glad that we tried it since I'm always driving by it.
