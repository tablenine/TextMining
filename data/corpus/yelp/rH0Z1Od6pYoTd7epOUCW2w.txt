red bean dumplings! my new favorite thing to eat. . i was sad when i dropped my first one, but good thing they come in a tin with 10pcs =]. cute, little swirls of dumpling goodness. a must have!. . i don't usually eat pork, but the juicy pork dumplings were delicious. it didn't have that porky smell or taste to it, so that is a major plus. . we also had the shrimp&amp;pork dumplings which were also very good.. the chicken noodle soup was a good starter. their noodles were perfectly cooked with a chewy bite to it. yum.. . extremely reasonably priced and a definite filler. . dinner or lunch, it will satisfy.
