I really wanted to love love love it here. It is right down the street from my house and so convenient. The atmosphere is great.. it Â could be a great date place.. but casual enough for a night out with friends. Great wine and beer list. And the food was amazing... when we finally got it.. . The way the menu was laid out we ordered some cheeses (to die for), a flat bread (also very yummy), the mussels (pretty decent), and the curry ketchup fries ( by the time we got em.. I was over it). Anyways.. we assumed that the food would come out in courses.. the the kitchen pacing was horrible.. and it took 45 mins for the cheese and flat bread to come out together.. followed 20 mins after that by the mussels and then finally the fries. . . Like I said the food and atmosphere are great (I will agree that the chairs are very uncomfortable!) I will probably give them another try in the future to see if they are able to get their service nailed down!
