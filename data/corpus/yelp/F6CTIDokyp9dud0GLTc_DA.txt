Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
OK...OK...OK...I read all the other reviews and agree with most of them.  I did enjoy being here with friends and having a wonderful meal and people watching.  I just don't get what makes Spago so damn special???  We are all making Puck a VERY wealthy man...I don't even like the guy...and, yes, I have met him (when he was married)...charming and full of "BS"...typical for a celeb chef, I suppose.  Actually, in the restaruants defense, I have eaten here several times and I have never been disappointed...just bored!  I only go here when friends come in from out of state...and it seems to be a "must go to" restaurant...I just shrug my shoulders and bite my lip and go.. I know alot of you will disagree with me, and that is OK.  So, go!  Spend your hard earned money!  Enjoy yourselves!  Just don't ask me to join you (not that you would).  It is difficult enough going several times a year when I really don't want to...maybe I will just say "no" the next time (?).
