I heart this place. As a breakfast lover, this is hands down my favorite breakfast spot in the city. It doesn't matter what you're in the mood for, Shopsin's will have it! The food is creative and downright delicious. You cannot go wrong with any of the following: the Castles (3 perfect sliders topped with fluffy scrambled eggs), the JuJu (fab hash), the Piaf (scrambled eggs on toast covered with a Gruyere cheese sauce and the most perfectly caramelized onions), the Ebelskivers (just try them), the Slutty Cakes (pistachio, cinnamon, pumpkin and peanut butter pancakes), or the Egg Chimichanga skillet dish. Bring your appetite and your patience -- the place is small and the wait can be long. But the food is worth it. . Just an aside, the service attitude is charming in a very New York, off-the-cuff kind of way. If you're not up for a little food service adventure, Â I suggest you do your homework and read up before heading over.
