Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
if i had to pick a restaurant of the year for 2007, Versailles in Culver City would be it - i ate there at least a dozen times.  my first time was back in 2001 and i still haven't tried the other locations.. . Blabber aside, here is what I have eaten (see pics!):. . Pork. 1,2,3,4 (Cuban style roasted, Fried chunk, roasted leg, and grilled pork chops)  - my favorite is #1. . Chicken. 6 (famous garlic chicken) - i hate bones so i've avoided this one ever since . . Beef. 14, 20, 22 (Oxtail stew, shredded beef, tongue) - tongue is my favorite. . Pan Con Bistec Sandwich - bistec is the bastardization of beef steak.  the meat is tough but this order makes a good cheap lunch.  why not spend $2 more for a real meal?. . Sangria - $12 a pitcher (about 6-10 glasses depending on the glass)  vs $2.75 for a small glass.  Definitely do the right thing, por favor.. . Bread - golden-buttered goodness - this time we arrived at 10pm and weren't served any.  Usually I could live off of the bread alone.  I tried putting sugar on it once - I recommend it if you're not fat or diabetic.. . Plantains - it comes with every pork, chicken and beef.  awesome.. . I had some appetizers once upon a time - I can't remember any of them and didn't think that highly of them.  save your money.. . The flan's alright, but fake someone's birthday and maybe get it for free/cheaper?  I don't know.. . I definitely like my beans and rice in the style of Moro (cristiano y moro), which means they mix the rice and beans together, rather than having to swallow the thick soupy black bean goop.. . I recommend coming here after 9pm so you can just sit your ass down upon arrival, instead of waiting forever outside in the cold,  Unless you have a sucker friend who will sit in line for the group.
