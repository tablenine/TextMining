Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
I gave Fred 62 too many chances and they messed it up so many times.... . The first time i went there the waiter told me that I didn't give him enough money two weeks ago. I tried to tell him that I wasn't here two weeks ago then he threatened to call the police if I didn't give him a extra 20 dollars. I was 13 at the time so I just gave him the money thinking that I might have been wronged only to be told later that he basically stole from me.. . Two or three years later I went with my grandpa and my dad. My grandpa ordered coffee and poured in the cream from the metal pitcher that is usually on the diner table. Turns out the cream was old and moldy. We asked the waiter for another cup of coffee and some more cream and he gave us another coffee and the exact same pitcher of cream. Then the hipster moron waiter tried to convince us that it is fresh.. . My dad went another time and had the same problem with soy milk. He tried to order some soy milk for his coffee and got regular milk. The waiter kept telling him that it was soy milk, but you can TASTE the difference. Even though it wasn't soy milk the waiter refused to change it for soy milk.. . this restaurant is full of asshole waiters. I gave Fred 62 too many chances and it failed every single time
