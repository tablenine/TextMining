The coffee here is fantastic. I had the crab-cake sandwich, and it was good, albeit a bit too salty for my taste. A friend ordered the apple/pear slaw, and as another user commented, it's really not so much slaw as strips of fruit. And strips of fruit would be fine if one wasn't expecting slaw.. . A little pricey for what it is, but really great outdoor dining ambience, so I can hardly complain.
