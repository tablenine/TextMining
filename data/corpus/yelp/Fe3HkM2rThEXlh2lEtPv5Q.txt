Delicious.  And authentic.. . My mom and and I drove 40 minutes out of the way to go to this place when I was moving into college at UCLA.. . And it was soooo worth it.  Best dumplings (or rather, "shiao long bao" haha errr please excuse the bad pin yin) ever.. . Yes, it can be painfully crowded...but we were seated reasonably quickly since we were only two people and shared a large table with 2 other parties.  I didn't really mind...too focused on the delicious dumpings!
