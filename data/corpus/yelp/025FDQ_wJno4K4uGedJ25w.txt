Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
4 Stars. . I have been eating items from Portos for awhile now, but today was the first time I was able to visit the Burbank location. The first thing that surprised me was how big the bakery was, not to mention insanely crowded.. . I ordered the a Cubano sandwich, a Spinach and Cheese Danish, and a Chorizo Empanada. The food was delicious and the prices a amazingly low for the quality of food you're getting.. . I love this place.
