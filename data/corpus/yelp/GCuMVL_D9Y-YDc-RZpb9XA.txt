Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I've lived in the area for years and this is place is great.  I've never really liked red bean for someone that's asian.  But after having the red bean dumplings for dessert, it completely changed my mind, that's if I can snag some, my brother would order a whole dozen for himself at times.. . Food: Food is great, especially the Xiao Long Bao and the Red Bean Dumplings. Location/Parking: Location is good that its in a busy area and you have other choices near by, parking isn't that great though, Parking lot is small and I either circle like a vulture OR just park at the supermarket parking lot (or the street).. . Wait: Expect to wait, the most I've waited is about 2.5 hours.  i came down to visit after I had moved to SF and the wait was way longer than usual that particular night.  And of course, like most asian places, there's like 15 people sitting by the podium just hounding the hostess.. . Service: Service is about average, no complaints.. . Price: I think the price is reasonable especially with the quality of food being this good.
