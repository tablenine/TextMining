Restaurant: Varasano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Yes, I know I am a little late to the Varasano's party, but I finally tried this newer Atlanta institution on Sunday. After reading countless reviews I had to see for myself. That said, here goes. . . We had a house special with pepperoni, and one with sausage. When reading the reviews I thought that this place may be like a NY style pizzeria. Upon entering and seeing the pies as well as the menu I now saw that this is an Italian/Euro style pizzeria. Hence seeing so many people compare this to NY style (Lombardi's my favorite) pizza is inaccurate. Having been to Europe many times, I can honestly say this is some of the best Italian style pizza I have had. In Europe, they basically never eat pizza with meat, it is either plain or with one veggie. So the fact that we ordered two meat laden pies shows that European style pies are not my primary forte. The quality of the cheese and char are the crust are great. I prefer a little more flavorful crust and sauce, but that just is not what this style of pizza is about and I understand that. . . I must give this place credit for bringing Italian/Napels style pizza to Atlanta. The service was a bit rushed, but the dining area was clean and the high ceilings were nice.
