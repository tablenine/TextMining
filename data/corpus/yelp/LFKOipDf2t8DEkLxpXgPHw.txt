Okay, so have you ever had something to eat that in your memory is unmatched by anything you ever have going forward in your life... and as the years go bye, the tastiness of the dish grows ever larger in your memory?   Well, that's how the french dip sandwich has been since I had one in 7th grade in Chicago at some random deli I will never find again.  Anyhow, as the case is, the sandwich from Chicago will never be matched but the french dip pastrami and regular pastrami sandwich at Langer's is a close 2nd!  It simply melts in your mouth and is the best pastrami I've had in LA; Johnnie's, the Hat, Philippe's do not even come close...
