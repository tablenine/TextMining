I'll chime in and also say that the cha-dol-something-something is the thing to get here.  The naeng-myun (cold noodles) are good too - but the best part is when the beef is finished, the lady comes by and throws all the leftover panchan, some rice, kimchee, and oil onto the hot stone and cooks up some fried rice.  . . It gets pretty crowded, and the service is typical Korean dive.  In short, don't expect any smiles or help.  I get hooked up because I go with my parents (we're Korean) who have been long time diners here and the restaurant the waitresses used to work at on Lincoln...  If you don't go with a Korean-speaker, just order, eat, pay, get out.  Don't dilly-dally, and don't ask too many questions.  Last time I was there, the (white) woman at the table next to ours kept asking the harried waitress about each panchan (whats this... .ok whats that... and this one).. The waitress sooo wasn't havin' it.  Bitch just shut up and eat!  . . Anyways, Cho Sun Ok is probably the best Korean in Chicago and cheap as hell too.  Better than San Soo G-something which is mediocre at best.  Though Chicago, unfortunately, isn't blessed with great Korean restaurants.
