Seriously like eating in a time-warp.  This place hasn't changed since it opened in the 1940s.  The counter dudes wear little paper hats.  The cheese sandwich is just that- cheese on bread.  Everything comes on pulp-cardboard plates.. . When you're done, they ask you- you want the pie?. . Sure... you think.  What the hell.  One slice of pie.. . Ah, they say- you want ice cream?. . Ice cream may be a bit much.  Ehhhhh..... . You want ice cream with the pie, they assert.  There's a little bit of fire in their eyes.  It's more a statement than a question.. . Yeah, whatever, you say.  Sure.  Ice cream on the pie.. . When the ice cream and pie comes, you may notice- it's the only food item that comes on a proper plate.  They bring it out with a bit of reverence.  It's an apple pie with ice cream!  Am I taking crazy pills?!. . Anyway, an interesting place to get food late at night.
