Their sandwiches are bomb~ esp with the pickled veggies and a Dr. Pepper! Make sure too pick up some ice cream for desert~ enjoy! I've only been there once but yeah, it's a good place.. . EDIT. . I went back today and it's been a while since I last ate here...they don't serve their sandwiches with picked veggies, instead it comes with a salad, which complements the sandwich very well! (Also try their choclate pudding, I hear it's good...) Oh and I got the Media Noche sandwich, delicious!
