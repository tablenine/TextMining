A fun experience, especially if you go when there isn't a long wait (off-peak times). The food isn't too pricey, though it's not cheap. There was less variety in the menu than I was expecting for a place like this, but it was enough. The dogs were good, though a little simplistic. I'm not a big fan of natural casing - so that reveals I'm not a connoseiur of dogs.
