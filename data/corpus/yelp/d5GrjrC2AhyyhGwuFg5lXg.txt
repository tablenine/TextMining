I could have sworn I reviewed this place a long time ago but I guess I was mistaken. Been eating here for a few years. I use to love the noodles.. . Last night, I ordered the pork ramen. It was so damn salty. I couldn't even finish the whole dish. And I LOVE ramen. there's no way i would put the chopsticks down unless it become unbearable. even the waiter came to clear our table wondered what happened. i told him it's way over the top salty and he seemed shocked. he went and told the chefs. i hope they get a clue. this place use to one of my favorite ramen stops. will have to try back again another time.
