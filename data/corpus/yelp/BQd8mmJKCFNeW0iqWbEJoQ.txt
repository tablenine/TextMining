I really enjoy this place.  I have always had great service.  The bartenders are helpful, patient, and knowledgeable.  I was given a tour of their gelatto making process in the back, so I felt special.. . The mixed drinks are inventive, fresh, and tasty.   I really like all the appetizers (that's all I've ever had there) and as someone else said, their food is reasonably priced. . . I like stopping in here for gelatto if I'm feeling too skinny and my lactose intolerance hasn't fucked me up in a while. Bam!
