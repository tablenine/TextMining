Try the Corned beef on rye it's very very good. They usually will bring you a plate of briny pickles.. Pastrami/Corned beef on rye is as good too. Try the Danny Thomas sando. Maybe get a side of home made french fries. .  The coffee: its so bad, its good! black and smells like burn motor oil!. I like the desserts here: black n' whites, hamantash, Horse shoe cookies, plenty of strussels to satisfy.It would be wise to spend 5 minutes and check out all of their baked goodies.  Decor: straight outta the 50's and 60's , kitchy and great fun.. During my college days,  I used to love coming here after perusing the various Art Openings in West LA. Our west coast version of Carnegies in New York. Not the same but it works.
