I won't lie. My first taste of Portos really sucked. It was out of this yellow box, I was down two or three Jack and cokes and this thing called a cheese danish bite wasn't making friends with my tummy.. . But like any ex bf, there exists a second chance - especially if you know he's good (or good at something. sheesh) . . On a slight detour while going to Sun Valley we stopped here around 2pm - and yes, the place was PACKED. We're talking D-land packed people. Crazy lines from the cafe AND bakery. It only took...40 minutes to order and get our food? Shoot, it was worth every morsel. . . Since we hungered, and since I would probably not venture out to Porto's anytime soon we had:. . -1 Meatpie (I'd skip this next time). -1 Chicken Empanada (delicious, juicy, flavorful and melt in your mouth flaky butter crusty yumminess). -Chicken Sandwich (the bread is amazing, the chicken was so juicy and went perfectly with the cheese and tomatoes). -Two fried potato ball things with...meat? (I'm usually not a fan of mashed potatoes, yet that combined with some ground meat was amazing). -Tiramisu (Usually not a fan of this dessert either, but Porto's made me an instant one. Not sure what those choco crunchy bites are, but I sometimes fantasize about them). -Chai latte (Me being asian = not so good with milk stuff, but I LOVE Chai latte, and I had to stop drinking this one in order to prevent myself from getting too sick). . Needless to say I left so incredibly satisfied, full, and probably could still taste the butter on my lips. Did I mention their plantain chips? Yeah, I brought a box home. Did I also mention that I went to the gym twice the next day? . . I probably needed to go 5 times.
