Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
The hot dogs and other food are comparable to any other average hot dog place. Â But you don't come to the Weiner Circle for great food, you come for:. . florescent relish, angry drunk people, cheese fries that you know are pretty gross but something inside of you tell you that they are good so you go with it, hilarious insults that you remember for days, etc.. . This place is DELICIOUS when you're a little drunk, but still pretty good/not bad when you are sober.
