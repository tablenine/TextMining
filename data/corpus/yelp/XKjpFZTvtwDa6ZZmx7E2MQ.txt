I did not expect to fall in love, but I am head OVER heels in LOVE with ilili!. . Before a nearby party on Saturday, 4 of us had a reservation for 830pm.  We ran into 2 other friends outside who were also going to the same party.  ilili happily combined our reservations and the 6 of us sat at a round table in the gorgeous dining room.  We did hang out at the bar first, which was cool, and they have awesome light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.  Only later during dinner did I notice that they are actually all over the restaurant, in little boxes in the walls.  I know, that sounds weird, so you'll have to go and see for yourself.  Additionally, the lounge area looks really cool and comfy.. . Aside from being pleasured visually by this place, my taste buds were in for quite a treat!  It's taken me weeks to write this review, but I just know that everything was awesome.  All of it.  The eggplant, the lamb, the hummus, the lamb, the fries, the lamb, those duck things, and whatever else we had, which was a lot.  We couldn't finish all of it since we were going out after and wanted to avoid food coma after dinner.. . This place is great to bring someone from outta town that likes yummy food.  Or just great to bring anyone to that likes yummy food.
