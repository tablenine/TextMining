After church, David and I came here with Leslie for another wonderful Easter Brunch!  It was just as fabulous as before!  What I love is that for a special buffet; the restaurant was busy, but not over crowded!  The price is really great for what you get and the special drinks...the bloody mary and lavender mimosas, were fantastic!  Our waiter told us that they have these special brunch buffets more often than just Easter, so we'll definitely have to come back again!. . brunch buffet   $40 per person . includes brew coffee and fresh orange or grapefruit juice. . brunch appetizers and entrees . romaine caesar, traditional garnish. winter endive salad, fourme d'ambert blue cheese, pistachios, celery . fresh seasonal fruit . roast berkshire pork loin, salsa verde . traditional buttermilk fried chicken . poppyseed biscuits . homemade sticky buns . eggs benedict, country ham, hollandaise . homemade pork sausages . spinach and goat cheese quiche . cedar plank salmon, bacon, garlic, scallions . creamy anson mill grits . roast fingerling potatoes, sundried tomatoes, black olives . maryland style lump crab cakes, grainy mustard sauce . assorted homemade desserts. assorted breakfast pastries. . I definitely tried everything above and needed to be "rolled" out of the restaurant and into the car!
