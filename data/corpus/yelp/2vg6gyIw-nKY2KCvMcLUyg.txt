CiUDAD was our last minute dinner stop on Saturday night and it was very forgettable.  To start, my friend had the empanadas...which came out barely warm.  I ordered the ceviche which was not bad but not great.  For our main course, my friend had the pollo ciudad and I had the mahi mahi.  Again...nothing great and sorta blech.  If I had to choose, I'd say the pollo ciudad was good.  But that's if I have to choose.  To end, we had the bread pudding which might have been good had it been warm.  But it was not.. . Overall, I wouldn't go back.  Not unless it was dirt cheap and someone drove me from the westside to downtown LA.  It's not worth the money or the gas.
