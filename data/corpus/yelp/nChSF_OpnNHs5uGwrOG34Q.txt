Category: Pizza
A totally different experience!. . The Good:. . Love the atmosphere.  Its a smaller place with limited seating.  There is a small bar with seating while you wait for a seat. . . For an appitizer you should get the Mediterranean bread.  It comes with this "shake" that you put on it.  Its great.. . Pizza is excellent.  Its pizza pot pie.  I dont know if you will find anything else like it in the city.  You can order them in a 1/2 lb or 1 lb, with meat sauce or vegetarian sauce, white or wheat and the only topping is mushrooms (whole mushrooms).. . You have to try the farmers salad.  Its the best.  The cheese is something else.  I dont know what kind it is, but I love it.. . The Bad:. . Not much to say here.  If you come during peak times, you will have to wait... average wait time is about an hour.  I have waited well over before.. . No reservations.. . Cash Only. . Bottom line:  Great place to take someone from out of town.  Great place for a romantic dinner or just dinner with friends.
