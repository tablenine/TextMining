Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
This is the best fish taco you can get for $1.50.  Yeah, Ricky's is better but costs more and he's only around on weekends.. . I've been here a couple times and the few tips I have for maximum enjoyment are:. . 1. Add crema, salsa and guac BEFORE the cabbage.. . 2. Go easy on adding crema, salsa, guac and cabbage, because you will miss how tasty the fish is, if drowned in the other flavors.. . 3. Get a Jamaica, as it's not too sweet and the perfect flavor to wash down the tacos.. . 4. BYOB - you can enjoy your own beers on the patio.. . 5. Order 3 tacos right away, because you know you'll want the third one so why waste time standing around waiting twice?. . 6. Skip the shrimp. I know you want to taste it, but it's not that great so stick with the fish.. . 7. The crema is in a tin pump dispenser on the far left of the salsa bar.  Don't head home without using it.. . 8. The spicy guac is on the far right of the salsa bar.  Use at your own risk.
