Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I went to this place because my friends suggested it and it was mentioned in a book that I read recently.. . It didn't look that impressive: small, lots of wood and brown, rustic decor.. . We all ordered the classic chicken and waffles. I didn't much care for the chicken, but I haven't been a big fan of fried chicken for a long time. The waffles were pretty amazing. I even ordered one more since I had been sharing mine with someone else. Super soft and flavorful.. . I WOULD come back and order the waffles to go sometime, though I probably never will.
