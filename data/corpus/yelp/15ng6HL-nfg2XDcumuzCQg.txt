Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
I'm not super impressed by Medici. They have gone way downhill over the past 5 years.. . My first experiences there were quite good. For ages they had the best pizza in Hyde Park, and I like the decor and ambiance of their dining room. Good sandwiches and great salads.. . Not sure if they changed cooks, but their pizza is not very good anymore. The last time I ordered it, the crust was only half cooked. I recommended it to a friend of mine who was visiting his brother in HP and he didn't like it at all. I go to Florian for my pizza now.. . When I raved about Medici to my girlfriend shortly after we met a couple years ago, we ordered out from there. My pasta was pretty good but her sandwich was just average.. . I'm not totally down on them but there are better choices in Hyde Park, especially for pizza.
