Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Penny's is a decent noodle shop.  I'd say they are consistent in their average-ness.. . The spicy noodles are good, and seem to deliver well.  Also, the cabbage and tomato side dish is really good.  Other things that don't quite deliver so well are their fried wontons, crab rangoon and some dumplings that get Fd up on the way somehow.  . . For being so pan-Asian, Penny's seems rather generic.  The dining area looks nice, but could really be a dining room in any restaurant.  . . 3-stars, Penny's.
