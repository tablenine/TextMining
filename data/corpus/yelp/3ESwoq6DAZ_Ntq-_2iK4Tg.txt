Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
There's nothing special about the (apparently) famous "Father's Office Burger". I found it dry and almost flavorless. Don't try to alter any of the ingredients -- it's not allowed. The policy is posted in writing above the bar. Come on, even Burger King lets you "have it your way". Not Father's Office. For example, the burger comes with bleu cheese, which makes me gag. I was told that if I didn't like bleu cheese, I should order something other than the burger. . . I'm generally willing to try anything once, so I took my chances and ordered the F.O. burger "as is", because I was eager to experience what others were calling "the best burger in L.A." My review of the burger is analogous to my review of Father's Office in general. Over hyped, over rated, and ultimately bland and unmemorable.. . I was there for lunch, so I ordered an iced tea with my burger. They don't have iced tea. I asked for ketchup for my fries. They don't have ketchup. I'm thinking, "Come on, even Burger King has iced tea and ketchup." Not Father's Office.. . Father's Office is exactly like Burger King in certain ways. You have to order at the counter, where you're given a small plastic placard with a number on it. You find a seat somewhere, and wait for the server/busboy to deliver the food. When the place is crowded -- as it often is -- I imagine your food probably gets toured around the entire space before you and your small plastic number are finally located by the server.. . Father's Office exudes the snooty attitude of a trendy gourmet restaurant, with customer service on par with Burger King. The difference is, you pay a lot more and you have to have it "their way".
