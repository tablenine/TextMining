Toast is very Hollywood.   I find the people watching great here because you find all the Hollywood scene stereotypes here.  I'm always amused.  People showing up in flashy cars, girls dressed like Olsen-twin followers and wanna-be/fledgling entertainers.  And there is a wait, so you have plenty of time to people watch and take in your surroundings.. . With all that said, I still enjoy the place.  The brunch menu is a mix of traditional breakfast favs like pancakes and omelettes and healthy low-carb, high-protein L.A.-friendly fare.    I love their breakfast potatoes.  . . If you can, sit inside and eat at one of the comfy couch tables. It makes dining even more relaxing.. . Parking sucks - do valet or prepare to spend a while looking for street parking if it's busy.
