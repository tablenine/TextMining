Restaurant: Wurstk√ºche
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm not really into the whole gourmet hot dog thing and I don't really care for beer, but I still think Wurstkuche is awesome...because tf there are two things I love, it's good music and good french fries, and Wurstkuche has both! Will definitely be back as long as it's not ridiculously crowded.
