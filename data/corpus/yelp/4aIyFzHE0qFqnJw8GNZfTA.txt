9 coworkers and I had an 8:00 reservation and weren't seated until almost 9:00. Yeah, I know.. . Luckily, we spent time at the bar with the great bartender and the manager gave us a couple meat and cheese plates to make up for the long, hunger-pained wait. Still wish they could have done something to get us seated faster. . . Our server was perplexing. He wasn't very personable or helpful. The owner of the company gave him free reign to great a series of plates for us and we ended up with odds and ends without an entree in sight. French fries? Really? If asked to bring out your best food and you bring out french fries, that's a problem. I really think the issue was with the server and not the food though. . . Most things we had were good, and the fried goat cheese balls blew my mind. The oven baked shrimp, though was overcooked and unmemorable. I didn't see one Greek thing about this place, so when I went in thinking we would get some Greek food, I was very confused. The flat bread pizzas were also good, though when we asked to make sure a goat cheese, walnut and date pizza be included in our dinner, they brought out two margherita pizzas instead. Again, what? I like tomato and basil, but is that really the best you can do?. . I'd go back, but make sure to order for myself since I don't think I can trust the servers to make recommendations. The bartender was great, prices were reasonable and if you have a smaller group. you shouldn't have a problem getting seated. Larger groups, beware, though. They apparently only have one big table and you'll be at the mercy of the group seated there ahead of you.
