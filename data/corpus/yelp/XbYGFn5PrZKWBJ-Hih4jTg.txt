Still my favorite steak dining experience this side of the equator. Everything was tip top from beginning to end.. . We started with the kobe steak sashimi, the prime sirloin steak tartare and the bone marrow flan. We then proceeded to wash this down with the 20oz prime Illinois corn-fed bone-in ribeye. I also had the steak topped with marrow. Absolute indulgence. Absolute perfection.. . Best moment of the night came when my friend ordered orange soda. The waiter politely leaned down and whispered into his ear, "hey man, look at me. I'm black, so you know I love orange soda but this is Beverly Hills and they don't drink that stuff here." Classic.. . We beefed it up pretty good, if they had a steak dessert on the menu I probably would've had that too. Perhaps a porterhouse a la mode would be a nice addition. Anyway, I'm just happy I didn't get gout from the debaucherous evening.. . P.S. The pretzel bread should not be missed.
