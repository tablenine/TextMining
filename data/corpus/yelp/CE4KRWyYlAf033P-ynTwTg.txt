3 words to sum this place up - Worst Service Ever. . . Me and a couple girlfriends went here Saturday night. Since they don't take reservations we arrived at 8pm expecting to wait, but for a reasonable amount of time. Well what we were told would be an hour wait ended up being 2 hours! It was unacceptable. The host was seating people left and right that came after us just because the tables that opened up fit their parties, rather than rearranging them to prioritize seating. . . And it didn't stop there, by the time we finally got seated around 10pm, our food service was terrible too! Our appetizer, which had failed to arrive before our main course, we were told would be "on the house" for the long wait. However, they might as well not of even bothered since it didn't come out until we were almost done eating our meal!. . It's unfortunate that a place with such a great atmosphere - exposed brick, dimly lit, with a large wine and beer selection has such notably terrible service. I will not be going back anytime soon but if and when I do it will definitely not be to eat.. . If it weren't for our visit afterwards to Hot Chocolate next door - to end on a decadently sweet note - our night would have been a complete and utter disaster. Dessert had never been more necessary than after our awful dining experience at The Bluebird.
