If the entrees were more filling, I would give this place five stars.  I took some colleagues here and we had a wonderful dining experience.  All the food we ordered was exceptional.  Dumplings, pacific skatewing, short ribs, maine sea scallops (my favorite).  However, we were still starving after two appetizers and our entrees, that we each ordered a dessert to share.  I would recommend not going on a empty stomach, ordering lots of appetizers, and order some sides.  Also, if the bar asks if you would like their homemade tonic... politely decline.  My client called the homemade tonic "dirty dish water."  . . The service was fantastic... our waiter even flagged two cabs for us.
