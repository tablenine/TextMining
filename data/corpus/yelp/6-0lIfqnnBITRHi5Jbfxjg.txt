This Is not a place to eat, its to drink!!! Theres 8 pages of drinks and one page of food. Dont get me wrong, the food is not bad, just not something id write home about or to you. Now the drinks are fantastic, it does get packed so dont go if your claustrophobic. You can dance there if you got the moves. Great atmosphere, friendly people, let go for a margarita!!!!
