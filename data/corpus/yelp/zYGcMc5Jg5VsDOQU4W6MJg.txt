I'll keep this short:. . We were stampeded while waiting in line to pick up our coats from the coat check.  Things got hairy, people were pushing, shoving, several fights were on the verge of breaking out.. . Hub 51 management needs to get a clue.  There were an excess of employees at the bar that Saturday night, why were they all spending their time herding people to the coat check or out the door rather than keeping things under control?  Why were they forcing coat-less patrons out of the door into the snowy night?
