Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
I went to Hae Woon Dae with a large group that was very familiar with Korean foods so I may have had a different opinion if I had been with a less knowledgeable group... but, really, thats sometimes part of the adventure!. . HWD easily accommodated our large group (approx 20) in a room with movable partitions (great idea).  The place is not fancy and I would say rather authentic.  The appetizers / sides (depending on who you ask) were very good and were often refilled and consisted of kimchi, pickled radishes, some sort of potato salad, sprouts, plus others.. . I was told that the kitchen can prepare food hot or "Korean hot".  Frankly, I'm not sure which flavor I had and couldn't tell you what I had unless I saw the menu again (spicy soup with beef ribs).  It was very flavorful.  I tried some meals of others in my group and those were flavorful too although, again, I couldn't tell you what they were (I'm such a caveman... all this variety and unfamiliarity frightens and confuses me).
