1000 reviews!  YES, it's that good.  If you go here you have to order the Burrata Caprese Salad which has roasted tomatoes and a blended basil drizzle and the side of Big Thick Bread to start.  For desert you have to have the salty-sweet Butterscotch Budino.  . The bartender, who looks like Mario Batali, is really great at suggesting wines.  This is unpretentious, delicious food at it's very best.
