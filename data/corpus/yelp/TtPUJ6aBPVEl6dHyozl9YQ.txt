Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
IF you can get a reservation: GO! . the pizza is top notch. Try the proscuitto mozzarella pizza, try the speck, olive tapenade mozzarella pizza, try the tricolore salad with the anchovy dressing (mmmm...how do they make that?! been trying to simulate it iin my kitchen at home!): it seemed to me you could go no wrong with any dish. . Our waitress was a little miss sunshine (not), but the bus boys were on top of refilling the ice tea. Wine comes in Quartinos, very pleased. The place is noisy, so be prepared to yell and be squashed in betwixt everyone else, but since the food is so distractingly good, it does not matter how you are sitting.
