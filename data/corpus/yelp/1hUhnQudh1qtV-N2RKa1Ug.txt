Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
I'm the type that loves a relaxing, slow-paced, late breakfast on the weekends after a night out and Blu Jam is my favorite spot for just such occasions.. . I have never had bad service here. The staff are always quick to accomodate and polite. My favorite menu item is the Hangover Burrito. Yes, I realize hangovers are a common theme for me. Haha. Anyhow, this thing is good! And spicy!. . Blu Jam also has great sandwiches if you're in the mood for that instead of breakfast. Inside has a nice ambiance and not too loud, outside under the umbrellas is nice when the weather is right. Makes for some great people watching on Melrose ave. Actually, one of the nice things about this place is the clientele. Generally its a hip twenties crowd.. . Blu Jam is just plain good all around.
