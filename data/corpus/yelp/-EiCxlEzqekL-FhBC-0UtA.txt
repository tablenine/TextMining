I've walked past this diner a million times but never ventured inside until yesterday. To begin with, they are located in the cutest part of Los Feliz with available outdoor seating...perfect for a sunny California day. The inside booths are eclectic and cozy. The menu is a jack of all trades - I ordered the breakfast burrito while my brother did the sloppy joe, both were scrumptious! Staff was charming, we will definitely repeat!
