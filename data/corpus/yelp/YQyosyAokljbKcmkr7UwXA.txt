Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Again, OVERRATED and EXPENSIVE as heck for just dim sum and dumplings. I've seriously had BETTER elsewhere that was less expensive. Anyway, we ordered the Shanghai Dumplings, Shrimp/Pork Dumplings, Pork Chop Fried Rice, garlic string beans, La Mien, and the Pork Shiaomai and our bill was RIDICULOUS! I was expecting "WOW, we've got to come here again!", but I got "WTF?! I've bought dumplings from the supermarket that's better than this!". Now, I don't mind paying a little extra for GOOD... no... GREAT food, but this place was just a waste of hard earned $$$. . . Another thing I was upset about was... we got there EARLY but in time for their opening yet they still made us wait in the front for about 20 minutes before seating us. There were already people in there EATING! Why couldn't they just seat us at least? When we were finally seated, we still had to wait 15 full minutes for a server to come take our order. The lady who told us to wait one moment just disappeared into thin air and it seemed like the other waiters were too busy to come check if we were taken care of or not. Still, we were very patient and cordial. Anyway, we eventually got served. No one came to check up on us nor did they fill up our tea pot. Come on now, it was NOT even busy! Would I ever eat there again? I might return, who knows? Maybe it was just a bad day for them or maybe they had new inexperienced staff on the floor? I'm all about 2nd chances =). . . I gave this place 2 stars because the restaurant was relatively clean and their garlic string beans and Pork Chop Fried Rice wasn't that bad. There was plenty of parking when we got there but I heard it gets pretty bad on certain days. As far as service and food OVERALL, I've had better.
