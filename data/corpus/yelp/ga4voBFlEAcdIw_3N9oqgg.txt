Dude, the Magic Castle is magic. If you can wrangle an invitation out of someone, as my boyfriend did for my 21st birthday, you can't not go. It's simple math:. . Magic + Alcohol = AMAZING. The castle just sweetens the deal.. . I mean, a wizard brought me free ice cream and sang "Happy Birthday" to me whilst brandishing his wand above my head . A fucking WIZARD! It's just as amazing as it sounds.. . The shows are magical; there are several different show rooms, each featuring a different magician practicing a different type of magic. We saw card tricks in a tiny room that sat only twenty people; we watched prop comedy and stage magic in a huge theatre. One Magicianette could read minds.. . All of this--ALL OF IT!--is mind blowing. . . The magicians are amazing, the mansion is amazing, the food is amazing, the drinks are quite strong (fyi, whiskey sours are fucking gross), and...well, it's fucking magic, what more do you need?. . Five stars, plus props to Pop Haydn for getting me in. There is a reason I made you my honorary grandpa, good sir, and you've yet to disappoint.. . I absolutely cannot wait to go back!
