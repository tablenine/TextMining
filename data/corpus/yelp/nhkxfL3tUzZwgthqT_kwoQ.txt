Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
I had:. . 1) Ban Xeo - Vietnamese Crepe = Yummy. 2) Spring Rolls - Standard . 3) Pho - Pho that was infused with ginger which was good.. . I think the restaurant likes to play hide and seek because there's no sign that let's people know it's the venue they're looking for.  Once you find it, you will be pleasantly surprised with the modern interior decor because at first glance I thought it was going to be one of those restaurants where it looks all pretty with crappy food. But, my expectations were wrong! My favorite dish was the Ban Xeo and the Pho was delicious enough.  . . But the Ban Xeo, that was, uhm fantastic.. . And because they like to lie on their tax forms, they only accept CASH = :-(.
