Order #6, do not pass go, do not look around. there is nothing else to consider!  The yummy tasty chicken that tastes lemony, garlicy, and buttery.  The dish comes with a side of plantains, rice and black beans.  Iz very very good.  Dip the bread you get into the buttery sauce that comes w/ the chicken!. . The cuban sandwiches are ok.  More meat is not always necessarily better.  I think I"ll have to hunt some more to find a better place.  Although I must admit their bread is good.  Thye just need to work on teh filling. (more pickles and mustard, thinner slices of meat and not so dry please!)
