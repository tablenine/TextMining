Restaurant: Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries
Category: Burgers
This place is terrific. The closest thing I have eaten to In N Out on the E. Coast, for a fairly quick burger (definitely better than fatburger in that genre). Excellent burgers, service, fries - and relatively quick. Plus, my wife who is a vegetarian can enjoy their veggie sandwich. . . Outside of the tasty burger, they offer a bevy of free toppings, free peanuts, good hot dogs in a nice clean atmosphere.
