This is not your run of the mill coffee house. It's an experience. I dig the place. My Cousin Hannah &amp; I went for lunch. Cool decor . . I don't get the guy that said "it felt too gay so he ordered to go" Maybe I'm just overly secure with myself? . . The only reason I gave this place 4 instead of five stars is because the service was slow &amp; they were a bit unorganized.. . My only other beef is the intriguing looking couple sitting next to me were speaking in a foreign tongue - Why can't people speak a language I understand when I'm trying to ease drop on there conversation???
