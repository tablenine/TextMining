I know it's called steak. But I was in veal kind of mood. And they cooked up a veal chop that was a scintillating dish.  Off the menu I requested a side of red onions grilled and they did a great job on that.  . . They had Tasmanian Pinot Noir which was a total surprise, almost devilish. Ha! . . Oh, I also had a spinach salad. Solid.. . Bottom line:. Great food . Great wine list. Great service.
