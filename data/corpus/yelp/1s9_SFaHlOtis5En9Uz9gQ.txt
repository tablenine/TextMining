Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
So when we first moved here with no friends and never even set foot in Illinois, let along Chicago, we turned to the only thing we knew.  Food Network.  Pre-Oprah Rachael Ray fans that we are, we had a keen eye on what she was recommending in the Chicago area.  This is one of the first places that caught our eye.  First off, it got us to Roscoe Village and that in and of itself is amazing.  But then, this place made some good food!  The vege-lasagna is (don't tell her!) just as good as my mother's.  Although I'm not a vegetarian, I dislike meat lasagnas and have a hard place finding a good spinach lasagna!  The meatloaf is very good as well...and mmm...mashed potatoes.  The drinks are potent and kind of weird!  All in all this place was very good.  Although the service has been hit or miss but never terrible.  And the space...well...it's tiny!!  But what a fun place to go with retro dcor surrounding you and giving you conversation pieces a plenty!!
