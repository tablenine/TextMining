Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I've been to Palms Thai twice now, and I have to say that I'll keep coming back. The first time was right after the first of the year, and it was just me and my husband. We both ordered fried tofu pad thai. SO GOOD. I haven't had thai food that delicious since back in my college days in Boston and New York. . . The second visit was just a few weeks ago, and we brought some Thai food fiends from out of town. They loved it too. Both of them had some form of curry, and I sampled both. Again...SO GOOD. . . Thai Elvis was there the second time, and we all got a kick out of him. When you add that the food is incredibly reasonably priced to how amazing it tastes, you get an unbeatable place to have a Thai dinner.
