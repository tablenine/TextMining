There are so many reasons this place deserves four stars.. . 1) It's a magical, yellow bus that appears out of nowhere and brings you priceless gobs of joy in a little paper tray for pocket change.. 2) They are actual Belgian Waffles (or shall I say, Waffels?).. 3) If God ate breakfast, this would be His guilty pleasure.. 4) The guy uses Twitter to announce his location -- technologically advanced while maintaining traditional Belgian awesomeness.. 5) They will give you Nutella by the spoonful if you're nice.. . But then there are bad things as well.. . 1) There's always a line.. 2) There's nowhere to eat it after you get it. Not a real problem for me Â because I'm a guy but a real problem for most New York females.. 3) Sure $7 is a small price to pay for this kind of bliss, but $7 adds up and bliss fades quickly.. 4) Once, the machine was broken so I couldn't even order the type of waffle I wanted and on top of that, the guy got the order I didn't really want anyways completely wrong. Thankfully, I was hungry and if you put whipped cream on anything, I consider it edible.. . Since I can't give it 3.5 stars, I'm going to go with 3. It's a treat and all, but if they didn't come to me, I wouldn't go to them.
