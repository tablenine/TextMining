Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Jesus, the line is ALWAYS long and bigger really isn't always better! Pinks is somewhat of a trendy L.A. landmark and the hot dogs are huge in taste and price (for a hot dog!) but I've had cheaper/better at Weinerschnitzel. . . Eh, I'd recommend it if you've never been but don't expect a magical hot dog like the word-of-mouth-around-L.A. claims.
