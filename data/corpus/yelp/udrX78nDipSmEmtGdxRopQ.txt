They need to update the menu. I ate there last week with a friend, I ordered the Earth Burger &amp; it came out w/ some grilled onions and that was it. I asked the server in a very nice way about the lettuce, tomato, etc. that were mentioned in the description on the menu and was told that my particular burger didn't come with anything else on it. I mean it was a good veggie burger and all but pretty plain for $11 and obviously not as described on the menu. I would give more than two stars but I work in the restaurant industry and that bothered me quite a bit... describe your food as it is served &amp; make your customers happy, even if for some odd reason my burger was not "supposed to" come with tomato, etc. would it put someone out too much to offer to get me a slice of tomato and a lettuce leaf. One of my servers would be in trouble if she treated a guest in our restaurant like that. Besides it ups your tips to go that extra step and increases your repeat business which means more money for everyone.
