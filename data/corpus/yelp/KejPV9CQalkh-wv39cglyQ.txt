Fred Macmurray breakfast sandwhich... ohhhh yeahhhh!  That thin crispy fried piece of hashbrown in the center of egg, cheese, sausage and fluffy butter buns makes all the difference.  . For those on diets, come here on your "cheat day" and order the Mac Daddy and Cheese balls: macaroni and cheese rolled up, breaded, and refriend for that added crunch and calorie count.  YUM!!!. For those who come on non cheat days, dont fret there are healthy and tasty salad and sandwhich options on the menu. . Too bad it's always so crowded, especially when you're having that crazy fat craving.
