Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I showed up at Pink's at around 6pm on a Saturday and the line was loooong.  I was able to get a spot right in front which was a welcomed bonus.  We got in line behind a couple and one of their friends, who were soon joined by 3 more people, and then 4 more people, and then another group of people.  I quickly grabbed my friends and went around and in front of this growing mob of people that seemed to know nothing about line etiquette.  . . We ended up waiting about 15 minutes to order, which turned out to be useful because we couldn't make up our mind on what to order.  We opted for the Chilli Cheese Dog.. . The guys serving up the dogs were very friendly and fast. We went to the back and found a nice metal table with an umbrella.    The dog was an incredible mess, but pretty good.  I felt the chili definitely could've had a lot more flavor. . . I'll definitely be going back to this place, although I do wish it was a little less messy.
