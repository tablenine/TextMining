Delicious salads with all kinds of yummy surprises hidden inside.  The bbq tacos are quite tangy and are really good when paired with the slightly sweet rice.  Drinks are hit or miss, but this is all beside the point.. . The reason you come to Cafe Circe is to hear the divine Ms. Francine Reed on Monday nights.  Ask her to sing Wild Women and prepared to tap your toes and leave with a smile on your face.
