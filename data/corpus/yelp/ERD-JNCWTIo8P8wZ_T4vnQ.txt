Hey buddy, yea you in the skinny jeans reading this review. How about some of the wurst i mean the wuuuurstkuche in downtown not located on skidrow? If you're brave enough to try this place out you will be very pleased! Great beer, soda and sausage selection ranging from the norms all the way to more exotic choices like alligator, rattlesnake, buffalo, bunny, duck and some other ones that will make you go ew. Unless you're Bear Grylls that is..               I had a Spaten optimator $6 brew with a rattlesnake and bunny sausage $7.50. The corazon had a vanilla cream soda $3 with the duck and bacon sausage $7.50. Also ordered some belgian fries $3.50 in truffle oil (extra $1.50) with a side of curry ketchup. Everything was great! Juicy tasty and crispy! I will be returning next time i'm in the neighborhood to try the alligator! I've always wondered what those cute bastards taste like.
