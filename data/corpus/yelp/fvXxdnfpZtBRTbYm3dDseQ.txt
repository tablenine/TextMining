I met my fiance at the bar and asked the bartender to reccommend a good beer for me *long hours at work on my feet all day.* Ended up giving me a great beer with excellent service.. . Headed over to our table with our server Rachel. She was excellent. She gave great recommendations when needed, and was attentive and always smiling. . . The food...THE FOOD! Mouthwatering. We had the lamb shank *which was so tender you didn't even need a knife* and the double filets which had a wonderful smoky taste. *Unbelievable!* The wine list, desserts, and apps were also amazing.. . The only downside I can think of is that it is a little noisy and tables are small. But honest to god, who cares? You're there for the food and experience!!!
