My first experience here was 2 stars, my last experience (yesterday 3/2) was 5 stars. So i thought that a 4 star would be a good balance. . . 1st experience: 3 weeks after it opened. Ordered the pizza with oregano and clams and the fennel sausage. The crusts were burnt and dried. No moisture or chewiness. Too much fennel on the sausage pizza. Just plain bad pizza. The salad was greens with wild mushrooms. It was just arugula with button mushrooms. I would think if Batali would put his name on something, he would have some quality control on the product coming out of the kitchen :(. . 2nd experience: best damn pizza I've ever had. My favorite pizza place is pizza antica in marina del ray (chewy, thin, charred crust, simple sauce, true Naples style). however pizzeria mozza is slowly catching up (still has a long way to go). had the lamb stroggato (stewed lamb), escarole, salsa verde pizza. They improved the crust tenfold since the last time i ate it. light, airy, crispy, moist. it was perfect. and the toppings worked perfectly with one another. it didn't hurt that they used my favorite sauce of all time (salsa verde: parsley, vinegar, olive oil, capers, anchovies) on the pizza. had a quartino of wine and the butterscotch budino (sea salt and caramel makes me :)   )   waited only 30 seconds for a bar seat, but the line grew right after we sat down. need to come at the right time to get seats fast, or you can reserve a table (weeks in advanced). highly recommend it. . . did i mention they serve the perfect crust for a pizza?
