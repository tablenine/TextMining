My girlfriend and I visited Takashi back in May 2009.  We had the latest reservations on the books, and ended up being about 7 or so minutes late.  We both felt terrible, (both of us were in the service industry at the time) but everyone there was pretty cool about it.  They told us as long as we were somewhat quick about ordering everything would be fine.  .      This being a retrospective review, I don't remember everything we had.  That being said, two things were unforgettable:. . 1. Scallops w/ Soba gnocchi-  One of my three favorite items of food in my entire life.  Foams usually do little for me, but this one actually added to the flavor and texture.  Granted, these type dishes are often some of my favorites.. but, this one I will remember.  . 2. Beef Carpaccio-  Another standard of my girlfriend and I's.  Yet certainly better than your average "fancy" restaurant standards.  Melts in your mouth.  . .     Our entrees were excellent as well, not as good as the apps.  We never felt rushed, despite our tardiness.  On our way out the door we were informed that Chicken in a Clay Pot won some award, or something to that regard.  We got the usual 'if you come back to Chicago, you gotta try it'.  I guess my Yelping and restaurant research failed me here.
