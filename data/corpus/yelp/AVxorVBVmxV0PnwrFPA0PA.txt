Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Best prime rib I have every had! Juicy, tender, silky, delicate, inspiring....... :). And the way our waitress prepared our salad, impressive (sorry, I just dont like vegetables. But I am sure it was some very good salad).. Setting is slightly old school........
