mirai is cool, trendy, and NOT a bargain!  there are so many BYOB sushi places in the city, why go somewhere that has SUCH expensive drinks (like $12+) and rolls?!  its a good place to go with a small group of girls, but like a few other reviewers said, people are packed together on the second floor.  the food was good.  atmosphere is cool.  if you have money to burn, go to mirai.
