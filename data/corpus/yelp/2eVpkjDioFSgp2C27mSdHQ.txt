Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Seems like every other ramen place I've been to, but the atmosphere and decor makes it feel a little more authentic. The restaurant itself is extremely small and stuffy; and there was a long wait outside for seating. : ( I would not suggest sitting at the bar because the "kitchen area" will definitely raise the temperature of the space and make it much more difficult to carry a conversation. . The combo meal, which includes a bowl of ramen and a side-dish of your choice, is well worth the money if you're looking for good eats for a good price. The soup is pretty flavorful, and it goes well with the noodles and egg especially. Although there was a little too much vegetables and shredded meat for my taste, the dish as a whole was tasty.. . I would've given this place 3.5 stars, however yelp does not offer that option, therefore I decided to be nice and round up.
