Good for a LATE night stop off, conveniently located in the heart of Wicker Park Nightlife.  My "bitch" about this place is that it is way to small, so plan on take out as there's like one or two tables in the joint.  I personally like places where you can eat your food there and not carry it home in some bag or stryofoam and eat it as it gets soggier and such.  Oh well, I digress...the food is actually pretty decent, not Great, but not bad either.....
