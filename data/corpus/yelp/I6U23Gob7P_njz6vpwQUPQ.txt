Yes, the interior is dark, but it was great for sitting around, keeping an eye on the football games and discussing a book we just read over pitchers of sangria.. . We recently had our book club meeting here - and even though it was a quick visit, it made a good impression.  When I sat down my friends had sangria pitchers and onion rings ready for me to dive into.  The Sangria is awesome and the onion rings are addicting!  I had the Sloppy Joe for lunch and everyone else had burgers.  The sloppy joe was huge and made me feel warm and cozy.  (It was a frigid day and my sinuses hated me.  I very much welcomed that warm and cozy feeling and poured myself another glass of Sangria.)  I can't wait to go back here when I'm feeling well, to try more of their burgers and to check out the outdoor seating I'm reading about on here.
