Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Finally it was the time for Soowon Galbi, Andrew H. brought my attention to this restaurant and Ben F. and his non stop Korean BBQ reviews kinda forced me to try KBBQ and last but not least my review No. 200 had to be a special one.. . Ocha's (my favorite Thai restaurant) is across the street, so I am familiar with this area. Parking can be a challenge and according to my 5 year old daughter it is a 'creepy neighbourhood'. Regardless these negative characteristics, we made our way to Soowon Galbi. . . It was the first time ever going to a KBBQ place and we did not know what to expect. The people in front of us could not help us either, it was for them also the first time, they read about Soowon on the Internet (wonder if it was yelp?). We had to wait in line for about 30 minutes before we got seated, but the building smelt soooo good so it was worth waiting, we reckoned. . We ordered the BBQ Shrimp, Beef Brisket and BBQ Pork, our table was quickly filled with little plates with all kind of unknown items. . We felt like a fish in a sandbox, and had the idea that everybody was looking at our table, realizing that we did not know what to do with all the food (well that is not really true, we do know how to BBQ).. . Well our first experience with Korean BBQ was good and different, I guess we need to hire the service of a KBBQ tour guide, to show us the ropes of eating Korean food the real way.. . Thanks to Andrew H. and Ben F. for making us aware of a new way of enjoying food.
