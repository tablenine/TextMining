I LOVE THIS PLACE!. . I think it's quite hilarious that the people that don't like this place are the people that should stick to lincoln park! LOL . . If you are easy going and don't have to have a romantic ambiance everytime you eat food then this is your place. AND for the people that think a FISH restaurant shouldn't smell like fish then dont come here or go to FL cuz that's what fish means lol.... . The plates range from 10 to 15 dollars and the meals by far are about the size of two platters.  They come with your fish and tons of steamed veggies, guacamole, rice and beans.  . . As well, for anyone who loves hot stuff this is your place.  They give you chips and salsa...with salsas even mexicans can't handle.  Ask for the orange salsa if you dare =)!. . Across the street they have a small strip of parking otherwise ashland usually isn't too hard to find some.
