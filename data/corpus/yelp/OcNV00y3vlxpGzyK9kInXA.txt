Absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to come back.  Be ready to come early for dinner because it is a small restaurant and you will have to wait.  . . The rolls are so meticulously made.  The sushi chef takes his time completing each roll, but I definitely don't mind waiting.  There were roll creations I had never seen or thought of that were featured.  The multiple layers of texture and flavor that seamlessly burst with each bite make you take as much time eating each piece as it took for the chef to create it.  The other great thing:  I am a sucker for spicy foods.  I asked him to make it as spicy as he could without destroying the flavor.  He did so gladly.. . Also, I'm not sure why the sashimi here is fresher than any other sushi place in town.  It just is.  And you can certainly tell the difference.  The best thing about it all: it's cheaper than most of the high end sushi places in town AND tastes better!
