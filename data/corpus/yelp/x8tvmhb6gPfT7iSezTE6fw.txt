Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
On the 8th day, God gave us the Alcove.I'd been blessed with a sampling  angelic apple tarts and the chocolatiest of chocolate (Just to turn a bad day into a great one) cake - that melts in your mouth as I sipped on a frothy, steamy soy latte on the patio.. . There's not much more that could be said about this Heavenly place - a bit crowded and daunting when everyone runs in hungry through the pearly gates. However, if you are a fan of sweet, lump crab meat - well then, look no further than the Crab Cake Benedict.  Be patient, my child! . . The parking (a.k.a. Hell - especially on a glorious crisp morning) requires a bit of patience - but it will be worth the wait and the walk.
