Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
Other than the fact that I hate waiting 30 minutes for a table when i've made a reservation (Like Seinfeld said, what's the point?) the thai curry i had here was delicious. Always like BYOB. I tried some spicy tuna rolls which were delicious too and my other girlfriends raved about the sushi.. . For 8 girls, with two thai dishes and a million rolls of sushi, it was $14 each (can't remember if that was with or without tip but still) plus the cost of the bottles of wine we brought. can't beat its affordability and $7 cab ride back downtown to the bars
