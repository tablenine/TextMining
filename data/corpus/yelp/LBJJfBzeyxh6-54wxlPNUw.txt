Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I have yet to find an authentic sushi restaurant that serves qualilty shashmi that is fresh, not filmy, smooth as buttah and taste like it's supposed to! Tank comes pretty close on the shashimi end-  their salmon shashimi is pretty darn good, nice thick slices and smooth as buttah BUT- this place is for you if you like. 1. Designer sushi...every maki roll seems to have mayo, cream cheese and jalepeno listed as an ingredient. 2. not into sushi?? no problem!  the couple next to me ordered Kobe Burgers and fries. . This is a neighborhood restaurant with a downtown attitude (although I think it is the perfect personality for a host that has to deal with irritable patrons for a 45 min wait-he does not get flustered). . Fried oyster (the sauce is to die for!) rainbow roll, ocean sundae, soft shell crab, salmon shashimi and sapporo = $85 incld tip
