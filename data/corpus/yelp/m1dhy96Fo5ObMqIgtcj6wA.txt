Feeling compelled to update my Mirai review given the fact that my past two outings here have yielded less than stellar results. Have things changed? New ownership? What gives? . . With the entrance of a new sushi muse in my life (ahem, Wakamono), I had somewhat left poor 'ol friend Mirai in the dust and had been away for a good half dozen months or so. Perhaps it wasn't such a bad thing after all as it appears my old sidekick has taken a toro turn in a direction that I'm less than tobiko thrilled with. . . The seating in the upstairs lounge which was always intimate is now closer clustered than ever... I know they're trying to accommodate more customers, but at the loss of my personal space? No Thanks! I really don't need to be able to rub elbows with the girl next to me, or have nowhere to put my purse, coat and limbs... and lest me not forget to mention the servers and bussers that now can't get in between tables and are just constantly (and clumsily) reaching over the poor sap who got the outside seat in an awkward attempt to serve you. Talk about distracting. . . Then, of course, that brings me to the food/service... they menu is stale. Not much has changed in years except for perhaps the quality. Loose rolls, uninspired pairings and for the first time ever at Mirai I couldn't muscle down the rolls placed in front of me, they were just... bad. My sashimi was good and cocktails were great per usual, but the insanely slow service via waitress that kept forgetting our items and blaming the kitchen left an inexcusable taste in my mouth. Sorta like their Unagi Trio Maki. Blech.
