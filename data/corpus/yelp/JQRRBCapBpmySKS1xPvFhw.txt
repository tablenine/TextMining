This place is for people who like over-flavored, mayonnaised filled rolls that leave  no room to taste the quality of the fish.  Everytime I have come here the sushi rolls are so overdone in sauces and mayonnaise that it is basically like eating rice with mayonnaise, chili sauce, or fried soy sauce.  I also got sick here last night.  Had the house crunch which was pretty much a deep-fried roll of shrimp (oh and they dont serve wasabi with some of their rolls, what is up with that?)  We were still hungry to decided to try their tofu dish which essentially was just deep-fried tofu with a very weird side bowl of fish skin flakes.  No delicious soy-sauce or dipping sauce, just deeply-breaded and deeply fried tofu-what the hell is japanese about this? Coast or Mirai much much better sushi and th quality and deisgn of their rolls allows you to actually taste the fish not such rice slathered in some articfical sauce.   Dont plan to return to Bob San again, the sushi is bad.
