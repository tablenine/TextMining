Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
This is one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite or something sweet when I'm in the area.  . . Porto's is this massive church looking like Bakery place (you can't miss it when you are at the intersection of Magnolia / Hollywood way)  There are people in and out of this place and finally had the pleasure to give it a try.. . When you walk in.. it's got long lines like you're at Disneyland!  However, they got so many servers that the lines moves fairly fast and efficient sort of as if you had a fast pass in your hand. (A fast pass to food!). . I tried their sandwiches (medionoche and Pan Con Lechon)  The medionoche was ok but the Pan Con Lechon was totally awesome!  Juicy pork meat on a moist cuban buns... love this sandwich.  I also tried their world famous potato balls but it didn't do it for me.  (Although everyone else will probably tell you otherwise because almost everyone I saw there had one in their mouth because they couldn't wait to bite into it). . What I love the most about this place is their Napoleon.  This awesome thousand layered pastry is absolutely out of this world!  The cream has just the right sweetness and the layers are just delicious.  I also tried several others (tiramisu, opera cake, fruit tart), but I will have to say Napoleon has conquered me totally!  . . Lastly, it seems that everyone walking out of Porto's hold a cake of some sort... I really gotta get one of their cakes and see how that taste.  Anyone tasted any of their cake selections? . . Great price and terrific eats!  Must check it out for yourselves!
