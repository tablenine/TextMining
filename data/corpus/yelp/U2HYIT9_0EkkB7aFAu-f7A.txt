Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
It's good, but.... . It's a lot more expensive and not much better than a lot of other dumpling restaurants in Alhambra.. . Plus, I'm probably jaded by the way better dumplings I got in Shanghai for like a dollar for 8.. . Still, it's not bad.  You won't be disappointed.  It's just that you can get more bang for the buck
