for a soul food chain, this place is hard to beat. for fried chicken, this place is unbeatable (at least in LA). the friend chicken is the best around here. it's a bit expensive and a bit salty, but it's very very tasty. waffles are pretty good. love the collard greens and mac 'n cheese w/ the fried chicken. a real treat and a fun place to go
