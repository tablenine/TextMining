Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I have had Din Tai Fung at locations in Taipei, Shenzhen, Beijing, &amp; Shanghai, and I feel that this was this was the worst.  Yes, I know this is L.A., but I have had better soupy dumplings at JJ's in San Gabriel.  . . I do not enjoy the wait at Din Tai Fung and the prices appear to be slightly higher than other dumpling restaurants.  . . Do your research on Yelp, you will find much better &amp; cheaper dumpling restaurants in the SGV.
