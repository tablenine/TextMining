Category: Thai
Even though this place was highly recommended by my friend (Kristen who wrote a review below) , I was still pleasantly surprised by my meal.  I was there for a very late lunch around 4:00 PM. There was not a big crowd, but I contribute that to the fact that is was so late and it was a weekend.  I hear it is packed during the week.  It is set-up like any average restaurant and is located in a plaza near other shops and restaurants.  Not really a romantic date spot, but a good place for a casual meal.  . . I decided to go with something subtle, a mango chicken combination... but I was definitely wrong to think this was a safe dish.  It was SPICEY!  Incredibly good, but very spicey.  They needed to add a chile pepper by the item on the menu for sure!  My friend ordered a curry dish which was not as hot, but still had a lot of flavor.  If I lived closer, I would come here often, particularly anytime I craved a spicey dish.
