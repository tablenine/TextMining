I went here about a month ago with some friends and we were told that it was an HOUR AND A HALF wait. So, we did not eat there. However, a friend and I went back today and it was great. They open at 8 and we got there at 8:30, so there was no wait and we were seated right away. The waitress was great, we got our food within 10 mins. of ordering, and they were playing some great tunes. When we were seated they were playing Roxanne, and after that they played some Led Zeppelin and some Elton John. It was a great experience overall. My only advice would be to get there early so that you don't have to wait!. Oh, I also recommend the stuffed french toast with mascarpone.
