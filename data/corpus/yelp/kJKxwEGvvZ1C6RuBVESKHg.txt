Ok...I liked the atmosphere (next time you're there, look at the ceiling in the bar area..so neat).  It felt cozy and old.  . . My caesar was good (and garlicy, yum!).  But my burger...I would never order it again.  I didn't love it.  I think it must have been the meat, it just tasted too much...it tasted too much like a strong batch of ground beef if that makes any sense.. . Also, our table was crap (one of the leaves kept falling into my lap painfully).  We were right off of the wait station and in a major traffic area.  Which was annoying because we had reservations - I feel like we should have gotten something better.. . I might go back if we had no other choices.
