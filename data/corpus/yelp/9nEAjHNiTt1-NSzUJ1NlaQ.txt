I tried the spicy pork taco ($2) despite just having finished dinner an hour ago. I had to, since I FINALLY came across the elusive truck. . . Too many options - wanted to try the burrito ($5) but that would've just been too much food. . . The spicy pork taco was tasty. Pretty spicy with some red siracha looking sauce. Not bad. Basically Korean grilled pork bites with a shredded cabbage slaw and sesames. The sesame kinda threw me off at first because they made the entire taco taste sandy in my mouth. At first I thought they hadn't washed the cabbage well enough. Then I took one of the obtrusive specks out to discover it was a sesame. Oh well.. . I'm a fan of food trucks though having spent time in Philly and being surrounded by these roach coaches. I can see why Kogi is popular though. It's fusion - Korean food in well identifable tortillas. Easy concept but just different enough for the masses to accept. ;)
