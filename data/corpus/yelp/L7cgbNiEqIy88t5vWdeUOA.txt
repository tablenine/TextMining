It's amazing what this place does with North Indian cuisine. More flavor, more spice, more fresh ingredients seems to be their guiding philosophy. For the most part this works, but be prepared for a bold burst of balls-out flavor in every dish you try. Sometimes, especially after a few courses (and since tapas and thaalis are the focus here, a few courses is par for the, uh, course) it can become a bit much. I liked how, one night, the manager came out to genuinely solicit feedback on the chicken byrani special he had just cooked up. I had to inform him that, while nice overall, it was a bit heavy on dry spices. I came away with the impression that this is a restaurant that really cares about experimentation and offering their customers the most pleasurable experience possible, even if they do occasionally go overboard. Wine and beer list is good, too.
