Category: Sushi Bars
Never again. . . Server was just dreadful --. 1. Belittled my friend who couldn't hear him due to the chefs screaming and gong banging around the restaurant.. 2. Made fun of my friend when he couldn't hear the server say Salmon.. 3. Dumped leftover water from another table to fill up our water cup (?!) Gross!. 4. Never bothered to check on our food.. 5. Was nice only for a quick second when handing our checks.. . None of what they did can be justified. . . This place is officially banded from my list of restaurants to dine. . . Consider this a 0 rating.
