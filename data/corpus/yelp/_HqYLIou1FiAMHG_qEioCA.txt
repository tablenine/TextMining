Not much to say here - great back outdoor patio, cheap and tasty Mexican food. Even on a weekend night during dinner rush hour, there's no need to wait for a table. . . My only criticism is that the margaritas are on the weak side. They are not too sweet, but you can't taste the tequila at all. Just sayin'...
