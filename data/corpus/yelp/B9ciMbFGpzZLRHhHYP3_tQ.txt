Yes, the decor is nice, but the food tastes like it was rolled in salt and the service is TERRIBLE!  The waiter was upset when we sent back an undercooked pheasant, and said, "that's how it's served here."  Sorry if the feeling of squishy poultry between my teeth isn't appetizing.  We felt rushed and ignored.  The best part was the dessert, but that wasn't nearly worth the price tag.
