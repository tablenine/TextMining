Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Mozza is one of those places that I always talked about going to, and reservations really held me back. I'm not one for planning that far ahead. . . So it took a farewell happy hour for one of my friends who was laid off, and this moving back to the bay, at Cabo Cantina, to bring up talks of Mozza. She was going that very night. And my gf got a serious Jones for it. So we got a late night rezz.. . As our first trip to the place, we decided to try as much as possible. For 4 of us, we did 3 pizzas, a meat plate, and the big, crusty bread. Oh, and a bottle of vino.  . . Bread was decent, but rather unnecessary.  The meat plate was good. It was great to try some original cured meats. But the apps detracted from the star. . . The pizzas. . . Oh the pizzas. . . The combinations are incredible. Get the weirdest sounding ones. I love the complex combinations along with the crunchy yet still substantial crust, and the perfect amount of seasoning. These creations are very well planned. Trust the chefs. Don't go for the all meat one. That's boring. (I'm talking to you Bridge M). . . The atmosphere is friendly and loud. Definitely fits with the gregarious nature of Italian cuisine, pizza, and the co-owners. . . Mozza, I hope to see you again soon.
