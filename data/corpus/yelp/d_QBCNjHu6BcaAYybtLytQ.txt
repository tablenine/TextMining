Everyone here was so nice!  Not to mention that the food was wonderful too!  We went here for my little sister's birthday and probably ordered one of everything on the menu (big family ok!?)  Bangladeshi food is very similar to Indian food, so I was prepared for the awesome deliciousness that was to come.  The tandoori lamb is not to be missed YOU GOT IT.  So tender and so meaty and earthy!  When I think of meat, that's how it always tastes in my head.  All the different naan choices are fun and very tasty and the mango lassi (a drink made with pureed mangos and house made yogurt)  is like a mouth orgasm!  Sweet, sour, cool, creamy...very good!  And you have the try the creamy  curried chicken in coconut with cashews (can't remember what it was called). . . The only thing I couldn't get behind was the goat.  What the heck, like chewing a tire!  It came with a curried rice and while that was really good, the goat itself was gross!  Definitely an acquired taste! . . If you need help or are a little uneasy about ordering, don't hesitate to ask the staff.  They're more than willing to help you out and after the meal, you get a coupon for 25% off your next meal!  So cool!
