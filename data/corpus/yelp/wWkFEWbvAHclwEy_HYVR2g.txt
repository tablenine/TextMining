Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
"Maria, you know damn well you have no business following this truck on Twitter" said my conscience....But I did it anyway :) teehee.. . I found out the truck was going to be at the Natural History Museum on a Saturday so I hyped up the kids and away we went.. . To my surprise there were only about 10 people ahead of me and the line was moving rather quickly.  We ordered a Cheddar melt, mac &amp; cheese with rib meat and a dessert melt.. All  three were made to perfection. Crispy  on the outside and gooey on the inside. . The little bro can't stop talking about the Mac &amp; Cheese/bbq melt. He said that must be what heaven feels like :) . My favorite had to be the dessert melt, the way the flavors come together is amazing! I definitely recommend it.. . The service was great, talk about service with a smile!. . I would have given them a five star, but I kinda feel like $7.50 for a melt is a little pricey. Don't get me wrong I will definitely hunt this truck down again, just not very soon.
