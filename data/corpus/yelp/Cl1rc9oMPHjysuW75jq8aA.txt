It's weird to walk to your table and have all the management and service staff stop to let you pass and say "good evening".  This place really sets the standard.. . Went there for my 4th anniversary and we were thoroughly impressed.  We both had something different from the menu so we could share.  I won't go into detail about everything but here are my highlights..... . Crab fritters- puts all crab cakes to shame.... its a pretty big portion of lump crab with a southeast Asian fish sauce.  good shit..... . Lamb tasting- the main sample of lamb was a cut from the rib.... it was seasoned well and grilled to order.  I wasn't moved by the lamb tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Still it was a stellar dish..... . Buffalo mozz with organic tomatoes- the mozzarella melted in my mouth... very fresh and beautiful presentation. . Chocolate cake with mint ice cream- I blew a load when I ate this...... . Beautiful restaurant, beautiful food, beautiful night.... this is the ultimate in dining.. . BTW.... we ate from the prix fixe menu but I think there is an ala carte menu by request.
