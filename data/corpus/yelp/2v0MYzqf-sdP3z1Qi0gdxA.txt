Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I'm dedicating this review to Tony who claimed Apple Pan has the best burger in LA. I will no longer believe a word Tony has to say. . I ordered the Hickory burger and was confronted with a thin meat patty that seemed to come straight from the freezer. The burger was slathered in a generic barbeque sauce that completely overwhelmed the taste of the low grade meat. . The only redeeming quality of Apple Pan was the kitschy paper cone cups the coca-cola came in.
