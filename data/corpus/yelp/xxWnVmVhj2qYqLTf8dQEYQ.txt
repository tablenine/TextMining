FINALLY!! I got a chance to try the famous french dip !! . I got there on weekdays at an odd times, around 4pm. It was not crowded at all and I can directly place my order! NICE!! . The food here is a really disappointment for me. The portion is very small, the bread is tasteless and I mean the food is really mediocre or I can even say it's no good! I got the beef double dip, the potato salad and the macaroni salad. None of them are special and I thought it will taste better. But I was wrong.. Definitely got to try this place ONCE just for the sake of having been there as it is a Los Angeles landmark. But,,, don't expect much for the food here :)
