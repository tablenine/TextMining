Fried chicken and waffles may sound like a strange combination until you try it. It's awesome.. . Get the chicken smothered in country gravy.. . You will gain pounds before the end of the meal, feel your arteries hardening in your chest, and probably not be able to move (in any sense of the word) for at least a week, but it's worth it.
