Came here for a friends birthday for dinner. The booth was big, lighting was good and it was a good time.. . I had a martini called the Mangolicious and it was great, the food was average, but maybe I didn't order the right thing. It wasn't bad, just wasn't very good.. . The only sour part of the night was when a waiter spilled a whole drink on the birthday girl and got her soaked. The waiter was apologetic but basically kept saying how it wasn't their fault.. . All-in-all though, we had a fun night.
