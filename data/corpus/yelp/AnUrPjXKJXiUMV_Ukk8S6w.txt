We had a great lunch.  Lobster salad and Planked Whitefish.  With a bottle of wine.  Delicious! Upper end for us.  Special occasion. Enjoyable experience. Great waitress.  Enjoyed eating indoors streetside, the best of both worlds. Would go again.  Fresh greens, great presentation and good. eating with great service.
