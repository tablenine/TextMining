Reza. He's such a good man and friend of the family. My father helped him expand the restaurant and he is now doing great. I have now relocated to San Diego, CA and I am saddened to hear other people's comments about him being "arrogant". For those of you who've had unsatisfactory experiences, I'm sure the good outnumber the bad.. . Since I was 4, my family would come here at least 3-4 times a month. I've spent endless birthdays here along with family baptisms or other occasions. . . This restaurant is vast with such a rich ambiance yet makes one feel welcome. Perfect for group occasions or an intimate date. The ambiance isn't just one of the attractions, the food is also the magnet. Plenty of parking...come on...What more can anybody ask for?. . The appetizers are always delicious. The feta cheese has one of the best textures and perfect balance. I simply ADORE the seafood combination dish: succulent scallops, grilled shrimp, YUM. The lamb is so mouth-wateringly tender. All entrees come with a grilled tomato, onion, and green pepper, not to mention a large amount of basmati rice topped with saffron or dill rice.. . Service is top notch, always on top of everything. Enjoy.
