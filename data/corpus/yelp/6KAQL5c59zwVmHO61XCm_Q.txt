This place has arrived with a shit load of fanfare.  Most of it undeserved.  Service was great, the guy that brought over my sandwich and soup was funny and polite.  A lotta smiles, energy and kind folks at the Bake Shop.. . I had a tomato soup and a half a grilled cheese sandwich.  Both were pretty tasty, but if you want the best grilled cheese in the bizness, head right up Peachtree and sit that azz down at Tap.  The grilled cheeses there are amazing!. . The place is set up really ackwardly, its like 3 long azz picnic tables, and a couple of spots to sit next to the windows and get a great view of peachtree.  However, its really ackward because it reminds me of cafeteria seating.  In fact, it kinda makes the place suck.. . THe Bakeshop is very much an open space, and you can see all throughout the kitchen which looked very clean to me.. . I just dont like the set up of this place, its kinda annoying.
