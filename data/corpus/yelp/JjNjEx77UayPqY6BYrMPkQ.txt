Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
Great NY Noodle Town is a staple in Chinatown. It's been there since... FOREVER! . . Anyway, their food is fairly tasty and quite cheap to boot. I usually get their roasted pork chow fun, which always ALWAYS comes super quick. Their congee isn't half bad either. Singapore chow fun is one of the best that I've tasted, with an actual TASTE instead of an explosion of curry. Their chinese pork is noted as one of the best within the city that I've tasted. . . They are usually quite busy, so you may expect a bit of a wait to eat. The place is pretty small too, so it's a bit cramped. . . On a personal note of annoyance - they don't accept pennies. What is up with that?
