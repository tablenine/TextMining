I know I shouldn't start with dessert, but I just have to get this out of the way -- their bread pudding is the best in the city.  The absolute best.  It's Italian bread pudding, the size of a tall slice of cake, with warm caramel.  No bananas, either, which means I can eat it.  Oh my god, I would eat this bread pudding every day if I were closer to this restaurant.. . There is no end to my love for this place.. . The atmosphere is so perfect -- so Sicilian home-like! - and the food is, quite simply, heavenly.. . They start you off with a loaf of bread and amazing oil [seriously, I've brought people here who are firm believers in adding pepper to oil and they were floored when they tried the oil as-is].. . The specials are always fantastic and make me feel guilty ordering anything from the menu.  If I do order from the menu, I tend to go with the gnocchi, mezzalune al burro, tortellone con salsa di noce, ravioli alla luigi, or tortellone anatra ubriaco.  The portions are huge, too, so you usually have leftovers.  Tasty.
