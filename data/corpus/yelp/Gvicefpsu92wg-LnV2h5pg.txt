Restaurant: Craft Atlanta
Category: American (New)
Since the wife is working on 2/14, we needed a good spot for an early Valentines dinner. I've been to Craft NYC, loved it, and thought it would be right up her alley. Not too fussy, but perfectly executed. Craft Atlanta rockets up to being on my list of ATL's finest dining destinations. . . At first, the menu seems daunting. On the appetizers side, you have about ten seafood selections, with sourced oysters on up to crudo of various kinds, then a few small pastas and a series of amazing salads for sharing. Then fish, and meats, and more veggie options than you can shake a stick at, each prepared to perfection. I even managed to get my wife to agree to the Brussel sprouts - which were tasty as heck and not b. . We had the beet salad (divine), then the waygu skirt steak with chimichurri, scallops with mushroom jus, roasted brussel sprouts, the pillow-like gnocchi, and the mixed wild shrooms. Roasted bosc pear and toasted almond ice cream to finish. Simple, pure and amazing food. Rockets up to being quite high on my list of ATL fine dining establishments.
