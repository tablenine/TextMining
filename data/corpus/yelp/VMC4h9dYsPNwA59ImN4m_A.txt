Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I lived a block away from Kitsch'n for a year and a half... Â and we didn't mind the wait - ever. The Bloody Mary's are always a favorite, and usually at least two rounds are ordered. They're just a bit spicy, and now that they've upgraded to glasses (made of glass) even on the patio - we feel more grownup! Favorites are ALWAYS the breakfast burrito and the coconut encrusted french toast! The raspberry dipping sauce makes it AWESOME.
