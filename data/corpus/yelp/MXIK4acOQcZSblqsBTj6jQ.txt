i went to buttermilk with a friend, a couple of sundays ago around 11am. 5-10 minutes of wait, though i bet you'd wait longer if you're a group of 3 or more. . . NO ALCOHOL BEFORE NOON ON SUNDAYS! friends, did you know about this? we certainly did not. or maybe we did but we always seem to forget. i mean i don't know! we are constantly drinking at brunch in this town, are we not? do we check the time when we partake in this jolly activity? i don't think so. anyway. this is the rule at buttermilk and they are sticking to it.. . so i'm sorry, dozens of people who were waiting for a (our) table. we had no choice but to eat our food VERRY VERRRY slowly because you see, there's a cocktail included in the brunch prix fixe (smallish portions but still a good deal, as the food is delish). and we weren't going anywhere till we got it.. . and i'm sorry, nice waitress who kept asking "are you finished?" while peering at our plates with tiny morsels left on them. no, we're not done here. we won't be till noon. at which time we politely asked for our cocktails (and asked for the check), downed them and left. a sweet hereafter.. . i'd write more about the food, but i don't remember much about it other than it was awesome. i was consumed by nerves. watching the clock is stressful!
