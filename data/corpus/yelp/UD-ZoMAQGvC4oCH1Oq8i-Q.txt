A true foodie heaven. Small, artful, and luscious dishes that tantalize the palette. I am from the Bay Area, but love coming here when in Chicago. Â The 12 course menu is very filling and the kitchen does a great job of adjusting to individual needs (one in our group had an allergy and one did not eat red meat) .
