My personal favorite location. Yes - it's loud! Yes - it's PACKED! Yes - people are yelling crazy indefinable things at the tops of their lungs are are still going unheard! It's like... a sushi restaurant and a night club had a baby that was addicted to crack and techno music! I added crack because... the wait staff has the attention span of a gnat... but hey - at least they bring you your food! The wild awesomeness ensues.. . You can basically re-read my review of the other location, since they are mostly identical... the only difference being that I have and do frequently have their lunch sushi buffet. A mad-dash to get fresh sushi as soon as the chefs hand it over - before it can be inhaled by others... . . And the price range really depends on what you order. If you order to of their yummy specialty rolls... it's be $$. If you stick to the dollar menu... $. It's all about the choices you make. . . I mean... ok. No - if you're looking for a nice, quiet, sushi restaurant to take a first date where you two can talk and get to know one another - obviously, don't come here. This is no fancy schmuck kind of place. It's pure, unadulterated sushi chaos. I like it. You should to. If you don't... no one cares. Go somewhere else. Only awesome people eat here - no losers allowed.
