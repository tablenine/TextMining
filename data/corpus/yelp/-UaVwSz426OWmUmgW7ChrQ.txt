Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Who needs to wait in some asinine line for sprinkles when you can go to Joan's on Third?  I was at first devastated when I saw the line that I was unwilling to wait in for a cupcake, at sprinkles.  My friend came to the rescue and said,"no worries, I know of another really good cupcake shop"  She then blew my mind with Joan's on third.  There cupcake selection was impressive, not by the variety of choices but with the quality of choices.  I got some sort of lemon goodness that made me forget all about that other what's it called place.  Oh and how many people were in front of me in line? ONE!
