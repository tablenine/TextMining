WOW!!!!. . no need to add too much her e- the hainan chicken is phenomenal. But the one thing that REALLy caught me - the RICE! Okay, if you know me at all, you know that I do NOT eat rice. I rarely do, if ever.. This rice was So light, so fluffy, perfect middle between hard and soft and lightly salted. I ATE rice here.. . On top of the chicken, we got the seafood casserole with pasta. Delicious, lots of seafood, an interesting twist with italian dish but slightly with an asian twist. I liked it a lot! Cheesy and tomato-y :). . maybe going back tonight before the flight? hmmm...oh yeah and service was great :)
