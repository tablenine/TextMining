This is one of my few go-to places for sushi in West LA.  Whenever I feel like dealing with a huge crowd, I'll go here, otherwise I'll dine at Nagao (when I want a little more quiet).  I usually stick to the nigiri here, although I also love the albacore sashimi dinner, because you get the soup, rice, tempura, and at least six pieces of super fresh albacore for around $15.  It's big enough to share with a friend if you also order a few rolls or nigiri sushi pieces.  . . This place has really fresh fish for the price and a variety of food choices.  So what if there's carpet on the walls (who decorated this place I don't know)... at least it's not as crazy bright white lights in there as it used to be a few years ago.  If you want a fun, bright, lively, and fresh place to go for sushi, this would be a good choice.  If you feel like spending tons of cash on pretentious sushi places where you can't see your fish, you may want to go to Sushi Zo.
