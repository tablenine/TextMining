So I'm on my way to a friend's house to watch the Super Bowl and we decide that I will pick up some dessert.  Of course I go to Porto's.  He lives in the city so even though I generally go to Glendale, I decide that the Burbank Porto's is closer.  Sweet jeebus....parking was a complete nightmare with people driving every which way just to find a parking spot.  I have a tiny little car and I still couldn't fit any where.  Eventually I found a tiny little spot on the street.  So I walk up to the door and the line is OUT THE DOOR!!  Holy Toledo!  Even though there are long lines in Glendale, at least they have an express line that you can go to just to get pastries, etc.  I was amazed...seriously...So it's finally my turn and guess what??  They're out of potato balls...Bummer...but in the end I pick up some meat pastries and some of their delicious desserts and all was well.  The people really are helpful and their pastries are the best in my book.  They lose a star because of the parking craziness and the fact that they were out of the potato balls... :(
