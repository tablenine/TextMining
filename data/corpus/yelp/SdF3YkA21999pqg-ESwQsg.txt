The allusive Kogi truck offered me a great experience, one that I greatly enjoyed, but never want to experience again. The previous reviews about the long lines are true. We arrived 40 minutes before the truck showed up and were still only number 16 in line. By the time the truck showed up in Irvine, CA there were over 150 people in line. It took about 15 minutes for the 16 people in front of us to order, and it took another 15 minutes for us to get our food once we ordered. Burritos are $5 each, Tacos are $2, and the sliders are $5. Overall, I don't think the food was very good. I can get a much better burrito for $5 at many different places near the location of the Kogi truck. Everything we had was covered in this mystery sauce. Between the wait, the cost, and the fact that we didn't really like the food, I can't say that I'll ever return, but it was worth the experience. Here is a video of the experience and a more in depth review: . http://www.youtube.com....
