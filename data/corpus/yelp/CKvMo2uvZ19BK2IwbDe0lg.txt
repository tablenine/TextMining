Yum! We loved it.  The oyster, seafood, veggie pancake was delicious, served VERY hot and crispy.  . We also ordered the combo of Be Bim Bop in the hot pot &amp; the Korean BBQ...very tasty.. Loved all the extras they provide:. Kimchee, Yellow Croaker (the whole fried fish), cellophane noodles with wonderful sesame flavor, daikon and a few others.. English was a little difficult for some of the servers but it was very friendly ! Also, quite a bargain.
