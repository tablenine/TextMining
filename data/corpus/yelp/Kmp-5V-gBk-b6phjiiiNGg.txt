I am not a big sweets person, but if there is like a random pie or tart or pint of ice cream lying around I'll definitely indulge.  I am that way about a lot stuff that I am not willing to pay for but will have at it if it's free: porn, cable tv, miller or budweiser beer, and sweets.  Someone at work recently brought in a pecan pie from Cafe Selmarie and it was awesome.  Best pecan pie I've ever had.
