Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
Price: Reasonably Priced. Atmosphere: Asian, Modern, Cool vibe. Food: Loved it. Service: Excellent. . I think I finally found my new local Thai Restaurant, I've been searching since I left San Francisco.. . Sake Salmon Nigiri just OK, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll Excellent, Green Curry with Chicken Excellent. Rice needs a little work.. . Service was near perfect, Tim our waiter was great and everyone else that stopped by to lend an assist.. . One small suggestion, I asked a number of friends about this place and all of them said the same thing, the place always looks empty, which could not be further from the truth. I think if you put dining tables up front in the window and seat those tables first it will accurately reflect your success.
