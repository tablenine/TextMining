The crab cakes are delicious - I almost licked the plate!  I wasn't especially impressed with the rest of the meal - the zucchini fries were soggy (sauce was good, though), the rat toes were just okay.  And why can't anyone produce a decent unsweetened tea?  It doesn't SEEM as though it would be difficult.. . We were seated right away (downstairs - it was 90 degrees out today!) and our server was friendly and attentive.  Noisy but not at all un-doable.  Great place to go see sporting events as there are TVs all over downstairs.
