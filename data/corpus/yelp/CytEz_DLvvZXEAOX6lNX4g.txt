Restaurant: Bonnie&#39;s Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
My girlfriend and I were looking for a place that served veggie burgers and regular burgers when we caught wind of food being made.  Turns out it was Bonnie's; a place neither of us had been to before.  We sat quickly and were served in a quick and friendly manor.  The place has very little bullshit so you get a simple menu with real human food, real beer, decent prices, and a portion that makes sense.. . We will definitely go back here.  Anyplace that makes good food with no pretense at all gets 5 big stars.  Cash and credit plus to-go would make this place the top destination for food if I lived nearby.
