Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I risk my life and safety driving over to Fathers Office in the pouring rain, only to get stopped at the entrance to wait in line. Glad I brought an umbrella, or should I not have, it was a hassle carrying it around inside Fathers Office. . . We finally walk in. First thing I notice is, we will not get seated, we will not be able to eat, we will probably end up leaving. My predictions were all correct. 10 minutes later, we were out of there. So walking to the car, pretty annoyed I was thinking what the hell is wrong with Fathers Office?. . One, this is not a place to come to on a Friday night with a party of 6 if your hungry and looking for a great meal selection. . . Two, Find your own seat. Great! I really feel like waiting at someones table, trying to pressure them to get the fuck out so I can sit down and order myself a burger that every Yelper raves about. . . Three, you have a much better chance sitting on the toilet seat, than sitting anywhere else inside Fathers Office. . . Four, I took a glimpse of the food menu, it was limited, very limited. . . Five, this is not a place to bring anyone that does not drink. . . Six, people are overrating this place. Yea I said it, and what. . . Lastly, the parking here sucks ass.
