Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Freakin' outstanding! I have tried a lot of different Shabu Shabu restaurants across LA and Japan, and this place is up there! First, there's the cool wait time of about 1.5 hours if you're coming on rush hour which is anytime within 2 hours before normal Americans eat dinner. Second, the hard-working and gracious owner makes an effort to ensure that all his beloved customers will get their place in line once occupants inside the place are finished with their dinner so you can go in. . . The food is fantastic. I'm a huge fan of their udon noodles and their meat. The meat is very tender, cooks quick, and tastes bombastic with the peanut sauce and ponzu sauce. I usually dip the meat into both of the sauces and eat away. The helpful and attentive workers will always make sure your bowl of dipping sauces never gets too watery and they also make sure you're filled up. The broth is tasty, too! I don't really like saying this b/c of fear of reprisal; and there are a lot of other restaurants out there for the most party where I can't say the same thing of... but you can't go wrong eating Shabu at this house! . . There, I said it. F you if you don't agree.
