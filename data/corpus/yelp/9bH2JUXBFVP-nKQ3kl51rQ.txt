I got drunk with my mother at Rosa Mexicano.. . We had just seen a movie at the Lincoln Center Theatre, and since we hadn't eaten in awhile Â we went over to Rosa Mexicano after spotting a glow of neon light emanating from the entrance. The entrance is wonderful - the bar is downstairs right when you enter, and you walk upstairs with a huge water wall right next to you to get to the main dining area. . . We quickly ordered drinks (frozen pomegranate margarita for my mom, and a classic margarita on the rocks for me), and by the time our food came we were definitely happy. The dishes were incredible; I had the enchiladas de jaiba, and it was truly the best enchilada I've ever had. However, the place is a little overpriced. The food may be delicious, but there is no way you can get me to pay that much just to have guacamole made for me tableside. And they really try to get you to order it.
