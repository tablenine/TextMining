Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
If you don't mind the wait to enjoy delectable pastries and delicious Cuban Sandwiches, Porto's is the place for you. The place is constantly jump-in with massive amount of customers because they enjoy the variety of choices such as pastries, cakes, bread, sandwiches, coffees, and other etc. I personally enjoy going to Porto's for the sandwiches and  famous "Cheese Bread" and "potatoes balls."  Porto's is a great place to have lunch because it is fairly close to the Glendale Gallery. Therefore, you can do some shopping and enjoy great food at the same time.  The price of the food is within reason and the food is worth the wait.
