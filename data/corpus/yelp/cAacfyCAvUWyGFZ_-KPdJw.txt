We were soooo looking forward to this.  Friends drove in from other counties to taste this!  But it was such a big disappointment.  The Verde truck was at Altadena tonight, got there early (5:50pm), we were #2 in line.  Must be the traffic cuz the truck arrived about 10 minutes late, didn't get served until 6:20pm or so.  Line got to be about 30-40 deep.  . But the food itself was quite underwhelming.  There was very little Korean or Asian taste in there, maybe just more green onions and vinegar, but tasted like typical Mexican food to us.  I don't know, maybe cuz Chef Choi wasn't on site to supervise, the quality didn't shine through in the food.
