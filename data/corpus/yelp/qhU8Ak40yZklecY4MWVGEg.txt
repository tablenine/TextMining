Avoid the paella, the rice is undercooked, the meat over cooked, and the whole dish is under seasoned.  The gambas al ajillo was also terrible, obviously the shrimps were bought pre-peeled and not fresh at all.  Only the empanadas are not bad..... . With so many better restaurant options on Colorado, I don't think I'll ever come back here again.
