Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
They changed the hickory wings. Oh No You Didn't! Shame on you Daddy D. Shame. SHAME! As you can guess, this used to be my fav menu item. Been here no less than 30 times in my life and love the pulled pork, the sauce, the corn bread (which is not under cooked as one yelper mentioned; they put xtra butter in the bottom so it tastes xtra good!) and the stew. The STEW! The only stew that competes w/ my hubby's, and he has made stew at 2 places in ATL considered to have good stew. . . Since that shocking day the wings changed I have not returned. I am holding my own personal boycott against Daddy D'z. SHAME!. . If you have not tried it, you should though. They have really good bbq. Just don't get the wings.
