If there's no lines, then I'd go.  If there IS a line to get in, then I'd go to some other Izakaya, as Furaibo is pretty much an average Izakaya.  I don't think it's really worth the wait.. . The food is good, tebasaki is a staple here so I'd recommend any first-timers to order this.  Prices are reasonable.  If you have a big group and don't mind sitting on the floor, then call in beforehand to reserve the back-room, which is kinda cool.  . . Although very much like an Izakaya in Japan, it is pretty small and the seating is tight.  Good luck finding parking on weekends.
