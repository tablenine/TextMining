I thought this place was an excellent hot dog and fries place.. . I'm vegetarian and was very impressed! My boyfriend and I split the three flavors that were available. Our favorite was the Italian, followed by the Kielabasa and then the Beer Bratwurst.. . We ordered the Belgian fries with truffle oil which gave it a great touch. The truffle oil alone tastes good but there were so many dips I could not resist! My favorite was the curry ketchup which I hear is a German favorite. My boyfriend would also recommend the pesto-mayo.. . Only caveat - expensive! I took four frozen veggie sausages home and they were $4 bucks each!!
