This place seriously confirmed what I thought southern cooking was all about. . . While on business I went to Eats with some co-workers.  Great price for some seriously yummy food.  I didn't expect to get 1/2 a chicken and enough sides to feed a family of 4 when I ordered my lunch.  Although scrumptious, by the time I was full it didn't look like I had even touched my plate.. . The (1/2) chicken was tender and well spiced (not salty) which was surprising (I don't usually like chicken).  For the sides I opted for the collard greens and macaroni and cheese.  Both were great but I'm not sure if the greens were suppose to be as mushy as they were (I've only had collard greens twice).. . As for the resto, it's a bit dumpy but charming.
