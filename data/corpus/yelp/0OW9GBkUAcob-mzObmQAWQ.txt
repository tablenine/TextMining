Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
I originally went to Spring when it first opened as the "best new restaurant of the year." I continue to go back without ever being disappointed. The food is amazing, the staff is knowledgable and the ambiance is amazing. I love their Foie Gras Mouselline.... in fact I'm craving it now. Shawn McClain has opened other amazing restaurants... but Spring is still my favorite.
