We came here randomly one Sunday night for Bar Trivia.  The crowd was pretty old, and the place was pretty full.  The service was decent....we had like 3 different waitress's coming over to our table.  The one thing I really didn't like was that they allow smoking inside (yes, go outside and smoke asshole).  There were people all around us lighting up and I didn't appreciate it.
