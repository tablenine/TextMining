Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
When you talk about shabu shabu house, you talk about 2 things: the wait time, and the food.. . Wait time: The infamous wait for shabu shabu house. Because of popularity and small size, the store is full whenever it is open and wait could go all the way to 1-2 hrs. Most people say it's well worth the wait. The way I think of it is, dine smartly. Know when it opens and arrive 15-20 mins before it opens to sign in on the sign up sheet, walk about little tokyo, browse the shops or the convenience stores, and return to a nice relaxed meal with minimal wait needed.. Food: It's all beef. The meat cooks the second it enters the water and just melts in your mouth. Also the 2 dipping sauces are the best that I've had. You also add in your own radish, garlic and green onions to the sauce which is very fun. It's AYCE rice. I once had 7 bowls of rice!!! . . All in all the atmosphere can be a little hectic and hot but slow it down and just have a good time enjoying some shabu shabu with some friends. The service is great and very fast and efficient. Price is alright for dinner and a pretty good deal for lunch. Shabu shabu house is the way to go!
