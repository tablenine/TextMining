Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pinks is the steez!  I don't ever remember waiting longer than 10-15 minutes in line to get my food, and I've been to Pinks @ least 10x.  I love the way that the hotdogs snap when you bite into them.. . Try the Mushroom-Swiss Dog + Bacon, it's what I ALWAYS get.  YUM!
