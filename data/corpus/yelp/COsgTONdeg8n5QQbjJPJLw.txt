I lived in NYC for five years.  This place reminds me of one of the countless Ray's Original (or is it the Original Ray's?) pizza joints in my old neighborhood.   It may not be coal oven-fired, but t's a greasy slice of goodness that's cheap, quick, and perfect with beer.. . The staff is hit or miss, which makes me nostalgic for NYC.  But they're not in there to win friends and influence people.   . . And HUGE BONUS POINTS for selling Zapp's potato chips, and especially for selling my favorite flavors.  Try the Gator Taters (in the green striped bag), they're dill chips.  Or the Craw Taters, (red striped bag) which are reminiscent of the spices in a crawfish boil.  It might sound a little much to eat chips with pizza, but these are a real treat.
