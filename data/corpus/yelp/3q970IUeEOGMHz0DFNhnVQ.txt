For after dinner drinking, I give it 5 stars... I mean they have Delirium on tap! The food I give 4 stars, but the sushi is half off till 6 and it is pretty good.... P.S. There version of a spicy mayo that comes with the sushi is unbelievably good. Overall its a great place for after work... especially on Friday's. I will definitely keep this on my return list and would recommend it to anyone looking to have a good time and get the weekend started right.
