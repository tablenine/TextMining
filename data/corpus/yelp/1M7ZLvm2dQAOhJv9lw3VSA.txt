Why is the menu kinda expensive here? That threw me off to be perfectly honest. The sangria was good, but they barely give you any in a metal pitcher and I think they only have red...hmmm. Outdoor seating was really nice but I could tell the indoor was really dark. Fried calamari was very good and they have interesting sides like fried plantains and a uniue potato salad along with tamales. YUM. Experience was ok, much rather go to Sopo.
