it started off well with an appetizing crab cake roll. then the rest of the meal fell flat. for the price, this should have been one of the best steaks i've ever had. it was not even close. reading about the exotic salts, dry aging, and specialty meats really got me excited. but my bet is the menu had more flavor than the steak. i'm also weary when there are bottled steak sauces on the table. a good steak should have enough juicyness that you'll be glad to use the bread pudding to clean your plate. also, the creamy spinach and risotto were bland, the service was good, and the ambience was okay.
