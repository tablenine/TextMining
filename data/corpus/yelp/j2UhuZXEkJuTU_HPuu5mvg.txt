Great place to reenergize yourself after a shopping trip or just to hang out and people-watch.  We sat outside and enjoyed some tasty food and beverages, and our waitperson was friendly and great with his suggestions.  I'm sure the vibe changes as the sun goes down, but in the middle of a hot NY summer day, this was the perfect place to sit and take in the buzz of Nolita.
