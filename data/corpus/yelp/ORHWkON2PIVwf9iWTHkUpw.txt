I had the pleasure of enjoying the "special" duck confit salad as well as the jamon Serrano flatbread.  The salad was a lovely contrast in flavors and textures with figs, pears and of course the duck which fell off the bone, yum.  The flatbread's crust was perfectly crisp and the toppings were delicious and melded well.  The service was friendly and quick.   I would like to go back and try the shrimp flatbread, the mussles and the mac and cheese with ham.
