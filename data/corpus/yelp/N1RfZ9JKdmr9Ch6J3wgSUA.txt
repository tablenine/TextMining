Restaurant: Bone Garden Cantina
Category: Mexican
I am not a fan of Mexican food, but they had some good drinks here. I was expecting an old looking place in the middle of nowhere but it was very new...in the middle of nowhere.. . It would be very hard to find this place unless you were looking for it. It is in a complex with various other companies and it seemed that was their main clientele. They seemed surprised we did not work in the area. I did like the wallpaper and decorations which were all bone related, not to mention the giant bone statue out front.. . They have a lot of exotic beers I had not had before and some interesting margaritas. I had the Bone Punch.It made me want to go plant my own Bone Garden somewhere. Oh, and the bartender was pretty hot too.
