Eh.  It was OK.. . The drinks were too sweet and not boozy enough.  The tacos were OK, but sparse on the filling.  The taco that was advertised as having habanero in it was not even remotely spicy.  The tamales were only OK.. . Our server was really nice, but spaced on people's drink orders several times.  All in all, the entire experience was only OK.  I wouldn't make a trip back.
