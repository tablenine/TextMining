What a unique establishment.  Very unique look/feel all around.  . . Highly recommended as an out of town visitor trying to get a nice authentic "Chicago-style" pizza experience.. . Very friendly, prompt service.. . Reasonable prices and a great atmosphere made my first visit a very pleasant experience.
