Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
They are ok tacos, Â but not worth the line to wait for them. When I have gone, it's right at 5:30 or right when they open otherwise expect to wait for parking, to order and to get your food. I like their beef &amp; bean burrito &amp; always order jalapeos with everything.
