Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
This is not one of those yelp reviews where I don't feel the need to blab out too much because Porto's is a sure hit. Just look at how many reviews there are for this place as well as their Glendale branch. To me, Porto's is all about the bakery and pastry. Superb and always great to bring to co-workers, birthdays, any other occasions. I finally experienced their sandwiches. The media noche was pretty good but I really enjoyed my beef fajita sandwich. The banana (plantain) chips were whatever. Of course as everyone knows, the only drawback to this place is that it is so popular that it's always packed. The line is usually crazy but for the most part, it moves swiftly. Their hot soy latte (cafe con leche) is really good but their iced caramel coffee was mediocre. If you go on the weekends or during busy hours, be prepared to wait in line a bit. MmMMm Porto's!!!
