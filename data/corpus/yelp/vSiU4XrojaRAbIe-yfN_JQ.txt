Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
Final Decision: Good pastrami, but overly priced. . So I saw this placed mentioned on Foodnetwork Best Things Ever and some of the celeb chefs mentioned some of their favorite foods between bread, this one was mentioned.  So my friends and I decided to give it a try.  We arrive and got greeted with a small group of people ahead of us and hostess that wasn't alerting everyone about a waitlist.  The place looked like a deli/restaurant that had these oldschool booths with the menus stuck in a slot between the chairs.  It was kinda cool to see people with shirt and bow-ties and taking orders.  Service was okay, there was a bus girl that came around all the tables from time to time to check on our beverages. . Food Ordered: . Pastrami with muenster and russian dressing on rye - I really liked the texture and thickness of the meat. The combination of the cheese and Russian all seems to meld in your mouth like french fries and ketchup.  . . #19 same as above but with swiss - my friend seemed to enjoy the sandwich with the swiss.  He didn't like the banana peppers that he requested on the side, which came off a little to salty.. . Pastrami and corned beef on rye - my other buddy thought the sandwich was okay, nothing to exciting or overly special.  He didn't have the Russian dressing in his sandwich though. . . Granted that my sandwich was tasty and the piles of pastrami was there, what was still hurting was the price.  For a sandwich portion that my friends and I got, we should not be paying $14 per sandwich.  Hence my low rating
