This is the nicest place in chicago for a vegetarian date spot. I've been there twice doing such a thing, and it was enjoyable.  The food is quite pricey, and it's very good.. . However, I expected to find very new and different items on the menu between the two seasons I went spring and fall, and there just wasn't most of the dishes had the same flavors and just didn't linger with me after I left.  As I can't remember right now what I had at all, or even a week later I couldn't.  I think they could improve their food to make it more interesting and exciting.  . . The coffee is so expensive though! wow. that surprised me, I can understand all of the other pricing, but $9 for coffee, that's a bit much.  . So go here on a date, it'll be a good night out.
