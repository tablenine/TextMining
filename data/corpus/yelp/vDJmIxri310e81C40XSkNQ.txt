Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Everytime I go to Burbank, i got to stop by porto bakery.. I love their americanized cuban pastry  My favorite one is guava &amp; cheese pastry .. I love their pastry because they are not sweet at all.. . The bakery always busy; therefore, be patient.  it's worth it.
