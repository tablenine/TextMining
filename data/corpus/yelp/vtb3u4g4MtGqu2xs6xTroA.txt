Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Easily the best Ramen spot in the San Gabriel Valley.  I used to love going to Daikokuya in J. Town in down town LA, but it seems like their quality kept dropping ever since they gained much popularity the last couple of years.  Shinsengumi servers are always friendly and enthusiastic.  Their Ramen is authentic Japense Hakata Ramen, unlike the Chinese imitation Ramen in some other spots in SGV.  Comfortable and friendly environment for several friends to get some good Ramen and a few drinks.  I wouldn't recommend groups bigger than 8 thou. . . Personal recommendation: hard noodles, strong flavor, medium oil, add chasu, bamboo, , corn, and cod roe.
