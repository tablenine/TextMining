I was introduced to this resturant about 3 yrs ago and to this day its one of my favorite places to dine. Its extremely crowded from 7:00 -8:30 pm, so I suggest having reservations. If you have a favorite bottle of wine - BRING IT!!! . . The food is AMAZING!!! You will enjoy no matter what. . . For 2 people you're looking at a $70 bill and its worth it.
