Went for dinner. Big place, big furniture. Nice bathroom. . . Had resisted going because of the bad experience at the place next door. I don't know why I lumped the two restaurants together... Anyway.. . Ordered: . - ravioli with goat cheese. - Kalymnos Greek Salad. - one of the flatbreads, I can't remember which.... - pork entree. - sweet tea. . The food was good but not memorable. I do remember the entrees were each under 500 calories. . . Did not like our service. Totally awkward turtle. Was not there when needed. Came upon us unannounced. One time we were discussing important manners and realized the server had been telling us the specials for about a minute before any of us realized he was there.. . Will I go again? Mebbe.
