I really want to give this place a 2 or 3 because of the scene,service and price, but the food won't let me do it! It's really that good. I went in flip flops, a tshirt and sweats. Mistake. Who dresses up for breakfast though?! I wasn't embarrassed though. Not like I couldn't afford it! lol There was no big crowd and I sat at a booth immediately. That's what makes the service so horrible. I can understand the disrespect if you're busy. I gotta stop following the Food Network. Guy Fieri needs a good talkin to!
