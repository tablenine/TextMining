This place is so much fun. I've seen people on dates, older couples, groups of coworkers, and people with children here. On Saturday , they had a live band playing which was a nice treat. . . The food is delicious, but I'll tell you what really stands out..The service. . The service is excellent and really makes you miss good service when you go to a different restaurant. . . I usually get pizza when here, but next time I will venture out and try something new. Great food at a great price.
