I like this place because it's good food open all the time. Â My favorite things to get here are the veggie royale, bossa nova waffle sundae, and most recently, the BLTLA. Sometimes there's a wait (mostly really late on the weekends) but I'd much rather eat here than some greasy spoon or fast food restaurant in the middle of the night.
