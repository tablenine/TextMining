Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I used to drive by this place all the time, but never stopped because the lines were always extremely long.  One day I decided to stop and I have loved this place ever since.  Their tacos and burritos taste great and the price is right.  The food always tastes fresh and I always leave with a full belly and a smile on my face.  My wife loves their enchiladas and guacamole.. . Parking is a bit of a challenge, so scope out street parking under the freeway (405).  Also, remember that this is a cash only establishment.
