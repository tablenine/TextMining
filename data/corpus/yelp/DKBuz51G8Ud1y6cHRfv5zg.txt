For some reason I came here twice in one week. The first time it was because of my friends who had gone a billion times, so it sparked my interest.. . I ordered the chicken ranch wrap which I thought was fabulous. I wasn't too excited about the little bit of fries that came with it. Although it was all filling they didn't have to be so cheap on a wrap and fries that I could have gotten at McDonalds for a dollar and some change.. . But whatevs, I also came back for dessert and I must say the fudge brownie with the ice cream was beyond tasty and the Italian Sodas have become my 2nd love.
