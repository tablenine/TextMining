The best thing about this place is the topping selection--I love it when I can get both pepper jack cheese and jalapenos on a burger. Second best thing: sweet potato fries. I would go back for these alone.. . But a burger is a burger. there was nothing great about the actual burger. It was delicious and well-cooked...but certainly not out of this world. I could go down the street to 5 Guys for an equally delicious (but for less money and less hype) burger.. . I'm told the veggie burgers and shakes are phenomenal--I'll definitely go back to give them both a try. But I won't go out of my way to do so.
