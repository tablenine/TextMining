Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Never have I ever.... . ... though of eating chicken &amp; waffles together.. . I was skeptical about trying at first, but I'm so glad that I did.  Genius combination of flavors.  Colonel Sanders would have been impressed with Roscoe's fried chicken and Aunt Jemima would've approved the soft, buttery waffles.  The Eclipse and Sunset drinks were just as awesome and perfectly balanced.  This is a must-try in LA!
