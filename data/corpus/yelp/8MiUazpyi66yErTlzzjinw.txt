Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
I came here late one night with a friend. The place was a cute retro diner with a very fun menu. All the names of the food were creative and they had plenty of different options that diners would not normally offer. It would be really hard to not find something to eat. The first time I got the Hippie Sandwich and it was delicious. The second time I got the fish and chips which were just okay. The place itself looked clean enough, with the exception of the restroom which had a black lights and crazy dolls hanging from the ceiling. I would plan to come here again in the late evening, it's much better than going to Denny's for a boring meal. I'd rather go to Fred's and have more options.
