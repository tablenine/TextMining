As a newbie to Chicago, tonight was my first night visiting Uncommon Ground.  It had a lot of build up, and I was excited, which is maybe why I feel let down.  I went for the music, which was excellent, but the wait staff were annoyed at us, and extremely unhelpful.  I was not sure where the music was, or if it had even started, and they seated us at a table after I shared that I was looking for the music.  I then felt compelled to order.  The prices for food are way higher than my grad student/substitute ESL teacher salary, so I ordered hot chocolate and a desert.  Amazing hot chocolate, dry cake for desert... let down.  So, then our waiter was annoyed that we were leaving the table to go to the music, which we tried to get to in the beginning.  I think I need to be less small town and just assert myself to begin with, but the staff did not make this easy.  I give the staff a two star rating, because they were rude, and the music and vibe of the back room a 4 1/2 star rating, so I average out at three.  Next time, I'll be assertive and ignore the crabby people.
