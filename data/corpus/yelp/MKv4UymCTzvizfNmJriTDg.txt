Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I know this place has a lot of history and all, and in my quest for the perfect burger I had to stop at this LA landmark.  After all, I even asked "chacha" (the 242242 text thing) what the best burger in LA is, and they texted me back that Apple Pan is one of the highest rated places.. . I got the hickory burger and fries.  The burger comes with a LOT of lettuce and pickles, no tomato or onion.  Yeah, this is when my doubts started.... . The hickory sauce is like ketchup, only a little sweeter and tangier, but still pretty close to ketchup.  Nothing special.  And while the hickory sauce did work well with the pickles, overall I just wasn't very impressed.  The fries were whatevers. . .  Forget hickory/ketchup sauce, I would take In-N-Out over this place any day!
