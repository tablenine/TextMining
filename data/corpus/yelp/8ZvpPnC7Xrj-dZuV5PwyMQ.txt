Restaurant: Opera
Category: Chinese
I've been here twice and both times the food was absolutely delicious.  I had the morel mushroom wontons and a few of the other items on the menu the first time I stopped in.  Basically I think the food can blow you away for what it is, they really can add interesting flavors to typical chinese dishes, which is why I think a lot of people enjoy this restaurant. . . The decor is fabulous, similar to a circus/ opera but done in a very tactful way.  I actually had the same server each time I was there, and she was great, nothing spectacular, but knew quite a bit about the menu and the wine.  As other people have mentioned it is pretty pricey, especially the wine, but it's worth it for a nice date or group night out.
