Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I seriously thought i wouldn't like this place, but i was wrong! I got the regular chicken and waffles, no gravy. the chicken was a good size, juicy and tasty! the waffle was my favorite! it was sooo good!!! They give generous portions here. I also ordered fries and potato salad to share with the party of 4, but they were alright, nothing spectacular. I would rather order chicken and waffles (hint, the name of the restaurant). i wished they have roscoes here in the bay! :( I missed the waffles! If gas were super cheap, I would totally drive down south to get me some soul food!! :D
