Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
I can't help but love this restaurant. It's in a fun area downtown and it's pretty much my destination for dinner before shows if I've had enough of Canter's.. . Blu-Jam is a truly hip little eatery that doesn't have the marble/glass/dark wood look that every "hip" eatery has these days. The waitstaff is always really great and they all seem to really enjoy working there. Our water glasses are always full and the food is always served promptly and (here's the sign of a good restaurant) at the same time. . . I've eaten here for Breakfast and early dinner and both are really good, but seriously avoid the turkey sausage because it's just the dodgiest, hardest, weirdest flavored sausage I've ever eaten. The turkey bacon is really a better choice in that. I reccommend the Chicken Vesuvius and the pea soup, both are well seasoned and the chicken is not even in the least dry (which is really an accomplishment for any restaurant, let alone one with prices like these.)
