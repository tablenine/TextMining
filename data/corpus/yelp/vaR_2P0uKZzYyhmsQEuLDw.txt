excellent sandwiches! . . the service was sincere. the hibiscus iced tea was yummy! i had the turkey sammich and my hubby got the cheese steak. Came with homemade chips and pickles. I would pass on the cheese steak though. It wasn't as unique as the turkey one. I'll be sure to visit them at their bigger location. This little place is really little. Only seats about 10 people inside and 20 outside at a time. The decor/ambiance inside wasn't much because it was the littlest room I've ever dined in. The prices and amount was just right for lunch.
