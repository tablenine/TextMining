Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
5 years in LA and finally did it.  . . First, let's answer the question of if Fried Chicken and Waffles belong together at all, or if Roscoe was just a crazy, cholesterol loving freak.   The verdict?  F--- Yeah!  Amazing combination and Roscoe is indeed a genius.  A little fried skin, syrup, and waffle as the canvas that pulls it all together...magic.. . The chicken was really good, but not the best in town.  Waffles were the diappointment.  Super soggy and not all that flavorable, seems like . . Portions and big and prices good, so definitely an LA must-do experience.  Don't bother with the gravy or anything special, just go with the basics (Scoe's#1 reco).. . disclaimer:  review biased by 6+ bourbon cocktails spread across Cole's and Seven Grand.
