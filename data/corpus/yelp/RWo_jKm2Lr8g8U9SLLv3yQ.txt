This place has awesome pizza by the slice, and you can't beat the fact that it's BYOB. I went here before a concert at the metro, and it was great. Nice guys work behind the counter and the place always has lots of comfortable tables and booths to sit in. The one thing that I will caveat this with is that I went on a saturday night around 830PM, and there were already drunken guys throwing up on themselves by 9....eh Wrigleyville. Just ignore it. :)
