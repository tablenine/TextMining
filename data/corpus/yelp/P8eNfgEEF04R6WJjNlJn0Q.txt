The first place I had pho. It's a bit nostalgic, I guess. This place is really small and the kitchen is right in your face so you can see everything thats happening in there. The pho will require a second visit, as its been awhile. . . And although I remember falling quickly in love with the beautiful bowl of hot steamy sexy soup in front of me. Ooh... and all the fun stuff you can tear up and throw in. It's like the food version of ripping someone's clothes off before diving in to mad love making. And the best part with this soupy lover is that you can flavor it just the way you want. Now if I could only find a man that would let me do that. (Not trying to be mean here fella's, I'm just saying we all need a lil work from time to time).. . I loved and still love the ambiance of this place. Even a drive by prompts my head to turn for a sneak peek of what once was the only pho I had ever had. But now mama's branched out, and although she might not Â have a brand new bag she's sure open to new pho's.. . BTW... this place is always busy. So get there before you get really hungry so the wait won't bother too much. At least the service is quick.
