Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Five stars, baby. This place is money. I prefer the Reuben burrito, but the Hollenbeck is awesome, too. Do yourself a favor and order your burrito wet- it's gonna be a little slice of heaven. Tacos, taquitos, enchiladas, salsa, chips, guacamole-everything is good in this joint, and it has the crowds to prove it. Don't be fooled by imitations- go to Manuel's Original on Evergreen.
