Restaurant: Bob San Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
I am a bob san regular. My boyfriend used to live down the street and we could be found having a late dinner here, almost twice a week. I am friends with bob, and alan and we always sit at the sushi bar because we like to chat! The food is excellent- as everyone as reported. But i think the most special thing at bob san is bob and alan! If you sit at the bar- they will Â guide to what is the freshest of the night, and create special rolls just for you! Not only are they great to have a fun chat with, i think they pay special attention to you if you sit right at the bar.. Our favorite are the seared scallops for appetizers, uni sushi when it's recommended, and super white tuna! . They are expanding their restaurant to be almost double in size soon, and which is why i think they've slightly raised the prices. Bob also owns Naniwa, in the loop, another great alternative when you arent in the neighborhood.
