We came here using our groupon last night and all day I was debating on what to order.  Corned beef sandwich, the Reuben, and Matzo ball soup.  I didn't want to be too gluttonous but how does one decide?  Well, when we arrived, viola!  Soup and 1/2 a sandwich deal for $10.95!  How perfect! I couldn't get the half Reuben but beggars can't be choosers.  I got my matzo ball soup and a half corned beef and pastrami sandwich.  Everything was delicious.  The hubs got the Reuben with a potato pancake which I ate since he was full.  I ate some of the meat that fell out of the sandwich and it was tasty.  The soup, the potato pancake, the two pickle slices and I was full!  I brought my sandwich for lunch today and am already wanting to taste it.  Can't it be lunch now?!. . Using the coupon we had, we ended up paying almost $10 out of pocket but we did get a $5 coupon to use on another visit!  Can't wait to go back and get that Reuben.  Or the lox plate.
