Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
Hugos has been one of the best restaurants Ive been to since moving to Chicago. The atmosphere is classy and sophisticated, though it tends to get noisey at times. . . Went here with a group of about 10. We had reservations and werent seated right away... but got to enjoy some time at the bar... and let me tell you, they make a stiff drink!!! . . Once seated we started with some aps: Crab Claws, Raw Oysters, and Lobster Bisque. All were great. Fresh and for lack of a better word, tasty!!! From there it only got better. Well prepared entrees with generous portions. . . Lastly, their chocolate cake is the largest, most decadent slice of heaven! It is pretty much half a cake in a single serving. . . Nothing about this place is cheap... but its totally worth it!!!
