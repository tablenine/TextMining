Restaurant: El Carmen
Category: Bars
El Carmen has become my fave local (since The Dime prefers the Trollsen Twins, apparently).. . I mean where else in this hood can you get friendly door-dudes and bartenders, a great jukebox, no Hollywood 'tudes...and it's a wee stumble home, no less.  The interior has lots to keep you amused: Mexican wrestling paraphenalia, funky lights, sensational flyers.. . Ok-- food is not the main draw,  but if you want a table, just order the nachos and the fish or tater tacos. And down a shot of METAL for me. The margaritas are delicious, too. Try the watermelon.
