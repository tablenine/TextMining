I really really really wanted to give this place more but the boyfriend and I had to debate if the hair in our bowls was mine or someone else's. Pretty sure it WAS NOT mine. . The food was alright but uhm... If the menu says "minced beef vermicelli noodles" you except MINCED beef right? yea, my meat was in huge chunks. I hardly call that minced. I appreciated the tea egg in it though.. I also had a side order of their sausage with minced garlic since they're famous for their sausages. It seriously tastes like a lop cherng (chinese sausage) but with less fat, and not as sweet. The minced garlic was raw. Entirely raw, with oil and dallop of satay sauce. It was way too much garlic. It'd probably be enough to kill Edward Cullen (oh if only I could kill that fictional vampire that gives teenage girls false ideals about love &amp; relationships). I had to scrape most of the garlic off and it was still too garlicky. . The porkchop rice was super good though. It's deep fried with salt &amp; pepper. MmM MMM MmMMSG goodness.. Just no more hairs in my stuff okay SinBala? Thanks.
