This is gawd-awful sushi for amateurs, but I guess if you're hammered on sake anything tastes OK.  But what about your olfactory senses?  The whole place (and fish) stinks, and it's not even a bargain.  Avoid it like the plague, or you just might get it.. . If you want good sushi ITP you'll find it at Taka, MF Sushi or Harry &amp; Son's.  Also, Starfish on Peachtree is small and delightful with a $10 sake sampling.  Sit at the counter and watch the pros at work.
