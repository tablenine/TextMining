I recommend coming here if you've never been. The sandwiches and drinks are OK. But the pastries are out of this world. Definitely order a pastry box to go. My favorites are the guava and the cheese pastries. The place always has a long line. But you don't have to wait too long because they're properly staffed with friendly people with perfect memories (I've never seen them jot down my long orders). If you want to dine in, I recommend you have someone look for a table while you're in line. The tables are rarely empty.
