Rating: 3.7. . I took myself on a date tonight. Since Sushi Gen is closed on Sundays, I decided to go to where Jerry L. recommended, Sushi Go 55.  I realized I've been here before and thought it was ok. Setting my previous opinion aside, I still think it's ok, but then again, I need to try their chirashi bowl the next time. . . There was no waiting time, and the sushi chef was nice. . . The spicy tuna was good but small.  The unagi and avocado roll was ok (didn't melt in my mouth), but then when I got to my last piece, I found a part of the avocado seed in it.. The kanpachi was firm and as Shauna D. puts it "Interesting." Meal came out to $19 (excluding tip).
