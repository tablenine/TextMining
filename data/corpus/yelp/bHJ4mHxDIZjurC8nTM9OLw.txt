Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
You can only church up a burger so much before it becomes ridiculous.. I had the original Umami burger. It was good, but not "$10 for just a burger" good. The malt liquor onion rings were awesome. You could actually taste the malt liquor and the onion didn't slide out of the batter on the first bite.. Also, Faygo soda was readily available for all you juggalo types.. In summation: I'm going to open a high end hotdog restaurant and call it Haute-Dawg.
