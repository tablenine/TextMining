Restaurant: Bin Wine Cafe
Category: American (New)
When was the last time you went to a bar or restaurant and could get a Bottle of wine for 10 bucks?   You can here! So, it's not over priced.  I have been to Bin Cafe many many many times and it is always great. Their specials each night  keep things fresh and exciting. The last time i was there the special was an Atlantic Salmon, pan seared with a Sweet corn risotto. HEAVEN. . . The Cheese is AWESOME!. . Tip:  If it's just you and a friend, ask to sit at the back bar.  This is the best spot in the house!  Live entertainment. You can watch the cooks prepare all the yummy food.  I like to watch them make deserts.  Talk about appetizing. Also, don't be shy the cooks there are all cool and will talk to you about what they are making if you ask politely and don't keep them from their tasks.
