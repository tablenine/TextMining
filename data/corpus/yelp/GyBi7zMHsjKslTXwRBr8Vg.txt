Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
My friend and I patroned Ciudad during LA restaurant week and I was very pleased with our choice. My taste buds were truly tantalized! Ciudad has found a way to mesh unique ingredients with classic comforting favorites. . . The bread they bring you out to start is delicious and is served with a Mediterranean hummus and olive dip. I would definitely recommend the meals we had : . mahi mahi ceviche, spicy Cesar salad, chicken Ciudad (the green sauce was to die for) and the mahi mahi with mashed potatoes. . . The mojito was just right and the service was right on point. It is nestled downtown and has a nice outdoor eating area. I can't wait to go back.
