so beyond the concept of a KBBQ taco truck which is just freaking awesome, Kogi does pretty well for itself. . . The other night, I had a spicy pork taco, short rib taco, and the special: mung bean "polenta." That was a total of $6. Pretty decent prices. Burritoes are $5. Drinks are $2 as well. While the portions may look tiny at first, they're actually pretty filling, if only because your mouth is on fire with spicy, salty, unidentifiable goodness. which calls for beer. and that kind of sucks because I don't think the truck sells alcohol ... stupid liquor laws. . . ANYWAY, my only beef (ha ha) with Kogi was that my food arrived lukewarm. Granted, it was a cold night, but I really missed the warm-food hands you get from other taco trucks. :: shrug :: I hope they fix that because I'll kick in another star if they do. Â  . . Also, my hands smelled like kimchee for hours afterwards, despite frequent scrubbing with Bath and Body Works most pungent soaps. Might be a plus or minus for you, I don't know.
