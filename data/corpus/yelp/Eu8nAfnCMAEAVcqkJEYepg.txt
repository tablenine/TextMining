Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I've heard so many great things about this little hole in the wall so PW and I made the trek out to silver lake to see what the hype was all about.. . needless to say, it lived up to all the hype and more. the menu is simple:. . $1.50 fish. $2.00 shrimp. $1.00 drink. . didn't spend too much time thinking about what we should get. we ordered 4 tacos and 2 drinks for a whopping $8.50. i really liked how they just give you the taco and let you put on whatever toppings you want at the salsa bar. the bar had about 5 different types of salsa ranging from hot to mild, a big bowl of shredded cabbage and last but not least a large container of sour cream. . . we devoured our tacos and proceeded to get 2 more. the owner was super nice and told us it was on the house! "you've already given me enough money, don't worry about it"......OKAY, when does that ever happen?!?! never. i was totally taken aback.. . but back to the food...I think I prefer the shrimp over the fish just because there was a tad bit more flavor to the shrimp but both are fantastic. the fish and shrimp are both fried to golden perfection and have the most satisfying crunch when you take a bite. so good!!. . if you haven't tried this place yet, please pay homage ASAP!
