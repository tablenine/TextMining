Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Love Love Love pizzeria mozza! Def the best pizza you can get in LA.  The crust is bubbly, crispy, and chewy all at the same time.  The toppings are out of the ordinary and compliments each other very well!  I've tried a lot of their pizzas and a few of my favorites are the white anchovy, anything with the buffalo mozzarella/burrata, and fried sage.  They have this amazing cheese that they put on their arugula and mushroom salad that is soooo yummy! I try to come here as often as possible =)
