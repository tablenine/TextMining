Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
The only good thing about this restaurant is its location- the night view is amazing. . .  As far as their food is concerned, WTH? Overprice for barely mediocre food!!! . .  I had their salmon dish with Asparagus and my grandmother had their black cod dish.  I have definitely had so much better salmon/black cod dish elsewhere. I was SO DISAPPOINTED. . .  For the same price, I recommend Josie restaurant in Santa Monica-. their fish dishes are amazing. . .  Even Westside Tavern's salmon dish is so much better. . .  Furthermore, I had their chocolate cake with Vanilla Ice Cream- Damn..  I really want YAMASHIRO's chefs and owner to taste their own menu with their own mouth before selling their food to customers. . .  The amazing view only will not secure their business. . .   Including their valet service, I paid over $100 dollars for me and my friend. . .   For WHAT?  I will never go back there. . .   By the way, I don't even like their interior design.
