Get ready for a different kind of brunch. Amazing presentation and a reasonably priced and diverse menu make for a great feast. I had the "sassy eggs' which was chorizo and potatoes covered with a layer of eggs and guac with a kick. The whole thing drizzled in a layer of ketchup/mystery sauce. The best. The only major problem was choosing. Crunchy blueberry pancakes? Yes please. Also important to note, the coffee is excellent as well, and they just kept it coming. . . Negatives? The lighting was super harsh and I felt like I was onstage. We got there and got a table right away, but in the mornings I've been told it has a long wait.
