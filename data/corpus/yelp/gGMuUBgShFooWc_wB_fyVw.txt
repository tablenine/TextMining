I went here last night for the first time.  The first thing that keeps sticking with me is the freaking impeccable and immaculate service.  Im a stickler for good service and this place rocked.  My water glass was never empty.  As soon as something was done or a wine carafe was empty it was whisked away.  I never had a want for service.  Someone was always RIGHT THERE.  If your waiter zooms past you and you cant catch him (as is what happened with my table last night once) they have these stationed matre'ds that seem to appear out of nowhere and make sure you have everything you need.  Incredible service.. . The pizza was damn good.  Its hearty rustica real Italian pizza.  The dough is great as its flaky and soft and crispy all at once.  I enjoyed the Coach Farm Goat Cheese pizza with bacon and leeks.  It was damn good.  My friend had the Rapini with Anchovie.  A little too salty but it is anchovy so thats what you want.  The prices of the food are all very exceptable.  I want to go back to try some of the aps that came out of the kitchen that looked amazing.  The wine list is long and very good.  A bit expensive of a list but I had one of the cheaper reds and it was an incredible glass that went perfectly with the pizza.  . . Mozza is a must go for sure.  But honestly if you just want amazing pizza you can go to Pizza Buona or Palermo's or Prizzi's on Franklin for amazing pizza.  I guess you come to Mozza for Mario Batalli's new inventions on old recipe's.
