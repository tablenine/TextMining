Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
I am upping Pho Cafe from two stars to four because:. 1) I forgot how to speak Vietnamese. 2) I haven't seen my parents in months. 3) I haven't had a perfect bowl of my mom's home-cooked pho in months. 4) I can't be bothered to drive out of LA to get REALLY GOOD PHO. 5) I'm homesick. 6) Objectively, their meats are really, really tender and delicious.. . If they would just add some kick to their broth, my mother would be rendered obsolete. just kidding mom i love you!. . PS One of the most authentically Vietnamese things about Pho Cafe is that they are cash only..
