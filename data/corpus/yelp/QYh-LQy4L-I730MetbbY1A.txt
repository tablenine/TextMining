My husband and his friend went their for dinner on a Thursday night and came home telling me wonderful things about this restaurant. I made him take me the very next day and he was happy to come back. . . My husband was right to rave about this place. . . I had the shrimp risotto which was perfectly cooked and I loved how the cubes of zucchini were still fresh and crisp in warm rice. I loved it.. My husband had the appetizer called Wings &amp; Beer. (It looked delicious, but there are a lot of things I don't like while I'm pregnant. For some reason I don't have any desire to eat chicken wings. Weird, but just how I am right now).. . For my entree I had the Corn and Fava Bean Succotash, pork tenderloin with roasted spoon bread. I crave corn with this pregnancy, so this was the dish for me. It didn't disappoint.  . . My husband is in the industry and one of the perks to being married to a chef, is when a restaurant where we are dining sends out anything complimentary.  Perennial's chef sent out some fantastic desserts. Everything was amazing, but what stuck out most for me was the deconstructed cheesecake. A berry "pudding" then a creamy foam and a crispy light cookie on top. But when you ate it together, it tasted just like a light cheesecake. Yum! The other two chocolate desserts were exceptional, it's just that the cheesecake warranted more space in this review.. . I think the prices are pretty reasonable for what you get. The presentation and service reminds me of pricier restaurants, and I have a feeling these prices won't stay this low, once their restaurant gets busier. I've already told everyone I know.
