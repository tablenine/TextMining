Portos, well what can I say its all good! I have been going to Portos since I was a small child in the 1970's. When we use to live in Inglewood when Inglewood was a good neighborhood we could not wait to arrive at Portos. Coming from a 100% Cuban family Â I know good cuban food when I see it even before tasting it. Portos bakery and now Portos Bakery and Cafe meet and exceed the needs of the cuban peoples taste. There is not one Cuban Bakery in Miami (Little Cuba) that can even come close to this place. I want to personally Thank Porto his family, Raul and Sister for keeping up the hard work and finally opening up a second location in Burbank CA even though I heard Porto was not crazy about the idea. Now that I live in the Valley I visit the Burbank store more often than Glendale but I do miss seeing the Portos family faces. They have now added dinner plates that while the food is awesome the portions are too small. Heck I could eat two of those plates. I love this place so much I take my clients here to make and close deals over the good food. Nothing better than making money and eating good food both at the same time. My clients come away so happy about the food they are more than happy to do business with me. Its a great place for food and when I tell returning customers lets talk about it over lunch at Portos I will buy the deal is in the bag!
