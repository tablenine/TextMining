DONT YOU MESS WITH THE BEST!!  Okay, not the best ever but best in L.A.. . I've been to a lot of ramen places.  Asahi Ramen (I had miso ramen) was horrible.  Kyushu Ramen should change their name because everything else is good except for the ramen.  Daikokuya was about an 8 (good but not good enough).  Chabuya was just a bit too unique for me (different type of noodles)  and not the kind I like so I gave it a 7.  Koraku downtown, I remember I had to ADD soy sauce in my shoyu ramen because it was bland.  . . People, I LIVED in tokyo and had the best ramen growing up, and just got back from Tokyo having tried a TON of different types of ramen, and still yet OROCHON is the BEST I've had in California for ONE particular ramen.  . . Here, it really depends on what you get.  I've tried experimenting with shoyu and miso ramen with different levels.  There's like 6 or 7.  . . Miso ramen level 5 = 3.8.. Miso ramen level 3 or 4 (spicy) = 3.8.  . Shoyu ramen level 3= 4. Shoyu ramen level 4= 4.1. Shoyu ramen level 5 or 6=  5 STARS . .  I'm all about spicy food and love all that stuff, but when you try the level 5 or 6, you can taste the depth of their broth.  I have no idea what they put in it to make it so damn good, but it's got layers that will shock your tongue.  For some reason the same ramen at other levels like 3 and 4 weren't as good.  . . A friend of mine doesn't think much of Orochon, but that's because she keeps ordering the miso ramen or the spicy miso ramen. . . Stick wtih the shoyu.  Try 5 or 6.  With extra chashu.  They have one of the best fatty looking chashu's you'll ever see.
