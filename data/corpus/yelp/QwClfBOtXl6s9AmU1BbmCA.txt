Restaurant: Stone Soup Kitchen
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Stone Soup Kitchen is amazing. Came here with friends for a nice, leisurely Sunday brunch. It took just a few minutes to be seated. We all ordered different things and shared a bit. . . I had the vegos rancheros, which was tofu scramble and black beans over a tortilla, topped with chopped tomatoes and onions, fresh jalapenos, and a tasty, really spicy sauce. (So happy to find a place that doesn't wimp out on the spice. So, so good. I added a couple drops of the habanero sauce on the tables and was in heaven.) I also got a side of the soysage, which was delicious.. . My friends said the cheese grits were worth the hype, and enjoyed the huevos rancheros. Biscuits were just okay. The jam was yum, but we had to ask for some. (Our waiter, by the way, was super cute but really frazzled, which kinda stressed me out. He was slow with drink refills and was pretty visibly overwhelmed. I know it's Sunday brunch and y'all are busy, but chillax dude.). . We each had two dollars off a ten dollar total coupon (from the SSK website, I believe), and overall brunch was really reasonably priced and super tasty. I'll be back!
