So on a random day, my friend and I decided to try out Oinkster's. As soon as we arrived the parking lot was jammed packed, so we ended up having to park onto the streets. . . It was around 3pm when we got there, and the line was out the door!! . That was pretty crazy, the cashier said that it's pretty much like this all day. So there's really no way to avoid the long lines, but it was definitely well worth the wait. . . We ended up getting the OINKSTER PASTRAMI, omg it was so delicious!! I can't even describe how good it tastes. We also got the seasonal UBE MILKSHAKE; the flavor of it was pretty decent, it just left a bad after taste. I guess it's an acquired taste..idk :\  Anyways, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I'm for sure going back!!!  :)
