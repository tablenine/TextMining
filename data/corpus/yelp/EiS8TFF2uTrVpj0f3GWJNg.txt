I know, I know.  Practically everybody has reviewed this place.  But I had to share my experience with their flight dinner.. . For a mere $25, you get to taste 6 different wines about 1/2 glass each, and a perfectly paired bite size course for each.  They have this only once a month (first Monday of the month).  Food is great, but not enough for dinner.  But we got to hang in Michael's room!!. . The only reason why I gave this place 4, and not 5 stars is because their service is a little slow when we had ala carte dinner previously.
