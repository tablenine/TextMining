Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
Luckily the two times I've tried Kogi there's been no wait (I wouldn't have stood in the ridiculous lines I've heard about if there was). However the 2 times I've gone, I've realized that Kogi is extremely hyped up.. . This is by NO means the most delicious taco you will eat. This is also not worth a 2 hour wait.. . That being said, it's pretty good food. The grease drips off of the sweet and salty meat, and all of the flavors of the taco blend well together to create a truly unique taste.. . Honestly, I think most of the reason people like Kogi is because they like the adventure of chasing down the truck. I know that's one of Kogi's big draws for me too.
