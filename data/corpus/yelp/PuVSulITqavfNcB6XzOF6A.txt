Daikokuya Ramen is a place for fans only. The food is extremely fatty and is literaly made from pig fat, so if you eat healthy this place isn't for you. If you come here only come for the ramen with added koterri flavor. The rest of the food is pretty average. I simply love the food, but the restuarant is quite hot and stuffy. FYI on a Friday Night you may have to wait about 1-2 hours to get in, because they don't take reservations and you do have to wait.
