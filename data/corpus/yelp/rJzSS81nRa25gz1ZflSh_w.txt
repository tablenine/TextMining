such a nice open room-high ceilings, lots of color, curious curtains.  you really get hit with the decor upon entering.  this place is EXPENSIVE, i doubt i can return for a full dinner. however, the portions are so HUGE i could return for the dinner salad which is a meal in itself.  lots of greens &amp; assorted veggies tossed in a light soy vinaigrette.  i also enjoyed the shrimp gyoza, pretty pricey at $10.  the sugar snap pea &amp; forest mushroom stir fry side was also MASSIVE.  for $9 i would hope so.  i never made it to a full entree, but shared with my vegetarian friend from the vegan menu which was very impressive-Hainanese Style Kaipong  Twice Cooked Coconut Curry Rice,Stir Fried Choi Sum, Forest Mushrooms, Peanuts, Sweet Peas. it was steamed in a lotus leaf.  . . the food was excellent, but for 2 people cost a whopping $140.  we had some drinks, but for one app, one side, one side salad &amp; one vegan entree, that is just way too expensive.
