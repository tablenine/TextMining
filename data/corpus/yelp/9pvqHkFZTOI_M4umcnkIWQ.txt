I strongly disliked eating here, and haven't had anything good or memorable here.  I've been here two or three times for lunch with someone who likes the place, so I gave it another chance.  I have tried the side dishes and the selection was limited, some were ok, some were bad.  The lemonade was a BAD lemonade mix, and there was no iced tea.  They give you a glass of ice and you pour your own drink from a plastic pitcher that sits on a table for everyone.  The pictures on the wall are not just cute, they are unappetizing, all of chickens.  Must we be reminded of exactly what the bird looked like before it was killed and de-feathered?  Sorry, it looks "funky" but not in a good way.  The whole places looks too kitchy.  It's dumpy and in need of updating, I think they're going for a run-down country barn look.. . I really don't know what people like about this place.  The food was just not good here.  I think it's just that people in Chicago like to think they're eating Southern food.
