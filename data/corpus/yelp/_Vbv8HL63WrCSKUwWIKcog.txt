I really don't get why everyone loves it here.  I love the rude black girls, but the cheese sauce is soooo gross.  It's GRITTY.  And SWEET.  It's nasty. The fries are soggy too.  I hate that.  I hate soggy, limp fries.  Don't like it on a guy, don't like it in a fry!. . Soggy and limp that is, get it?  Haha I'm so funny.
