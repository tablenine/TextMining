I went on an awesome date with an amazing a guy at this spot in the highlands. I would like to give my date two thumbs up for researching a gluten-free restaurant for me. I like this place despite the size of the restaurant. Great atmosphere and crowd. Food was great! Hostess a little off. We had a wonderful server that was very charming and attentive. I would no doubt recommend this restaurant. They have a great gluten free menu. I ordered the grilled calamari and fish market, which was fabulous!
