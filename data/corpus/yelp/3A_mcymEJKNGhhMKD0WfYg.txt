I thought the food and service at this place were alarmingly bad.  I could have made a better steak from buying some flank steak and dumping a bottle of terikakyi sauce from Jewel.  I have been Marche and loved it--these owners should be embarrased for this place.  The place was half full on a weekday night last week yet they still struggled to complete are 4 person order in 3+ hours.  Instead of apologizing the long delay--the mgr just said, "Were really busy tonight."  . . I am too busy to ever go back, I don't care how much the coupon saves you.  Panda Express is run better....
