There's something about this place that makes me think of the many great dystopian novels and movies that have come out in the past. You are numbered, watched and recorded in this place that takes away your appetite like turds on a plate would. You sit around with a Foodlife credit card building that tab like a divorcee in a dive bar. The workers pop out of dark corners with a rag busing your table so quick it brings tears of horror to your face. Its gross, overwhelming and creepy. Quite frankly, I would prefer living with David Berkowitz or Jeffrey Dhamer than ever returning to this sad, sorry reminder that humanity is ending....Starting with 'foodlife.'. . I wouldn't be surprised if what we were eating was Soylent Green.
