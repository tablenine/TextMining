Mmmmm the burgers were awesome!!! I had the Blue Bacon Burger and it was yummy. I thought me friend (who claims she is vegetarian) was going to have a hard time finding something fer herself on the menu BUT they had several veggie choices for her the choose from.  The service was great,  I felt like  our waiter was a long lost friend. . It was a great day as we sat on the outside patio with good food and the inviting East Atlanta Village street traffic.  I will have to come back some time one evening to experience the bar action.
