Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My first time, and as much as I've heard about the place, my imagination had conjured up an image in my mind.. . First- for some reason, I had imagined counter service. It's not. We were seated in a booth in the corner. Cozy, though the ripped vinyl really should be addressed.. . Second- I imagined a menu with 1 thing on it- "chicken and waffles", with variations on size, perhaps. Instead, there were lots of permutations involving gravy or onions or french fries. Eventually, I settled on "#1", thinking if it's number 1, it has to be the signature dish.. . Third- I imagined a plate with chicken and waffles arranged in a mountain, chicken atop the waffle base, syrup running down the whole thing. It's not - the chicken is off to the side, or if you order one of the gravy ones, a separate dish altogether.. . The food - it was OK. The waffles were better than I expected and the chicken not quite as transcendant as I'd heard. It's an interesting combination, to be sure, and burping it later was a novel experience/taste. But, the clouds didn't part (haha, it was raining!) and I didn't see god light when I took that first bite.. . The service was fantastic though- very warm and friendly, from all 3 servers with whom we interacted.
