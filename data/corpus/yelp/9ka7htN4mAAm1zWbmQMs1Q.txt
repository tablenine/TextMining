Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I was visiting SoCal from Boston one day when my boyfriend took me here. I LOVE this place! The focus in the overall atmosphere is history, tasty food and comfort. Almost no one does prime rib quite like Lawry's, they've been doing it for a long time, so they know what you want--delicious food. It doesn't come in the shape of a cube with three strings of vegetable arranged in cursive "isn't this a pretty arrangement" on the plate. It comes smelling and tasting like heaven in your mouth. . Its served to you by waitresses in quaint 40s gear--white hats on their heads, tan uniforms. They looked absolutely elegant and lovely as they expertly answered questions, managed carving stations, whisked salad, etc. They really made the atmosphere interesting. . . The overall restaurant is HUGE! you could picture events there--weddings, parties, etc. They have lots of rooms and main halls. People tended to dress a little nicer than jeans, although some people preferred to come casual. Overall the people at different tables really seemed comfortable and happy. The atmosphere was so cozy. . . Parking is the only down side--too expensive and it takes too long to wait for your car when you leave. Suggest trying to find street parking and walk up to the place if possible.
