Yeah, the jalapeno cheddar nachos are good.  But everything else I've had has been nothing but disappointment.  . . Today I got the "Total Reuben" with a side of potato salad.  The Reuben tasted like vomit.  Pretty much identical to those Harry Potter puke flavored jellybeans.  Soggy "sourdough rye" bread that just tasted like mushy bland wheat bread, with some rice, thousand island, and sauerkraut inside.  The side of potato salad was only a few bites, but it was okay I guess.  $13 + tax and tip ended up being almost $18 for a stupid sandwich.  . . Girlfriend ordered the Ciao Bella sandwich which was pretty much just a few pitiful scraps of lettuce thrown in between two slices of bread.  Definitely not better than anything I could have made in 5 minutes at home.. . Way overpriced, slow service, unremarkable bland food.  Why do I remember liking this place?  And just out of curiosity - anybody know what their deal is with lukewarm water?
