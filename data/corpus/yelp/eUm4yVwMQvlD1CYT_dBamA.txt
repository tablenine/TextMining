Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Yes! Finally a coffee shop with great , unintrusive service and good food! I love the theme too.  This is going to be a regular hangout for me.  Great music, great sandwiches, great coffee.  The little travelers shop in back is very cute with some great finds.. . I had the egg salad sandwich and it was great.  Can also highly recommend the coffee as well.  For dessert I had a lemony cookie type thing that was just okay- had a funny taste...but then again I am not a dessert person so the judging there best be left to someone else.. . I'll definitely be back.
