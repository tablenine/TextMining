The bf and I had tried Kogi food before at Alibi room and loved it, although it had been towards the end of the night.  So when the truck decided to park itself close to work, a large group decided to try it out.  The special for the day was a banh mi hot dog.  I immediately got excited until he said that it was on a regular hot dog bun with the banh mi sauce.  What banh mi sauce?  Mayonnaise?  Needless to say, I didn't order the hot dog topped with mayo and cilantro.. . However, I did order the Kogi Dog.  I guess that I had pictures of little hot dogs dancing in my head.  The dog was on a regular bun but this hot dog was covered with their sauteed kimchi.  The dog was perfect, I may never want to eat a regular hot dog with mustard and the like again.  I didn't try the tacos or sliders this time but I remember how good they were the last time.  Besides, it gives me reason to go back!
