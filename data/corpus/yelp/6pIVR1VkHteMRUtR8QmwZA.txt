Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Very disappointed in the grilled cheese truck, unfortunately.  Maybe the buildup was too great, I dunno... I was REALLY looking forward to it!. . Hubs and I had:. . - Ham &amp; Gruyere on Pretzel Bread (special):  okay (though not much to it), except cheese was not melted.  Yes, it's a melt place.  Yes, this is a problem.. . - Tater Tots:  pretty good.  Probably the best part of the meal.. . - Mac &amp; Cheese (side): somehow both too spicy AND too bland... how on earth did they manage that?!  I'm tempted to call this an accomplishment rather than a fault.. . - Fluffernutter:  stale bread, slightly singed (hardly what I'd call "grilled"), but a tasty combo (peanut butter + marshmallow).. . - Dessert Melt:  stale bread, again not "grilled" but just singed, banana tasted kind of strange, marshmallow was not melted at all, couldn't taste the nutella.. . I started out with two stars but in the process of recapping our order in text format, felt moved to drop to one.  It's not offensive food, just absolutely not worth one's time and effort to track down the truck.. . At least you can be sure that there won't be a line, which they seem to tweet more often than the locations themselves.
