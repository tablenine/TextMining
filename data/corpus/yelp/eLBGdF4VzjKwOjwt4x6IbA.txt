I went here for breakfast a few days ago, and I was extremely impressed with the quality (and portions) of what I got.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of ham.  The biscuits and gravy came with 2 eggs, and I figured the ham would be a small sliver of the stuff, but I wound up with two enormous plates of food.. . The biscuits and gravy were very unique, as I think the gravy had sour cream or cream cheese in it to give it a light tangy taste, and the biscuits were somewhat crisp on the outside, yet flaky and soft on the inside.  I will definitely get this again.. . The side of ham came with two grilled ham steaks!  I only wanted a taste of ham alongside my eggs, but they gave me a whole meal on top of my already giant meal.  The ham was thick-cut, which I wasn't expected, but it was still delicious.  A very easy five stars!
