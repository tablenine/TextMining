Langer's again. But, wait, it's not a bad thing. If you love pastrami then you've got to try Langer's deli. It's not just the pastrami that's good here either. My son had the brisket of beef french dip sandwich, and, man that was an awesome french dip. I like the hot pastrami with cole slaw and Russian dressing with avocado. .      They are located in the MacArthur park area of Los Angeles. On the corner of 7th &amp; MacArthur to be exact. Free parking is available one block east on 7th with validation. Check it out, you'll love it...
