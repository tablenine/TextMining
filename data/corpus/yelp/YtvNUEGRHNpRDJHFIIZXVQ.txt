LOVE the Mish Mosh and fries w/ranch. Way too expensive. Also, might encounter the pleasure of seeing a "celebrity" but to my displeasure I got to feast my eyes on Atreyu BUT I do however think that I saw Jason Alexander ("George Costanza") on his way out (At least, that's what I'm telling myself) with his perfect balding head.
