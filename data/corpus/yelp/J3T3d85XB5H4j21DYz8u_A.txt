This place gets packed.  I wanted to give a poor review to try to thin the crowd, but I can't lie, it's fantastic.  I had a burger that was amazing, but I was also quite drunk, so I am going to abstain from reviewing any food.. . There is no waiter, so don't just sit at the table waiting for someone to come to you.  It's usually ~$60-$80 for my GF and I to come here for a few beers which I think is kinda pricey, but then again we're getting excellent beers and great service.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable so you don't need to pretend to be.  Tell them what you like and have them pick something out for you. Don't be a douche, trust them and drink what they give you, you will be better off for it.  If you don't love it, tell them your thoughts and drink whatever they give you next.. . Best beer selection in LA (Lucky Baldwin in Pasadena is also very good).  Also if you patronize this place often, tip well, and aren't a douchebag, you might be clued in on some very rare beers they get in that public at large is unaware of.
