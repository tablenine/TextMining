The scene and atmosphere are amazing.  To the point that I made a reservation for the following weekend upon just seeing it for the first time.. . Our dining experience wasn't as outstanding.  The best thing about this place is the people watching.  The place looks hip and awesome at night, but I would think it's far from elegant during the day (the chandeliers won't have quite the effect, and the painted black ceiling would be far less magnificent).  . . Our server did nothing but make generalized statements all night (i.e., "the ladies love this dessert;" "you'll like x, x and x dish;" "the ladies always order x entree.")  Whatever, dude.  I'll order what I want ... and it probably won't be what every single other lady you've ever served ordered to appease you.  So there. . . I'm sure I'll be back for a friend's birthday or something of the like, but it won't be on my own accord.
