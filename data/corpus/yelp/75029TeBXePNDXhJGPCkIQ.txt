Naha? More like no thank you. On a business lunch we decided to try something new and after reading all the rave reviews we decided Naha would be a great idea. However, I'm now here to rain on the Naha loving parade. . . I'm not sure if we didn't drive up in the right car or weren't dressed appropriately or weren't a big enough party (there were four of us) or if it was just the wrong time of day, on the wrong week, at the wrong second but whatever it was we surely received the cold shoulder. Our server grunted at as and if he spoke it was one syllable words. I promise you I understand English better than primate. Also our food took forever (they were practically empty) and when it did show up I was afraid the plate would break with the force that it was set down with.. . The whole experience just made me very sad. I was hoping to fall in love with Naha and have pretty Naha babies but alas that dream will never come true.
