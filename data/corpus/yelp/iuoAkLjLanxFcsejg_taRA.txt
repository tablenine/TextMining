It's a rainy afternoon in LA.  It's been a year since I came to LA and I expected sunshine and warmth.  Instead it's a dreary overcast day with the cold penetrating through my exposed legs.  Going to Little Tokyo reminded of the gloomy LA backdrop in Bladerunner.. . I go to Daikokuya and am shocked at the wait.  There were a dozen parties ahead of us for about a dozen spaces.  The wait is 45 minutes and we get a place at the "bar".  It's really more of a spot where you can watch the chefs make their creations.  Behind the counter steam from boiling hot water permeates through the air.  This brings the whole Bladerunner experience full tilt.. . The ramen is one of the best I have had and you get a huge bowl for just $9.  Ask for the special daikoku soup.  This is full of flavor and will have you licking your bowl to the last drop.  The pork meat they add tastes like the pig was just killed this morning.  20 minutes pass by in a daze as I lose myself in the soup.  By the time I look up, 1/3 of a garlic pot and 1/3 of red ginger is gone, mixed somewhere within the brown liquid nirvana that now fills my stomach.. . It was worth it.  Best to come here on a cold rainy day.  I've been here several times but this was the first time I ordered the ramen and now I see why everyone is raving about this.  With the meal done I have to get back out and expire another clone...
