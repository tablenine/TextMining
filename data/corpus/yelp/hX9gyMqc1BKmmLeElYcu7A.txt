Restaurant: Caf√© Bombay
Category: Indian
The infamous weekend buffet is a must try for fans of Indian food, and especially those who are skeptical about trying the cuisine. The array of spicy, sweet, salty, vegetarian &amp; non vegetarian, etc, is bound to please even the pickiest of eaters. With the buffet, you have the option of trying everything, which is definitely something to take advantage of at Cafe Bombay. Take a few pieces of nan and experiment with the assorted yogurt-based sauces. There's also a flavorful variety of meats, rices, potatoes, and vegetables. For only $10 you will go home feeling satisfied and pleasantly full. I've never had to wait for a table, so there's no need to rush. Take your time, try something new, and enjoy!
