Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I'm not going to lie - vegan scares me. The phrases "dairy-free" and "all-natural"? Well, while I like to pretend that I am all about healthy, eco-friendly eating . . . those phrases tend to be sort of a turn-off too, especially when it comes to dessert. But I was so very pleasantly surprised by Lula's. . . Walking into the shop is like taking a step back in time . . . you know, if they had used the term "gluten-free" in 1914. They're generous with the samples and in all honesty, even this suburban-raised palate enjoyed every bite, maybe even more so than regular ice cream. Shocking. . . I have to thank Lula's for really changing my perspective about vegan food. I'll definitely be a bit more open-minded now when it comes to those scary phrases.
