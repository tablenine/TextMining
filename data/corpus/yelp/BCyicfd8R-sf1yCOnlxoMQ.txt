Remember, tonight is about pacing.  You'll need reservations and it's going to be a bit pricey.  Some of our favorites include The La Suprema margarita, order it shaken and served straight up so all of the flavors don't get watered down.  Fresh Guacamole en Molcajete prepared table-side served with warm corn tortillas.  If you like "lasagna style" dishes try Budín de Pollo, baked soft corn tortillas filled with pulled chicken, Chihuahua cheese and mild roasted Mexican peppers, served with poblano cream sauce.  Next, the Mole Blanco with Beef, two soft corn tortillas filled with tomato-chipotle beef and topped with a sweet corn and pine nut mole.  We were very sad to see they replaced the dark mole sauce on this dish.  The waiter gave a detailed explanation, but neither of us soaked it in as we were still in shock.  They brought out a sample and it was delicious, but we still wish they bring back the original dark mole.  Dessert time.  You'll need a Café de Olla, hot coffee with Kahlua, piloncillo, orange, cinnamon and topped with whipped cream.  You'll also need a Flan de Rosa, vanilla flan served over toasted almond cake with chocolate mole sorbet.  The staff is always friendly and welcoming.  Never a bad experience.
