Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
pros: smart staff, good location, pushy patrons (read below). cons: limited in door seating. . so i went. i tried. i savored. it was as good as "they" say. . the potato balls are good but hello.... have you had a croquette? . i was expecting some special flavor... but hey it's good stuff when you can fry a potato + meat!. the sandwich with pork and ham was delish! the sweet bread, crispy and sweet ... yum!. the cheese pastry was also good but not as soft/crispy - perhaps the humidity? . . either way, i now know why the patrons will fight over the last cake in the display case. it was lethal. asian ahjumas vs hispanic donas. yeah. it almost erupted in a battle a la clash of the titans but on a shorter, darker haired style. the staff saved the day by bringing out another cake but i see why people fight for the cakes. a-freak-a-mazing!. . one more thing about staff; the ordering process is like a cougar date auction on new year's eve but they know the method and did not slip up. at. all. woot!. . so glad they're coming to downey in 2010!
