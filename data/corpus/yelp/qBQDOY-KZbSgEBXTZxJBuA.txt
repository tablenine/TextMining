Would wait 40 mins. Hello. 5 Stars? Yeah. It was a really awesome dinner. The seafood was really fresh. The entre was amazing. The wine was perfect. It was the perfect dinner. It also could have been the fact that I went with someone I really like too. haha. No, but it was really good. I am really picky when it comes down to food.. the fact that i liked everything on the table, says a lot.
