Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This place was pretty good. Well prepared dishes, dumplings, noodles were great.. . My mom's friend said the one in Taipei is waaaaaaayyy better than this location..figures. . . We had a very enjoyable dinner and ordered too much to finish. At the end the red-bean xiaolongbao was actually my favorite dish, even being a desert. . . I liked their dandanmein but I prefer No. 1 noodle houses' or Ding's in Rowland better than DTF.. . However, this place still rocks and you're in for some really good food regardless!
