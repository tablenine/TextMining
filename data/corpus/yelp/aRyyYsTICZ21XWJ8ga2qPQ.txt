Restaurant: Tom&#39;s
Category: Diners
I heart Tom's.  If only this place were open at a time when I'm awake on the weekend...  I have a soft spot for quality diners and this place is always on my mind when I wake up early enough to possibly eat there.  At times there's a line out front to get in, but people get free cookies while you wait.  In fact, most of the times I've been there, the owner gives you something free (once he gave me hot cocoa, I felt like I was 5, but in a good way).  I've mainly had the omelettes (eggs benedict also a winner) with grits (I like grits, not sure why) and I'm never disappointed.. . Great food, warm vibe, not pretentious.  Need more places like these.
