Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
On a recent visit to Chicago, my friend and I dared to sample Giordano's highly recommended 'thin crust' cheese pizza. I say dared to sample because we ordered an extra large on our first day, thinking we could easily stretch it out to last for our three day visit, but it was hard to resist its temptation every time we opened our fridge at home!!. . Great, friendly service and mouthwatering pizza. Unforgettable!
