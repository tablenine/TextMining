GOOD EATING YET.... . As a fan of pastrami sandwiches, I was eager to see how Oinkster's special pastrami (two weeks aged/smoked) measured up against what I've had at The Hat in the SGV and of course, Langer's. . . For $7.50, the basic Oinkster's pastrami was good in quality yet oddly, it wasn't as satisfying as either the Hat or Langer's. The Hat isn't as fancy a pastrami but there's something about how they pile the pastrami on there and slap it on a bun which is satisfying (albeit not very healthy). Langer's pastrami is just on another level in terms of quality - I don't like paying $10+ for it but I have to admit: it's damn good pastrami. Oinkster's was satisfying but it didn't leave me with that, "I need to come back here" feeling you want from a great meal. . . In contrast, my friend got the Pulled Pork sandwich and I have to say, especially for $6.50, that was really excellent. Pulled Pork is very easy to turn out overly dry but this was moist and oily but not in a way that was off-putting. I'd definitely go back just to try that. . . We got the belgian fries but I wasn't that impressed - they were crispy all right...but too crispy. It's like they fried all the starch out of the potato. Instead of fries, it was like eating strips of chips - all crisp, not that much to bite into if that makes any sense.. . Also, the house ketchup was notably inferior to Heinz. Way too vinegary not to mention, thin. . . Verdict: If I lived in Eagle Rock, I'd be willing to go again. However, it wasn't impressive enough (save for that pulled pork sandwich) to make me want to crosstown to go there again.
