The bartenders here always seem to be a little cranky.  I know they must get annoyed by all the drunks but it's kind of their fault.  Maybe the mojitos shouldn't be so darn good and people would drink less.. . The salsa dancing could be fun but the floor is really super small.  Still, it's a fun place to go to especially if you don't dance.  It seems to have that sort of auditorium feel to it.. . This place has the finest bathrooms of all salsa dancing venues.
