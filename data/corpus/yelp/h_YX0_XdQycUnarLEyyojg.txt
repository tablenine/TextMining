Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
As diner food goes, Fred's is among the best. Over the years, I've had everything at least once and can say that it's all pretty decent. The Hippie Sandwich and grilled ham and cheese being personal favorites. Both onion rings and fries are cut in-house and fried to perfection. . . Staff are surprisingly fast and friendly, especially considering the owner-enforced hipster look they all work (and the often obnoxious clientele they serve). It's the crowds of wannabe hipsters that are the real downer here - a typical LA affliction. For me, anyhow, the place is best before 9a, between 2 and 4p, and after 9p.
