Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
My wait to order was only 20 minutes, but that's because it's Friday at 11 a.m.  . . My excursion to Pink's started when my friend Cindylu's blog asked "What is a 'must' go&amp;see place in your city?" when she admitted to never having been to Pink's and being made fun of by her brother.  I admit, I've been here for 4 years, and I've never had a desire to go to Pink's. The lines look ridiculous!  I figured it's like Cheers in Boston. Being from there, I've never been... never had a desire.. . Anyway... We decided to go on a weekday at 11 a.m. to avoid some lines.  Most of the people in line were what Cindylu's bro called "D-bags (douche bags) and tourists."  I dunno if I saw many d-bags in line, but definitely there were mostly tourists in line.  . . Service was pretty quick, and we ordered chili cheese dogs with onions and mustard and fries.  We figured ordering a more "classic" item would help in our judgement of the place.   The dogs were SMOTHERED in chili, which was kind of bland.  The cheese was pretty much a slice of Kraft American cheese.  The bread held up very well. The dog itself was pretty good. . . I was pretty unimpressed. I woulda been even more unimpressed if the wait had been any longer. . . Overall... the hot dog vendors outside the Hollywood Bowl are much better and cheaper!
