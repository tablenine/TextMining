This place is like a hidden treasure.  They have authentic Japanese food.  The service is great.  The sushi chef is kind of quiet, but I'm pretty sure if he spoke great English...he'd be joking right along with us.  With this place not being so big, you kind of get like an intimate feeling here.  They have a few rooms in the hallway for bigger parties.  In the rooms for a larger party, the guests sit on the floor with pillows.
