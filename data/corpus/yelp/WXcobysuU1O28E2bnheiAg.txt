I do not consider myself a "Cake Person" but I do love carrot cake, and Cafe Selmarie has the BEST carrot cake. I was so excited when I found out they do wedding cakes and was even more excited when they were affordable. We had a 2-tier "decorative" cake to cut in front of guests and take pictures with and then had sheet cakes to serve. This is a great way to go if you want to save money and are not interested in a huge multi-tiered cake. Cafe Selmarie worked out the drop off time with our wedding location and was very easy to deal with.
