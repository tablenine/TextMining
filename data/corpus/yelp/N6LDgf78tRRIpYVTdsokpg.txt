The ramen is so delicious!  The broth is so flavorful...and that black pot belly pork is melt-in-you-mouth divine!. . BUT - The germaphobe in me just can't get over how dirty the restaurant is - especially the restroom.  It just makes me not really want to eat there.  . . I'm so torn:  food so good - bathroom so bad
