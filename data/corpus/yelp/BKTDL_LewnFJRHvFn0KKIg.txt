Having heard so much about this place--and noticing that it has almost 2,000 reviews!--I figured I was indeed the last person on earth, or at least LA, to try it. Very few occasions would warrant me spending more than $10 on a personal pizza but my birthday is one of them. I called at 10 am exactly 1 month before my b-day thinking whoever picked up the phone would think I was nuts for calling in so far in advance. This was not the case and I'm glad I called in! . . I had a reservation for 6, and although they usually don't seat incomplete parties the host "graciously" made an exception for me and my party of 5, soon to be 6. Servers were super helpful in answering our questions ("what is PANNA??") re: food and wine. Best pizza we tried: Fennel Sausage. The squash appetizer was awesome too, although if I were Mario Battali (ha.ha.) I would incorporate some dipping sauce(s). . . Overall notes: Wasn't hard to make a reservation, just a month in advance. Plenty of street parking available in the area. REALLY Loud, not sure I'd go with more than 2 people again. Good pizza! Not Life-Changing. No Diet Coke, but try the "Diet Cola" in the Wes Anderson bottles. Round Table Pizza is still #1 (no kidding).
