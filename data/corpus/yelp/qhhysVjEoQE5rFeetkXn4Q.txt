YYYYYUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMM .... i think my review should end here.... but i think i'll throw more in :P. . 1) Five Spice Scented Duck Confit Eggroll- Mandarin Orange Chili Sauce, Truffle Oil, Lychee Herb Salad (doesn't taste as dynamic as it sounds but still really good). . 2)Crisp Ahi Tuna "Zuke"- Sesame-Panko Crust, Mandarin Orange, Fennel, Red Onion Salad, Strawberry Chili Marmalade (that latter part....wow ... and the tuna- perfectly seared!). . 3) Black Tiger Prawn Singapore Noodles- Prawns, Jonah Crab, Chinese Sausage, Egg, Peanuts, Madras Curry (pleasant surprise- the noodles were TINY so they blended really well w/the rest of the ingredients and didn't overpower the dish). . 4) Opera's Peking Duck Service- Three Presentations ( and by 3 presentations they really mean 3 separate dishes!!! GET THIS!!!! let me just say... duck in cherry sauce .... with tons of cherries ... and i'm not talkin about no maraschinos...). . --Grand Finale--. . 5) Opera Cake- Five-Spice Scented Jaconde Layers, Callebaut Bittersweet Chocolate, Vanilla Butter Cream, Gianduja Feuillentine Layer, Brulee Bananas, &amp; Roasted Banana Five-Spice Ice Cream..... why'd we get this? b/c there's a lot of words in there.... it was ... the cake itself was pretty good, very clean flavors that go together well, we were expecting something creamier but this was more crisp.... the ice cream was ... interesting... checkmark on tasting 5-spice ice cream :P. . If you want something creamier, the Tao of Chocolate looks orgasmic ;)
