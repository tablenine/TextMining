Look, I get it.  I use to wait tables so I know how annoying it is to serve large parties.  But last night 11 of us ordered in groups, specifically stating so but were still presented with one large check.  We asked the server if he wouldn't wind splitting the check at least into 3 groups....he declined.  Between figuring out meals, drinks, gratuity, tax, AND splitting the meal of our birthday guest, it took us over 15 minutes!  The server was nice enough to give us pens and paper for the math, but seriously....split the check!  Don't be so eager to tack on the 18% gratuity for a large party.  If you take care of us, we'll take care of you.  Promise.
