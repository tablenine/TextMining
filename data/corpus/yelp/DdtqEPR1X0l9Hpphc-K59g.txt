Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
So, my last review on this Top Spice location seemed pleasant. I raved about the Ladna and... that seemed to be the only thing I raved about. This could be why: . . I dropped by yesterday and ordered some soup to go. Wow... my people really don't care for me. The attitude, no smiling and snappy responses. I guess I really never paid close attention to service. I paid and wait for my food on the wooden bench. I wait and watch people walking into the restaurant. "Hello!" (with a smile). "How many?". "This way". . . I do notice that when I dine at this location with a non-Asian friend, I'm treated fairly well. When dine with an Asian friend, service is not the best. Not horrible, but definitely not wonderful. . . As I sit and wait for my soup to go, I look around and spot all the awards. They made me laugh. Like I said before, their ladna is good, but I may have to dine at the Ansley Mall location. The owner, Jeff is real nice. I've conversed with him about culture, food and Atlanta life. I don't know him personally, but I thought it was pretty cool of him to initiate conversation. . . I definitely felt like scum yesterday. Like the kid who wasn't good enough to be treated like the other important kids. . . I probably won't be going back to this location again.
