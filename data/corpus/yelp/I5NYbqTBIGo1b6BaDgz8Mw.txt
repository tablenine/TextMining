Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
I give Buona Terra high regards for being the best Italian restaurant I have experienced in and out of Chicago.  That said, it remains a huge disappointment compared to anything I have tried in comparison to NYC.  I tried several of the dishes and found each to be slightly on the bland side.  The only dish I remotely enjoyed was the Gnocchi Verde al Quattro Formaggi, which is nothing to praise to others about.  The Cannoli was a pleasant surprise, but again it failed to amaze me.  Had I not lived in NYC maybe I would have rated Buona Terra slightly higher, but there should be no excuse.  My standards are high, and they failed to meet those standards as an Italian restaurant.
