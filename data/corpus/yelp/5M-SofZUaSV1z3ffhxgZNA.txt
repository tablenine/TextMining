WOW THIS PLACE IS CHEAP!. . just kidding.. . Yelp needs a SIX DOLLAR SIGN PRICE-CONFIGURATION.. . Okay, let's get to the chase.. . THE CUT/Wolfgang Puck does NOT serve true Kobe Beef.  . It DOES serve Japanese Wagyu, which was very good.  True Kobe Beef is from the Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.  They serve Saga Prefecture which is not the same region.  It's like trying to say I have a burgundy but then you realize it's "like a burgundy".  . . So while i don't feel "tricked", it's good to mention that the beef is NOT real Kobe.  Like walking behind an asian girl (they all look good from the back) only to find out she BEAT!. ------------------. Okay, Prices. What I mean is they're not really that Okay.. . $650 for 3, $650 for 3 $650 for 3 $650 for 3 $650 for 3 $650 for 3 .... NOT INCLUDING WINE; we brought our 05 Pahlmeyer and Pride 06 Merlot.  Purchased there, the bill would have been ~ $1000. Corkage was on the high side - $35.  . . It was our friend's birthday, so the splurge was required.  . . Besides, if you can't spoil your good friends and family, SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU. . . Apparently you cannot bring the same wines that are offered there.  Good to know...but since they did not have our vintage for the Pahlmeyer (they have the inferior 06 :p ), we were safe.. . Service was not snooty (was pleasantly surprised) because the hostess/receptionists in the afternoon are very.  . It was actually very attentive. (David was our server).. ------------------------------------. What we Eats for Dinners.. . Good: Onion rings are incredible.  Yes. amazing.. . Pork Belly: I didn't care so much for the somewhat tough consistency but the flavor profile of salty/maple was well nuanced.  A very good dish.. . Marrow Flan: Good.  Anything fatty is good. yum.  The second best thing I've put on bread.  The first is the lard from the charcuterie plate @ Angelini Osteria.. . Steaks: Well it's some of the best steak you can get.  I don't think it ranks a 12 out of the 12pt scale from Japan for their Wagyu, but it was very well cooked.  Flavor good.  . Sauces were nothing special.  Point Reyes Bleu Cheese is a little overpowering, unlike some other bleu's (though they're all strong), and I like the way Ruth's Chris does the cheese on their steak better.. . Ambiance and decor: Modern, sleek, not stuffy.  White tablecloth would ruin this place.  Good looking people everywhere.. . Alternatives: I understand it's a different style of food, but Tsuruhashi in Fountain Valley also serves Wagyu (via Yakiniku...cook yourself Japanese BBQ) at MUCH MUCH more affordable prices.  . . While I can't say it's the best meat I've ever eaten, I can say the overall experience was definitely worth trying.  . . For meats:. Yakiniku: Tsuruhashi in Fountain Valley. Affordable Wagyu, cooked asian-style in little pieces.. . Favorite Butcher in America: . http://www.lobels.com. . in New York City. Store and Mail Order. They have excellent wine pairing recipes w/ help by Robert Parker. . http://www.lobels.com/....
