Koji passed the . . LEFT ON THE FRONT SEAT OF MY CAR OVER NIGHT test!. . Even though the short rib burrito was lacking in meat, the fact that it tasted so DAMN GOOD the next morning after it sat on the front seat of my car all night, helps it maintain all 5 stars!. Damn, I love food that travels well!. Kimchee ROCKS!
