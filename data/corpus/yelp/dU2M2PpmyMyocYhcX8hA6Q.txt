Went there for dinner Saturday after the Braves loss (again!).  Surprisingly it was not busy at 8pm.. . Server was good, not too intrusive, but made sure we had what we needed. . . I left a hat and sunglasses there, called back they had them and didn't loose them between Saturday and when I picked them up on Sunday.  . . Two thumbs up!
