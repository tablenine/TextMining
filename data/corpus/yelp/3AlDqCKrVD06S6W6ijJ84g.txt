Restaurant: Manny&#39;s Coffee Shop &amp; Deli
Category: Delis
I have a love/hate relationship with Manny's.  I love the food, especially the legendary corned beef and pastrami, but even the sides like the potato pancakes.  . . I hate that I am forever ruined for eating deli sandwiches in my home town of San Francisco.  I can't stop thinking, "well that was okay, but it sure was no Manny's."
