Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
This is a great place to have a lazy brunch, catch up with long-lost friends, or just enjoy the people watching. Don't expect to be in and out of the Alcove quickly, so don't come if you're in a hurry. The Alcove is meant to be savored. . The lines moves quickly and the staff is always cheerful. Looking at the decadent cakes and pastries can do wonders for your mood. And tasting them is even better.. I try to have something different every time, and the more memorable meal involved fried chicken and sweet potato fries. The coffee is good too.. Two thumbs up.
