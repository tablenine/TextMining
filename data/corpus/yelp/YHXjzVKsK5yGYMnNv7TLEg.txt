I liked this place. Service was pretty good, food was excellent and the atmosphere inside is great. . . Be warned that you will get weekly emails from them if you sign up for their mailing list. They do send good deals and coupons all the time though. . . Would go more often but it is a bit of a hike from the South Loop. . . RrL
