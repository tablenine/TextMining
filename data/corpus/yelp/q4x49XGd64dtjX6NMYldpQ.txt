Category: Steakhouses
One of the finest romantic places to eat. Â This place is expensive but then again well worth it because the steaks are amazing. The steaks are tender and juicy, just the way it should be. The service is impecable, they treat you like royalty. All in all this place is a must for meat eaters!
