I was heading into Little Tokyo to grab some cheap sushi when the restaurant that I was planning on eating at was closed.  Across the street, I noticed this place (which I had heard about before from a friend) and my girlfriend and I decided to check it out.  It was moderately busy at lunch time, but I didn't have to wait to order.  The most challenging part is figuring out what kind of sausage you want., which there are about two dozen.  A gentleman (who I suspect is the owner) approached me and was friendly and helpful.  I got the Sante Fe Turkey sausage with carmelized onions and spicy peppers.  Got some fries with Thai Peanut sauce as well.  Truly, the food was fantastic.  For the sausage, bottled water, and small fries the price was about $14.  Not exactly the cheapest lunch, but delicious and filling.
