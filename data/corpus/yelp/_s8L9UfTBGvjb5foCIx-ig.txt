This place is authentic Mexican food! I ordered the 3 tacos w/ rice &amp; black beans. The steak taco was too dry so I'll skip that next time but the chicken mole &amp; battered shrimp hit the spot. I love how they serve the rice &amp; beans in a mayan inspired wooden bowel, although next time I will get the pento beans (much more tasty).
