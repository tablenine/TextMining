Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
The major reason why I joined this site was to read other's reviews of stores,restaurants,venues I've never been to before visiting.  I wish I had done so before going to Pure Taqueria.  Went here for lunch yesterday.  Place was pretty empty which should have been a sign considering I just left Highland Bakery which is where I should have eaten but moving on. The food was bland. Just no seasoning at all! Waiter was nice and he bought chips and salsa to the table and the salsa was really good.  I ordered the corn cakes with shredded pork and now I realize no matter how it is cooked, I really don't like shredded pork.The frijoles charros looked like beans in broth and the corn cakes were too thick for my liking. The lettuce served had onion and vinegar and the rice, blah. I asked the waiter if plantains were served and he said yes.  I ordered a side and he came back from the kitchen stating it was fried which I said was okay. He brought the plantains to the table and there were not hot and looked like they were dried, then fried. I called him over and told him these were more like plantain chips. He explained that he did not really know what plantain looked like.  I also suggested Rosa Mexicano is where to go for really good plantains.  He was really nice and took it off the check but this is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to here that did not serve fried plantain's guess it's more of a Caribbean dish. I did not drink any margaritas but I guess that would be the only reason to return to this place.
