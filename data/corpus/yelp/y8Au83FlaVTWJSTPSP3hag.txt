On this visit, I chose some other menu items to try with the goat cheese appetizer- Great braised greens, prosciutto &amp; mozzarella pizza, as well as really good semolina dumpling pasta (in brown butter with winter squash and sage)...highly recommended!  Attentive service, as always.  Not much more to say than that. . Also phenomenal:  squid appetizer, champagne truffles, olive oil/chocolate/sea salt ice cream.  Service is especially great- our server was so enthusiastic about recommendations of everything from the wine, to cheese, to every single dish we ordered.  Glutton-free menu available if you ask for it!
