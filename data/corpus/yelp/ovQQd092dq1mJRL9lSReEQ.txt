Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Really excellent food, but the staff and seating arrangements leave much to be desired.  The restaurant looks like it can double as a retail store... tall windows out front and all tile walls around you.  It gets loud and when it's cold, the wind blows in whenever the staff opens the doors to go outside.  The host frequently lies about wait times, so when they say "come on in, we have plenty of tables" you can be sure the restaurant is full, and when they say "it'll only be 10-15 minutes", you can be sure it'll be 40.  Luckily, they fill you up on yummy bread when you sit down, and the food is about the most freshest Italian I've had in Culver City.
