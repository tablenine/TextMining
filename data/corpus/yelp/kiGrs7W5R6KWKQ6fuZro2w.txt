The sushi quality is excellent.. . It just sucks that you have to wait FOREVER for a table.. . And it's CASH ONLY. . . I would visit this place several times a month if the lines weren't crazy and they took credit cards. Instead, I go there once every 3-6 months. Maybe the management will read this.
