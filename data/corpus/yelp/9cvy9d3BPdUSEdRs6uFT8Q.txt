Category: Burgers
You know what, I really like this place.  Though I have always ordered take-out from here, everything has always been consistently good.  If you are debating between going to Hackney's or across-the-street competitor "Bar Louie,", go to Hackney's.  The burgers here are also very good with a hearty amount of fries.  Three stars for decent bar food in the South Loop.
