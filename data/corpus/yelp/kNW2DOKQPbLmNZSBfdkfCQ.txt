After the Elite event at "Royal T" on Dec 5, Carrie D., Shelley W., and I went to the Oinkster for a "nightcap." By nightcap I mean that Carrie and I shared the Beet Salad, a House-cured Pastrami sandwich, and a large Belgian fry while Shelley had a Veggie burger. This was probably my 5th or 6th time to the Oinkster and I must say it was the best experience I've ever had there. The pastrami was something to write home to mom about. (I sent her an email about it. Seriously.) It really was an amazing sandwich due to the soft bread it is served on and the quality of the pastrami which was perfectly cooked. Additionally the beet salad was a new item for us and it was fabulous. The salad is basically a spring leaf mix, beets, pecans, chopped tomatoes, and some fried goat cheese. The fries were excellent as always. We were so full when we left, that we couldn't even order an Ube (or the seasonal pumpkin) shake.. . As a few people have noted, the prices are a bit high. They're not outrageous however. Their menu is online at their website, but I'll save you some time, the pastrami sand was $8, the salad $7.50, and the large fries were $3.50. If you were at Islands or another comparable chain, the prices would be similar.  Not that I'm comparing the food to Islands, just the type of food for the price.. . I do have to take issue though with people calling the place "fast food". It is a quick serve restaurant, and a high-end (i.e., high-quality) one at that. Yelpers should know the difference. Google it.. . Something else to note about the place is their Happy Hour. It is 3-6pm Mon-Fri and includes a Burger and fries combo for $3.99 or get  Chili fries for $2.00. But the best part is the $2 pints and $7 pitchers of beer! So if you're a value seeker and HH lover, like me, go during HH. . . Seriously though, go for the pastrami.
