The Earth Burger has an interesting taste.  The patty was just TOO MUCH.  I had to fork off like half the patty.  The buns are great though and the sauce on the burger was awesome.  It is annoying that they don't do any substitutions or puts things on the side for you.  Also, the fact that you have to pay for extra ketchup is ridiculous.  Also, 3 dollars for a soda is way too much.  It was an interesting experience to go eat at Umami Burger.  I don't know if I would come back.  The bun was the only good part.
