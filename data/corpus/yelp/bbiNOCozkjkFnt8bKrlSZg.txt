Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Yum.  Finally found a great Mexican restaurant in my area.  The chips and salsa were awesome, as people have already commented.  The chips have a very distinct taste and we quickly became addicted.  I ordered the chicken enchilada and shredded beef taco plate and it was perfect!  Came out fresh and piping hot, not lukewarm like it had been sitting there then quickly microwaved (*ahem el cholo*).  The beef taco was really good.  My bf had the Paco's Choice special (i think that's what it's called) with the carne asada and pork, and wow, the carne asada was really flavorful.  the pork was just eh.  . . The line really sucks though.  We were there at 4pm on a Saturday and we still had to wait 15 minutes; don' t even want to know how bad it is during peak hours.  =/
