Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
A typical Friday night for a couple who consider themselves hip from Westlake or Thousand Oaks --. . Girl: Let's go Out tonight.. Guy: Okay.  Where?. Girl: The City.. Guy: Okay.  Let's go to The Stinking Rose followed by The Grove.. . ----. . What do you get when you cross Disneyland vs. Buca Di Beppo vs. 8-Million Megatons of Garlic?  The Stinkin' Rose in Beverly Hills.  The kind of place that suburbanites go for culture.  I enjoyed the food, don't get me wrong, but this place scared me.  Had they seen me the next morning, they would've been equally as spooked.. . _C$
