i went on a saturday night, had to wait about 30 minutes, and it was TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT.. . great food, great atmosphere.  . . ordered:. 1. Gyoza.  Very delicious, homemade, non-greasy, delicate wrapper.  Smothered with green onion.   . 2. Pork Cutlet Rice Bowl.  With egg and yummy juicy rice.  Yummy yummy.  . 3. Pork Ramen Special.  Fabulous broth, not too salty, perfectly textured noodles.  . . i also liked the cabbage salad with creamy dressing.. . nice!!
