I'm so glad they're back.  TIme was I worked down the street from this place and would saunter by every day for either lunch or coffee.  I've heard so many stories about what prompted the eighteen month closure that I don't even wanna hear it any more.  Funny how the nastier stories seem to come from the local restaurant competition, huh?  Anyway, they're back and I'm chuffed to bits about it.. . Their soups were out of this world - and presumably still are - especially their fresher than freshly made gazpacho.  During chilly weather, I always avail myself of one of their hearty breakfasts - tonight it was the S.O.S. which I cannot turn away from, although I really should.  The red flannel hash and scrapple are damn' tasty as well.  They now do a mighty enticing line in 'tater appetizery things - we had the nacho style with melted cheese and jalapeños, which may have been a mistake volume-wise, looking back on it.  . . Anyway, when it warms up I'll be having anything from the artichoke sandwich to the goat cheese salad to their epically scrumptious portobello mushroom and pancetta salad (YUMMM!!!!).  Dessert was a more-chocolatey-than-I-remember caramel pecan bar. Such was the richness that my friend couldn't stomach more than a few bites so all the more for ME!  MUAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  . . I'll be regretting all this tomorrow, but if I don't eat again until Tuesday I'll be fine.  *sigh*
