Ok. The food is really good. Don't get me wrong. Went there a couple of months ago with my gf. We basically just had the buffet for 2. No drinks. Nothing else ordered (except maybe 1 soft drink. i forget). Plus tax and tip, the bill came out to $170! I knew it was expensive, but geez. There's only so much you should have to pay for a buffet of mostly meat. Also, the waiters bother you a little too much. They are supposed to come by only when you have this little coaster-looking thing turned "up" on your table indicating you want more meat, but they came by literally every 2-5 minutes whether or not we had our coaster turned up.. . Besides that though, the service was really good. Can't complain about that. Just can't reason paying that much for a buffet of just meat and salad... My 3-star rating is based food, service, value for money. Good to go once if you've never done Brazilian BBQ before. Not sure why anyone would make this a regular spot though... I mean... for about half the price, you could do the Universal Hilton Champagne Buffet...
