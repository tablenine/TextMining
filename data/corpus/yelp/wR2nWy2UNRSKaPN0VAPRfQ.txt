Wurstküche has an intriguing menu with far more sausages than you can try in one sitting, but don't worry, because as good as the experience is, you'll be back.. . We had the rabbit/veal/pork and alligator/pork sausages. As advertised, the alligator had a nice smoked flavor, although it might have been a touch on the salty side (sausage, salty? no way!). No big deal, just drink more beer. The rabbit, on the other hand, had a more subtle flavor. Not lacking in flavor, just more, I dunno, sophisticated. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it was probably the best sausage I've ever had. I could probably be happy never trying anything else on the menu and just eating the rabbit on future visits, but I have a hunch that there are other gems on this menu.. . Regardless of your sausage choice, I agree with the other reviewers here that you really have to try the belgian fries with the truffle glaze. As my buddy put it, there's no way that you could get such a nice earthy flavor from regular potato without the truffle effect. Go ahead and get your dipping sauces for the fries, but to be honest, the fries can stand on their own without any sauce.. . One last tip: we got there right around 6 pm on a Friday, and the line was about 6-8 deep. By the time we left (about an hour later), the line went out the door and well down the street. So get there early unless you really really need the extra time to do your foursquare check in.
