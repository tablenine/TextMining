line OUT the door when i got there. seems very very casual!. . i ended up ordering their garlic chicken which is something they are famous for.. but i didn't end up liking it because it was so ... limey.. and lemony.. tasting. and i don't like foods like that.. i was sort of dissapointed. WHERE WAS THE GARLIC!!... . my friend go some sort of beef thing it was really good!!. . i love the rice with black beans ..and plantains that come on the side!. .  you should probably share a dish.. couldn't finish it own my own..
