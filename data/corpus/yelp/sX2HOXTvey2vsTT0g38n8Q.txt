Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
My girlfriend and I were looking forward to a decadent burger and had heard that Father's Office was the place to go. Wow...what a disappointment.  We ordered the sweat potato fries and the Office Burger. The fries showed up and we asked for ketchup...no ketchup. Are you kidding me? No ketchup?!?!  It's a freakin' burger joint...get over yourself and allow the patrons to have ketchup on their burgers and fries.. . We ordered our burger medium and it came out rare and dripping with blood. We sent it back and they cooked a new one. We tried to eat it and could not finish it because it as like shoe leather. . . The only reason I gave it two stars is because the fries were tasty.. . How hard is it to cook a good burger?
