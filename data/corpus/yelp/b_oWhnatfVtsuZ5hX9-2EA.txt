Garlic Aioli. 'Nuff said.. This place is fabulous! It was my first time in eagle rock and certainly not my last. I can't wait to explore the area!. Back to business... After watching Guy Fieri eating here on DDD I knew i had to go. It definitely lived up to my expectations.. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork and my beau ordered the oinkster pastrami. We spilt the belgian fries and each succumbed to a beer. The eagle rock solidarity was a fantastic porter style beer and the Craftsman 5 point was great too. The lovely cashier lady let us taste our Â beer while we were ordering to make sure we liked it. Very awesome. . Okay... be prepared... these sandwiches are HUGE! They don't mess around here. The pulled pork was so sweet and flavorful and the pastrami was hands down the best i've ever had. . The thing I loved the most though was the garlic aioli that came with the fries!! OMG soooo goood! I was also impressed with their chipotle ketchup that you can pick up by the condiments. . Great service. Nice seating area. Fabulous prices for what you get. I'm definitely coming back to try the Fosselman shakes and the other awesome menu items. . . Dear Oinkster, you rule.
