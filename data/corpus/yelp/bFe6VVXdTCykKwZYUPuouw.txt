I came here a while back with my sister, her husband and my g-friend. The ONLY thing this place has going for it is the view. . . Sushi- bad. Service- the worst ever. The dude brought out are entrees, then are wine, we were almost done with are dinner and he brought out are appetizer, um.... correct me if I'm wrong, an appetizer is pre-big meal.. Price- over, way over. Are bill came to $300. I would have been better off , renting a car, driving to Big Bear, catching a trout, fileting the damn thing, driving back, cooking it in my oven while I serve Dubrov shooters to my guests and then skewering the fish on a machete. . . Bon appetite'
