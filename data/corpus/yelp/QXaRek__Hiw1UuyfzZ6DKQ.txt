Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Um, I'm glad that apple pan has a following, so they wont miss me. Every five years, I go to apple pan hoping things have changed because I do like the decor. However, im always reminded once i take a bite, why I go every 5 years. If you like a relish sandwich and hold the burger, you will be crazy for apple pan. Its cash only which can be an inconvenience, but Â I will say this, they have good desert.
