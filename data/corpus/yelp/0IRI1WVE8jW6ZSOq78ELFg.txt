Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This is one of the reasons why I don't like Japanese Ramen, thier noodles. see my review of Daikokuya.. . The service really sucks. We got here for dinner and seated ourselves outside.  It doesn't seem like they hire enough people for this place because the tables outside are uncleaned and dirty.  They lag in bringing you the menu, water, in taking your order and bringing out your food.  . . And there's nothing special about the broth or noodles. I have nothing else to say about this place except that I don't like it at all.
