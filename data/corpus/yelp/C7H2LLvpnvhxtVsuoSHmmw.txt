Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
I went here years ago and the only thing good about it was the view. Yes it looks like a Japanese castle but beyond that it didn't feel Japanese.. Now Yamato (now closed) was a real Japanese restaurant. . Yamashiro's was the 1st Japanese restaurant I have been to in all my Japanese life to charge for an extra bowl of rice. Overpriced mediocre food and the nerve to squeeze more money for rice. It's NOT like the clients are Asian and everyones asking for rice. GREAT tasting japanese food NO hype KUISHIMBO 6th street near Catalina in Los angeles. on 6th west of Vermont. NO FLASH NO VALET NO SUSHI NO VIEW ONLY EXCELLENT FOOD.
