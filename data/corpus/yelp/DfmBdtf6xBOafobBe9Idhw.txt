On balance, this place is fantastic.  It's run by Cuban immigrants who have worked...HARD...very, very hard.  Beautiful American story, really.  A feel-good place to support.. . You can get a pretty substantial sandwich (they have lots of choices) for a decent amount of money.. . Personally, my favorite is the pastrami.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.. . Their turkey is good, tuna is fair and I hear their feta is delish (I don't eat feta so I can't comment).  . . I stopped in recently to try one of their plain, butter croissants and, well, I was kinda disappointed.  Too flaky and not buttery and soft enough, truth be told.  Very average which is anomalous for them, really.. . If you like pastrami, try theirs.  You just might leave a happy camper.. . And watch out for the sodas and bottled water; they're overpriced.. . Oh, and one more thing: try their potato balls.  Just trust me.  Add a little Tapatio sauce if you like it spicy.  Your taste buds will thank you.
