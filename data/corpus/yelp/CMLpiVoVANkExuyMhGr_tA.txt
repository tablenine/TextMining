I recently enjoyed a beautiful summer night with two girlfriends.  We had an ice cold dry Rose from the list to go with our first course of Prawn Ravioli with Lobster sauce was divine, the Lyonaisse Salad was light and the bacon chunks were full of flavor.  We also split the Scallops with a short rib canneloni and a side of Mac and Cheese with bacon.  The mac was huge for a side dish and the Scallops were melt in your mouth tender.  . All in all, a great meal!
