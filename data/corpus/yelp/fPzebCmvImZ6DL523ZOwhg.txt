This is the place to eat if you love garlic on your food. I only visit this place once with my friends, but would love and go eat again. I highly recommend trying their garlic ice cream after dinner. Strongly recommend not to bring your date to this place, unless you planned not to make out after dinner. :D The quality of its food speaks for itself.
