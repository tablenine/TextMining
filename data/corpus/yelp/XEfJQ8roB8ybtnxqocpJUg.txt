I came here last Friday evening, as it's in the Boy's neighborhood.  Upon walking into the restaurant, we saw a few different tables with mussels (Cozze alla Marinara), so we ordered those for an appetizer. Mind you, I'm not a fan of seafood--or so I've always told myself. He successfully conned me into trying them--for the first time--and I was pleasantly surprised.. . For the main dishes, I ordered the Spaghetti alla Chitarra, while he had the Veal.  The spaghetti was tasty, particularly the meat.. . Overall, it was a nice place, and service was very good. The only downside was I felt like the couple next to us was practically on top of us. The tables were a bit too close for comfort.  They also have a small patio for nice summer evenings.. . Good food, good experience.
