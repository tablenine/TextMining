I think this is the first time in my straight adult male life that I've been in room with so many sausages and had such a fantastic experience.   Seriously, this place is great.  I don't eat meat and as you can imagine vegetarians and hardcore German brats rarely go hand in hand. Yet somehow at Wurstküche the impossible is possible.  They've got a plethora of options for meat or non-meat eaters and it's all exceptional.  Great beer too.  I suggest getting there by 12pm if you want to beat the lunch rush.  If not, it's totally worth the wait.  Mmm...Sausages. I'm in love.
