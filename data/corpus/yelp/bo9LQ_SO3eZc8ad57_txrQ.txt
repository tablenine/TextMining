after 5+ years of being in LA, i finally made the trek to toast expecting to wait in a line of people consisting of out of towners and la "seen or be seen" crowd.  to my surprise, the wait was non-existant as we walked up and sat down immediately.  . the food here is pretty good and portions are large.  it wasn't amazing, but definitely worth visiting if you don't have to wait in line.  one gripe would be the awkward smell of wet towel every now and then...this but a huge damper because it almost made you lose your appetite.  but aside from that, cool place to check out on a saturday afternoon.  . the chicken salad sandwich was good and not drenched in mayo.  veggie salad was tasty as well.
