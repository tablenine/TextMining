Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
This was the place to be a few years back, usually around 3 am, for my crew.  After a long night out we ended up hungry with few 24 hour choices.  That is why we chose Taco Cabana.. . Some of the reason we frequented the Cabana was that they made clear was was veg friendly and what was not.  The place is clean, but Mexican Fiesta sort of gaudy, but that's cool with me.. . I have only eaten here a few times during the daytime, and it was pretty decent.  But definitely tasted better while drunk and famished!. . Instead of going to Taco Bell, hit up Taco Cabana.  It only takes a few minutes longer but the ingredients are less sketch.  If you don't feel like getting out of your car, hit the drive-thru!. . But be warned- getting in and out of this place can be scary, being at the truly bizarre intersection of Piedmont and Cheshire Bridge.  Keep your eyes peeled when pulling out!
