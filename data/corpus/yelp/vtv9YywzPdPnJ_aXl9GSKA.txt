Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The infamous Father's Office is where it's at.  It's famous for it's Father's Office Burger, which is spectacular, but there's a lot more to enjoy.. . First and foremost, FO is a bar.  So there's a line, lots of people standing around in the place, and there's no guarantee for a table.  My best recommendation is to go for lunch or early dinner on the weekend.  The Helms location has a great big patio, which is awesome for beautiful, clear, Southern California days.. . Alcohol selection is excellent.  Beers are either microbrews or dark/flavorful imports and they have a reasonable selections of wines.  Waitstaff is very knowledgable about their booze cabinet.. . The Father's Office burger is a must.  The cheese platter is totally money and the sweet potato fries are baller.  I recommend most of the stuff on their menu, especially if it's correctly paired with the appropriate spirits.  Bring conversational friends and have a good time!
