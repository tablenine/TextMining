Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Who wouldn't want starchy, fried, meat-filled, mashed potatoes?  Eat them while they're fresh, and they won't disappoint.  Porto's also has a wonderfully crafted recipe for cheese rolls, and their desserts are a nice way to treat your palate (luckily, slices are portioned out so you don't overload your sweet tooth!). . If you're looking for a light lunch, try their Torta de Pollo, or the Ham &amp; Cheese Croissant Sandwich which are made to order, on freshly baked bread.  Plus, for only a few bucks each, they won't bust your budget!
