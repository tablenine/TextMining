Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Creative, inspired and delicious-- 'tis you, Ian.. . Ian's and I go way back, though I'm just now writing about our prolific love affair.. . You see, Ian's is who I go and see when I'm having a bad day. Conversely, I also find myself jonesin' for Ian on a day I'm smiling. Rain or shine, sleet or snow, that trek to Ian's is well worth bumping elbows with Wrigleyville's finest frat boys.. . My favorite slice is the signature mac 'n' cheese though I've also got love for BBQ chicken pineapple, spicy chicken quesadilla, and the burrito as well as the s'mores dessert slice. Yes, I'm still talking about pizza here!. . The only drawback is that these slices will run you almost $4 a pop. But, it's some of the best fat food ever!
