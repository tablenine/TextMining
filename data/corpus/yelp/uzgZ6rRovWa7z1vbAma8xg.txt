This is a good ramen place. . . We started with the fried spicy tuna appetizer. It came hot and fresh and delicious. It's spicy tuna wrapped in a shiso leaf, battered and deep fried. They serve it with a slice of lemon and salt and it was mighty tasty. Â . . I ordered the daikokuya ramen with shredded pork combo. The bowl of ramen was HUGE. I expected it to be small since it was a combo, but it was easily 9" in diameter. I can put away food, but man...I had leftovers for two meals from here. Onto the food: the pork was tender, although a bit on the greasy side for my taste. The rice was chewy and flavorful. The ramen has a good broth. I think they must use ham hock in it. There's an initial smokiness to it and I like that it's not too salty. The noodles arrived cooked perfectly - slightly chewy noodles that will soften the longer they are in your broth. The ramen also comes with a soy egg and plenty of scallion scattered in the bowl. . . I like this place. I like that it's open late on Fridays and I like that the food is solid and good.
