i've eaten here dozens of times.  it's in my hood and it's a dream come true.  i have eaten everything on the menu and have never had a bad dish.  my faves are the phat rice (kitchen sink rice) and the soba noodle soup with the blue crab broth, scallops and hominy.  to die for.  and the owners are extremely friendly.  byo-a plus-and good choice of asian beverages.  kimchee changes daily.  this is my favorite new restaurant in chicago.
