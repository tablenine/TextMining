I really wanted to love this place.  Need a veggie/vegan place that's open past 10 p.m.  My 20 year old daughter and I went there on a week night and got a table no problem.  My hummus sandwich was pretty decent.  My daughter ordered the vegan mac-n-cheese.  She's really picky so when she said it was so bad she couldn't eat it I ridiculed her...then I tasted it.  I am not picky and I will eat something that's not great....this was inedible.  The pasta was waterlogged...the sauce....I don't even know what that was.  We sent it back....something neither of us has ever done before.  We both felt really bad about doing that, and I even offered to pay for it, but the waiter was nice about it and said he's had other people not like it (hello!) so that was very cool.  So then she ordered a vegan grilled cheese with tomato.  Freakin awful!  We've had plenty of vegan restaurant food and we know it's hard to imitate cheese...but if you can't do better than this don't bother.  The juice from the tomato mixed with the sort of melted cheese and it turned into some kind of weird goo like substance.  Neither of us could eat that either.  We each took one bite and that was all we could manage.  We were too embarrassed to leave it, so we wrapped half of it in a napkin and put in in my purse.  The fries were decent...the coffee was pretty good.  We were going to have dessert, but the waiter didn't bother asking and just brought the check....so....not sure what that means.  Maybe he sucked or maybe he thought we did.  I'll try the place again.....it was cool and the open 24 hours is great....my daughter was scarred for life.
