Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I remember coming here as a kid and in high school. It was where my friends and i would split a meal and talk endlessly about high school issues (HA!). I believe the 251 or 252 drops you off right in front or something like that.. . perhaps because my mom is such a good cook or because most food is pork based(ewl), it was always a hit or miss for me. . . They have really big burritos (that's what she said!) dry or swimming in some sort of sauce Â and that is what they are famous for. . . I do have to say that i am a sucker for guac. Total sucker. And let me tell you that El Tepeyac has the best around, maybe that is why i kept going back because i would even buy some to take home.. . avocados=god's gift to mankind. . . OHHH never ever show up for lunch during the week because you'll never be seated since all the businesses flock there for lunch meetings or just to lunch.
