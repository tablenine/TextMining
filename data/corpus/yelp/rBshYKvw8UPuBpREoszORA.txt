I admit that even though I went crazy for this place when it first appeared, I can now say that it's overrated. They offer good food but I think the rarity of a dessert shop sort of tricks people into being amazed by what is essentially okay food - nothing spectacular, but certainly nothing awful. That said, I still go in occasionally for the everyday sundae or some passionfruit sorbet and I do miss the strawberry shortcake.
