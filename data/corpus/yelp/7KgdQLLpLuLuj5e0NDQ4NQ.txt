SO MUCH FUN! . . It is like a little piece of Vegas in the valley. . . Like most of the other reviewers have said, you'll love this place if:. . A) You like to drink. (My table of 8 - but really 5 drinkers - did 4 gallons of beer and 10 bottles of sake. Yes, we've got problems!). B) You like singing along to music. (Verrrry loud music; ranging from Journey to Michael Jackson to Gloria Gaynor to T-Pain to Sir Mix-a-Lot.) . C) You're perfectly fine with making a fool of yourself. (By dancing on the chairs, for example). D) You like spending too much money. (Yes, the food's overpriced, but for the level of fun you have, I say SUCK IT UP and ENJOY LIFE!). . Really the only downside to this place is the cost. Turns out to be about $40 to $60 a head, but when you're there for a birthday or celebration of some kind, it is absolutely worth every penny. Just show up with a good attitude, a healthy thirst for alcohol, and your favorite credit card! Parking is also pretty easy. Lots of street parking and the meters stop chomping for change after 6pm. . . Oh yeah - don't wear anything that can't get wet. Those properly done sake bombs can get pretty messy, and beer ends up splooging all over the place when you pound the table! Thankfully, the staff is VERY good at dispensing napkins and then quickly cleaning up the messes the drunken patrons make. . . I can't wait to go back, and I'm definitely going to ask to be on one of Alex's tables again. That mo-fo can do sake bombs like a Stealth Bomber!
