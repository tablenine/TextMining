You pay for the atmosphere not the food. . . I went here for a friend's birthday with a large crowd - we got our semi separate area. The food is expensive, the flavors are okay though I Â do like garlic- I got the shrimp alfredo noodles or something like that. It just didn't appeal to my taste buds but tasted much better as a left over with some asian chill paste. What the birthday girl got was the crab and shrimp platter that looked oh so delicious - I would recommend spending the 20+ for that item.
