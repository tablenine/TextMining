it is a very romantic restaurant over-looking los angeles on a hilltop. the setting of the restaurant is basically what you pay for cause for sure, it's not the food. it is more of a fusion japanese restaurant because the menu caters for non-japanese people. totally americanized but the food is not too great. not the tastiest sushi that i've had, just decent.... . definitely over-priced, but hey.... location, location, location.
