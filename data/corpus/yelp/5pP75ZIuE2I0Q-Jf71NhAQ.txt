Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
This just in: Barefooted babies are the cause of all the world's ills.. . Or something like that. The guy (host? owner?) who was going to seat us demanded (like actually demanded in a really not friendly way)to know if my baby, who was sitting in a stroller next to his flip flops at the time, would be putting on shoes for "dining" - before he would even seat us or give us menus: . . Him: "He's got shoes, right?", gesturing toward my sweet little boo boo like he was a wee naked hillbilly or something.. Me: "What? I mean, yeah, but what?" , meaning - What?. Him: "Well you know - health code violations - I don't want any trouble." . Me, still pretty incredulous: "Whaaat?". . Bear in mind please, that this is also a place that has pickles listed on the menu as an appetizer and serves breakfast "All Day Long!", so I wasn't expecting this level of snobby formality. (I mean, yeah, the regular South Loopy type snobbery, maybe, but not the being-shitty-to-people-with-babies-kind-of-shitty). . So I never even got past the foyer, which is a real shame because they also have a Monte Cristo on the menu - my all-time favorite and kind of hard to find sandwich of all-time all times. Â But given the asshole-y vibe of the place, I'll just have to imagine that's what the food would have tasted like, too, you know, just to console myself.. . PS - to the jerk in the glasses: I was only here to give Eleven City Diner a pity fuck anyway, because the place I really wanted to go to.  was closed, so don't flatter yourself.. . PPS - search within this restaurant's reviews for "owner" to get an idea of what a dining experience here is like- you're welcome...
