Get their Hainan chicken. The Rice is unusually very tasty and buttery. I don't know what they put in it, but supposedly they cook it with broth instead of water which makes the rice moist and flavorful. It's definitely not a good place to sit down because the restaurant is literally like the size of my room. It's that small so alot of people take it to go.
