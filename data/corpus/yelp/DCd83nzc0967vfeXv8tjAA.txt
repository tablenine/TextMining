Another great breakfast place.  The wait staff are prompt and professional, though their physical appearence is very hip and wild.  The T-shirts are hilarious. Every one of their wait staff and bus staff are friendly and polite. The food is also very good. My favorite dish is the Thai Cobb salad.  I like their breakfast dishes too.  They give large portions of everyhing and its fairly tasty.  Their red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream is to die for.  As for their hostesses, ugh!!!! that's a whole other ball game.  The japanese chick with the mohawk and acne "is not the business" .  Her attitude sucks, and the new black chick they just hired ugh would it kill the heffer to smile?  The people that eat there all seem  down to earth and real, a bit artsy but real, and if anyone ever sees the gorgeous dread that eats there alone, omg he makes going there and tolerating the hostesses priceless.
