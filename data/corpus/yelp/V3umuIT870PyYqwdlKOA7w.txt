Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Always packed, with lines out the door, Porto's lives up to everything you've heard about it.  My sister loves the cheese rolls, while I am still undecided on which pastry I like best...so much to choose from!  Their desserts are tasty and reasonable for the price.  The medianoche is perfect...succulent meat, hearty bread, and pairing it with the fried plantains always hits the spot.  We drive out here from home, which can take up to an hour's worth of driving, but when you're craving Porto's, you have to answer it.  What can be irritating is the lack of seating (even though there are lots of tables already!) and sometimes the ordering system isn't as smooth/organized as it should be, especially when it's more crowded than usual.
