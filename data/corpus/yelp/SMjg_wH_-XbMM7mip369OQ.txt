I am by nature not a sausage person, in fact, I am a vegetarian, but Wurstkuche has gotten me to come back over and over again.  They have a delicious selection of vegetarian sausages from classic Italian to grilled apple sage to Chipotle.  It makes my mouth water to think about.  The atmosphere is very cozy and it's fun for a casual date, especially because they have an amazing selection of Belgian, German, and other imported beers.  Has an artsy vibe but isn't overbearing or unwelcoming, I  took my mother there once (given, she's a cool lady) and even she loved it.  . . Can be very very busy, especially late at night.  Stays open until 1 or 2 in the morning, which makes it the perfect place to go after a concert or a night out in LA-- no one can say no to Wurstkuche.  I only wish it was easier to get to the street where it's located, there are a lot of diagonal alleys and one way streets that can make the drive a little frustrating.
