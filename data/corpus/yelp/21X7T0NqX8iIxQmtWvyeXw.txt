In the larger context of foodie experiences, Indian food is still a relatively new realm for me. That being said, I now have 6 Indian food dining experiences under my belt. My most recent experience was last night at Veerasway. . . Truth be told, I loved it. I thought the food had improved greatly - i.e. no more of those incidents where the food was so exceptionally spicy - now, the food was well spiced and heated. My fave is the bindi chaat fry (of course, like everyone else out there); it's a different take on the traditional chaat fry in so far as some pickled veggies are added for texture. I love it. Although I still have difficulty remembering names of dishes, I simply adore the tofu, pea, cheese dish - just a little goes a long way with me when served with a little rice and naan. My companion's lamb was all the hype; he looked forward to having it again after our last foray here and was not disappointed. Finally - the one thing you must try - the side of whipped potatoes with mustard seed! I kid you not - those were the smoothest, lightest, tastiest potatoes I had ever had in my life. The mustard seeds added incredible texture and interest. . . I'll agree it's a bit pricey for Indian food (when compared to prices at Gaylord, for instance), but it's thoroughly enjoyable. Can't wait to return; I hope they're featured again in Groupon so I can obtain another $35.00 cert at discount (hint, hint) :)
