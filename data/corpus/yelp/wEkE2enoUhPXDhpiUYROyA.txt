This place is great if you like creative Maki and fusion rolls, which I do:. Latin Heat, Ika Maki, Empire Roll, and Soft shell crab are my top favorites at Tank. Some of the others are only so-so.... . The music is of the bad techno variety, service can be slow, but decent. . Prices are a little high, but go on Saturday and Sunday between 1:30-6 and try some of the selected Maki rolls at HALF PRICE, that alone is worth four stars.
