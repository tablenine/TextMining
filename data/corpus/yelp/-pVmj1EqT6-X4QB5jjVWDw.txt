Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
After living here for 2 years and walking past the minimalistic Ping Pong, we finally went when family was in town.  I never wanted to go in here because it seemed very pretencious.  And in a way, maybe it was a bit, but it was a highly enjoyable experience.  Hot towels at the beginning of dinner, a nice glass of wine and then Yum!!  .99 Hot &amp; Sour soup that was so much better than any I had before!!  I had one of the vegetarian platters (eggplant, grilled tofu, etc) and wow so good!  Nice to taste tofu with flavor again!!  Someone else at the table had what I was going to order, orange chicken, and I'm glad I didn't.  The sauce is reminiscent of the chocolate orange flavoring.  ick!!  Too much for me!!  . . Our waiter was so nice and plesant and answered all questions.  Overall a very nice experience.  And a bad thing for us.  We discovered a new and afforable place to dine all the time.  This is not good for my summer figure!!
