What is this warm, tingling, ground shaking, earth shattering sensation that I'm feeling? . . Options: . . 1. Went to a party, got wasted, passed out behind murder Kroger and was robbed by a homeless person . 2. staying up all night playing World of War craft and reaching level 72 . 3. Eating at bone garden . . Option 3 duh!! . Oh Bone garden how i love thee. From the Dia de los Muertos decor, to the freshest salsa Ive ever had, followed by the best shrimp enchilada .......ahh memories. matter a fact going now for lunch! . . PEACE
