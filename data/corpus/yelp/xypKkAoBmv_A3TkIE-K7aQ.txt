This place has a fast food joint setting.  You order then find a seat in the other room; they bring the food to you but you clean up after yourself.  The food was ok.  I was most impressed with the appetizers:  octapodakia, spanakopita, kreatopita, hummus and baba ghanouj.  But my main meal of roasted lamb with green beans and rice was just ok.  Meat was tender and didn't taste gamy but I tasted better.
