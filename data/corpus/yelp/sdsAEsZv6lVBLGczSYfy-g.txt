I have been to Dunlay's twice for Sunday brunch.  I like the atmosphere, it is usually lively and the service is decent.  The first time I went there, I had a very good BLT.  The second time, I was in the mood for something light.  I was intrigued by the sesame chicken salad.  Grilled chicken, cilantro, tortilla strips...yum.  I even asked the waitress and she said it was fantastic.  Well, my salad arrived and it was literally lettuce, very sweet peanut sauce and chicken COLD CUTS...a lot of them, and not even cut up either, the whole round slices.  Seriously???  I'm generally not too picky, but for a $10 salad, I'm looking for something I can't make at home with a bag of lettuce and a package of Hormel.  So I guess if you go, stick with something you can't screw up...like the BLT.
