My experience here was slightly more enjoyable than my first time at DTF (at the neighboring location) because this time around I knew what to order.  Also, the smaller venue also meant that no customer was left unwaited.  However, I'm still not such a huge fan of the XLB that I would jump at the opportunity/make the ridiculously long drive to Arcadia just for their XLB.  I mean, it's not bad but it's not mind-blowing either.  I must not have a thing for Taiwanese style XLB or something, sorry.
