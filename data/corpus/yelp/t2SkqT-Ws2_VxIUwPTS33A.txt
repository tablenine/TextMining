Went here last night. Phenomenal - so good. I had the Aligator Andoullie sausage and the Buffalo, Pork and Beef. And fries. SO F ----ing awesome! They got  a DJ. He's great becuz the music is at a reasonable volume so you can chat with the rest of your party. Great beer and staff, and decor. I'll be a regular. Don't worry about the line - it moves quick. . The world needs more sausage - peppers and onion.. . If they added a few craps tables and some showgirls - this place would be the greatest place on earth!!
