Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
As far as a hot dog place goes, this placed rocked.  I did have to stand in line for an hour though.. . The family got a couple of different kind of hot dogs and I personally thought they all rocked.  If I lived close and the line didn't take an hour to wait in I would eat there a couple of times a week.. . If you dig hot dogs/diner food/LA must see's, you have to check them out.
