Ahh, first time here, yet I've sampled their delicious coffee elsewhere.  I have to say that Saturday was an interesting day here. I'm not sure if it was typical but there were kids having meltdowns, dogs picking fights with other dogs, etc. Much to my chagrin, this was taking place near where my spouse and I were sitting. Trying to put it all behind us, we ordered machiattos (for him) and cafe con leche w/soy milk for me.  Tasty coffee only that I had to wait forever to get it.  The delightful waitress seemed very apologetic but I have to say it wasn't entirely her fault.  It looked like they had this girl working all kinds of different tables.  Get more staff.   I don't enjoy cold coffee unless I order it that way.  We sampled the scone which was so tasty (apricot Ginger) and then my awesome PBJ+C sandwich arrived.  So well worth it. Peanut butter, banana, dark chocolate all grilled in between two slices of heavenly tasty bread.  I didn't drink the milk but the spouse enjoyed it. . He liked his eggs and mushrooms he ordered as well.. . The decor is quite nice here. I will be back despite the fact that they forgot my coffee twice.  Damn you LA Mill, why do you taste so good.  Then you had to go grill my pbj and make it fantastic.
