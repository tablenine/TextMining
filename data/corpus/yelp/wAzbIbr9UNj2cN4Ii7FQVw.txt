they do happy hour from 5pm - 10PM. It's not really the place to go to if you're a sushi snob, but the rolls are soooo cheap during happy hour. I got caterpillar roll and spicy salmon, and they both ended up being around $11 TOTAL after tax and tip.. . the portions were pretty sad. teeny tiny rolls. but i guess you get what you pay for.. . the place/atmosphere itself is really nice, which might make people think it's an upscale restaurant, but it's not.
