so...when i went to las palmeras i ate these great little pork balls, that almost melted in my mouth they were so tender. but i only got like 4 little balls for $14.00. i looked for the balls on the menu during my papi's fix and what do you know-they were on there: masitas de puerco!!! yummy, the plate was 10.95 and i knew it was going to be a filling papi's portion. . . it was packed full of balls, Kathleen may like the icky, gooey, sticky, gelatinous balls that come in bubble tea, but as Juan says "nothing says love like pork". . it was a very generous serving complete with rice/beans with guess what...bacon in 'em!!! smooshed, fried plantains, never had them! they were awesome! it think they are called tostinos. idk. OMG, they were awesome!!! the meal was awesome!!! the masitas weren't as great as las palmeras, but they were good. the portion made up what the taste lacked.
