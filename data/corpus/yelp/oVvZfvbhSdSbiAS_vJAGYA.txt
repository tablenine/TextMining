Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Best posh sandwiches in the city, and who can argue with a beer list that's twice as long as the (very long) menu?. . Cone fries are excellent with aioli and vinegar, and I like the Thai cuke slaw as a side. There's some sandwich with onions, chipotle mayonnaise, peanut butter and apples that blows my mind whose name I forget.. . Avoid the shark.
