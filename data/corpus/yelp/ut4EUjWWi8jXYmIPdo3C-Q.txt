While dining here, I was almost certain that I'd give the place a 5-star review. We got to sit on the table with a swing and eat dinner while swinging - which was one of the coolest experiences. . . The tampanade was pretty good and i loved the fact that they had non-alcoholic beverage options besides cola and iced tea - for example, faux-ito! . . The pizza was decent, but still quite cheesy even after we requested light cheese. . . Now, I went for my birthday eve dinner and had lost of Happy Birthday balloons with me that my bf had just bought me... I didn't expect them to do much, but our server and other servers kept looking at it but not a single 'Happy Birthday' -- but that's personal choice. . . Finally, come the bill - we added a couple of ingredients to our pizza, namely onions and jalapenos, but they charged us for the most expensive pizza on the menu (because we custom-made ours) plus added $2 for 2 Â extra ingredients --- uhhh, what!? That doesn't make mathematical sense to me... does it to anyone else?. . I'll still recommend it to others, because most of you might not customize your pizza, but I still don't agree with their decision there...!
