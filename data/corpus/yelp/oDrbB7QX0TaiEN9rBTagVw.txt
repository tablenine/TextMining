02.2010. . Why oh why my dear iPhone did you decide to fail me today? Dead battery = the worst thing ever for this yelper. Tear streaming down my cheek knowing I will not have any pictures to post. Guess I'll just have to come back again! That = no problem here for this yelper! . . The Griddle is on my revisit list so I am here today to eat the richest, biggest breakfast for lunch out there. . . I get the same stinkin thing every time I come here "Some Like It Hot Scramble". I always enjoy it and am always stuffed until dinner after I eat it. . . But today since my sweet tooth and I were flying solo I decided to live a little and get something different. No pancakes the size of records today so I'm left with their yummy French toast options. . . First time here RL and I ordered the Nutella stuffed French toast and it was my first nutella experience (that shocked him) and it was insanely rich and delicious. Another time I came with Jes and she ordered the Moms French Toast and it was so good I wish I didn't order my "regular" item. . . So today I went for the Peanut Bubba Crunchy French Toast. Wooooaaaaa!!! Awesome! I'm one of those weirdos who will not eat waffles without peanut butter so this heaven of peanut butter French toast was a whole new experience for me.. I just loved loved loved it. . . Service here is so so to me. Not bad in anyway just not the greatest. The place is always packed (at least the 5 times I have been here) and parking can be a nightmare. But food is always good and huge and one day I'll be brave enough to order the pancakes.
