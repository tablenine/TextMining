Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I give it 5 stars as a steakhouse - this is why you go...right?. . Well, this is the best steakhouse in L.A.  . . I've been to the Bev. Hills location and the newer Thousand Oaks spot - the TO location is super sleek - single floor (no crampiness), crazy beautiful wine cellar/dining room - with live singing (subtle I tell you!) on the weekends.  I personally think the BH location reeks of lawyer.... but you come for the steaks not the sharks.. . All the raves are correct - the Bone-In Rib Eye is the exceptional item on the menu.... but then there are sides - some will tell you Mac N' Cheese - and even the Lobster Mashed (which are heaven) - but may I suggest the Truffle Gnocchi! (don't eat more than 3 bites - you'll be takng everything else home - it is SOOO rich! - yum), and for 'tatoes, I say skip the lobster and go for the Mastro's potatoes - Mashed Potatoes with Cheese, Bacon and Sour Cream all whipped into one friggin' tasty side... (but the Lobster Mashed are still awesome).. . If you don't have a budget and haven't eaten in a week - try the seafood tower - you make it any way you want - lobster, claws, shrimp, etc - all served on a bed of ice with dry ice smoke wafting behind.... expensive? YES, but showstopping and delicious too!. . Even the bread tastes like friggin' clouds!. . Desserts are ho hum (but not terrible by any means) - but who can eat dessert after that Henry the Eighth meal?. . Service is spectacular - all the white jackets and black bow ties smother your table... Drinks are PERFECT.. . Beats all the Ruth's Chris/Flemings/Mortons Steakhouses (are they to be taken seriously?) into the ground.  There are still other great steak restaurants (Cut, Craft) but this is just that Masculine Steakhouse you've been pining for.
