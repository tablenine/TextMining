Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I am not a particular fan of David Burke's but had heard good things about his Chicago steak joint.  Came on a bustling Friday night in a party of 4, started off with a bottle of Malbec, and the James signature cocktail which was recommended by our waiter and really sweet and easy to drink.  Here's what we ordered:. - surf and turf dumplings and crab cake: both very good, probably the best course of the evening . - sides (corn, spinach, fries) all were pretty disappointing and unimpressive. - steaks: porterhouse, filet mignon, south side steak - all were well prepared but not necessarily worth the hefty price tags.  . - we also ordered a chocolate and peanut brittle dessert, which i remember as being good but forgettable.
