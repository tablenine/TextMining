Current favorite restaurant in Chicago, having beat down May Street Market. I know the term "asian-fusion" is cliche at this point, but this place does it perfect. I have been here twice - the carrot -limegrass soup is awesome!!! I forgot what I had last time, but I had the Sea Bass the first time and it was fantastic. You get what you pay for, this place is not cheap but it is a very satisfying meal. Thanks Spring. . . The decor is indeed minimalist, and I think it goes very well with the theme of the restaurant.
