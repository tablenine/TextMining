My first time in Lincoln Park.  My lovely friend who happens to be a native Chicago-an (?) took me here for a light lunch and some refreshments (it was a HOT summer day with temp over 100 dgrs!)  . . It was very cute and relaxing.  Loved the 2nd floor's vintage, old-school decor but it was full of studious college students from nearby and we couldn't disturb them with our conversation... so we headed back downstairs for some ceiling fan action and bright sunlight coming through the windows.  . . The food (I think i had a sandwich) and icecream were very good.  Nothing gourmet or too special to note here, but i guess it was just the setting that made the experience so charming.   I'd revisit.. . bourgeois pig cafe in NYC is VERY different from this one, I must note...
