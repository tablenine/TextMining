One of my favorite spots. I do miss the old poster-sized picture of the owner with Mick Jagger, but their new place does have it's charm. It's much more modern looking, which is kind of nice. They have a full vegetarian menu (as well as a regular menu) and they've got a lot of selection. That being said, I usually get the Kung Pao tofu because they make it the best since Sam's gourmet. The General Tsu's is also excellent (of course). Most of the appetizers are pretty delicious as well. Highly recommended and I love the late night hours.
