"GRIDDLE!" is the way they answer their phones at this place. It isn't the most polite way but it did give me a chuckle while getting lost in LA. This was my 1st stop in my glutenous filled day of yelply famous LA food joints.. . THIS PLACE GETS P-A-C-K-E-D so come prepared with your harry potter and twilight novels because you can probably finish one or two waiting for a table here. The pancakes are the size of a small pizza and the french toast is the best! . . Parking is an extra rowdy bi-atch here and the joint is way overcrowded. On the other hand the food speaks for itself and that's why it gets so crazy!
