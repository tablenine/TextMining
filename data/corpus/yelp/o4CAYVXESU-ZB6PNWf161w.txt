Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Questo posto è realmente buon e delizioso!!.....ok ok ok, you got me...I don't speak Italian.....BUT, I feel like I should when I eat at Casa Bianca....... Visions of Lasagna, Spaghetti, Ravioli and Spumoni dance through my mind when I think of this great "American Italian" joint.  I say "American Italian" because this place reminds me of NYC Little Italy or the Lower East Side type eating.  A place where immigrants came from far away to start a new life, restaurants were start with blood and sweat, and new recipes were founded.  Best type of food comes from trying new things out!. Being Italian, I know a thing or two about the food... my blood is made up of marinara sauce, my hair of spaghetti, tongue of pizza and eyes of meatballs......anyone want to make out?!!? Fine! Let's just say my palette has been fine tuned. haha. Anyway, the place is good!!  "Everything Pizza" is by far my favorite around town!!  Give it a try, I'm going this week!
