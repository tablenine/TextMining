Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Shin Sen Gumi is a chain store.  I've been to one other place and this Rosemead one is much better for their service.  Shin Sen Gumi is not like most Japanese ramen-ya because you get to custom make your dish by adding ingredients and telling them how you'd like your soup base.  . . This place is great for when you're in the mood to eat something warm and yummy.  The service is good and the food is consistently tasty.  However, for a ramen, it's quite expensive especially when you start adding the extra ingredients (which, in my opinion, many should come standard).  Ramen is so easy to make and is really cheap in Japan... ok, ok, so we're not in Japan, but still.  However, generally speaking, this is a pretty cheap restaurant and you'll get full and you'll be happy so can't really complain.  And even though the appetizers are expensive for the amount that you get, I have to admit that their gyozas are quite tasty so I always end up getting them anyway.
