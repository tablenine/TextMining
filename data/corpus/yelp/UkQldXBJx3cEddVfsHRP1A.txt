I FEEL healthier just walking into this place.. . There isn't a Whole Foods close to my place at home in Cleveland, so it's nice to be close to one here.  I'm more and more interested and invested in organic foods and health supplements/remedies these days, as after having kidney surgery a few years back, my body is less and less tolerant of the chemicals and preservatives found in most of today's commercial foods, not to mention what can be found in prescription drugs.. . I love the ambiance there: it's gigantic, I dig the little cafe area where you can sit and eat your selections from the hot bar or the salad bar (with WiFi!), and the staff has always been pleasant to me, and very knowledgable and helpful.  I've had terrible allergies since I've been here, and after months on prescription drugs, switched to a bee pollen supplement, a natural allergy remedy,  and a Neti Pot to keep my sinuses clear - but I would have had no clue what to do had I not gotten such great advice from the staff there.  And sinus problems are a HUGE thing for a singer, so extra thanks to them, because it works!. . The food here is super fresh and delicious, as well, so big thumbs up for that.  Even when I try new stuff I've never had before, I've loved it.  And just a package of pitas, a container of organic feta and some tasty hummus will tide me over snack and lunch wise for a week.  Yum.. . The only thing about Whole Foods that takes away the star for me is the price... it really is expensive to shop here, and I do wind up going to Kroger often when my budget won't allow for their products.  While I do like Trader Joe's and they are cheaper, I do still prefer Whole Foods for their wider selection.. . All in all, if I've got a little extra cash, I will spend it here and happily eat healthily!
