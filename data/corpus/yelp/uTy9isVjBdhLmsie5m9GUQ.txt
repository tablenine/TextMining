Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
With all  of the raving reviews and all of the people (okay, not "all", but "a few") talking about this grrrreat place aka "Papa Cristos", I went there a couple of weekends ago with a buddy of mine. . . The line was looooooong as heck, with very limited parking, and the service wasn't so hot. Soooo, what is the 5 star review for? Yes, I'm very discerning and discriminating when it comes to good food and good service.. . Oh!! The food? It was about a 4 star, but with the loooong line at the register, the lackluster "ambiance" (can you even call it that?), and the limited parking, I'd give it a 2. Maybe 3 stars on a good day. (Grateful that I did find parking right away, but those who arrived after me were asked to valet park, and/or give their key to  the parking attendant.)
