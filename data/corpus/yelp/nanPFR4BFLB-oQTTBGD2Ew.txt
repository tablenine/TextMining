My two cents: I really don't understand why this place has bad reviews. The food was incredible and the prices are what you would expect for a place this level. They may have changed the menu recently. Dunno. I was very happy with the food. Quality ingredients mean higher prices. It goes hand in hand. The owner has to make some profit.  . Note to the Chef: THANK YOU for not using cheap oil, like soy and corn oil. The quality of oil that a restaurant uses is a huge ++ for me. The quality of food was excellent.  . Ok now my review: We arrived a little late. So we called in and the hostess held our table. We had a view seat. We had a great view, but we had a loud party of drunk brides maids that sat behind us. So it wasn't the quietest night. We ordered the truffle hamachi, crab cakes, and darth vader as an appetizer. The hamachi was delicious. I loved truffles so I was one happy camper. My boyfriend went crazy over the crab cakes. We both loved them. Delicious! The Darth Vader was megh. It wasn't my favorite item. For dinner I ordered loch duart miso salmon. Boy was I happy! It was so delicious! I love how every bite tantalized my taste buds. The flavors all complement each other very well. My boyfriend ordered the grilled seafood. He was very happy with the dish. I had a bite of his quinoa and mushroom. It was Divine. We will definitely be back, and hopefully we won't have a table of loud drunks behind us. Oh! I loved the garden area. The garden room is very beautiful and peaceful. And to all you yelpers that compared this place to every other sushi house, you are wrong very wrong. If you knew the quality of ingredients average sushi restaurants used you would never step foot in a mediocre sushi house again. I am telling you oil and ingredients can really make a restaurant stand out. This place is my favorite sushi house in LA county.
