Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place seems to have a cult following, as indicated by the massive crowds lining up to get the simplest damn Mexican food I have ever seen for sale in a restaurant.  Unfortunately, you probably have to be part of the cult to really love it.    The extra ingredients are what make great Mexican great and you'll only get beans cheese and meat here.  However, the tomato salsa they give you for free is a winner as are the tortillas they use to make the burritos.  But the watery supermarket style guac is a  big loser.   In any case, there is something charming about the 1970s-esque hand pained signs, cheapo decor and cash only policy... makes me feel like I should be part of the cult after all.  Or not... go next door to Cinco de Mayo, pay an extra dollar and be happy.
