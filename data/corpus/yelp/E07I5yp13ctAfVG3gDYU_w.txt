Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My favorite meal of the day is BREAKFAST. After hearing so many people rave about Griddle Cafe, I'm glad that I FINALLY got to experience it for myself. . . Be prepared for a long wait at Griddle Cafe. On a rainy Saturday afternoon, my friends and I waited over an hour to be seated. After finally being seated, we were all overwhelmed with the extensive menu with soooo many choices. I was so overwhelmed that I ordered two breakfast entrees - the Charlie's Scramble and French Toast. They were both delicious! I also liked how their coffee is in a French press with free refills. The food was totally worth the wait! . . Oh, this restaurant is really loud, so you will either be shouting or won't be doing much talking. I guess with all the yummy food around, there's no reason to be doing much talking. =P
