I had a good experience here, despite the absurd wait for a table.. . My girlfriend and I came here with my good friend Peter and his girlfriend. We downed a few bottles of Dr. Loosen Riesling and gorged ourselves on crab and garlic noodles.. . I felt full and satisfied, and since we had a gift certificate here, we only paid 75 bucks for dinner. Can't beat that, now, can you?
