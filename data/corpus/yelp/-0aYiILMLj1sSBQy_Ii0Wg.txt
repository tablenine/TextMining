Restaurant: West Egg Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I visited West Egg Cafe last week and enjoyed my meal. The service is relaxed and attentive. My pancakes were the size of manhole covers and delicious. Coffee is good and the prices were reasonable. Everyone should visit West Egg Cafe if you are in the area.
