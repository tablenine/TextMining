Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
This review is for take-out only.. . I walked here from the Aquarium and Coke (didn't realize it was such a long walk) and was starving, so that might help explain why I liked the food so much.  I would have dined in, but the wait was like 45-60 minutes even for 2 p.m. on a Saturday, so that wasn't happening.  Opting for take-out instead, I ordered a fried chicken thigh, a waffle (I know there are multiple kinds, but I can't remember which one...think it was traditional) and a piece of raisin toast with peach butter.  Okay, I wasn't the biggest fan of the raisin toast (I thought it was a little dry, but probably some of the better raisin toast I've had), and I totally thought that peach butter was peach-flavored butter.  But, having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and the waffle.  I liked it enough to want to come back to Gladys and actually wait to dine-in.  The food, simply put, was delicious.  . . Other things:. - It's interesting to note that I went here and Pittypats within days of each other, and the racial segregation is remarkable.... - Even though the peach butter is not peach-flavored butter and more like peach jam, it is still pretty tasty!  They even sell it in the can.. - GKRW didn't seem like the most reasonably priced, but I think an actual dine-in experience will reveal more...
