Ate here recently with a client.  Never been, never heard of.  The menu consists of a good variety of food; I can't imagine someone not findind something they wouldn't like on it.  The Raspberry Turkey wrap that I had was good not great but the prices were pretty reasonable.  I imagine this place is busy on a Friday/Saturday night but wouldn't go back for lunch.
