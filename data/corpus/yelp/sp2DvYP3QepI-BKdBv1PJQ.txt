Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
This place serves the most unimaginably huge portions of really great food.  Everything we ordered was dee-licious and positively giant sized.  The sweet and slushy "Miami Vice" (half frozen strawberry margarita/half pina colada) is killer as well, though it didn't seem to have a tremendous amount of alcohol in it.  I sucked that (also ginormous) puppy down like there was no tomorrow and could have easily drank another if I wasn't being all responsible 'cause I was driving.  I saw that they've received a lot of complaints about the wait and service, but we were seated right away and the service was quick and attentive (on a Saturday night, no less).  I took off half a star because my shrimp came with the shell on and I had to peel 'em all off before I could eat.  And another half star for the previously mentioned deep-fried odor...you will take home a little bit of El Barco, because that smell will permeate everything you're wearing.
