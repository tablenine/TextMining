Not much to know about this place..large or medium shabu shabu? and what do you want to drink soda tea or coffee? oh may I have some more rice? thanks :). great food best I ever had. Always packed people figured it out get there early 1 hour before it opens wait till the owner puts out the list get yer name on it, stay within shouting distance so you dont lose your place.
