I've never had a bad meal at Opera.  In fact, I CAN say I'm a fan.  I don't mind paying a little extra for ambiance, good creative food and great service.  I have always been sat close to the kitchen and have the chef coming by our table and dropping off specially made goodies.  THANK YOU!  :)   If you're trying save some dough but want the experience go Tues (like others recommended). Enjoy!
