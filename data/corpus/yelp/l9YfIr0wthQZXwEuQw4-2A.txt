This place is AWESOME!!! Great location, right off of the Brown line Wellington stop. I live right around the corner so it's great to grab a quick dinner if I get home late from work. . . The menu is very diverse and super cheap. The desserts look amazing! I have only had the monster cookie, but I am obsessed. They are best if you get them warm. I have had the vegetarian sandwich (can't remember the name) and their goat cheese pasta. Both were wonderful! The bread really is awesome. Despite previous reviews, I thought the pasta was well worth it. . . I really don't know what people are talking about in regards to the "unfriendly" staff. They were super nice to me! Greeting me at the counter and bringing my order to me (they call out your order number but I was lost in thought and missed mine). I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
