Restaurant: Devon Seafood Grill

I wasn't sure what to expect at Devon Seafood Grill. Was it an overrated gold coast/river north restaurant, or was it a place with real substance behind its food? Maybe it was because my expectations were low, but I was sufficiently satisfied after our lunchtime meal. We entered around 11:30 and were the only party in the entire restaurant, yet the host asked us if we had reservations. I couldn't help but respond with, "No, but it looks like you've got an open table here." . . We started with fresh oysters as an appetizer, which came with a few different sauces. One was your typical red sauce, the other was something with sesame oil in it, which I thought was really unique. The oysters were really fresh, and we enjoyed them quite a bit. We also each ordered hot tea, which comes in a cute little pot, and you can choose your favorite Tazo flavor to steep. I ordered the salmon salad. The fish was good, although I wouldn't say there is anything special about this particular dish.. . Total meal with tax and tip came to around $50. For a lunch, that's on the pricey end, and it might be a bit too expensive for an everyday lunch spot, but at least the food stood on its own and we didn't feel gypped. Service was friendly and rather quick.
