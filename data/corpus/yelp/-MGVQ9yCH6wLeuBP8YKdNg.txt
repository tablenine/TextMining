All I have to say is........ YES! Do It..... . Go in get a number 13 with a nice juicy succulent fried chicken breast and a freshly made waffle....NO NO... Silly ....(laughs out loud).... . Dont just eat your Â chicken then eat your waffle...Slather the hot sauce on your piece of chicken. Then Slather the syrup on your waffle. Now very carefully put them together on your fork and open wide....MMMMMMMM..... . Now that's what its all about....I know... I know... (shaking my head). . Theres time to thank me later...All Smiles...... . Oh and don't forget your favorite sides...The Mac-N-Cheese is rapturous as well as the Greens....Just Mouthwatering. . Now I don't usually go and ruin a perfectly flawless diet for fried food but, my friend opened a shop directly across the street and .......Well.......You can only ignore your stomach for so long... . Im Tyler Anderson and I approve this YElP...
