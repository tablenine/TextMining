Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
I don't know what the big fuss is about Ciudad. The food wasn't really anything special, the couple that i was with sent the chicken back because they didn't like the flavor. The staff was willing to make things good, but my friend just was "over it" at that point. . . The drinks were just drinks, and the food was just food. I would assume that for these prices we are paying for all the expenses incurred when hiring the interior designer, the PR and Marketing Staff and the lease of the buildings location. . . I think people like the idea of Ciudad because it makes them feel special. I bet there is an elitist feeling when inviting someone to one of the "top restaurants in LA.". . I say save your money and go try Pete's Cafe in Downtown, the food, ambiance, prices and drinks are much more humble, and of this planet.
