A group of four of us went here a few Saturday nights ago.  Our reservation was at 9:45p and we were seated a bit after 10pm.. . We shared Nancy's Chopped Salad and it was huge - enough for three of us to share and then some left over. Even if that were my entree it would have been too much - the thing is huge!  The dressing was perfect, not to overwhelming and it wasn't trying to drown the poor lettuce and cabbage.. . I shared the Fennel Sausage pizza which was good - nothing great. I spent most of the dinner eyeing the "meat lovers (?!?)" pizza one of my friends ordered. It looked so good. I think I made him uncomfortable with the staring.. . For dessert, my friends all got a sorbet but I had to try the Butterscotch Budino. Pretty damn tasty.. . Overall the service was okay. The server seemed pretty disappointed when she realized we weren't going to be running up a huge bar bill. I'm not too well versed in my beers and they all seemed too fancy - but nothing looked good and no one described or recommended any wines - so we just skipped it.. . I'd go back in a heartbeat - but would want to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen!
