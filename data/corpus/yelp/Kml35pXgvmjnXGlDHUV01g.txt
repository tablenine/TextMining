Restaurant: Bob San Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Bob San is not for people who only want to eat rolls that have 17 ingredients and are smothered in eel sauce and wasabi mayo. Yes, there's a place for mega-maki but Bob San is more focused on uber fresh fish, treated with reverence and served simply--albeit it a slightly trendy setting. The pan fried scallops are a tremendous starter to share with a group--several scallops pounded flat then sauteed with lemon butter and soy--sounds boring but is so much more than the sum of its parts.. If you want the best experience cozy up to the sushi bar and leave yourself in the very capable hands of the sushi chefs--just ask them what's best that day and you'll be sure to have an oustanding experience. . Location is great for a small party or a pre-going-out gathering. Not as much scene here as Mirai down the street but portions and prices are much more reasonable as well. You can feel comfortable schlumping in here in a sweatshirt and jeans on a bad day or dressed to the nines.
