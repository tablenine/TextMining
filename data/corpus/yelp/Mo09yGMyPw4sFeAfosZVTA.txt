Eat It or Beat It?. **EAT IT!!**. . One word: CUBAN. Versailles serves up one of the best Cuban food in LA and the prices are very reasonable and the food quality... spectaculuar! If you're looking to come around prime-time... there will definitely be a wait, but definitely worth the wait!. . Versaille's Famous Garlic Chicken ($10.95):. First off, the portion is HUGE! Every table I saw get this item did not finish, so unless you're a fattie and have a big appetite, I suggest sharing this item with someone! This garlic chicken smelled soooooooooooo good and tasted just as great! The garlic was not too overpowering and the juices from the chicken was just so yummy. The chicken was very tender and juicy, no complaints! . . Rice/Black Beans (Comes as side dish):. Rice was moist and the beans were just right! Not too dry like the ones at Cafe Habana Malibu, which sucks by the way if you've tried the one in NYC, so don't go there. I am still bitter about that place. Back to the rice and beans, it was bomb!. . CONCLUSION:. If you love cuban food as much as I do, this place is great and the service was very friendly! They serve you up some bread in the beginning with olive oil smotherd on top. Garlic chicken is defintely a must-order if you're a newb. Other yummy menu items include the Ropa Vieja (pulled pork) and the Pollo con Arroz (Chicken with Rice). Â So I say, EAT IT!!!
