Went on a Saturday night and sat on the patio in mid November (only in Atlanta).  The vibe is nice, the menu ok.  Had the Andy burger which was quite good and my wife got the veggie burger which was really good.  Our waiter said the veggie burger was made from scratch and it showed.  Their shoestring fries are good as well.  Overall the menu was mainly salads, burgers and sandwiches with a few entrees.
