Wow, $$$.  . . I appreciate the freshly grounded meat but the truffle burger and fries just didn't do it for me.  If the portions are small and the burger is bank, I expect it to taste phenomenal and it was nothing beyond okay.  The bun was nice and the truffle flavor was there but the burger just didn't shine... and I noticed that my friend's truffle burger was somewhat medium rare and mine was fairly well done; although this wasn't a big deal for me since it is a burger, preparation should have been more uniform especially considering the price tag.. . Nice concept and it may appease your senses but it wasn't enough to get me coming back for seconds.
