Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I used to frequent this place a lot back when I was in college at Oxy. I like the pizza, the atmosphere, and the service. I realize the wait is insane, but trust me, the wait is insane EVERYWHERE in LA on Friday nights. That's just how it is. . . Also, if I remember correctly, make sure to bring cash. I don't think they take credit cards...which is a bit annoying.
