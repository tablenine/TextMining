Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
Ciudad has a nice setup, outside patio, it's clean, convenient if you are already in their structure, and the food and drinks here are decent.  But I've had better, and I can say the same for their service-- they are not especially attentive, regardless if they are busy or not.  Not impressive or special.
