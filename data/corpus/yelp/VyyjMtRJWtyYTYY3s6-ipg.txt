Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Walked in positively STARVING!  Which brings up the very best thing about Joy's and the not so best.  While I was glad that our server came over to get our appetizer order, it was irritating that he appeared to be in a rush to get us out.  If the place was packed I wouldn't have a problem with this, but the place is pretty big and maybe filled 1/3 of the way.  We asked about dessert, and he literally told us that we shouldn't.  We were ordering dessert to be polite as he stared at us finishing our 1/2 glasses of wine.  Really uncomfortable. . . On to the food - EXCELLENT!  Everything was flavorful, the portions generous.  I had a noodle dish (Pad Khee Mao) and my honey had the Panang Curry, with a Super Combo Appetizer to start.  All good! Love the variety of sauces served with all the nibbles, totally up my alley.  And while I wouldn't rush to eat here,  they do deliver!
