one of my first field trips to the east side... there are so many places i've wanted to try - but never had anyone to go with.... . well, my experience here was rather, er, unique - but i suppose the memories will be fondly remembered - for the silliness that it was.... . after a puff from one of those funny little *cigarettes* i retreated into my own world... . . i was in my own little bubble, just me and the plate of eggs &amp; chorizo with bean and rice... it was very good, and i was isolating each item on my fork - to taste everything individually.  i was concentrating so hard on my little task - gathering food onto my fork so carefully.... . "Wow - you are so strange when you eat". . um, yeah - i wasn't alone... i was totally called-out on my bizarre behaviour...  the food was great - what i ended up eating of it... but i just couldn't eat much... i was way too self-conscious at that point... i need to return one of these days...
