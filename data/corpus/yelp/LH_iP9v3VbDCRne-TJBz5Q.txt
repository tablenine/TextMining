Restaurant: Adobo Grill
Category: Latin American
To say that Adobo Grill is a Mexican Restuarant is underselling the experience.  It has been said time and time again on this site - Get the Guacamole!!!  When you go to Adobo be prepared to redefine your expectation of Mexican food.  The origin of this food is more from Central Mexico and is much more refined than the traditional Mexican Restuartant.  . . I have taken family to this restaurant, used them for an in restaurant party of 100 and have used them to cater events and every time the food and service has been excellent.
