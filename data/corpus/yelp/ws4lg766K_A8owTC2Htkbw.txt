Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
the food's cheap and delicious, but it's THAI ELVIS for the win!. (however the filipino bob dylan - as my friend called him - kinda freaks me out a little, esp. when he starts doing sinatra.). this is a great place to take large groups and friends from out of town. i've done both and they all love the place.
