Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Back in the 60s, places like El Tepeyac and the Original Pantry were one of a kind.. Not like today, where we have a bazillion choices. . . I guess people are spoiled (A good thing) by the quality and quantity of good restos.. . BUT, I don't really understand the poor reviews. Are my taste buds that bad? . . I forgot. 10 people;10 colors.. . Gotta go. Hollenbeck here we come : )
