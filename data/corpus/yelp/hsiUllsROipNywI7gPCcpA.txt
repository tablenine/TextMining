Category: Barbeque
This place sort of reminds me of the run-down shack in my friend's back yard that looks like it's about to fall over. Once you get inside, it's even worse.. . But the food is great. The pulled pork sandwich is everything it should be. The waitress with almost no space left for more tattoos was a plus. . . If you're a casting agent looking for "rough transient" types, grab a booth and keep an eye on the customers. . . If I'm in the neighborhood and looking for BBQ, that's the place.
