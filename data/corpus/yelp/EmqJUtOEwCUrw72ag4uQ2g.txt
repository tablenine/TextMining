Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
Moody's is that place, well for when you're feeling kinda moody.  In the moody for a burger in the summer, yes please.  In the moody for a sammy and some soup in the winter, yes please.  In the moody for speedy service...not so much.  I really like the place, the vibe and totally dig the food but when it gets busy you need to order your second round upon arrival if in fact you have the chance.  It gets crazy in the summer and the garden is a nice urban escape but they always seem just one server short which cuts into my eating and drinking pleasure.  Never had a server with a bad attitude or one who is angry and bitter, just overwhelmed.  And during the day when my car is at the nearby god for saken mechanic getting fixed and I pop in for a delicious burger, the servers kind of disappear or get caught up in the shenanigans with the regulars.  . . Great food, nice moody place to snuggle up to a fire or chill on the patio but don't come here if you're incredibly impatient or thirsty.  I am not positive but I remember asking for the wine list thinking a bottle was a better option (from prior experience) and the server looking at me like I was insane.  Maybe she was perceptive, may be not.. . Always reliable for great food though!
