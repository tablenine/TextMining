Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
Diners, for the most part, until now all felt the same to me... Leave it to the Buckhead Life Group to upscale one of them. The only other "upscale" diner I found myself in was Fog City Diner back home in San Francisco.. . Going in, I knew that I wanted to try the tomato soup as I had heard about it from a friend. I wasn't overly hungry, so I just added a simple crab cake app to it to round out my lunch... . When it all came out, the bowl of soup was a decent size... while the crabcake app was just that, a single crab cake atop a bed of dijon mustard dressing... . . The soup itself was decently flavorful. I am unsure about the white cheddar popcorn drowning in the bowl though. I think it would have been better that they leave the popcorn out, and allow the diner to place them in. They just get too soggy otherwise... Really more of a novelty than anything else. Certainly not the sexiest of garnishes as you try and pick out the popcorn from your teeth after your meal. Hah!. . As for the crabcake, it was a little on the blah side... The frying was a little harsh on it, and made the outside a little burnt. The crabmeat was decent, but the soggy breadcrumbs and overall texture left a little something lacking. The dijon didn't really add any punch, and was quite flat as well.. . At $6.50 for the soup, and a whopping $11 for the crab cake, I have to say I was a little disappointed...
