Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
I recently went to Top Spice, and enjoyed the food as well as the ambience there. We walked in, and it was very dim lit (even though it was the middle of the day), but it was still pleasant and gave off a real nice vibe.. . The service was good, as the waiter kept checking on us frequently to make sure we were okay. . . I ordered Pad Thai, which was good, but was hard to swallow (literally). That is probably my fault, as I am usually one for spicy food. So when the waiter told us that our "spice range" was from 1-10 we (both me and my friend) assumed right in the middle would be good, so we chose 5. Boy was that a mistake....that Pad Thai tasted like they poured PURE chili on it. It was incredibly hot. We ended up not finishing it, because it was just too spicy to be enjoyable. I wish the waiter had better explained that "medium" was not a number 5, but I can't even imagine how #10 tastes....that'd probably blow you through the roof!!! Â LoL!. . Anyways, overall it was a nice dining experience, the lack of a star is due to the food on this particular day.
