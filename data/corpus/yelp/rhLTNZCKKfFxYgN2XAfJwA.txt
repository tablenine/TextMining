Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This place is absolutely amazing! I was in Atlanta for Labor Day weekend and was craving sushi. I found this place on a fluke and am so glad I did. My friend and I loved Taka. I love the fact that it is fairly small and intimate, and that the owner, Taka, is right there behind the bar making the fish. . . You can tell that he is well trained and takes a lot of pride in his work. The fish was outrageously fresh. We started with the ceviche appetizer, which was great.. The scallop nigiri in particular was a standout, was was the CNN maki (spicy tuna with tuna on the outside). Our server was attentive and helpful. When I told her that I was visiting from out of town and had enjoyed the food so much, she brought us a homemade brownie for dessert, compliments of Taka himself.. . Class act all the way! I absolutely recommend this place for true sushi lovers. We passed a ton of sushi restaurants to get to this one and we made the absolute correct choice! Taka will be among my first stops the next time I am in town.
