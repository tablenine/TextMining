The food cart phenomenon has hit CA by storm and once I found out I had some business in LA to tend to, I knew that Kogi's had to be a top priority! To give you an idea of what top priority means, I basically got picked up from the airport and twittered immediately to get to the Echo Park location right on time. . . Having never experienced a Kogi truck before, there was so much angst and anticipation and uncertainty. Once the truck found its parking spot, I knew what I had to do... order $40 worth of food from the menu. I had no choice but to sample everything and I succeeded. In my to go box, I ended up with kalbi tacos, spicy pork tacos, a kalbi burrito, and a special torta sandwich made with pork, pineapple, and a cotija-like cheese. Best in show definitely goes to the Kalbi burrito with its tender, sweet/salty beefiness and crisp cabbage and accompaniments. The pork sandwich was also pretty good and posed another salty/sweet contrast that I rather enjoyed. . . Overall, Kogi brings a unique experience that no one else in the industry has. Something about the twittering, the chase, the race to the line, and finally the food is all so alluring, so I can understand why the hype exists. It was a great experience and I wouldn't mine doing it all over again when I get back to LA.
