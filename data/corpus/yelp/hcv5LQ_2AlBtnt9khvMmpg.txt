The red Sangria was alright. It seemed like it lacked alcohol. But the apples in it tasted very alcoholic. . . The outdoor seating was nice and the heaters definitely help in keeping you warm. The waitress was also very friendly. . . I would go here for a nice night of people watching and relaxation. Although it can get a little intense when it gets too packed. But it's a very nice indoor/outdoor space that gives off the feeling of being in a garden with trees.
