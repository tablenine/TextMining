Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
You will never find a better chili cheese dog anywhere else.  Period.  To all the people who complain about the line being too long...there's a reason!  BEST. CHILI. EVER.  I would wait an hour for it (although I've never had to wait more than twenty minutes...the people who wait an hour are newbies who haven't figured out the best times to go).. . Whoever said Costco hot dogs are better than Pink's is clearly high.
