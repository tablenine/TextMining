Their margaritas are probably some of the best I've ever had. Also, the garbanzo beans and potato croquettes are solid. The only downside would be the uncomfortable happy hour seating. I suppose they really only want you to stay there an hour? I'm not sure, but those stools are cramp-inducing ... not so fun. If you can get past that little detail, Ciudad is a great after work happy hour joint.
