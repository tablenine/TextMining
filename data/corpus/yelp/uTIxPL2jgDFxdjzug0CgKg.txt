W.O.W.. . All it took was one bite &amp; I knew this was probably one of the best steaks I've had in a loooooooooong time!!. . What more can I say after the nearly 300 reviews before mine, except that it's all true..  This place is the bomb!!  . . The porterhouse &amp; bone-in ribeye were perfectly seasoned and had a slight charred taste - DELICIOUS.  The sides were huge and we both enjoyed the creamed corn, mac &amp; cheese, and wasabi mashed potatoes.  We ate endlessly but still ended up taking home a huge bag of leftovers, so keep in mind that all servings are big.. . Molly, our server, was exceptional &amp; I want her bosses to know what a great job she does.  Our wine glasses were never empty, plates were cleared promptly, and our dinner experience was absolutely perfect.. . Btw, did I mention the bread??  Omigod, the bread...  Soooo good.. . And, we paid the $25 corkage &amp; brought our own wine.  The same wine was on their list for $50 more that what I paid, so my advise is to BYOW, especially if you are on a budget.. . 2 other reasons for 5+ stars:  1) complimentary chocolate birthday cake for hubby  2) follow up call the next day.  That's what I call great service.  Highly recommended!!
