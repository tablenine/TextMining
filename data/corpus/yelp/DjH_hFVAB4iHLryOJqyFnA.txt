Restaurant: Sepia
Category: American (New)
Sepia might be my new favorite restaurant.  I had the pleasure of dining here on Friday night after hearing a lot of good things about the place and I was definitely not disappointed.  First the decor - Sepia might be one of the most beautifully interesting environments I've ever dined in... from the chandeliers to the faux leather-top tables to the sepia-hued artwork on the walls, it's really a gorgeous setting.  My one recommendation would be to dim the lights just a shade or two in the main dining room, but other than that, I found the interior to be pretty flawless.  . . The food was exceptional as well.  As others have noted, the flatbread is a must-try.  We had the mushroom one and loved it... I'll definitely try the others when I go back.  For my entre, I had the lamb and it was fantastic - I'm still thinking about it in fact.  My friend had the sting ray - yes, sting ray.  I've never seen that on a menu in my life, nor had he, so we decided that one of us had to try it (it's called "skate wing" btw).  And it was actually really good... I'd compare it to halibut.. . The desserts all sounded great, but we were way too full to try anything so I'll have to save that for another time.  Prices are comparable to other Randolph-area restaurants.  Service was friendly and not snotty.  Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood!
