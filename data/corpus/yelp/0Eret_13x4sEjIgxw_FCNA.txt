Bottom Line: If your eclectic, from Cali,NY or just a laid back cool ass person you spend time here. . . Personal Feeling: "Before I came here I pretty much hated Atlanta" (i didnt see enough culture melted together, yall know what i'm talking about). . Unfortunately if your from those areas I spoke about, while you'll feel extremely happy that atlanta has at least one place similar to Venice Beach or The Village. You will end up feeling Â somewhat cheated because this area just isn't that big compared to some of our old stomping grounds. . . Never the less there are a few more scattered spots throughout the city (Castleberry, The Highlands, pieces of Decatur etc...) that kinda of help make up for ATL being so small or eclectically challenged at times.
