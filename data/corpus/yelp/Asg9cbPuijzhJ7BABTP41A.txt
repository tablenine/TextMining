Once again I found the food to be excellent at this "off the beaten path" restaurant.  Was among a party of six and all diners were very happy with their chosen entrees. The appetizers were terrific especially the crab rangoon which is the best I have eaten.  The little purses stuffed with crab in a mix of cream cheese melt in your mouth.  Our varied entrees of Champagne chicken, Szechuan beef, and seafood all resulted in rave reviews. Portions are generous accompanied by rice or noodles.   Service was slow however, and the server left us to pour our own wine.  Getting a taxi was also a huge problem later in the evening.
