Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
For our ONLY date night in southern California I got to pick the restaurant. Out of curiosity I picked Geisha House. I read the reviews on YELP but still I wanted to experience it for myself. . . I made reservations for 9pm on a Sunday night. We arrived a few minutes late and had to wait 10 minutes before we were seated. My husband bought us a couple of drinks while we waited. The waiting lounge area was really nice and comfortable. After our table was ready we were seated in the corner of the restaurant and hubby was not pleased. . . The decor was RED and nice. It had more of a club feel rather than a restaurant. They were playing 80's music and I didn't mind it. Our waiter was Jason. It was kind of busy so he wasn't very attentive in the beginning but became so after the crowd started to die down. . . Let's get down to the food... . . - Bentley Roll we liked. The texture and taste was MUCH different from all the other rolls we've had before. . - The Hollywood was OKAY. . - Call "911" Spicy Tuna. I'm a fan of spicy tuna. I order it at EVERY sushi place we eat at to see how spicy they make it. Geisha House should rename this roll. It's NOT spicy at all. . - Chicken Robata-Yaki was AWESOME. My husband and I enjoyed it VERY much. I want to try this at other sushi restaurants so I can compare. . - Miso soup with green scallion was just alright. I've had better at hole in the wall sushi spots. . - Sashimi was good. The plating was very nice and creative. My husband enjoyed it very much. . . We'll come back to try other dishes the next time we are in town. Our bartender was really cool. She was from the bay area and hooked my husband up every time he went to buy more drinks.
