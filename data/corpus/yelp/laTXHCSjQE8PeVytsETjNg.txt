Triple dip brioche French toast.  Experiment between dipping into warm syrup, cool crme fraiche and chunky peach preserves turning each bite into a work of art.  Don't mind the people in line staring at you longingly while you tenderly dip each precious morsel.  Ignore those who have just ordered and interrupt your concentration by asking what you're eating.  Smile knowingly to those waiting for their drinks as they ask which dipping order produces the most flavorful bite.  And next time don't sit so close to the counter.
