Went here on a Sat. morning around 11:00 and there's a line already.. My Hubby and I orderd the regualr XLB, crab meat XLB, Â XiaoMai XLB and spicy beef noodle. My god ! to my surpirse the juice is still there with the meat and it burned my mouth. Got to say they have the best XLB, better than dumpling king on Balboa in the city. The texture of the meat and the skin. Damn I wanna drive 6 hours down there to have some more XLB. Will be back next time to try out the sesame buns and red bean dumpling. Gotta say the service was good for a Chinese resturant.
