Can we say adventure trying to find this truck?!? But it was definitely worth it! I read about this place in the LA Times and was totally bought with the concept. Ever since I read the article I couldn't stop talking about it and had to have these tacos. My girlfriend and I were headed to L.A. and right in front of us on the freeway was the Kogi truck. It's like it was meant to be! So we decided to follow the truck. Unfortunately, we ended up loosing the truck. Thanks to Twitter (where they post their locations), I was able to find them again. Anyway, 30 mins later and a few blocks away from where we parked we found them in front of the 4100 bar. The line was long and the smell was delicious! I got 4 tacos, 2 pork and 2 beef and they were heavenly! Who knew korean bbq tacos would taste so good?!? The adventure, the walk, and the wait was definitely worth every bit of it! Get on Twitter and follow them around. You won't be disappointed!
