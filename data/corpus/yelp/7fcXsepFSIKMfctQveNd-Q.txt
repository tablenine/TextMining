Probably one of my most favorite breakfast places in Los Angeles! Everything on the menu is legit. Jason is a great waiter and I always have a great time going in there. Last time I was there, we saw Drew Barrymore chowin' down on some delish treats. it's yummy! I recommend the California Omelet for sure! mmm mm. Jason is legit too!
