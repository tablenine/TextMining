Truly one of the most delicious and delightful dinners I've had in Chicago to date.  We - a cozy party of two - began with curry white bean soup shots (compliments of the chef) and crispy pork belly (with sticky buns) for an appetizer.  The tease-size shots were beautifully creamy with just the right amount of curry notes.  And the pork belly -- oh Lord -- was absolute heaven!  Moving onto the entrees, we both really enjoyed our choices: seared scallops with braised oxtail (melt-in-your-mouth tender and juicy) and halibut with buttermilk dumplings.  Then for dessert, we shared the malt chocolate bars (a fancy interpretation of smores) which were quite excellent.  . . Just when we thought the meal was over, our friendly waiter brought us shot-size tastes of some exotic hot chocolate.  Not sure what was in it, but it was little drops of heaven!  A very nice surprising touch to end a fabulous meal.. . Spring's interior suggests Asian fusion which is exactly what their menu offers.  It's serene, warm, and appropriately romantic.  A great place for that special date or a relaxing dinner with close friends/family.
