Generally, seafood is expensive, but I'd take the same money I dropped here and get some sushi instead.. . They fresh-squeeze all the juice for their drinks at the bar.  I suppose this is a charming touch, but it's nonsense things like this that add up to an over-priced meal.  Do you really need fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice if you're just going to dump a ton of vodka into it?  Eh.... . The crab was good.  I had a bowl of chowder that was basically cheese, potato, and bacon soup.  Being from Boston, I have very large and important ideas about how chowder should seem and behave.. . My guess is you just have to grab the right special on the right night in this place.  Get the crab otherwise.  . . Service was mediocre.  The staff was all very polite (actually hard to find in hollywood), but some drink orders were forgotten.. . This place isn't a disaster or anything, but you can do alot better for the price.  Oh, and it's noisy.
