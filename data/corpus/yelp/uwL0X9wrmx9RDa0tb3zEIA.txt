Restaurant: Babs
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Babs was our best eating experience in a recent trip to Atlanta. Great, eclectic and casual atmosphere in a mostly ressidential neighborhood. . . We came on a Sunday morning for brunch and had some delicious never ending glasses of Blueberry Lemonade, an italian egg white omelette with Steak and Mozarella cheese as well some traditional scrambeled eggs, with bacon, a fruit salad and home style potatoes.. . Everything delicious and the staff was wonderful!
