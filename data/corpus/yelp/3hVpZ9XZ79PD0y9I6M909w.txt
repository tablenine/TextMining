Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
The ugly 80's is back in style (God knows why?!), but the ugly 80's has always been at Tokyo Delves...    . . :::: D-E-L-V-E-S ::::. :D:elicious? NOT, the sushi tasted stale, surprised I didn't get the runs. :E:ntertaining? Heck yes!  The folks at Tokyo Delves were born entertaining.  They eat entertianment for breakfast.. :L:ove? Lots and lots of drunken love from all over the restaurant, including a group of gentlemen who cheered my sister on for her birthday dance off.. :V:ibe? Feels like you're at a sushi night club... Nomming sushi with 50 Cent.  . :E:nergy? So much screaming and cheering that you'll gaurantee to go deaf, but good deaf.   . :S:exy? Oh hell yes, a table full of MILFs grinding up on their pimp daddy and getting frisky, it's one sexy scene for sure.. . Again, I was there for my 22nd birthday and it was so much fun I had to bring my sister here for her 21st birthday.  It's also my excuse to have drunken fun with my friends.  . . Drink fast, because once you get your food order over with and eating over with, you don't have much time to drink since there are only 2 hours in between seatings.. . Make reservations, especially on weekends.  We went on a Friday and it was a full house!  Plus, if you have reservations, you'll be able to line up at the VIP line outside this 80's sushi club.  Who doesn't want to be VIP and be ahead of the line?! ANY line?! :)   . . Ask for seating closer to the sushi bar so you can get a better view of the synchronized performance (won't spoil what it is, you gotta see it for yourself, it's damn awesome).  . . OK, I admit it again, you don't come here for food, that's for sure.  But based on fun factor, Tokyo Delves deserves a  5 FOR SURE (especially having not gone back for 3 years!).
