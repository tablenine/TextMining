Met Alice S .there for breakfast today. I have trouble making the night time events, but weekends for breakfast are much easier for me to do!! This place was hopping,even at 8 AM on a Sunday(we were warned by reading the other reviews). We ordered our food and it seemed to magically appear-poof!! It certainly didn't taste premade,but it was super fast! I had a Mexican omelet(can't remember the exact name),and it was delicious!! It had some goat cheese, avocado,onion, corn, cilantro and some other yummy stuff mixed in-delicious! The potatoes that come with are quite good as well. What really made me happy was that they serve veggie sausage!! Yeah! The coffee was very good and always full. Service was speedy and friendly. When I go back, I really need to try the stuffed French Toast-it looked heavenly!!  If you go later,be prepared to wait, especially if Alice and I are there-we talked so much, they asked us to leave so others could sit down!!Sorry for being table hogs, but sometimes, girls just like to gab!!
