I took the lady pal here for our ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY.  I had the strip steak, and it was amazing.  For an appetizer we had the artichoke and cheddar fritters (VERY good).  For dessert we split the Chocolate Bundt cake... it's to die for.. . The service at this place is excellent...and it is of course, BYOB.
