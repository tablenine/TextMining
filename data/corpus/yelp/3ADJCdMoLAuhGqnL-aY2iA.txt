I hate to have to put this place on blast because I liked it so much, but according to my friend it's already been on the Hills, so whatever. . . Was taken here for a Sunday brunch double date by my best friend Mariam before the boyfriend and I had to fly back to the Bay. . . Loved, Loved, LOVED it!!! It was so cute!! The ambiance and atmosphere was great!! The food was super yummy, great breakfast as well as lunch dishes. I highly recommend the Falafel Wrap. I was a bit hesitant when my boyfriend wanted to order it, cus I feel like Middle Eastern food needs to come from a Middle Eastern restaurant in order to be good. However, Toast's rendition of it was pretty spot on to authentic (lavash wrap and all. Pita would've been better, but i love me some lavash!).. . Mariam ordered the French Toast. Sooooo good!! I typically don't allow myself such rich things, but I did snag a bite and Yum-O!!. . All in all I'm adding Toast to my LA food hit list!! Also, if you ever need to go sunglass browsing, this is the place to do it. Granted it's LA and everyone where's shades, but this place had all different types, sizes, and colors. So stop by Toast for brunch before you hit up the mall for new shades :oP
