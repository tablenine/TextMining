Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place is for the experience, and not the food. . . The tacos here remind me of a Jack in The Box taco, on steroids. If you like the greasy shell, Â "all you taste is lettuce" filling, watered down salsa, random-ass-who's-who-in-line, no parking, and gross guacamole; then come here. . . I've seriously never had salsa, or guacamole, that tasted like it was marinated in water. What the hell is that? . . If you want a taco like this, go to Jack in The Box, shove in more lettuce, and a ton of shredded cheese. Same thing!
