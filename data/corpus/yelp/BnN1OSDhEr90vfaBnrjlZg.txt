My fellow diner and i ordered the "Royal Frush" which comes with 4 baos, bao fries, a cup of boiled peanuts and two drinks for $25.. . I tried the Haus Bao (skirt steak) and the Chairman Bao (pork belly).  The Haus Bao was well seasoned, moist, and filling.  They definitely didn't stint on the meat and it was the perfect amount to get a good balance of meat to bun with each bite.  The pork belly nearly knocked me off of my chair.  It was so good i had to stare at it after taking each bite because i couldn't believe how tasty it was....it melted in my mouth.  The layer of fat on the pork belly was AMAZING!  I would say it's comparable to the Momofuku Milk Bar pork bun...better in my eyes because of the price.  Baohaus is definitely more economical and maintains the quality.. . what put this eatery over the top for me was the friendly staff.  For a relaxed-quick service seeming environment, the staff was very attentive and took the extra step to talk to us about our meal and inform us about future events.  They were not at all pushy, but all very friendly.  It's almost like hanging out in your friend's kitchen....but with extremely delicious food.. . Also, the bao fries with sweet sesame sauce are a must try!  If you've had fried bananas (thai style)...this reminds me of it.  In any case....the hint of sweetness offers a good contrast to the meat in the bao.  It can be eaten alone as a dessert or together with the Bao.  Either way...give it a try at least once.  It's almost like a light churros or funnel cake...asian style.
