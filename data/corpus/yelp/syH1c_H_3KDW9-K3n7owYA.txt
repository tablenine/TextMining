Went to Fritti to attend a benefit in honor of  Ramse Hunt Wilson (age 37 days) who recently died of SIDS.  Ramse's dad James is a long-time manager at Fritti so Fritti, Sotto Sotto and Beleza pledged all of their Oct 3 proceeds to establish a memorial/SIDS research fund for little Ramse.  Nice gesture, great restaurant.. . My thoughts on the meal:    . . Sauvignon Blanc  - yum!. Insalta Mista we split - yum!. Pancetta e Cipolla-  fancy bacon on pizza?  OMFG YUM!. my date's Marinara - yum!. the chocolate soup we split  -  Wish I were at home eating this alone so I could have it all to myself and lick the bowl clean!
