Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This is the best fried Chicken I have ever tasted, and the waffles literally melt in your mouth like cotton candy. The staff are always happy to see you and accomodate. Its a little pricey but you definately get what you pay for, and its well worth the experiance at least once, but I promise youll go back..
