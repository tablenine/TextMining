After my visit, I feel like Bocado pretty much screams out everything that I DON'T look for when I go out to eat... I'm even little hesitant to give 3 stars, but I think the burger was decent for 5 bucks.  oh wait.. it's 11 bucks without sides.  . . Expensive overpriced food, awkward wait-staff, yuppie to the maximum, OK food... I just don't find myself going back to this place again.. . I'll agree that burger was delicious, just not $11 delicious.  It's made with two patties, two slices of cheese, with homemade pickles on sesame buns.  The meat was nice and juicy, but I found myself trying to figure out why they would charge so much for this burger.  I'm usually not tied to $$$ of the food, but this one really made me question the concept behind it.  The homemade pickle added a good flavor to the burger, but I felt like it was just a sweet slices of pickle.  . . I had the seasoned fries and a hefeweizen which waiter really didn't know anything about.  Finished the food with chocolate/banana pudding recommended by my friend.  It was nice and thick, separated in a vintage mug with banana.  In the end, our check came out to be 65 bucks...  and it was two of us.  Granted that we had a full course meal, but we still had burgers and fries!. . I agree with other yelpers about the awkward waiting staff, but I was greeted with a smile and taken care of immediately by the hostress.  There was no wait (6PM on weekdays) and I had no problems there. . . The interior was nice and clean, just another modern restaurant.  I think it plays a huge factor in your price!  . . Overall, it was just an OK experience for me.   I think there are better places in Atlanta.
