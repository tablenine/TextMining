Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Hide is another Sawtelle institution besides Safe &amp; Save Market and these guys literally made sushi famous and known throughout West LA.  They used to be where GR/Eats is now - a VERY small place, almost 1/4 the size of its current location in a time where sushi was an "experimental food" in the US.  The owner and wife is straight up Japanese and so are many of their staff members so get ready for a no bullshit attitude with you.  They get so busy sometimes and I see them rubbing some customers the wrong way all the time since they are in such a rush to get people in and out.  Don't take it personal, it's just business.  Oh yeah and try their tempura and "kai-yaki"  It's the best thing you'll ever eat.  Peace.
