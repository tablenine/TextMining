Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
the long wait escalates your expectations, which makes the experience of actually trying the hot dogs all the more disappointing. . . if they were bbq'd on a grill they'd add a good kick of flavor; the hot dogs themselves aren't anything special. i once had the veggie dog here and it was pretty awful---lukewarm and rubbery (but then again, it's not real meat so what can you expect?) but their other hot dogs weren't great. i mean, ok hot dogs but so not worth the wait! the only reason you should go here is for the experience of going to such an established Hollywood spot. side note----the fries were surprisingly good. . . overall you can get tastier, juicier, fresher-feeling hot dogs by bbqing them yourselves. or better yet, get yourself a bacon wrapped hot dog grilled with onions and peppers off a mexican cart (common after normal club hours), which you'll find all around Hollywood. now THOSE are some tasty hot dogs
