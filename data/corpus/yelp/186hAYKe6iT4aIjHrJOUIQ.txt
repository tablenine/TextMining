If your looking for an authentic bowl of Pho, this is not the place to go to. I went to this place because I do not eat beef and they offer tofu and chicken broth pho. Its a decent spot if your into the "hipster" LA type of places were folks wear interesting clothes, over sized glasses and as my mom says, "grungy" but you know they got money (LOL) I digress, back to the food.. . I had the chicken pho, its decent, my husband had the beef pho, he said, "its aight" and my friend had a rice bowl..also just ok. The drinks are good. . . However, it gets very crowded and I didn't appreciate the fact that the manager went over to two tables that were finished with their meals and were just chillin if they could possibly start to leave because people were waiting thought that was not cool. . . Not a very diverse crowd..so the way i see it is go to Gingergrass if you want decent pho that is geared more towards bland taste buds. Don't get me wrong i like it because its healthy but its not all that!
