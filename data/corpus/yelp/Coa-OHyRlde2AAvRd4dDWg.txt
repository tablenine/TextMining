Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
My friend dragged me down there, twice.  I just knew because the line was 30 minutes long, I was about to indulge in the greatest hot dog ever to grace the earth's surface.  NOT!!  . . After a long wait in line, we went to the back outside patio and ate the dog.  He ate it like a starving.... something that starves.  It was very regular.  It does have a 'snap' when you bite into the dog, but that's about all it has.  . . OOOOOOVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEERRRRRR RRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEDDDDDDD!. . But I do think you should try it at least once, just for the experience of saying that you've gone to world-famous Pinks. But don't say you haven't been warned.. . P.S. . If you want a great hotdog, go to Fab's Hot Dogs in Reseda.
