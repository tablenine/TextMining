God how I love this place. Words cannot express how EXCELLENT AND DELICIOUS the food is here! But seriously, if you want to have a mind blowing experience I highly suggest you make your way to Porto's now!. The only thing that I have to warn you about is the crowd. The average time it takes to order and get out takes me around 15-20 minutes on the weekend.....but it's worth it!. . Go there now!
