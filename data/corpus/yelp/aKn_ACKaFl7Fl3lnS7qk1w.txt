Maybe when I went here, I was a bit naive, and I was fresh from upstate as a frosh at NYU. But I didn't like the food here. I had a basic noodle dish, and wasn't impressed with the lack of richness in the noodles as well as the undercooked vegetables. And needless to say, the stomach wasn't feeling too hot afterward.. . The restaurant is separate from the small bar, which has I think Bass on top, or Stella, and that's it. It's popular because of the inexpensive prices and the quick sit down with the friends. It's a good block to people watch though, so get a table by the windows.
