Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
I've been a long time lurker on Yelp.  I had to start an account to comment.   As I was reading the reviews on Cho Sun Ok I can't help but feel sorry for the non Koreans that have had "rude" service or stuff they didnt like here.  . . I have been going to this place for over 15 years now.  Been going since I was 10.  You do the math.  Anyways.... . Here are some things that I have to say to non Koreans that dont understand this place or any Korean restaurant.. . 1. No one is intentionally trying to be rude to you.  Korean waitresses are known for being rude to non koreans because non koreans have the habit of lingering after their meal and they expect to be babied throughout the process when you know damn well the restaurant is packed full of people. . . 2. In all my years of going to this place I have never gotten anything except the chadol (thin slices of beef).  Dont get the bibimbap here they arent known for that.  Each restaurant is known for a certain thing.  If you want good Kalbi goto SSGS etc.  . . 3. The owner used to be a beast when it came to foreigners.   I've seen him kick people out.  This is going back to #1 on my list.  Dont piss the guy off I want him to live and hopefully in 10 years I will be able to take my kid there.  . . 4.  If its your first time there I highly suggest taking a Korean who is fluent in Korean and knows their cuisine.  Do not take an Americanized Korean they will be of no help to you.  I've personally witnessed this on several occasions.  . . i dont know if yelp has a mail function but you can email me questions if you like.  . . I may be a bit blunt but this is coming straight from the horses mouth.
