Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Simple menu, fresh tacos....  is this my favorite taco that I've tasted.... hmm.. not quite sure but it's definitely better than many, many other places.   Had 2 of the fish and 1 of the shrimp and the hochata.   Fish and shrimp was excellent.  Hochata wasn't that great.   Tasted very grainy and wasn't that sweet and cinnamon at all.  Love the salsa bar.    I would say that the pineapple was the hottest followed by mango.      Guac salsa wasn't that good.  It would of been better if they just had fresh chips with the tacos. That would move it up a notch.
