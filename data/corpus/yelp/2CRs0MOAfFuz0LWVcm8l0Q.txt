This is definately not the place to go. The ambiance was noisy and without atmosphere. More importantly the food was a disappointment. I ordered the pork chop. It was very thin and very dry. We shared an appetizer of cod and it was mostly mashed potato. To add insult to injury- we brought a bottle of wine with us and bought one bottle plus a couple of glasses from them and they still charged us a $35 corkage fee! Â We asked the maitre d' about this and he said nothing he could or woUld do - it was policy! Bad business, bad food.
