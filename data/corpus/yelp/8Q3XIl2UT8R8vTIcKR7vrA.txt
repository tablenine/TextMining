Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
Not to be confused with trader Joe's the grocery Store, Trader Vic's is a throw back to the infamous Tiki bars of yesturday.  A chain by definition, but really quite an original.  The Atlanta location is in the basement of the Hilton downtown.  They host some crazy theme parties and bands that attract many GA State students and hipsters.  The drinks are old school strong and will put hair on your chest.  The food is wacky Polynesian/Chinese fusion leaning way towards circa 1955.  This place is fun, fun, fun.
