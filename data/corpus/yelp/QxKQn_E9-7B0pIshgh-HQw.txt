There are so many things that I love about this place, especially the neon orange processed cheddar cheese sauce that puts all other processed cheese sauces to shame.. . I also love the total hooligan atomsphere of the staff behind the counter.  If you're not prepared for this it can seem sketchy.  If you're prepared for but don't appreciate then it can seem rude.  But if you're prepared for it and appreciate it then it's all just part of the experience.. . Case in point: One time I went there and my total bill was under $10.  Of course it was, because how much can a hot dog, cheese fries and grape soda actually cost?  Anyway the punk-ass mofo working the register was yakking away on his cell phone.  I believe that the whole conversation consisted of  "F'real?  No shit." repeated over and over for at least 10 minutes.  I forked over $20 and he only gave me $1 back.  So I politely pointed out that I had given him $20, and he responded by...giving me back another whole dollar.  When I politely told him exactly how much change I was due he rolled his eyes and threw it on the counter.. . I love it.. . My only mistake was being polite.  If I was all like "Yo bee-yatch!  You owe me $12.67 and shit!  Now give me muthafuckin' money before I bust a cap in yo' ass!" then I'm sure that the whole exchange would have been that much more efficient and rewarding.
