Not bad.....we had the mint chocolate chip milk shake, one scoop of chocolate ice cream and a chocolate chip cookie for the drive home.  The chocolate ice cream was smooth and creamy and very rich.  The chocolate was a bit much for me.  I love chocolate but this tasted more like bitter or semi-sweet chocolate compared to milk chocolate which I prefer better, it was still very good but a bit too chocolaty for me.  I tried my husband's milk shake and I think I may have preferred his milk shake over my scoop of ice cream.  It was a really nice flavored mint ice cream with tiny little chunks of chocolate.  It comes in a tall glass and I think it is really made for two people.  Chocolate chip cookie was very tasty.  I would recommend this ice cream shop based on the quality although I would try a different flavor next time.
