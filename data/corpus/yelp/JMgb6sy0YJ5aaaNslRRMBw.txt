I have been back to H&amp;F many times since.  I still don't like the logistics and seating arrangements at H&amp;F, but I had a chance to eat their 10PM burger as a whole by myself.  It was good burger even though it was on the greasy side, but that is what you get when you have two burger patties with two slices of cheese cooked in duck fat.  The sweetbread is awesome though and it is a good place to eat when you can find a seat.
