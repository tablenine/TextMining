4.5 stars. . This place is super TINY!! Arrived about 30 minutes before closing, and only one open table.  I would hate to be here during rush hour. . . Had the famed truffle burger..  Was worried it might come overcooked when the server didn't ask how I wanted it cooked.  I was happy when it arrived medium-rareish pink, and juicy. It was damn good.. but not as good as Father's Office.  Still, better than 25 degrees, and bouches bistro, and others. I'd give it a solid 4.5 stars.   The bun was very soft, and good.  The meat was high quality, and the cheese and sauce gave it good flavor.   One of the best burgers I can remember other than FO. It is something you might crave..!!. . The fries were thick, and were slightly above average. 3.5 stars here.. . The cokes are Mexican style, just like Father's Office. 5 stars!. . Mandatory Valet.  $2 charge, and street parking is pretty hard to find.
