Oh my G-d this place is amazing.  I lived in NY and I've had 2nd Ave Deli and Katz's, and this place blows them both out of the water.  The pastrami is like candy.  That's all there is to it.  Whether you go with the Reuben or the French Dip or the # whatever, you are in for the best pastrami sandwich you have ever eaten.  Located in an area that most Jews would never dream of going, this place is packed every day, for damn good reason.  This is now the first place out of my mouth when people ask where they should eat in LA.
