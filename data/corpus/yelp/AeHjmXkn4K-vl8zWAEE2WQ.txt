Some good. Some bad. . . The good - The variety of tacos. Bring a friend and get the 8-piece taco plate so you can experiment and try several different kinds. The margaritas are tastey as well, with the peach one reigning as my favorite. . . The bad - Our server did not check up on our party regularly so we found ourselves straining our neck, looking for her a few times. Tables are small and right next to each other, so while the lighting is intimate, the space is not. Don't plan on having a private conversation here unless you're okay with strangers listening in; however, weekend nights are usually crowded and the noise will drown it out. . . Go there for the food, but don't carry any high expectations.
