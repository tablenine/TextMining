Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
After a long LA day trip my friends and I decided to end the day at Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles. . My first impression I thought I was going to a nightclub, there was a big black security guard at the entrance and you have to leave your name at the door. Second was I gonna get shot. lol. But man was it delicious. The seasoning on the chicken was delicious and it didn't feel oily.. Waffles were awesome too! but 2 waffles was abit too much. I was a little nervous to try something new but it all came out great, only down side would be the Mac &amp; Cheese, I didn't think it was good at all esp. $4.50 for 1 scoop. Next time I'll do without it.
