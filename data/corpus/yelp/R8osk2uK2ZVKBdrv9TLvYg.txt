Once upon a time my dad used to bring home apple turnovers and pastrami sandwiches and I was a beautifully fat kid. One day I got old enough to drive and this because a default date place and scored major points because it wasn't Life Plaza (who knows what I mean?). But I have a confession, I never brought a girl here for her. It was all for me...always for me. Everything, and I mean everything is amazing. All the desserts, all the cakes, from mocha to mango it's all so. Damn. Delicious. . . My two favorite sandwiches are : . Papa Preparada sandwich is crazy mashed potato, ground beef onion ball-mixture-thing smothered all over cuban bread. Kind of like a meaty mashed potato sandwich. . Pan Con Lechon has sloooow roasted pork. Lovingly roasted pork. Sexily roasted pork. I love the words "roasted pork." This sandwich is the Brazilian supermodel of the line up. . . The potato balls come as sides too, along with pies and all sorts of flaky, crusty, butter, meaty choices. The biggest problem here (besides the crazy lines) will be making a choice between all the great items. . . AND THE PLANTAIN CHIPS. They come as sides and in boxes with a garlic oil dipping sauce. Imagine a banana flattened and fried except it tastes like crunchy, slightly sweet tortilla chips.. . I always feel like eating at Porto's is being in one of those Kodak moment pictures with smiling families moving in slow motion to uplifting music because everyone is so happy here! Except you get to stuff your face with mashed potato meat balls which makes it that much better.
