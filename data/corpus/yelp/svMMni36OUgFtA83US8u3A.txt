Restaurant: Souper Jenny
Category: Caterers
This place is a nice Atlanta original. The food is fresh and pretty tasty, its not 'wow' but it is pretty good for lunch. The atmosphere is nice, the staff friendly. Break up those usual lunch 'soup and sandwich' haunts for a more enjoyable soup and sandwich, soup and salad or soup and soup combo at Jenny's.
