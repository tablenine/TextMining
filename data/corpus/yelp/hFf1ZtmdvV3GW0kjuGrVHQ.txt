After the Yelp event, we hopped over here to grab some dinner and drinks. The waiter didn't seem with it, similar to our first, and the food was blah. The few dessert items remaining at 9 were good, and the cheese tortellini was heated up frozen pasta from a Costco type place, or so it seemed. . . Have had much better, can now take this place of my list.
