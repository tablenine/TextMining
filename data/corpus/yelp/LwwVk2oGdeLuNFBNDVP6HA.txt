The sashimi special is ridiculously good in quantity and quality of sashimi.  The atmosphere is kinda crazy and claustrophobic with the noise and crowdedness.  I think the owners are anti-kid because it's one of the least kid-friendly restaurants I've ever been to.  The food is top-notch, if you can handle the ambiance.
