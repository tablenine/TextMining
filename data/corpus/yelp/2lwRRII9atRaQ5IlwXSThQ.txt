I LOVE this place, and I swear it's not just because I'm a Korean writing about a Korean restaurant.  There are, unfortunately, some not so great Korean joints -- and maybe then there's a bit of nationalistic pride that keeps me from bashing those on Yelp -- but I definitely want to sing praises when they're due.   Here goes.. . I've been to this place at least half a dozen times now, and the food and service are always great.  I can barely speak Korean myself so non-Korean speakers, you'll be a.o.k.  It almost seems like the wait staff appreciate the word getting out and having some "diverse" clientele in the mix, which is always appreciated.  Also the decor is downright upscale with nice deep booths, clean tables, and a faux old-school Korean paper-paneled wall on one side of the smallish restaurant.  . . Food is awesome and well-priced.  Tofu stews reign supreme, and they have every type of tofu stew available -- I either get the seafood mix or kimchee tofu hotpot -- and for people not so versed in all things tofu, the tofu in the stews are super soft, super light and savory.  Like most Korean restaurants, they also serve a whole bunch of side dishes (mostly vegetarian and some seafood) for free as well as rice and rice porridge.  If you've got some extra room, definitely get the soup and spare rib combo for an extra $3 or $4 bucks -- w/o the beef you're looking at $8 for the tofu stew, rice and sides.  You can't beat that with a kimchee stick.
