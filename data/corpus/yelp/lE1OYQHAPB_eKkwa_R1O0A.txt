Pretty good if you like tonkotsu soup base.  The place is small and kinda old but very lively most of the nights.  If you are gonna go during the winter, bring your coat.  It can get really cold in there.  Anyway, one thing about this place...do not order gyoza if you want mouth full of yummy dumplings.  There gyoza is very tiny...I mean REALLY tiny.. . *Decor =...not much to look at. *Food = good but I prefer Orochon in Little Tokyo. *Service = good
