Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
What can be said that hasn't already been yelped. Â Bottega Louie is SOLID. They have something for everyone, from their amazing pizza's to their beet salad. Albeit a tad bit loud, the decor of the restaurant is fantastic and very suitable for larger crowds. . . The food is good. The place, aesthetically is amazing. and the waitstaff is beyond helpful and pleasing.
