I thought this place was good, but pricey.. . We had chicken nachos an guacamole for appetizers.  They were both pretty large, and quite tasty.. . I had the BLT for lunch.  It was good, but I do not like to put so much work into eating my food.  (I don't like chicken wings for this reason).  This was an open faced sandwich that you ate with a fork and knife.  . . I was sad that I was so full I didn't have room to try the carrot cake.  I have heard wonderful things about the frosting.  But the portions were huge!. . I was very impressed with the service.  I order my sandwich with no cheese.  After I cut into it I noticed there was blue cheese on it.  I just decided to push the cheese off.  But the server noticed the cheese too, and apologized and offered to get me the correct sandwich.  She brought out a fresh BLT with no cheese very quickly.  I was so impressed that she noticed that!
