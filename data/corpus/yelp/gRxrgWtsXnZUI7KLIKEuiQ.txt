I'm a pastry snob. This place makes great ones.. . I usually go pick up a few sinful little confections, sit outside on the patio or by the fountain in the square, and pretend that the three I've chosen are to be shared amongst friends... :). . Also a great brunch spot, especially during the warmer months. Goat cheese salad and quiche are highly recommended.
