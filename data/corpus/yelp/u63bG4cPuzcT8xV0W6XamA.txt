Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Oh Pinks, how I love thee. . Pinks is filling. . Pinks is fattening. . Pinks is GOOD. . . I can't believe I waited in line for 2 hours for it...but you know what, it's always worth it. I was highly entertained by the other hungry customers, the constant moving billboard, and the large pothole in front of the place provided lots of entertainment as well. It was hilarious seeing dozens of cars speed across the 10 foot pothole and scrape and hit the floor. Love seeing LA's tax dollars not being spent! lol. . My all-time fave is the chili-cheese hot dog with a grape soda! The chili always tastes the same everytime I come, and I love it more and more. Pinks hot dogs is the best place for your late night fix!
