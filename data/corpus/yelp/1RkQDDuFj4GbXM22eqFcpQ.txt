Category: Chinese
I'm not gonna jump in to the bandwagon here, ok. C'mon now! DTF! drove all the way from OC for you, worse, did it twice, huhuhu. I'm not saying you won't ever see me again braving the long wait at this spot but never again to get out of my way for this. I think this dumpling hse is overrated, people are coming, though. Yeah the quality of the food was slightly better than regular, that I give it to them but 4-5 stars overall? again, c'mon now! Lastly, the servers were somewhat stressed out they're stressing me out!. .    :)--- clean restaurant, slightly better quality food.    :(--- tasted one tasted 'em all kind of feel, Din Tai Hyped!
