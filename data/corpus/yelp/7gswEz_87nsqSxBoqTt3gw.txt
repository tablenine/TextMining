WoW. Porto's. The last time I visited it was a bustling mad house of baked goodness. It still has that fresh baked excitement, but now with Â elbow room! I did not see the grab a ticket and wait in the mob system - maybe it has been eliminated - and I love it. . . The eclairs are one of my favorites, they have this nice coating of sugar or syrup that makes each bite delicious! The meat pies are wonderful and pack very easily. And the potato balls are outta site.
