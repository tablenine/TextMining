The last stop of my food binge weekend.. . What did you say, make my own burger?  Hell yea! . . Usually a basic burger kind of gal I was a bit scared about my choices: 4 toppings, a sauce, pick your bun how ever will I decide?. . Well decide I did and the end result was a sweet, spicy, hot cold concoction I might make at home.  Turkey Burger on a honey wheat bun, goat cheese spread, grilled pineapple, jalapeno, baby lettuce blend and tomato with a horseradish mayo (apparently same one that goes with the fries (tastes like McDonald's special sauce).. . Everything was good but the turkey burger did get overshadowed by the flavors.  At least that is what I though till I tried the turk burg alone and realized that it didn't really pack much flavor to begin with.  . . As far as french fries go, maybe it is the amount of sweet potato fries I have been eating lately but I didn't think they were anything special.  Not bad, but not good.  Of course I ate them, what do you think I am crazy?  But I enjoyed the regular fries of the 50/50 dish we ordered much better.
