I'm not one for writing reviews...but this experience was too good not to share.  We came in on a red-eye from LAX, and this was our introduction to "southern hospitality".  We ordered the Cheese Grits (oh so yummy), the Buttermilk Pancakes (oh so fluffy), and the Oatmeal (oh so lovely).  We were waited on by not one, not two, but by three different people (all so willing and eager to help.)  The Stone Soup Kitchen definitely won our hearts.  Actually, my two young daughters are STILL talking about the great breakfast at the Stone Soup Kitchen!  Oh...and the granola is a beautiful thing as well.....  Thanks Stone Soup-ers!
