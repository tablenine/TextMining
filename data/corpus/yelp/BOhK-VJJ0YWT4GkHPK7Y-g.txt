went out at night, and it had turned into a bar!. . i showed my id, walked in, &amp; the place was packed! not the packed like canned sardine-packed, but moderate enough to know that the place is POPPIN' you know?? it was a good atmosphere &amp; everyone got to sit and stand anywhere they wanted.. . the selection of beer &amp; wine is awesome. my husband definitely enjoyed the beer. says he hasnt had good beer with a alcohol percentage of 10 ever in his life, and there were really good tapas. the fries didn't come in the mini-carts. hahaha.
