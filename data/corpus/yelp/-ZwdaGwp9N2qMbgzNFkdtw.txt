I don't get what all the hype is about this place.. . First off, they rushed us to leave because of the massive lines/wait. And they almost didnt let us cut a cake we brought but we somehow convinced the lady to let us. . . I went here for a friend's birthday and we ordered 7 plates of ONE thing - juicy pork dumplings. We also had fried pork chops, chicken soup, pork pun, appetizer (sprouts) and shrimp/pork shumai. Overall check was $96. (for 10 people - cheap but we didnt order alot, we were still hungry!). . fried pork chop - 4 stars, it was so good!. chicken soup - 2 star. I didn't care for it, it was very plain but refreshing I guess.. pork bun - 2 stars. it was whateveer. appetizer - 4 stars, damn I loved this! it was spicy and good and flavorful.. shumai - 3 stars. it was good.. finally, those dumplings I heard so much about - 4 stars.. . *edit* After eating some from another dumpling house, I've come to realize that this place aint half bad!
