Our favorite breakfast place hands down.  The pancakes are the best!  The pumpkin pancake is in a class of it's own.  The golden ticket is also very good.  The bacon is nice and crisp.  He have also had burgers here and they too were yummy.  The only minus, not reflected in the final tally, is that it can take a while to get a seat.  The place is always busy unless you get there in the late afternoon.  Another tip is to get a half order of the pancakes, they are huge, a half order is doable.
