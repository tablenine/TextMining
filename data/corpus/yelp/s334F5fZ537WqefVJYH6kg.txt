Excellent Mexican restaurant with helpful servers. . . Following the server's suggestion, I ordered the tilapia dinner that came with tortillas and made my own tilapia tacos. The dinner came with some aspargus, vegetables, and rice. Â I'm not sure what they put on the rice, I think it was a lime based sauce, but it was a perfect companion to the fish. . . Remember to bring some beers or other alcohol, it's byob.
