Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Taste = not tasty. I was hoping it would be, but I went with my fam in a group of 4 and everything we ordered (we all got soups/salads and lunch plates) was not tasty. The baked pasta dish was overcooked, the soup was sickly sweet, the sandwiches were "meh," and everything else was less than memorable. Head down to urth cafe or any place on 3rd for this type of fare and I think you'll be better off.
