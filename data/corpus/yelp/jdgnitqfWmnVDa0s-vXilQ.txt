Stopped in for a quick bite after some shopping. I ordered the Chicken Finger Basket. The chicken fingers tasted like Burger King's chicken nuggets. I'm okay with that. The meal also included fries (okay) and carrot sticks. I thought it was priced a little high. My boyfriend got the stuffed french toast. Very good! And a milkshake - the one with orange sherbet and orange pop. I don't remember the name, but that milkshake was excellent! Loved it! . . The food was good, but in the end I thought it was a little expensive.
