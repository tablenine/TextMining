I'm giving this 3-stars due to the fact that it's been a long time since I've had real wood fired pizza, and the food itself was delicious...when it arrived. . . Went there with a group of Yelper's in which most of us ordered different drinks (beers and cocktails) along with different toppings on pizzas. Share and try right? If it fits your fancy they do make a mean drink intentional or not. I've never been one to give dings for strong drinks and I won't start now. However, myself aside they were not to the delight of the group. . . The pizzas: I personally got the Nana which I split with Emily R. The food itself was delicious. The crust was not over done to where it crunched like a cracker, nor was it doughy. Good sauce, right amount of cheese, and nice helping of toppings. No soups here. Size was what you expect with a large, certainly generous enough for sharing. . . The downer, service. As I commented during the night it wasn't "bad" but was out of tune. Timing of our food coming out was an out of the world experience. One order came out 30 mins before the rest, and when we asked about the rest of our food it almost seemed like someone forgot to punch it in the computer. Most of the follow up of plates, checking on drinks, or even grated cheese was an after thought. Again, I doubt anything intentional, a sync issue. . . Awkwardness came when our server did not split up the check and we had to work though the exercise of a cash to card ratio. She didn't get it, or just was irritated. Either way we got the eye. . . A place worth going to for an upscale but dress casual night out. I just might wait until the kinks are out.
