Wait? What wait? I got seated in 5 minutes! Oh that's right, my friends waited for me while I was stuck in traffic. Thanks girls!. . I ate here with friends and fellow yelpers EJ C., Su L., and Long T. (from Houston) on a Friday night. Upon being seated, the waitress distributed hand towels which (as I explained to my friends) are used to clean your hands (obvious?) in case you wanted to eat sushi the proper way: with your hands (not so obvious). The exception of course is sashimi, so I kept my hands nice and grubby. You can read more about sushi dining ettiquete here . http://www.dummies.com....  in case you want to be a pretentious snob about it. Otherwise, keep rubbing those chopsticks and mix that wasabi with soy sauce like an uncivilized connoisseur. Kidding!. . Everything on the menu was a bit pricey, so I figured I'd get the sashimi deluxe dinner since sashimi is pricey anyway. It comes with a side of tempura and a bowl of rice, and of course, a random assortment of sashimi. While everything on the sashimi deluxe was excellent, I was severely disappointed to find that my favorite sushi, sake (salmon), was cooked! Arrrrrrrrrrrrg. Maybe I didn't read the menu properly, but that was so sad. Otherwise, I enjoyed generous servings of hamachi, toro, etc.. . If it wasn't for the fact that my salmon came cooked, I would have easily given this place a 5. I know, it's trivial, but not to a salmon sushi lover. Don't mess with my salmon!
