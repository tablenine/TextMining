3.5 stars. OK when same vegetarian friend was in town, this was one of the joints we hit. . . This is my take on GOBO.... while I enjoyed our dinner and dishes here, it strikes me as any ole CHINESE restaurant whipping up some quick-cooked, greasy (albeit vegetarian and gluten, seitan etc) dishes. So as you can see, I'm not for paying more than average prices for pretty average fare.
