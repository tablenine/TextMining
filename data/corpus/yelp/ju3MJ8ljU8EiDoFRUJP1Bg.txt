Lets just say I don't think food covered in heavy sauce is good eat. . . Just like most of the 1 or 2 stars reviews, I want to believe the hype but soggy cabbage topping mixed with overly seasoned &amp; oily dressing?!  It's so overpowering that you can't taste nothing but the sauce.  . . I agree with one of the reviews :  "tastes like a Korean mom's leftovers reheated and thrown into a tortilla!"
