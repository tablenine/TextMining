Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Although this is technically a Brazilian restaurant, the Brazilian food I've had here has been sub-par. However, their pastas, pizzas and sandwiches remain ever popular. There are three locations in Los Angeles. The semi-outdoor seating is cute, but not really my scene. I think restaurants are the only places that can keep up Christmas lights for the entire year.. .
