I ordered the Regina Margherita pizza to go last weekend.  I was running out the door late to a party.  Besides the crust being a little thin and soggy, causing tomato sauce to fall all over my car, it was way overpriced.  It wasn't worth $15...especially as I ate the whole pizza in one night by myself.  I had the spinach/ricotta pizza before and that was a little better...but was on a date, and sometimes that clouds things and he ended up being a jerk anyway.  I liked instead talking with a new interest about spilling pizza in the car and thinking I'd rather be more down to earth with pie at Everybody's where at least I feel you get your money's worth and a whole lot more toppings.  Love and pizza should be filling.
