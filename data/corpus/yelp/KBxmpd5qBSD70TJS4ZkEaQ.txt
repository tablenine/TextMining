Holy sweet jesus, there are about 1000 square inches of pancakes in every order - 1000 sq in of eat-until-you-explode delicious pancakes.  Even my cappuccino was deliciously oversized.. . On a weekday, there isn't really a wait.  The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is that the service was pretty spotty.  Since it could take about a hundred years to make it through your food, that mostly wasn't a problem.  But the waitress dropped off the wrong bill and we had to wait about 10 minutes for her to come back, then another 10 for her to bring back the right one and take our payment.
