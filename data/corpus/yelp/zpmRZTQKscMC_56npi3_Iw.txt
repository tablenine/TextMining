their tacos and other food items do taste good. and from what i've tried, kogi tastes better than their competitors (bool, calbi, etc). BUT after you've tried it once or twice, it's not worth the wait. pretty please.. if you have to wait over 30 minutes, i say move on. i would not go out of my way to eat kogi truck unless it was in the area and there is a short wait. after i had it once, i planned on not going back unless i absolutely have to. not worth the long wait at all. pretty please, don't do that to yourself. you're going to be soo hungry by the time you actually get your food and then you'll get mad at yourself for waiting so long for that.
