A very chic vegetarian restaurant (they have an upcoming event pairing wines with vegeterian dishes). I ate here for lunch with a friend who loves it, but I thought my dish (eggplant with green beans) was a little saucy. And by saucy, I don't mean piquant or bold, I mean drenched in sauce. Surely vegetarian food has been around long enough to not have to rely on heavy sauces...Still, I do hear good things about it, so give it a try and let me know what you think. The ambience is fresh and lovely and it had a brisk lunch crowd.
