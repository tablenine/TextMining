Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Sushi Gen is my favorite sushi restaurant.  I compare all sushi to Sushi Gen.  Located in little Tokyo, in Honda Plaza, Sushi Gen is no longer a hidden gem.  Everyone seems to know it.  I would not recommend going unless you had a reservation.  . . The food is fresh and top notch.  The toro,  yellowtail, and halibut are of excellent cuts.  Since the place is always packed, the fish must always be fresh.  Almost anything you would want at a typical sushi restaurant - Sushi Gen would have.  . . With regard to Sushi restaurants, I strongly suggest that you find a place that you like.  It may not have to be Sushi Gen.  Once you have found a place that you like and enjoy.  Get to know the staff, the chefs, etc.  Once you develop that relationship with them, they will begin to treat you well.  They will often suggest things that you may not have had.  Heck, even buy them a beer or two.. . And one last thing.  Eat at the sushi bar. . . it is part of the experience.  Don't go a sushi restaurant and order a sushi/sashimi plate.
