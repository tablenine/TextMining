Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
The ambiance is wretchedly trendy, but no more so than anything else in this neighborhood. But the service is amazing and the FOOD is just good. All of it. And the fat is trimmed, the meat quality is high, basically everything you hate about bad Chinese food is totally eliminated and the traditional favorites that I love have been "skinnied up" to be lower fat and higher quality. The sesame chicken, rather than a heavy fried breading is light and very tasty. The chicken is like you made it yourself. But the BEST thing about Ping Pong is their hot and soup soup. I am a snob about that soup and Ping Pong's is perfect. The taste is traditional, but better. No grease, no slimy pork at the bottom... just chicken (again, trimmed and quality meat) and onions and mushrooms with tofu. It's perfect. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, and it is the BEST hot and sour soup I have ever had. And that's saying something.
