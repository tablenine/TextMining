Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Rosco's is far from fine dining. In fact I don't think I could ever under any circumstances recommend this place to anyone... while I was sober anyway. But that's the problem. As soon as I'm drunk Rosco's sounds like ambrosia. Poorly cooked chicken smothered in fatty gravy with a side of cheap waffles and fake maple syrup. What's even better is I can get one last beer in before the night is over... This place is heaven when intoxicated, but hell when you're sober. Every time I eat here sober I feel like JCVD sucker punched me in the gut. But when I'm drunk all I can remember is that sweet sweet gravy.  I only go to Rosco's with a Blood Alcohol Content of  .1 or more.
