Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
After despicable service at Leon's on a busy Sunday evening during the winter holidays, my friend and I decided to skip out and head across the street to Parker's. . . The hostess was very polite and immediately sat us at a our table. Our waiter was more than accommodating and *professional*. Parker's is a grown-up, classic steakhouse. I ordered the NY Strip 8oz for an INCREDIBLE price. Abandoning my better judgment, I ordered the steak fries which were delicious. The steak was phenomenal, and cooked just right. . . Our server did forget our steak knives, but on the whole a significantly better value than Leon's across the street with a vast improvement in the service.
