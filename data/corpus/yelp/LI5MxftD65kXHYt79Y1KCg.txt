Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
How I spent my Sunday early-evening:. . - listening to Lady Gaga and a bunch of other randomly dancey top-40 "hits" that didn't really seem like "Vietnamese Restaurant Music" at all. - eating some seriously good Chicken Coconut Curry Soup. - covering some seriously inappropriate-for-life topics with a bunch of boys. - waiting for one of the Camo-clad servers to drop off my friend's fried rice with AMAZING CHINESE SAUSAGE. . This was my second trip to Tank, and I think it surpassed the first one because I had NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING the first time and got one of those giant-ass noodle soups and didn't really have a clue how to eat it or deal with it or anything. I did better the second time around.. . The menu is huge, varied, and mostly cheap.. . And if you REALLY want, you can probably get cow penis soup.
