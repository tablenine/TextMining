Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Parking is difficult but there is a mall right across the street. Do not come with big groups. The wait at this restaurant is ridiculous! Keep in mind that I have no issues waiting for good food...There is no order to the wait. You would think that there would have been a number system developed. Its really based on the "Honor System." While there we saw a couple just walk in and take a seat without waiting what so ever. Maybe it was a bad day for the "Honor System." Lets move on to the food.... . The Hickory Burger was OK. The fries were OK. The apple pie a la mode was great! Service was good. The price was a bit high for what it is. I would recommend experiencing this place but personally I would not eat in at this place again. Take out would be the ticket. . . CASH ONLY!
