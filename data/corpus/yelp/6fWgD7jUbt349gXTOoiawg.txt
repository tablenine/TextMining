A friend of mine took us here repeatedly for pho claiming that it's the best in town. I don't have much to compare it to as my palate extends well beyond just pho, but I will gladly admit that it's got to be one of the best. The menu is extensive with all sorts of soup, noodle, and rice dishes to choose from, though the pho is the best option I've had so far. Beef or chicken are the main options, though you can opt for all veggies. Beware if you're vegetarian, however, as I believe the broth is either beef or chicken; best to ask if that's of major concern. The pho itself has an excellent flavor and plenty of noodles and an entire grocery store aisle of produce. It's amazing. I've tried a few different bowls and every single one of them has been nothing short of awesome, and the quality is always fresh. I'd swear they have a garden in the kitchen where everything is freshly picked! If you love fish sauce, this is also one of the best spots for it, and there are plenty of other sauces as options for your bowl.. . If you're a bubble tea lover, then welcome to heaven. I don't need to say much else, but if you thought the pho menu was long, wait until you see how many flavors of tea you have at your fingertips. Mmm mmm good!. . Over the top chandeliers and incredibly friendly waitstaff await your arrival - don't leave them waiting, y'hear? Don't blow that $5 on some fast food crap - this is definitely the spot to spend it!
