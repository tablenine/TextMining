The few times I've been here, I haven't been impressed.  I love tuna, and I always order it rare.  Both times I attempted the entree, it came out looking more medium well.  The tuna tartare appetizer would be the preferable to the entree, as would the salmon chips.  If I return, I'll definitely remember not to order the tuna entree.  The scallops looked good, so they might be more up my alley.
