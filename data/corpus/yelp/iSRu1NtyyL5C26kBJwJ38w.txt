Long wait, but totally worth it.. . Perfectly priced. However, I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner since they increase their prices. Save yourself some money, do yourself a favor, and come during their lunch hours, 11:30AM-2:00PM! It's cheaper then!. . If I can change one thing about this place, it would be the peanut sauce. I've tasted better, but other than that, everything is superb!
