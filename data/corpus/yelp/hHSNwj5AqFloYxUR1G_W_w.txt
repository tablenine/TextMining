I can`t wait to go back in the summer and sit in their courtyard. This place is GORGEOUS!!! Perfect place for that romantic evening out. The food is good...nothing spectacular....but good. Â One thing that kinda put a damper on the dinner....no liquor...only wine. May-be if I would have been a little tipsy the food would have tasted a lot better!!!
