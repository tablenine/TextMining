Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
obviously when people come to din tai fung, they come for the xiao long bao. the best choice is definitely pork and vegetable, followed by pork and shrimp and lastly, pork and crab stuffing. if you don't like pork, you really shouldn't be going to chinese/taiwanese restaurants.. . i enjoy coming here for the xiao long bao occasionally, but the hour long wait usually discourages me from ever stepping foot in this plaza. even though there's now two locations within walking distance of each other, it hasn't reduced the wait much, especially when you come on a weekend between the hours of 11am-2pm or 6-9pm.. . that being said, i'm honestly not impressed by the xiao long bao here. my mom makes xiao long bao at home that tastes so much better, and i don't have to stand outside of my kitchen waiting for an hour to eat those. what i do like about din tai fung's xiao long bao is that the skin is very thin, so the doughy taste doesn't overpower the flavor of the juicy meat inside.. . everything else i've ever ordered here - the fried rice, the noodle soup, and the shanghai rice cakes - are all pretty typical of any chinese restaurant in the 626. it's not bad, i still like it. but it's not mind-blowingly good either. you can probably get the same quality food at about the same prices at any other restaurant within a 10 mile radius of din tai fung.. . so if you must come here for some taiwanese cuisine, come at off-peak hours, try to keep your party small as there aren't many large tables inside the restaurant, and don't come with too high of expectations for the xiao long bao.
