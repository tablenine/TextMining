After a late night on the town and you really want a suicide dog and don't really want to get ill and have to sue the city you may want to come out to Pinks. This is the spot, though you might wait 45 minutes in the freezing cold but it's worth it especially if your buddies are with you and you are piss drunk anyways. . . They have a variety of dogs and make it any which way you like it and if your lucky you have a place to sit and eat your dog at a semi clean table. Â Oh yeah and they have some old ass drinks too. Like Bubbleup baby.
