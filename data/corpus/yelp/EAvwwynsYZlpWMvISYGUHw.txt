Holy crap.  The sandwiches are outstanding. I had the lechon-- roast pork with sweet plantains and some of their ungodly delicious mojo.  Not greasy or chewy.  Just perfection.  The boy had the Cubano and, if I liked ham, I probably would have too.  It looked damn fine.  . Funny how pork truly blows my skirt up but I can't stand ham..... . The real winner were the mariquitas... just forget about it!  They were so garlic-y and crispy and I could have made a meal on them alone.. Actually I plan to soon.  Mariquitas with a side of their soupy delicious black beans. . . Perfection!
