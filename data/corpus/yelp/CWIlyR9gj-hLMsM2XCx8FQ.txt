I came here with coworkers after a long day of work and it was juuuust riiight. We had never been there before so the waiter gave us his spiel on how they had seasonal menus and that everything was under 400- something calories. The 3 of us shared the chile relleno appetizer that had a spicy kick to it. I ordered the Caramelized Sea Scallops which came in the perfect portion for me. The scallops were tender and the pearl pasta was tasty.  I cleaned my entire plate except for the lemon garnish!  Our waiter was professional and kind.  Although, I would have rather he not serve us our dessert spoons before we even decided if we wanted to order any... oh, and the live music was entertaining!
