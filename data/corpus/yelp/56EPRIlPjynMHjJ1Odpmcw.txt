Tonight I went downtown to visit my amazing webdesign duo We Are Giants After a quick meeting we headed over to Wurstkuche. . . Wurstkuche is known for their exotic sausages. It has been on my list of go to spots for sometime now. Needles to say I was very excited to finally check it out. . . How dope is this chair?. . You walk in and see this amazing assortment of all types of sausages from Bratwurst to Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeno peppers. They go in. Check the site for the latest menu. . . On a side note this is a great Digestive, according to homeboy behind the counter.. . Red brick walls and low light created a really nice ambiance. The group seating in the middle created a group feeling inside. It felt like one big dinner party. . There was dubstep playing tonight. Nice touch!. . I got two sausages. One gourmet and one exotic. . . First I tasted the Chicken Apple &amp; Spices. This is one of my favorite types of sausage. Tonight was no disappointment. They killed the classic chicken apple.. . Second was the exotic Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers. Mouthwatering goodness is how I would describe that. The sweet and spicy peppers were the perfect addition. . . These guys make up the dynamic duo that is We Are Giants. They are also the guys behind The Eagle Rock Yacht Club. It is what your looking for if you are into throwing balls around. . . I defiantly will be coming back to Wurstkuche.
