I went here 1 week ago, and the last time was in 2003. WOW, they renovated this place and it is SO nice.. . Pork (sam gyub sal) - The BEST I ever had in my life.  FOR REAL.  5 star. Brisket- 4.8 star  . Yook Gae Jang-  4.8 star (One of the best I've had). Kalbi- 4 star (have had better at other places). . It's a bit pricy though...but REAL good.  And the service was a 5 star plus...
