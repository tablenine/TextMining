Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
last time i went here, i sat downstairs with my friend.  we had our french dips and a beer, conversed at a community table atop sawdust lined floors along with gaggles of other "angelinos".  . that philippe's experience  was just like the last, which was just like the last and so on.  and it led me to ask the question, "why DO i like this place?"  nothing new, nothing different, nothing remarkable.   . it's been the same thing, every time i come here.  i always get a good sandwich;  the prices are always cheap, and the place still exudes the old LA noir essence that i love.  . it's the consistency, i realized, that keeps me coming back.  i couldn't ask for more in life.  something that's been the same since i was a nugget holding my mom's hand while crossing the street and 20-something years later it hasn't changed.  like a BFF you haven't KIT'ed with during summer but can still pick up right where you left off next semester.
