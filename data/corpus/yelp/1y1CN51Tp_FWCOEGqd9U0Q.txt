i am very upset as I write this. . I have a dilemma. A curse of sorts really. . A wee bit of the issue is will power but I'm still upset.. oh.. where to begin.... i just moved down the street from Rose Angelis.. They 'welcomed' me to the neighborhood with that insanely decedent pudding and OMG chocolate and caramel strawberries.. D@MN their hospitality.. They read me the the specials when iIcall in and have my take out ready in 15 minutes.. I actually have to go and wait 3 minutes while some nice neighbor buys me a lovely Chianti at the cute little bar area.. really ...its upsetting ..Rose Angelis has to be the gem of MY neighborhood.. . YUMMY.
