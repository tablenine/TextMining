Mr. Pizza Factory??! Why didn't I ever know that "Factory" was in the name of this place? Maybe that's why all the walls are painted with factory scenes.... Anyhoo, I live within walkable distance of this joint so it's a pretty easy meal for me to get. The place is always packed, but I'm not exactly sure why. It's not horrible pizza, but I don't think it's the best. I took my fam here once and they were kinda "eh" about it too--and they like everything!! Definitely an interesting concept though--Korean pizzas. I think I expected something more Korean tasting, like a true fusion of pizza and Korean food, but that's not what I got. I was pretty disappointed with the Bulgogi pizza because it didn't have enough bulgogi meat and the pieces that were on the pizza didn't taste enough like Bulgogi. It just kind of tasted like a regular pizza with tasteless strips of meat on it. And don't bother ordering the other pizzas that you can get anywhere else, like the Hawaiian or Meat Lover's pizzas because the regular pizzas taste no differently or slightly more lackluster than what you can get at a standard italian pizza place. Ms. Pauline T. raves about the Potato Gold pizza, but I have yet to try it--maybe I'll revise my review once I do!!
