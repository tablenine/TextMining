Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
I like Urban belly but most of my friends don't get the concept. You order from the counter (server doesn't come to the table), you get your own chopsticks, knives, forks and water and then wait for your food to be brought to you. I don't have a problem with this but the last time I went it caused a Resevoir Dogs style debate on whether to tip or not. I tipped but you are tipping someone just to bring you your food and nothing else after that.. . The Urban belly Ramen is very good and ideal for a person who is having flu/cold symptoms. It is a nice warm hearthy meal. All of their dumplings are very good also but they don't have a dessert option and I think there entire menu has just 14 items on it so it is severly limited.. . Nice food, nice atmosphere but I wouldn't drive a long distance for it.
