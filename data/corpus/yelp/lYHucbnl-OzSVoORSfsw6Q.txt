I drove by this place everyday for 4 months without even noticing it. Then one day when my friend mentioned this wonderful restaurant that was the talk of Santa Monica, I was intrigued. I searched through the reviews and decided to check out this hidden gem on Venice Blvd. and found a gold mine.  . Following the reviews, I tried the FO Burger and Sweet Potato Fries. I must admit that these two items were one of the more unique and tasty items that I have ever had in LA.  The sweet potato fries were fried nicely to a crisp and paired with a tasty, "garlicky" aioli sauce that still makes my mouth water thinking about it as I write this review.  The FO burger was a delicious with a unique blend of the FO house sauce and soft baby greens. The flavors brings me back to some familiar flavors from a restaurant back in Boston, Beerworks.  . So if you are here and feeling a burger and fries definitely try this combination. I tried a fruity flavored hefeweizen with sweet notes of bananas and citrus, which I that was pretty unique.  Didn't complement the burger fully but it tasted pretty darn good down the gasket...
