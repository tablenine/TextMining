Don't get me wrong, I LOVE BC, I just don't like this location. . . I usually go to the one in Garden Grove &amp; EVERY time I go there, I leave satisfied. My friends &amp; I decided to try this place out because we were in the area, and I was quite disappointed. Okay, get ready for a biased review! . . The 1 lb shrimp that I got was just "meh." It felt a bit rubbery and it didn't soak in that whole shabang flavor I was craving. And the corn wasn't as tasty as the corn from Garden Grove; it felt like it was lacking butter. And the water! Oh my, okay, the water is 25 cents at both locations but this water was just the worst. It tasted like it came from a water fountain and it wasn't ice cold at all. Pretty sad. . . And I ain't even trippin, my friends noticed the difference too! So for me, next time I'm in this area I'm going to Noodle World, because at least I actually like what I order there. Sorry Alhambra BC.
