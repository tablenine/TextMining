So we were a group of like 8 and we were going to see a movie at the Paseo Colorado Pacific Theaters so we decided on eating at Yard House. I had never been to Yard House before but I had heard it was pretty good. What I didn't know was that it would be so expensive. Oh well. I had Pear Cider and Iced Tea to drink ($10), Clam Chowder ($7), and a NY Steak Sandwich with sweet potato fries. YUMM ($17). Add that up with tax and tip, thats a $40 meal that was absolutely NOT worth $40. Not sure if I would go back here, the prices just aren't worth what you get.
