So I saw the thing n Tv about this place and I decided to try it out. I got the roast beef and was slighly disapointed. Then I tried my boy friends lamb sandwich and was in heaven!!!!! Maybe I am just not a roast beef girl but the lame was fucking AMAZING!!! It was so soft and delishes. The sides we got were good as well. This place is not my favorite but it is a place I would go back occasionally :) GET THE LAMB!!!!! MMMMMMMMMM
