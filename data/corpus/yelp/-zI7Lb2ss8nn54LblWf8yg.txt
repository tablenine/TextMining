This is one of our favorite restaurants in Chicago! The food is always cooked to perfection. If you are a fish lover, this place is for you. And if you are not, there are plenty of other yummy things to choose from. The staff is always pleasant and attentive without 'hovering' and the decor is very appealing and modern without seeming 'cold.' I highly recommend Spring!
