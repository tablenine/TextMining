I've always been curious about this place ever since it opened. For me this restaurant is very conveniently located right next to the building I work in, so I thought I would give it a try.. . I went there as it was opening for dinner, and it wasn't crowded at all. I know this place is supposed to be a big deal with its famous chef and everything, but honestly it was just alright. The steak was okay, and the risotto was too salty.. . I also remember the server being a little pushy and suggesting this dish and that dish. I order what I want.
