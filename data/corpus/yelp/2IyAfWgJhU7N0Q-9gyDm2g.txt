Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Some people love it and some people dont really care for it (although I really dont know why).. . But here are the facts. . 1) The ingredients are as good as any foodie restaurant in LA, SF, Chicago, wherever.  Produce, meats, cheeses, etc. are all exceptional quality.  The final product may not be haute, but the ingredients are as good as they get.. 2) The caprese is the best in the city. 3) The bread crust is made with great care.  Whether you prefer charred crust, thick, or thin, no one can deny the QUALITY of the crust.. 4) The wine list is very thoughtful. . Some people are stuck on overly sauced ridiculously thin NY pizza.  For those of you who are, Mozza will not satisfy.  . . For those of you who love caprese, salumi, proscuittio, meatballs, artisnal cheeses, great wine, awesome bread, great ingredients and are open to pizzas that arent NY style, then I think you will find Mozza a great choice.. . I personally love the atmosphere, the decor, and everyting on the menu.
