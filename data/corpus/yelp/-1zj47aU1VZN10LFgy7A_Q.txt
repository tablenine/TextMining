The long wait time here does not mean it is worth it. I've been for brunch a few times because it was recommended by several people. They spoke of it with "amazing" and a "must" in L.A. Now, that I live here permanently and have done other places, I'd suggest it for someone visiting, but if you have don't have time and know other places it's not worth the crowds and trendy pretentious types here. Service, people, food are all okay. No mimosa's, but I'm still trying to find that, maybe it's a liquor law/time thing here. You may see a few C-list celebrities here too. It's good people watching. I love watching hungry people stand around.
