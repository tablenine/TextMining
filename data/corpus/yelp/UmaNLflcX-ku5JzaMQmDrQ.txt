Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I have been to Stella's for dinner four times now... once was at least 6 months ago, when I had the same waiter as I had a few days ago.  To me, that is a good sign.. . This is my favorite diner in the area.  It is very clean, bright, and cute inside.  The servers are nice and knowledgeable, and everyone who works there seems to get along.  Everything I've had has been awesome (try Dracula's garlic bread...) and they actually make an effort to give the food a nice presentation.  Basically, the whole place is just adorable.. . On your way out, the manager will likely go out of his way to make you feel like the most special person on earth.  I enjoy that.. . And last but not least... they serve RC and Diet Rite!!!!!!!!
