I moved last summer and I seriously miss Cleo's.  I returned tonight after a six month hiatus, and fell in love all over again.  It's the best bar in the city.  Great $5 pizzas on Thursday, great random beer specials.  Awesome bartenders, wait staff, etc.  Even the bouncer is kickass.  The only downside is we're no longer down the street, so either me or the H has to be the the designated driver.  Boo.  Cleo's, can I take you home with me?
