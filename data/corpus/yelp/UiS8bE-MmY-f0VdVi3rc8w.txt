I've been to both Fogo and Brazzaz and think they each have things I like and dislike. I think Brazzaz is a better value for the money. I also think that Brazzaz has a far superior salad bar. Although why would you eat from the salad bar when pounds upon pounds of meat will be coming your way?. My favorite cuts are the round and filet. Although I actually like the sides better then anything. I mean how can you beat fried plantains, polenta, cheese rolls light as air and the hot pineapple skewer oh and not to mention the mashed potato's(they're like creamy crack...egh that totally doesn't sound right, but they are soooo good!)? Â . Although I am on a 1200 calorie a day diet I am thinking of biting the bullet and coming here tomorrow for lunch. $19.99 lunch special is hard to beat, plus I'd love some protein.
