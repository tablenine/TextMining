Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I have tried many Ramen place and this one isn't that spectacular to me at all. The broth is too salty and the portion of noodle, vegetables, meat and soup are not balance. It's also kind of lame for extra green onion in a supper small dish will cost you $1.25 extra. Without extra pork, it seems no pork at all in there. Â We tried other side dishes as well and none of them are impressed; however, the beer is great over there. I will not drive all the way to downtown again for this place is for sure.
