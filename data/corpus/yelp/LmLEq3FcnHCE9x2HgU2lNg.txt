Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
So you want some tapas?  Bueno.  Can't afford AOC but still want some great food?  Cobras &amp; Matadors is a great spot.  It's a unique place with an interesting and creative menu... and no liquor license???. . That's right.  Luckily, they conveniently own the liquor store that is strategically located next door.  Good job, guys.  Decent wine selection, nothing crazy, but it'll do you right.. . One nice thing is that Cobras &amp; Matadors FINALLY realized the folly of their ways... and decided to start taking reservations.  NOW you don't have to take your date and wait to be seated.  It is a dark setting inside, which is nice, although you are elbow-to-elbow with your neighbors... so get ready to establish your space early and defend it.  Outside is nice if you can get a table, as long as the exhaust fumes from Beverly Blvd don't bother you too much.... . I could go through the menu and make recommendations... but we all have our culinary preferences, so I'll let you make your own decisions.  But everything that I've ever had has been very good.. . All in all, I'm giving 4 stars.  A very satisfying dining experience, with reasonable prices and decent ambiance.
