This place is really nice! The atmosphere is nice, although a little crowded at times. The food was great and there are many many options to choose from. It is a little on the expensive side, but definitely worth the money! . . I've marked 4 stars but it probably deserves 4.5, it is a great Italian place in a great neighborhood!
