With all the hype of this place and having to make a reservation 3 days in advance I was expecting a lot . They met all expectations. EVERYTHING I had was soooo good there ......OMG. I had the Bianca pizza with sage also tried the Fennel sausage pizza (soooo yummy).  Also had the best Butterscotch desert I have ever had.  I would definitely go back.
