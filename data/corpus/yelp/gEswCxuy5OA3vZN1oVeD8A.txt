We ate at Sola for valentines day... and i don't think i need to go back there. The food was ok. i had the bass and it was mushy and didn't have much flavor. it came with spinach that was a bit salty. my wife had the tuna which was actually pretty good. . . The experience overall was poor. We felt very rushed. We ordered a bottle of wine, soup, entrees, and desert. By how fast they wanted to rip us through sola, i would have thought we were eating Panera Bread. We felt like we needed to chug our last glass of wine as we felt like the bus boy was breathing down our neck to clear the plates.  However, the table next to us was a "friend of the owner", and it was obvious. They staff all but fed them their food.  My final issue with sola is you get no privacy. they cram so many tables into a spot they may as well call it family style. . i understand the need to flip a table, but seriously, i have waited longer for my food at panera bread. . . Review Note. This is our 2nd time eating at sola. the 1st time was ok, but the experience was only average. we thought we would try again only after another favorite restaurant went out of business.
