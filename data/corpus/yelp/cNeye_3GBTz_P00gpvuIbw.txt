LONG LINES.. . but well worth it. you can get a bakery level cake for anywhere btwn like $15 and $30 easily. and if you want crazy decorations (trust me i saw all kinds there) or a HUGE sized cake, it will cost more. but a typical cake should be no more than $30. and hell, at those prices i'll stand in long lines.. . i have no idea what to expect when i got there. i thought it would be a small mom and pop type place. boy was i wrong. it's huge with a cafe on one side for small eat-in orders and then the other side for large pastry/bread orders. and a special line just for pre-ordered cakes. . . i'll definitely be going back. and this time i'll know to expect being there at least 30 min for the long waits.
