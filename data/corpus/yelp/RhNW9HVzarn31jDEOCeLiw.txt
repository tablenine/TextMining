Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Randomly stumbled upon this place with my boyfriend. We spent Sunday walking around China Town - caught a demonstration by Shaolin Warriors of LA - which was pretty great. Afterwards we Â took a side street by accident and ran into this restaurant. When my bf saw it - he informed me that this was one of his father's favorite places. A weird fact about our relationship - his father and I tend to have the same taste in food. Anyways, knowing this, I immediately wanted to try it. We both had the french dip lamb sandwich - it was pretty awesome. I def'ly see myself craving it in the future. The line wasn't too bad - took about 10 minutes. The downside for me was that it was a cash only place, but they have atm's with the usual ridiculous fees. Anyways - worth the hype and i'm definitely going to indulge again. The iced tea was good. Also, people watching during the wait kept things interesting.
