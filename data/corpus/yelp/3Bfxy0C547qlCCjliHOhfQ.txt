it's 100F today, and i enjoyed a cool, crisp and delicious mako salad in Gingergrass' comfortable air conditioning.  The place was packed, and there was a bit of a wait at 1pm, but it was decidedly worth it.  HUGE salad, the beef was very tasty but a little chewy, (it would have been GREAT if it was cut into smaller bits from the start.) Overall, though, it was good to the last bite. Service is adequate, but not exactly attentive. The ginger limeade was so strong i had to water it down quite a bit before it wasn't making me squint after each sip. . . I'd happily go here again, and I'd love to get into that menu a little deeper, but i just couldn't bear to eat anything hot today.
