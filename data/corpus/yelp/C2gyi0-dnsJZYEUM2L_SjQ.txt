BOSSA NOVA SOO DELICIOUS! Jason Rosen from Honor Society actually suggested this to my friends and I and when we saw it..we were like, hey lets just go try it! AND WOW IT WAS GOOD! I never had Brazilian food before, but it was pretttttty bomb! I got this chicken sandwhich thing..I can taste it now.. JUST GO TRY IT! And they deliver too! When I was waiting for a concert at House of Blues, they came and it was super hot and yummmmy!! Okay gotta go bye!
