I think I'd give it actually 3.5 stars if I could. Some of my party had been here before (and I came a few minutes late so perhaps the waiter already reminded them this) so they let me know its kind of tapas style where everything is shared.  Four of us ordered the divers scallops, chicken, halibut with sea urchin reduction, beef cheeks (who's Auntie Edna's favorite little cut of beef?), heirloom tomatoes, colorful cauliflower, roasted shishito peppers, assorted mushrooms, gnocchi and had pork belly brought 'compliments of the chef'. I didn't pay for this lunch, but probably would have been annoyed if I had personally paid $29 for a plate of 4 scallops. They were good, but not $7-per-medium-scallop good. The gnocchi was my favorite (and only $10 -though it is a side) - we all liked it enough to have a second order. Dessert was nice. We had Concord Grape sorbet, chocolate peanut butter tart with gelato, spiced gelato with marshmallows and bruleed pumpkin pie. I liked the peanut butter tart best as it had a nice crumbly crust texture on the bottom.  The service gets 4-stars as they were very attentive.  And, I haven't read other reviews but I'm sure that others note that this is right by the talent agencies so you are likely to see someone - at my lunch Ben Kingley was enoying a meal across the way.. . New note: Went again and again the gnocchi was out of this world.  Can't be good for you but tastes oh so good!
