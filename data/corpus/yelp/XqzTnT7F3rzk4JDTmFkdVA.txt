Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
We were around the Magnificent Mile and really wanted a good breakfast... we were told Yolk was one of the best in town.  I will absolutely give it a score higher than the typical chain breakfast joint (iHop, Good Egg, etc...) but it really lacks that neighborhood cafe feeling where you get amazing food from local farmers.  This just felt like a chain with above average food.  Betty's in Berkeley still takes #1 for breakfast... by a long shot.
