Category: Sushi Bars
I enjoy eating at the Geisha House- I have always had good service there and I think that the it has a really fun vibe and beautiful decor.  However, I don't think the food is anything to write home about- I have certainly had better sushi, but the steak is very good and they have some fun combinations on their menu (even something as simple as the bacon wrapped tomatoes which are delicious).  If you want to go somewhere very hollywood trendy for a 15 dollar glass of wine this is the place to go, however if you are craving amazing sushi, you can do better elsewhere- most of their sushi rolls" dont even have raw fish in them!
