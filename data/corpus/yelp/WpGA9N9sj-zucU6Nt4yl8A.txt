Parking is sorta nuts here, because it seems the entire valley gets their lunch at Portos... or at least their baked goods prepared at this Burbank hot spot.. . The plantain/banana chips are sooo good, you'll have to get more, as only a few come alongside the sandwich plate. I recommend the "media noche" sandwich..... and ADD TAPATIO for kick. . . :-). . Little known fact.... a Porto's "SECRET" (if you will)... . . The coffee is fantastic. Sometimes I go there JUST for coffee....And you don't have to wait in line! Just jump up to the drink area and pay there... skip the 40-person queue and get your coffee nowwwwww.
