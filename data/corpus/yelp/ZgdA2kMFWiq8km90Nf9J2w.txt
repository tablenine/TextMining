This was my cousins' recommendation as she works Downtown...but I have passed this place SEVERAL times while heading to bars.. . Well...let me tell you it is worth a stop. This place has a very NYC feel.. . YOU MUST ORDER THE PORTOBELLO FRIES! . . The mozzarella on the Caprese salad was delicious &amp; I especially enjoyed how the tomatoes were peeled.. . I thoroughly recommend this place for a trendy night out. There are no reservations but the restaurant is big, so the wait isn't THAT horrific (lol..or at least it wasn't for us).. . Service is a bit slow...but the wait staff is VERY attractive (so I say that is worth a bit of leeway :-))
