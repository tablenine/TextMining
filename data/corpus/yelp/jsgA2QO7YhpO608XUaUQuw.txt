Fresh, raw and simple - Is all I need in a sushi joint! This place hit it spot on!. . Hubby took me here for my birthday dinner and it was perfect. We split the Sushi Deluxe dinner with the fried chicken to start. Â It was more than enough to feed us both.. . Service was good and worth the wait on a busy night.
