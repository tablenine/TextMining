No one should feel guilty about giving this place 3 stars. It's what it deserves - good food, reasonably priced in a cafe-like setting. Get the sweetbreads on the app menu and the arugula salad to go with it. Try some meat other than a thin steak. There's a little thing of chimichurri sauce on the table for dipping bread and your main eats into. We've all seen them come and go on the Melrose corridor, and Lala's is always just there, fun, reliable and easy.
