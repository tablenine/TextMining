Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Nowhere on this side of the MIssissippi can you get such good fried chicken and Waffles at the same time! I'm not even joking, I drove with my friends for almost an hour just to eat here.. It might seem strange to you, especially if your knowledge of Chicken and Waffles doesn't cover anything past KFC and Eggo's. It's a really carefully planned meal, and it tastes like love and happiness! I wish I lived closer, so I could eat here all the time!
