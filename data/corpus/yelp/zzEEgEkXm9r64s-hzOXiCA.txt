I have gone to this place twice. Obnce as an invited guest during its opning and once by myself. . When everything was on the house this place was excellent. The steak is actually pretty good especially with the mashed potatoes(creamy). The beer selection is huge but not alot of favorites in my opinion. BBQ Calamari was ok at best just....needed...something....more. It being the first operational day the waiters werent that sharp but I'm sure they will get the kinks worked out.. The next time wasn't that great but still as good. A little pricey but really, what do you exspect out of midtown? Steak was still good and the waiters flowed alot better but the appetizers...still missing that something. Desert was still good and you can't go wrong with 30 different beers(they have a tasters choice card, and you can get little shots of the beer before ya dive yourself right in).
