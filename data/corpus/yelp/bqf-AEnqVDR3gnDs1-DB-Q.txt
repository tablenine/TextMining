I was at Coobah with friend and yelper Mary some time ago. Another friend and I decided to order a number of small dishes including some very interesting tamales and something that had some fantastic plantains on it. I don't remember the details of the food too well, but we had good service, great food and excellent drinks. It was way crowded and like Mary said, perhaps a bit too trendy, but definitely worth the money.
