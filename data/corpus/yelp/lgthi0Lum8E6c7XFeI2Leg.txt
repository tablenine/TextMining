Dust off those aviator sunglasses and military caps and then head on over to The Griddle Cafe with a hearing aid (YOU'LL NEED TO TALK LOUD IF YOU SIT INSIDE) and an empty stomach.  Make that 8 empty stomachs, which you'll need once you see the portions.   After basking in the sun for the 45 minute wait, I had a suntan to compliment my hearty breakfast.  . . While my friends ordered the French Toasts (yummy!), I ordered the "Gone Shrimping" meal (Egg Whites scrambled with Shrimp, basil pesto, scallions, and tomatoes).  I MUST recommended it if you want to take a break from the carbs and want something not too sweet for breakfast.. . Although the food was excellent, I gave The Griddle Cafe 3 stars because the extra effort you had to give in order to enjoy the meal was just too much.  I expected some sort of wait, but didn't expect it for the food, bathrooms and the check.  And also, kiss the Parking Fairy if you happen to find a spot in the free parking lot. (We were fortunate enough to find someone leaving their spot.)
