Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Basically a hundred bucks a head. You can get out for less by avoiding drinks but this is not a hot dog eating contest on Coney Island. Also, don't try to "beat the house", it's self-defeating and you'll end up in the morgue. Fogo de Chao is best enjoyed through casual grazing. The salad bar is fantastic and the meats are superb. Wave your hand at the first few passes - the choicer cuts come towards the end (this is common to all Brazilian buffets). Also, bring a date - not your "buffet buddy" because this is a classy joint on Restaurant Row.
