The dinner at Chops could have been better for what we spent. I was expecting a four or five star restaurant. Our experience didn't even rate. . . The Cons: We had reservations and arrived on time but they were running a little behind and we weren't seated till 30 minutes after we were scheduled. Not good for a high priced restaurant. . . The mashed sweet potatoes were downright cold. We sent them back to the kitchen and when the waiter brought them back to our table. They were still cold. . . We sent them back again and they came back warm, not hot. . . Shabby for a fancy eatery: Coffee came with no cream. . . Pros: they were very apologetic and aimed to please. We got comped on the cold 'taters. They brought us a free bread pudding for dessert. I guess it was just a busy night and the staff was pushed past its limit. Â Next time we're going to McKendrick's.
