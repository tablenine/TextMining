Category: American (Traditional)
I really love this place.  I've come here about once or twice a year over the last 3 or 4 years.  I was there last night and everytime I go I like it more and more.  They change their menu around and it's always getting better.  It's not too expensive, it's comfortable, a GREAT date place.  This is the first time I saw the bar they have in the front.  AND free parking!!  I just don't have a bad thing to say about Fork &amp; Screen.. . Also, our server, Austin, was fast and friendly and nice.
