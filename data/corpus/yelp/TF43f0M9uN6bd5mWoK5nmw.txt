I like Sepia a lot, although there are a couple reasons they don't get a full five stars.. . I ordered a couple glasses of wine, a martini, a beet soup, and the skate wing.. . The soup tasted pretty good but was more like a thick sauce - it was so thick that the surface was tilted and didn't find level.  I'm permissive with definitions of soup, but I'm pretty sure they should be liquid and not ketchup-consistency.. . They did screw up the order at first - I ordered the beet soup, and they brought the beet salad at first.  The server caught her own error, but not before I'd been presented with the salad.  They let me keep the salad, so I got to try that for free, which was nice.  I actually liked the beet salad better than the beet soup.  The wine picked to accompany this was sweet enough to bring out the sweetness in the beets, but not so sweet that it overwhelmed the other flavors - well played.. . The skate wing was about perfect - that dish gets five stars, and the wine my server selected to accompany it was earthy and bridged the fish and cauliflower flavors quite nicely.. . Besides the odd soup, the other reason I can't bring myself to give this place five stars is that the seating in the bar/lounge area looks cool, but is actually quite uncomfortable to sit on.  Great food served up in an uncomfortable seating arrangement doesn't make for a five-star experience.  I should eat in their actual dining room next time, as it might be more enjoyable and more comfortable.
