Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
For fast mexican food, Titos is the best.  I have been coming here for over 40 years.  The food is simple but addicting and great.  Best are the tacos and burritos.  Every couple weeks I crave Titos and go for my fix.  The salsa is thick and medium spicy.  The guacamole is good but has a thin consistency.  No chicken or pork here just beef.  Just like Saturday Night Live....taco taco taco
