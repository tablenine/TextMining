I really liked the food...like really liked it.  The fries were awesome and I loved the dipping sauce.  BUT I just wish that the portions for the sandwich was just a little bit bigger.  I got the pulled pork sandwich and it just didn't seem as big.  But none the less, definitely some good grubbin'.
