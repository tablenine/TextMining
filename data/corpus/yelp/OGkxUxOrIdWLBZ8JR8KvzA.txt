Do you like to drink?. . Do you like to eat?. . Do you like lots of people to look at and flirt with?. . If you do then you will dig Casa Vega. The margs are fantastic, the food is a bit pricey for what it is (basic americanized mexican food of the blend together variety), but it's really cute and you feel like you are on vacation. And did I mention all of the cute people there are to look at. Good, cuz there are.. . As a warning, don't order the crab salad unless you are into the whole vat of mayo consuming your plate. Not a fan, but for mexi basics, it's good! :)
