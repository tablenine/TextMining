So this place is fantastic for brunch if you'd like to enjoy LA's #1 natural resource, sunshine and get back in the real world after a night of drinking.  Not so good if you roll out of bad any later than 10 and have to endure the long-ass line that is always there past that hour and moves painfully slow.  They do make an effort, though, by bringing little cups of lemonade and iced tea to refresh the hungover line stander-inners so props for that.. . The food here isn't gourmet, knock your socks off but rather  brunch done well and right and oh yes, big.  I walked in with the biggest hunger ever and only got through half of my breakfast quesadilla.  Did manage to finish the delicious fresh melon and berry mix that accompanied it, though.  My coffee was delicious also and I will be back, hopefully on the earlier side to enjoy great brunch food in a very nice outdoor setting.
