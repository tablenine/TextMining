Went with my Marshmallow Peep this past weekend. In fact, we went two nights in a row, it was so good! Great, no frills, food.. . Their hamburgers are certainly among the best I've had. Juicy, flavorful, and simplistic. The chicken salad sandwich was surprisingly good. My Jew Loved the 1/3 pound burger, and we both found the fries to be high on the yum-factor.. . I've a bit of an issue with their coleslaw, though. While it's not essential that a side order such as this be exceptional, I was disappointed. The coleslaw is a bit dry and not terribly flavorful, but if you mix in the dressing they give you for the fries into the slaw you get something mighty scrumptious.. . I'll be trying the pulled pork next, and I must try the cup cakes soon. :). . I'm extremely satisfied with this place and will definitely go back there as soon as I can with my Jujube. :). . Edit 11/30/07:. It bears mentioning that the name Oinkster is not misleading in what they serve because it's not suppose to represent their menu. Rather, Oinkster is what you'll become after eating the food served at this establishment. Duh.
