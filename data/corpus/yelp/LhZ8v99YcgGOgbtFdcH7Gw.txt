this place is actually pretty good ... i give it a 4 because the food is a leetle bit too salty for me, and i'm known to eat my food with flavor, so it's salty to me, than it really means that your food was poured with salt.. . their milanesa is all i order, and it's quite a place to be. their salad and their bread.. mmmm. yummmmmmm~y for my tummmmmmmmmm~y.. hehe:). . it's always damn packed everytime i go... the staff is pretty friendly and always up to give you some suggestions.... . limited meter parking and valet parkers are actually nice too.. surprisingly. i'm not too thrilled about their long waits for the ladies restroom though.
