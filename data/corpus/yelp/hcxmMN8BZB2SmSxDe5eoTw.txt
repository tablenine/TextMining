Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I am probably being kinder than I should be with this review.  I'm annoyed with this place because, just before they opened, I talked to a guy who looked like a manager-type, and he said we'd be able to order the full menu from the cafe at the bar, so my friend and I went there looking for dinner.  When we tried to order, we were told, unfortunately I had been misinformed.  No big deal.  We ordered off the specials: dinner-y type thing.  I got sand dabs, and my friend got mussels of the tapas menu.  There was some kind of mix-up in the kitchen, and our food took ages to get to us, and when it finally did, my fish was cold.  . . As a consolation prize we got dessert, which was fantastic.  We got a gelato spaghetti, which is vanilla gelato shaped into spaghetti, and the topped with strawberry sauce &amp; shaved white chocolate (I'm drooling now, are you?).  And we also got the raspberry chocolate cake.  Both were amazing.. . We also got drinks with dinner, I got a bellini, and my friend got an "Italian Assassin" which was an amaretto and Jim Beam something or other, apparently deadly.  But mine was very very yummy, and I would have had another one, but that would have caused me to leave my phone number for the waiter, and that's just tacky.  Did I mention he was seriously hot?
