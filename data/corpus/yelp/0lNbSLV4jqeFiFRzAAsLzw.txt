Do not base your opinion on my review! As I only eat one thing and one thing only at Doc Cheys - The shrimp wontons with chili sauce. The are the most awesome!! They are greasy lil nuggets with shrimp inside and dipped in the sweet spicy chili sauce... I could eat 20 of them! But I would probably sweat grease!
