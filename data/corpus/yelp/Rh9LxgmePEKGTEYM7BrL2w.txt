Coming from SF, i have very high standards for mexican food.  I can get a $5 burrito in the mission with chips and salsa that rivals $100 meals i've had.  My review focuses on tacos and burritos.. . At El Cid 2, tacos are cheap ($2) and done well.  Not mind blowing, meat is average to above average, the tortilla was better than average (not saying much, since so many places have bad tortillas), and salsa was slightly above average.. . I will definitely be back for more tacos and burritos, cuz its less than 2 blocks from my house.
