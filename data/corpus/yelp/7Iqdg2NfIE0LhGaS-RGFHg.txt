I liked this place.  It had really good prices and really nice people.  We didn't feel like downtown Atlanta had much to offer in terms of dining, so this place was a gem.  . . We had the bison short ribs which area a Saturday special, even though we ate there on a Thursday.  Tony, our server didn't blink twice.  (A little back story, we came here for cookies and ice cream the night before.  They were out of oatmeal raisin, but he remembered and make sure to set a few aside for us to take home.)  . . The bison meatloaf was also delicious and the squash casserole was great as a side dish.  Add a pretty decent bloody mary and I was sold.  This place was friendly, cozy, and not overpriced.
