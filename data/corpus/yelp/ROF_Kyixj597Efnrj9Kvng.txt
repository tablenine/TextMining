It's not like this placer needs another review, however everyone is right, prepare for a long wait.  We could not believe the wait at lunch when so many other places in the area were empty.  When we were finally seated we both ordered the sashimi deluxe that came with miso soup, tofu, rice, and pickled veggies.  Now the sashimi came with yellowtail, tuna, kampachi, more tuna octupus, seaweed.  It also had cooked items including salmon and tuna.  Our favorite probably was the spicy tuna since they used chilis mixed in the tuna.  I didn't care for any of the cooked items, however all the cuts were big and melted in your mouth! Definitely worth the wait.
