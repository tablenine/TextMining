Checked this place out with a buddy of mine on July 3rd and even with the big Anime Expo going on the wait for a table was fairly quick.  I had the miso with #3 spicy, and added an egg with garlic.  I'm not a ramen connoisseur, but I thought the soup part of the ramen was decent.  The #3 spicy level may have been a little to much for me.  I barely tasted any garlic even though I added it, but it could be the spicy level that prevented me from tasting it.  The egg they added was just a hard boiled egg and I was hoping for a fried egg ontop.  For what you get the food seemed a little overpriced since you only get one peice of pork and barely any ramen compared to the large bowl they serve it in.. .      Oh, the button ontop of the napkin holder does work.  My buddy pressed it to see if worked and ended up embarressing himself by telling the waitress that he was just testing it.  Maybe thats why we got less ramen haha
