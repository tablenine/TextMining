this place was so freaking good and smelled so delicous from the outside. its definitely worth the wait! i got cheddar cheese/bacon waffles. its small and crispy but oh so delicious. I wish it came w/ hash browns though...my friends got french toast (also very tasty) and the denver omlette (very good). I highly recommend this breakfast place. dont even think about going to the local yolk.
