Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
So, I think I am officially a total LA convert. Why? Because since moving here, I have eaten at my very first Indian, and now Brazilian restaurant. I know you might be thinking, where did this girl live before, Iowa? No, I came from the white washed land of Orange County, where the closest thing to Brazilian food is Rubio's/Charo Chicken. . I was always hesitant to try this place because whenever I drive by, there is a line standing outside to get in -night club style. However, it was surprisingly tame when we showed up. Service was great, and my plate was tasty except the meat was a little on the dry side. I can fault myself for that because I would pretty much rather eat cardboard animal products over the risk of getting mad cow or whatever. . The dinner plates are enough for two people, and the menu is so varied it ranges from pastas to sandwiches to hamburgers to salads to main entrees. Someone could plausibly eat here every day for a year without ordering the same thing twice. Genius.
