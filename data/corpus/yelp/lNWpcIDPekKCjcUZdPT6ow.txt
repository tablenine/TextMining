My favorite place in the ATL for really good food. Always somewhere to park. In the evening the lights are low and someone playing the piano. I love the spinach and artichoke dip. I haven't had a main course I didn't like, but their salmon is the "best". And, they carry my most fav desert, the pecan apple cobbler. . . Sometimes I go there for lunch, just by myself. It is wonderful.
