If your in the mood for an old fashion kik a$$ burger this is your spot.. . They have 2 kinds of burgers:.  Hickory Burger Â (Smoked flavor and a sweet sauce) **I recommend this. Steak Burger (Comes with relish). . Great Ham and cheese sandwich (sliced as you order it). good tuna salad and egg salad as well.. . Dont 4get to save some room for their world class pies, if they have boysenberry cream or strawberry cream pie, grab it (they normally sell out early). . but in a nut shell, if you haven't tried it and are within 3,000 miles of Apple Pan, drop everything and get over there.
