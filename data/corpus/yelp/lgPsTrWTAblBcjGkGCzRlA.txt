Place is amazing. I love their fish soup. Extremely healthy and very delicious.. . Wouldn't recomment coming on weekend nights. Very loud and crowded. They have live entertainment. If that's your thing, then cool, but it's just too noisy for me.. . Otherwise, you aren't going to find the tastiest Thai food this side of the Valley.
