I read the reviews before I went and I was expecting the volume, so that was no surprise.  The lack of a wait was a surprise though--even though it appeared packed, the maitre'd found us a table right away, right near the window no less!  . . The menu was sooo inviting.  There were so many things that looked good, and they had a number of rare / "gourmet" sodas on it that actually excited me (shut up).  The food itself was a disappointment.  My companion ordered some kind of tomato basil soup that just tasted of tomato paste.  I had a chicken parmesan dish that they didn't see fit to include pasta with--isn't that a staple?  The chicken artichoke dish was delivered swimming in olive oil--a little pasta or rice in there to break it up would have been welcome.  Dessert was pretty yummy, so it left a nice taste in my mouth on the way out.. . I loved the decor (it is gorgeous inside), the service was helpful even if it took forever to get someone over, but the food was somewhat below average.  Some better chefs would bump this place up to a 4.
