Brrrrrrr. Our party was split in two with my half sitting next to a door that kept opening and letting a freezing draft come in, and the other half sittting directly under the ONLY working heater in the outside area. This made for a less than stellar dining experience. Our half was shivering in coats and sweaters the entire time while the other half was about to get heat strokes. Lesson learned: do not sit outside the main dining room!. . Anyways, the food was a-ok. I had the calamari (decent) and the chicken and spinach manicotti (pretty good). We were all satisfied with our food. The portions are huge so even if the menu is a bit expensive, you can definitely split dishes between two people. After visiting Maggiano's and Brio back to back, I'd have to give my vote to Brio though.
