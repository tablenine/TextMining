Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
How good is Fogo? It made me break my vegetarianism.  Even now I don't eat beef, but I get the occasional craving for some Fogo.. . First off, the staff is very accommodating.  I planned a surprise birthday party there, and they even went along on the joke when I arrived at the restaurant with my boyfriend.  Bonus points for that. Free dessert, too!. . The salad bar is orgasmic.  I'm a cheese freak, and I gorge myself on all the delicious exotic cheeses that pepper the salad bar selections.  Excellent waldorf salad.  I know you're probably thinking, "Salad bar? What is this place? Fresh Choice?" WRONG.  This is the fanciest schmanciest salad bar you'll ever lay your eyes on.. . Fillet Mignon is absolutely addictive. . . Pricey everything---pricey meal, pricey alcohol, pricey desserts...And it doesn't help they push dessert alcohol on you. (I'm a sucker for limoncello.) But if you're willing to splurge, it's worth every penny. Also, don't eat all day before you go. You'll thank me.
