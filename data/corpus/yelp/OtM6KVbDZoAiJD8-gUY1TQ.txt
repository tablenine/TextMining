Restaurant: Apres Diem
Category: French
I'm actually sitting in Apres Diem now.  This spot is it for me.  One of my favorite places to lounge, relax, and unwind.  The people who work here tend to have a more worldly feel of just letting you enjoy your time and company.  I always have to ask for my bill, which is a good thing, because it encourages socializing and doesn't give you that "hurry up and finish because I need your table" feeling.. . The darker decor, high tables, and comfy couches all have grabbed me and pulled me in.  Like Talib K says, it's a good mid afternoon spot.
