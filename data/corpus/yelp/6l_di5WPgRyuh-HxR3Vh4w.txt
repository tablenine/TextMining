This place is really good for what it is: a trendy sausage place in downtown. The sausages were decent, nothing amazing but nothing not worth trying. The fries on the other hand were excellent and so were the peculiar dipping sauces. The beer selection was phenomenal, especially if you enjoy imported dark beers. The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars is the long wait, the high prices, and the "I HAVE to take you to this place" kind of trendiness.. . Nice for an evening date if you don't mind waiting. A dinner for two will cost you around 35-40: grab a couple beers for your wait in line, a couple sausages, and a couple beers for dinner.
