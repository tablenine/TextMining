I went here for lunch with a work colleauge, and really liked this place.  The theme of the place is a weird combination of lounge and sports bar, but I think it works, espeically for Randoplh Street.  They have some great outdoor areas; we ate our lunch on the patio outside, since the roofdeck is only open in the evenings for drinks and appetizers.  The food was pretty darn good.  We started with beef nachos and they were awesome.  The nachos are served on a three-level platter (pico de gallo, sour cream, guacomole) which is a bit over-the-top, but I liked it!  We both had Kobe burgers with fries.  The portions were huge, but the quality was not sacrificed - the burgers were delicious!  The fries also came in a unique serving platter with two dipping sauces; ketchup and another mayonaise based dressing, which was actually quite tasty.  The food itself is a step above your typical bar food (e.g. better than Bar Louie) and offers an alternative to the pricey restaurants on Randolph Street.  The service does leave something to be desired; it wasn't horrible, but I was expecting a bit more.  For example, we had to ask to get drink refills.  The prices were acutally pretty reasonable; for one appetizer, two Kobe burgers and two drinks, it was $38.  Given the Randolph Street location, that's not bad, in my opinion.  Overall it was a good lunch, and I think I will definitely be back for happy hour or evening cocktails.  The roofdeck looks really cool, and I think it can be positioned as a less crowded alternative to the Roof at the Wit.  It would be a good spot to hit for drinks after dinner on Randolph Street.
