I think I might have been really hungry, which is probably why I think the food is better than it actually is.  There are so many yummy desserts here but the chocolate chip cookie is just the right mix of chewy and crispy.  YUM.  Also had the Salmon Stack.  The poached eggs were a little under cooked and the fruit didn't taste super fresh, but the potato pancakes and the smoked salmon were flavorful.   The only thing though, my plate was dirty, like it hadn't been washed properly or someone but their dirty finger on it or something so I tried to eat around it.  The bacon wasn't greasy but I got two GIANT pieces because they were each 4-5 pieces stuck together so they weren't all crispy. . . I would go back again but like the name of this rating "Meh, I've experienced better."
