The food is overpriced, but decent.  The hubs and I went for a group dinner and ordered the carnivorous dinner for two, which came with samosa appetizer, naan, rice, lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, and rice pudding for dessert.  The portions looked small when it first came out, but it was actually more than enough for the both of us.  We were sweatin' curry by the end of dinner.  Looking back, that dinner probably could have fed 3-4 of us.    . Anyway, the food was just ok, nothing to yelp about.  It was definitely overpriced.  We left paying $41 with tip.  The lunch buffet is probably better for the price, and you get more of a selection.
