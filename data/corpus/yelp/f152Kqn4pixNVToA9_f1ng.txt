Low on style, high on flavor this is one of the best Cuban places I've ever eaten at.  It's not much to look at but do not let that deter you.  The food is excellent, the staff is friendly, and the prices are cheap.. . I once saw Perry Farrell dining here with a lady friend so if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for you!
