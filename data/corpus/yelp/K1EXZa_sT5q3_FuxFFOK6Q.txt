Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Tender Greens kept me alive throughout grad school.  And by alive I mean generally delirious with waistband-snapping joy.. . Seriously, I can hardly express in words how much I love this place.  The food is awesome.  The menu is simple.  It's all prepared in front of you, and it's everything you want: meat, vegetables, soups, salads, desserts, wine.  The mashed potatoes are ridiculous.  The steak is divine.  And let's just say I would eat my left hand if it was covered in their ranch dressing.. . The prices are more than reasonable, the food is a visual delight, the scene is quaint, and the service is delightful.  Not to mention, everything is wildly fresh and procured by the restaurant with environmental responsibility in mind.  The only complaint I can think of is that their cutlery is some weird and twisty design that makes it nearly impossible to rest your fork or knife on the side of your plate.  A seriously damning detail, I know.  But I suppose the lesson is that your eating utensils shouldn't be given a rest anyway: this food demands to be eaten without pause!. . If only I still lived close by...
