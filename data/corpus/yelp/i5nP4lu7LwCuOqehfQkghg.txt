This review is for the food, not the magic.. . As a restaurant and for the price you pay, this is a sub standard place.   The lobster was frozen and had a mealy texture.   Not what you would expect for a $50 entree.  The seafood linguini was good but not worth $30.   The mixed grill of pork, rack of lamb, steak and sausage was good but again not worth the $40 entree charge.   A side order of mac and cheese was $7.  It was more like cheese flavored macaroni.   They should have used more cheese on the dish.  It turned out dry.. . And as you can guess the drinks are outrageous.  $2.75 for a coke.   Most bottles of wine approach $100.   Buy the wine only if you want to impress your party that you can spend lots of money.   . . The food is subsidizing the magic...which is all well and good if you understand the math here. This is on top of a $20 cover charge.  You can only get a main theater ticket if you eat here.   At these prices, they should hire a 5 star chef to manage the kitchen.   . . My advice.  Eat a light dinner before coming here...and order the minimum amount of food to get a theater ticket. . . Like the magic, the food is all show and no substance...(that is a compliment for a slight of hand magician)
