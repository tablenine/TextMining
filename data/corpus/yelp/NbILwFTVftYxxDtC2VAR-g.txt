Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Hands down, 5-star pizza at Mozza Pizzeria.. . The pizza crust is so thin and perfect!  My favorite is the pizza is that is referred to as the "meat lover's pizza."  I can't recall the name on the menu, but it contains sausage, and speck, and other meats that I can't seem to recall right now...welp, I believe that means it's time for another trip to Mozza.. . On my very first trip to Mozza I made the mistake over saying "Okay" to the proscuito and arugula pizza...I really hate arugula.  Luckily  it wasn't baked in so it was simple enough to remove it from my delicious bites of proscuitto/thin crust.. . Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.
