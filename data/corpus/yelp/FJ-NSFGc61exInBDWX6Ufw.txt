Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's Tacos is worth going to for the blended salsa alone. Others may say it's bland or watery. I think it's delicious and I like it not spicy. I almost always eat the hard tacos with shredded beef which honestly is average. The chips are a little thick but again they make my favorite salsa and give you a generous cup of it. There is usually a long line but with good service. Tito's has a small parking lot but I have never had a problem finding street parking nearby. I had a chicken tamale once. It was really good, moist and tasty. The beans are really smooth and creamy and need just a little salt but on my last trip yesterday I found out it's made with lard. Still it was very good and topped with a lot of shredded cheese. I've never had a burrito or enchilada because for me one beef taco, the generous amount of chips and salsa and a serving of beans always fills me up. Some people have complained about the price but a hard taco with cheese ($2.70) to me is reasonable, about the same as one carne asada or chicken taco from Baja Fresh. . I go to Tito's only a few times a year because of the lines and calories, but I look forward to my infrequent trips.
