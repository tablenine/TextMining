Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Sorry, I don't get it.. . Long lines, horribly mediocre food.  Why not go to Carney's on Sunset instead?  The hot dogs are better and there is no line.. . But I guess when you come from New York, a $1.50 "street meat, water dog" with no lines, is heaven.  Pinks is just nonsense.
