Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
3.5 stars.. . It was a beautiful day in Los Angeles--blue skies, warm breeze, not a cloud in the sky. We walked up to the front door and there was a bouncer. . . Come again...??. . Didn't realize that you have to be 21 to get in the front door, when it really is just like any other family restaurant. But i guess because you have to order food and drinks at the bar, making sure that everyone is of age at the door is the best way to go. . . The beer selection was great, I wish that I had a little more time to sit and enjoy the beautiful weather but the entire patio was full. We sat inside, but with the patio doors open, it seemed like we were outdoors. . . The bar had two dinky TVs not worthy of mentioning... so it was a little bit tough trying to watch the World Cup.. . Now I wasn't all the impressed with the sweet potato fries. The garlic aioli that came with it, however, is another story. Creamy without the overpowering garlic breath afterwards, it was a prefect match to the fries. . . For the burger, I'd give it 4 stars They have ONE burger and one burger only on the menu. Father's Office would not allow you to make modifications to it, but why fix something when it ain't broke? Everything about the burger was divine. The juicy patty, the toasted buns, the sauce... mmm... *wipe off drool*. . Over all, not a bad place to kick it with friends and grab lunch, but it wouldn't be my FIRST choice either.
