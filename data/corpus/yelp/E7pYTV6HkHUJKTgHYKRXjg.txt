This place is a garlic lover's dream.  The atmosphere is a little strange, but who's here for that?  We're here for garlic!  I had the surf and turf.  The prime rib, the crab, the mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach was all infused with garlic.  If you don't like garlic, avoid this place.  Otherwise, you'll be in heaven.
