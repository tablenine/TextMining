Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
As a DePaul student, I find the Pig to be an excellent spot to get together with friends both new and old. There have been random moments of conversation with my friends when someone will say, "I wanna go to the Bourgeois Pig. We should go!" and thus, plans are made. I especially love going there for their breakfast items like the Belgian Waffle Deluxe. The amount of different toppings you can add is mind-boggling, and yet I frequently resort to brown sugar and mixed berries. Their drinks are also delicious, especially the fresh fruit smoothies and vast selection of loose leaf teas. However, I suggest not going on a Saturday or Sunday as the cafe is quite small and many people frequent the space with study groups or for breakfast. The back room on the top floor is wonderful as well for the comfy, thrift store-esque couches and selection of books. A Lincoln Park must!
