With the exception of turkey bacon, I've never eaten bacon and deemed it substandard--I really enjoy bacon--but I think I will now. The bacon in my macaroni and cheese was honestly the best bacon I've ever had in my life. I don't know what they do to it, but I don't care. Nor did I care that it was a Friday during Lent and I was eating bacon. Jesus would approve of this bacon. Ohemeffgee. Yeah, so maybe I opened this review talking about bacon and only bacon, but I am the same girl who hosts "Baconfest" each St. Patrick's day. Whatever. . . Ok, onto the rest of the experience. It was pretty great. Nice atmosphere, laid back, but a little bit loud. The service was attentive without being pushy. We were told we'd have a 30-minute wait that in reality was about 5 minutes, so that's always a bonus. I had a great glass of malbec--they have a great beer and wine selection--and bf had a couple different beers that he enjoyed. The food that surrounded my bacon was a lovely macaroni and cheese, because I eat like a 5 year old. It was a little oily and not quite as creamy as I like macaroni and cheese, but remember the bacon? I would order it again. Bf had the bison burger and LOVED it. He said it was "cooked to perfection." I can definitely see us trying this place again soon.
