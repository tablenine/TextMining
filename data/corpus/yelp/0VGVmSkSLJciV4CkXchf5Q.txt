Their salad's nasty...  Worth a drive by every now and then.  If there's a lot of people standing outside, they're probably waiting for a table...  . . Keep driving.  Hit that spot on 6th, one block west of Western on the north side of the street.  Park Valet for $2, grab a table, ask your server for #1, #3, and a rib eye steak.  When the 29 year old kinda fly owner homeboy greets you, tell him, "Can we start of with 2 Hites?"  You order enough, he'll throw in a couple free ones for good measure...  Thanks Paul!
