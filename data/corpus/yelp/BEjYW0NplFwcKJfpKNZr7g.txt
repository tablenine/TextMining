Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Churrasco, the Gaucho way of roasting meats, is an important element of Brazilian culture. Of Brazil's churrascarias, the most famous is Fogo de Chao.  This restaurant has finally come to California and is better than ever.  Over a dozen cuts of beef, pork, and lamb that just keep coming untill you put up your signal for the gauchos to stop.  For desert the cachaca spiked quentao, resembling mulled wine, is a marvelous way to forget how stuffed you are.  I suggest fasting for 24 hours before coming here.  You'll not have to eat for 24 hours after as well.  Magical.
