Korean flavored tacos did not sound appetizing at first. But I decided to try it after reading reviews. I went to the Alibi room in Culver City. The bar was packed and it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food on a Friday night. I tried the trio of tacos, pork, chicken and beef. It was amazing. AMAZING. Try it. You will not be disappointed. The meat is tender. The salsa/ veggie mix Â compliments the meat so well. The sauce is perfect. And I think it was only $7. . . I heard the kimchee burrito is just as good. I'm trying that next time.
