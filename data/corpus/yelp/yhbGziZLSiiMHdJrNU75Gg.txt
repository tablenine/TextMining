I'm really leaning more toward 3.5, but 4 works. I'd have given it 4 in a heartbeat a few weeks back, but have found it hit or miss as far as food quality lately.. . Hit or miss or not, though, it's still better than most of it's phoponents (get it... pho opponents, phoponents! Yeah, I'm lame...). . The pho is good, the bo kho is great, and my beloved rice dishes are delicious 90% of the time. The other 10% they're dry. Boo.. . ... oh yea, and they have the best damned avacado &amp; tapioca smoothie! (aka "bubble tea" to most other white people ;)). . One thing to improve on: service. I get angry if my glass of water sits empty for long. VERY angry.
