Love this restaurant!!. . OK so it may not be the BEST italian food in the city, but I am telling you it well worth a visit. They have wonderful appetizers and good all around entrees. The atmosphere is soo cute and everyone who works there are great. . . We really love this place whether its with the whole fam, a double date, or a romantic meal. Its a fantastic place for any outing!!
