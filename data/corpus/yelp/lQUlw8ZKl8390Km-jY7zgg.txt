Category: American (New)
Started with the white shrimp flatbread, which was delicious. Split pea soup was great. Crispy flattened chicken was great as well. Good crowd, good beer as well. Parking is easy, reservations on OpenTable were easy to get.. . In addition, this place is good for old people. I went there with my parents and they approved. Also, Ford was there and outpunted his coverage. There.
