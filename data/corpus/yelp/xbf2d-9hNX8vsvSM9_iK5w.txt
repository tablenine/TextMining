"One beet salad, hold the beets, please." . . I haven't gathered the courage to place that order yet, given their extremely clear but disappointing NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO MODIFICATIONS policy, but I will...I will.....it's on my bucket list. ;-). . I know people don't come here for the salad, but I do because a) I don't eat red meat and b) so my boytoy can indulge in his favorite burger anywhere, and that's saying a lot coming from such a burger connoisseur --- one not so snobbish that he won't stick his nose up at an overcooked $16 Kobe Style Wagyu burger and not too proud to relish in a $6 guacamole bacon burger from Carl's.. . Back to that salad --- it's darn good, minus the beets. Delicious gorgonzola cheese, crunchy walnuts, and perfectly light dressing. I always complement it with a specialty drink that inevitably sucks. I think those specialty drinks are actually pretty authentic but perhaps only a true drinker could appreciate that --- because they're hideous. They come in ever-so-fashionable glasses, though, and one of them comes with the most delicious homemade (I assume) candied cherries. Mmmmmm.... . Anyway, so far I've stuck to the salad. One day I'll try the crabcakes - a special they always seem to have. Overall, I think this FO is an enjoyable experience. We haven't had to distract anyone with a mock-star-sighting (Hey! Is that Justin Guarini?!") to cut in front of any super long lines to get in, and we haven't had to challenge any other couples to a dance-off to get a table. Sounds like success to me.
