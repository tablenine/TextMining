Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I'd rate 60%. . So far it's my favorite branch of Roscoe's. . I always get the deal with 1/2 fried chicken and 2 waffles.. Food &amp; service here isn't bad, but I find it very inconsistent.. . Chicken breading is great here!. It not too heavy, not too greasy, not over seasoned.. I never get tired of it.. If you're lucky, the chicken will come out perfectly moist and served hot.. At other times, it's very dry (particularly the breast meat).. Doesn't help when the server brings it out cold either.. The dark meat usually comes out more moist &amp; appetizing.. If $$$ was no issue, I'd order all chicken thighs &amp; lots of waffles.. . Gravy isn't bad. Â . I prefer it on the side, as its a bit heavy &amp; salty.. . Dessert just sucks.. Think the only option (that I was aware of) was mediocre sweet potato pie.. I couldn't even have it heated &amp; served with ice cream.. . Some servers are more attentive than others, although it's never been offensively inept.. Value is decent but not great.. $15-$16 for 1/2 chicken &amp; 2 waffles in a cafeteria setting is a bit pricey imo.. . Parking &amp; wait times aren't bad as long as you avoid the Sunday brunch hours.. . Still, it's a fairly solid fried chicken spot that I don't mind going to once in a while.. Will return with reserved enthusiasm.
