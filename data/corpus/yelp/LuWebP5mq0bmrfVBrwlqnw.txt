Yum yum yum.. . Grilled artichoke here .... (drumroll) .... puts the one at Joans on Third to SHAME. Which is a bold, bold statement considering Joans is maybe the best thing to happen to my stomach ... ever.. . Vibe is what you'd expect from the CC mall ... corporate and somewhat flashy. A little loud, especially during lunch, but not uncommon for a 'steakhouse' (with sushi??) vibe. . . Ordered the spicy salmon roll salad - delicious. Service was prompt and friendly, but def get a lunch reservation, as every exec in the greater Century City area seems to dig it, too.
