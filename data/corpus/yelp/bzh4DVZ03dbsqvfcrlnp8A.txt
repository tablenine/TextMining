I could totally live here! This place is beautiful, the service is great, and the food... well, FANTASTIC!!! I had the Diver Sea Scallops with Chipotle Creamed Corn and Pesto Fried Rice for $23 MMMMMMMM, yummy. TOTALLY WORTH IT! My favorite dessert of all time is Creme Brulee, and what do you know, they had it! What a lucky girl I am. LOVE IT!!!
