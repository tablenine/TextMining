I have been here several times and I am never disappointed.  I always call and ask to sit in Dracula's Grotto.  Even though they normally will not reserve tables in a specific room, I am always able to sit in the Grotto.  Everyone I bring here loves both the ambiance and the food.  It is normally really loud and quite crowded but sitting in the Grotto makes you forget all of this.  The Grotto is set up like an old Gothic wine cellar and it is hilarious.  Try and go with friends who have similar food preferences so that you can share with them.  Make sure you try the garlic fries........delicious!
