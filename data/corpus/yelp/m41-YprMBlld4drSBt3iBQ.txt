Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
I've only been to Chow Baby once, not because i didn't like it but because for now its really out of my way. The time i went i was a little nervous. This odd make-your-own stir fry concept was a bit foreign to me. It was a good thing that i went with a couple of veterans because i would have been a little lost.. . Once you figure out how things work you can really make some amazing combinations though. The veggies are fresh and crispy, the meats are great but what really makes it are the sauces. I tried several combinations of veggies, meats, and sauce and was never let down.. . The only bad part about this place is how buys it gets. It can be super hard to get in on the weekends if you don't go early. I hear lunch isn't as bad. I guess this is a good problem to have though.
