I was excited about trying this place because I heard there is an extensive vegetarian menu, which is true, but my tofu dish was a little uninspired.  And although the decor is well reviewed by others, I couldn't help but be reminded of the cheesecake factory.  Anybody else feeling me on this??  Drinks and service were very good though, and my date loved his sea bass dish.  I will be back to give it another try.
