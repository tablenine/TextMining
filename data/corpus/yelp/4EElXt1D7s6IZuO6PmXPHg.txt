Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
I will never understand El Cid's popularity. Sure, the back deck is nice, but there are plenty of bars/restaurants with comparable outdoor space and the courtyard simply doesn't justify the sub par food. Seriously sub par. I love Mexican food and find El Cid borderline offensive. Perhaps it's just that it's been Midwesternized (i.e., is pretty bland). I just don't get it, though. Even the salsa lacks flavor. And it's definitely pricier than other local Mexican eateries, which is just wrong. . . Pretty on the outside, sure, but totally mediocre.
