I'm a new comer to Smoke Daddy's but I thought it was awesome! The brisket sandwich rocks as do the fries! I looooove their fries! The cornbread IS usually a bit dry....its similar to Heaven on Seven's cornbread in the sense that it has some jalepeno's in it.......but Heaven on Seven's cornbread is off the hook! I haven't had anything else, but I have heard that the ribs are awesome too.
