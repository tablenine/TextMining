Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  I've been going for 20 years and it never disappoints...  The atmosphere is laid back and charming, the wine is great, the back patio is a hidden gem in the city, the Roignant family always make you feel at home.  I have fantasies about the spinach creme crepe... and the ratatouille crepe made with goat cheese... even their house salad is delicious.   I'm just as comfortable on a date or out with friends at La Creperie as I am taking my 3 year old daughter.  Literally an any occasion restaurant...  Plus, when Clark street is a mob scene, you can always park across the street in the Century Garage!!  I love this place so much it makes me want to weep.
