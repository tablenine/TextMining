Best parts about this restaurant = warm towelettes for your hands at the beginning of the meal and the chocolate covered fortune cookies at the end. The hot + sour soup is better than average and my tofu + broccoli dish was tasty. (Disclaimer: We waited almost an hour for a table and had 2 bottles of wine as a group, so anything would have been tasty by the time we received our food. It was our fault for the wait -- ate with a group of 8.). . The music, especially in the bathrooms, probably broke government standards for acceptable volume levels. That's my only qualm.
