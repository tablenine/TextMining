I think the whole thing about finding the Kogi Truck is over rated and waiting forever for food is not worth it.  I heard there's an actual location to eat at a table rather than on a sidewalk.  . . The burritos and tacos are the best.  After going there twice, I realized the food only taste good because you wait so long that you are hungry.  . . Oh, watch out if you get there too late.  If there is still a line - they'll cut you off even though there are people waiting to order still.. . There's a $10 max limit to ordering food.  So don't think you can order food for a family of 2.  I wanted to spend $10 on just myself.
