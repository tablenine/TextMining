Category: Asian Fusion
I can't see my mr. happy or my toes anymore thanks to my new buddha belly. HELP ME!. . I've fallended and I can't get up!. . OY!. . The food is too delish for its own good as the masses will soon descend transforming this quiet strip mall area into another social scene of foodsters(we had the LTH hit squad in attendance last night), lines will soon be down the block which isn't as bad as hot dougs, because this is BYOB and so I suggest a hard top cooler to bring and allow for impromptu sidewalk seating.. . Parking lot available, but it will get crowded fast between customers and laundromat (right next door) tumblers, so park on the street and walk it so you have something to do after you eat the WHOLE menu as we did last night. Everything was spot on to die for including awesome service(water refills and bussing were friendly and attentive). . If you're going anytime soon, PM me and take me with!. . Also, be warned the lock on the unisex one hole restroom doesn't really do its job, so bring a friend to play door monitor if you plan on doing more than a standing #1.. . Yvonne and Bill are genius with a heart and this place has just raised property values in the LS another good 13 points.. . Best idea is to phone your orders in("yes I would like one of everything...") and pick up to go and eat it at home naked to let your belly urbanize.
