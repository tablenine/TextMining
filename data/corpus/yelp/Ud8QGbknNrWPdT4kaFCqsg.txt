this place is excellent for vegetarians (which i am ). . OPEN 24 HOURS. . sloppy veggie joe . thomas burger (veggie) Â with white cheddar and shrooms. homes fries are a must !!. . don't go in there asking what quinoa is !!. read up on that shit before you go ... i am sure they get tired of explaining what it is ..... . fresh juices and smoothies made there. . a giant selection of teas. . breakfast all day .... OPEN 24 HOURS. . James is my favorite waiter ... Caesar and his brother are super nice .... The girls come and go .. some of them get prego and some become strippers or waitresses in strip clubs... but nevertheless there are always some cute ones around :-). . The OUTSIDE isn't that impressive but don't be fooled the food is great ..... . i eat there A LOT !!!!!
