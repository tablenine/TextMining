Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Food - 4/5. Service - 4/5. Price - 3/5. Atmosphere - 4/5. . Best Dish: Steak Sandwich (with mashed potatoes). . The salads at Tender Greens are amazing; however, the steak is just simply too good to pass on. And when you add the mashed potatoes to the equation, it is the perfect combination. It may get a little hectic during dinner hours so be prepared.
