Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
All i know is this place is classically classic. From the rolling prime rib cart to the waitresses down home style and retro outfits this place is steak lover heaven. I got it Lawry's way with a stuffed baked patatoe and some red wine at the suggestions of the waitress and I didn't want to leave.
