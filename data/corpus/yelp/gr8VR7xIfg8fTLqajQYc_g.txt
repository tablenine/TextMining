This is the best place for authentic Mexican. Â I love it for the food, and the owners are a husband/wife team (could you work with your spouse?) -- their kids are so cute too. Try the tilapia taco appetizer (my favorite) or the mole (my husbands favorite). They also have a great breakfast on the weekends (huevos rancheros) yum. I'm getting a craving to eat there already!
