Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I was visiting from Toronto and my aunt insisted she must take me to Pizzeria Mozza and I am so glad she did.  It was amazing.  We did not have a reservation and had to wait about 30 minutes for seats at the bar.  It was so worth the wait.   I had the margherita pizza and swapped the mozzarella for buffalo mozzarella. It was a thing of beauty!  The wine list is diverse and if you aren't sure of which wine to select, trust the sommelier/server with the goatee and glasses.   As I considered the dessert menu, the stranger to my right leaned over and whispered, "Go with the butterscotch, you won't be sorry."  Butterscotch Buddino it is then!  It was the perfect ending to my best meal in LA on this particular trip.   I never enjoyed pudding as a kid, but this delightful butterscotch pudding, topped with caramel and a wee touch of sea salt, takes pudding to a whole new level. Don't miss out!
