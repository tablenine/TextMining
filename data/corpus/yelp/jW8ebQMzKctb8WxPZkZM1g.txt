Excellent spot for an interesting selection of Asian inspired sandwichs, soups and sides.  I loved the Asian Meatball sandwich, a warm and crisp pita stuffed full of moist and favorful meatballs, and light somen noodles.  The side of brussel sprouts with chorizo was fantastic.   Efficent and friendly service.. . I will definitely going back to try some of other menu selections.
