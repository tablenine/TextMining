Please note- I have only been to Bin on Tuesdays.  But lots of Tuesdays.. . If you want a fatty burger with juiciness that soaks into the bun and flavor that slaps you in the face and says "TAKE ANOTHER BITE NOW!" and you are really poor- yes you can have it all!!. . I am a huge fan of the burger.  I have had most of the area burger specials and this is by far the best.. . I've enjoyed all of the wines that I've had- I like the sexy reds flight the best.. . The service is fine- I haven't had anyone who has really proved themselves to be an expert in wines or cheeses but I also don't really go for that.  I go for a $5 burger.
