I went here last night for a friends b-day dinner. It was great! Despite all the mixed reviews I read I thought it was good, service was a little confusing due to a language barrier. The food was great, everything we had tasted fresh. I opted for an entree, Shrimp Rama, it was good, but a little soupy w/ the peanut sauce. I had a taste of the GIGANTIC dragon roll, which was delish! Will definitely be back!
