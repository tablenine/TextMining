Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
As I strolled Culver City with a hansom LA local, looked and realized how different San Francisco.  We were on an excursion for a good brunch place with a patio, I stumbled over 3 other restaurants that did not meet my expectations, mainly they did not have the correct bar selection, Bloody Mary's or potatoes.  Then I found a cute little Italian cafe with a visible full bar from across the street, my kind of place.  The menu was Great!  I could not make up my mind but ended on the open faced Italian sausage omelet.   Which was sensational, the prices were great, the portions just the right size and a great patio! . . They need a little help with their bloody Mary's but I think maybe its an unusual drink in the area?!?!? Odd but Ill live, I got what I needed and was mighty satisfied.  . . Service was great and everyone was very helpful and nice.  I would go again, that is if I am ever in the Culver City neighborhood =)
