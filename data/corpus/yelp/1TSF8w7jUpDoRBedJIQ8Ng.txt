What  a place.  A true no-frills dining experience.  Manny's is all about great food and big portions.  I came in hungry then left and didn't eat for 24 hours.  My only regret/mistake--the matzo ball soup WITH noodles.  I'd skip the noodles next time and just go with straight up Matzo + broth.. . The other great aspect of Manny's is the clientele.  I was there with my good friend and his family (W+s+d) and we were probably a sight on our own.  My friend's son was bound and determined to get every dish and utensil from the table to the floor.  My friend looked like a plate spinner the way he'd catch one plate and get it back to the table just to dive for a mug.  The point of this is nobody even noticed us.  The mix of family's, blue collar 9 to 5ers and all the people who don't fit in to any single category allowed us to blend in and not feel like we were disturbing or disturbing anyone.  . . Next time I'm getting my Reuben on.  If it tastes 10% as good as it looked I won't be disappointed!!  . . I'll definitely be back and definitely highly recommend.
