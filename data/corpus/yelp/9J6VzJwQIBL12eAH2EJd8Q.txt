Friends of mine took me there for my early birthday on Saturday night.  Both bar and restaurant were jam packed and I know why-this place is just wonderful!  . . While we were waiting for our reservation, we had some drinks at the patio.  I had my Mojito and it was pretty good.  I prefer to have a little bit more mint, though.. . All the food we ordered-beef tartare, salumi &amp; charcuterie, salad, monk fish, pork chop, steak, pasta, etc., I mean, EVERYTHING (well, at least what we ordered) was absolutely wonderful!. They have pretty good selections of wine, too.. . Their service was quick and friendly enough for 7 group of people, I think.. . Pretty pricy for the daily visit, but great for the date, birthday or some other special occasion.
