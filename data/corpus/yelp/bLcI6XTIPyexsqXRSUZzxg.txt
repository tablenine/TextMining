Eh. Not so much. . I've been here a few times over the past few years. Most recently, last week. Â the food is pretty good, although it's not what it used to be. The main issue is that the service is hit or miss. On the day I was there last week, the host was a complete dolt. I was waiting for a friend and he asked if I had been helped, which I had. After that he ignored me and seemed to be a little burdened when I eventually did need help. Apparently it interrupted his self-admiration time. That being said, the waiter that we ended up with was great (and cute). He pretty much saved the day. Drop in if you're in the neighborhood. Wouldn't make a long drive for it, though.
