I saw this in Atlanta Food Magazine and I was not let down. I give it 5 stars, a notch above the many 4 stars, coming from California, we found it a step above many other places in the area. . . The Queso was GREAT, Enchiladas were Yummy and Mojitos were to perfection. It was a little weird to find, and if you go in the summer, eat indoors, tons of mesquitos outside that will eat you alive. . . The wait staff was great, food was served up hot, had tequitos, in a combination plate. Was glad to find a great place in Atlanta to get some good Mexican food!
