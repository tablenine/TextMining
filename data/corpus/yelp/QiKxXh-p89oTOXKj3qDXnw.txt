Restaurant: Market
Category: American (New)
Market is a restaurant that minors in everything and does not major in anything.  The restaurant offers a little bit of everything; a rooftop lounge that offers a beautiful view of the city, a bar, and an indoor/outdoor eatery.  The food and deserts we had were very good but I thought the beverage selection was slim (both in the eatery section and the rooftop lounge).  Market is attracting a really nice crowd right now but I did see some questionable clientele stroll in there.
