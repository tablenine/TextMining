I got to try this place but only because Fraiche wasn't open for dinner on Monday. So basically, this was Plan B. . . It was kinda chilly and we had to sit outside since we didn't have reservations. The nice thing was our waiter gave us blankets. I thought that was a nice gesture. We got the menu and it was a little more spendy pants than I would have liked. Flatbread for $14? See, I would have gladly spent $14 on a beef tartare appetizer. But flatbread?? We were starving so we did decide to order the Jamon Serrano Flatbread. It wasn't bad but more $8 flatbread than anything. I decided to order the trout and my friend got the fried chicken breast. . . The entrees were about $22. I enjoyed my trout. It was a whole trout with skin still on but perfectly filleted. It was tender and lightly breaded and came with a side of greens (I think it was some exotic asparagus but looked more like brocollini. I was trying to eat healthy and thought I could do so by ordering fish but it came in a creamy sauce so that didn't work out so well. My friend's chicken was nice as well and came with a side of black eyed peas, corn and mashed potatoes. . . I think if the prices weren't so high I would actually think about coming back to this place. But I honestly think it's overpriced for what it offers.
