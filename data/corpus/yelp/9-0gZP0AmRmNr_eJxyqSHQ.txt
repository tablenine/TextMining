What more can be said about this place?  It is not all things mexican - it is, primarily, for tacos and enchiladas, but also boasts some great side dishes.  I love the cheese enchiladas with pork green chili sauce and the veggie taco.  My husband cannot go without getting at least one fish taco. (He's addicted) The turnip greens are amazing, and we often make them at home, thanks to Eddie publishing the recipe in the AJC.. . Subscribe to their weekly specials update via their website, and when you see the Chimichangas as the blue plate for lunch, make sure to stop in and order it.  They're my absolute favorite, and are only offered once a month or so.. . There are times when the line is not so long, but I'm kind of afraid to reveal them.  Sorry!
