Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Working on Third Street, I have a lot of choices for lunch but when I can't come up with a decision I always settle on Joan's because of convenience and dependability. Yes, the food is pricey but some things are worth it like the venetian coppa salame and the prosciutto with roasted peppers and mozzarella. The ham and brie is alright but I don't care too much for the mustard, the pressed chicken, bacon and brie was a bit of a disappointment; the muffuletta is decent, and chicken salad can be a hit-or-miss. The cupcakes are seriously overrated, dry and not that flavorful. I've never actually sat and ate there just because it's always so hectic but I have seen some celebrities (Cameron Diaz), almost-celebrities (Miss Jay Alexander from ANTM), and a celebutard (Paris Hilton). To the person who said they saw Gary Oldman, I envy you.
