i love it. from their cobb salads (AWESOME) to their blue velvet cake (it will turn your shit blue for about 2 days minimum) ~ and even their soups!. . I LOVE MILK. funnily, I've never gotten their milk. . . $$ it's not your fast food store... it looks like a small sitdown... but boutique cafe style~
