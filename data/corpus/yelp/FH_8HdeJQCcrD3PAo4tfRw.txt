What a great way to spend an afternoon!  Magically, we both had Monday off and decided to go out for lunch.  We chose this place based on the reviews and the comments that they have a huge beer selection.  Since I drove, I chose to have a root beer (which was wonderful!).  We each ordered a sandwhich...I had a Roast Beef which was good.  The real story here though was the Grilled Corned Beef, which was ordered by my Boyfriend (I snuck a bite for myself).  OMG.  It was so delicious.  I would go back just to have a whole one to myself.  My boyfriend tried the Victoria Prima Pilsner and Mama's Little Yella Pils.  Mama's was a winner!  We finished our lunch with soft pretzels...wow.  Another reason to go back. The service was fast, and super nice.  Another great thing to add on: great prices.  2 beers, a rootbeer, 2 sandwiches AND pretzels for $32 before tip.
