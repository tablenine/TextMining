I have been coming to this place my whole life. The great thing about it is it never changes. Was in the area for lunch yesterday and slid into the last seat at the bar. . . I ordered the usual: Hickory burger w/ cheese, &amp; a root beer. Didnt have room for fries but the guy behind the counter looked at me and smirked because everyone around me had fries and there I was,  burgerless, all alone fiddling with my rootbeer.   I guess he felt bad for me so he gave me a few fries,it made me smile,. . Then came my timeless burger, same as I remember only better cuz its been a while. Heres how it hits your mouth in chronological order, Crunch of toasted bun, Zingy sweetness of hickory sauce, Sharp Cheddar, Juicy patty,  Crisp mound of iceberg lettuce, Salty sliced pickles, &amp; to round it out mayo. It was blissful.... I couldn't  fit any pie after scarfing my burger but It is a must a la mode if you've never had it. This is the kind of place you miss while traveling...makes me feel like im home :)
