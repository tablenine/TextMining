Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
Fraiche would get a much higher review if it weren 't for the surly service. Our waiter struggled to please us because he had been put in an awkward position by the kitchen fascists who had decided you order once and that's it (ie., you can't order some appetizers, enjoy them, then decide based on that what you might like to order next). I hear a few restaurants are doing this to keep the patrons moving. It put a damper on the evening. The food here is quite good, and although a friend of mine insists if the food is good people will pardon the rude service, I think that only goes so far. For a special outing where you plan to drop $300 you don't want to be made to feel like the staff's first thought is, "How fast can we get them out of here to seat another party?". . I had lunch here about a month earlier and it was a much more pleasant experience.. . I'm updating my review today because I had an excellent lunch at Fraiche last week - and the service has dramatically improved. The food is terrific still!
