Restaurant: Little Five Corner Tavern
Category: Bars
This is my failsafe, 100%-guaranteed shoe-in restaurant pick any time I'm in L5P and hungry. I've never waited for a table, I've never been dissatisfied with the food, and I've never felt neglected by the waitstaff (and in L5P, this point is HUGE.). . Lots of beers. Lots.. . The Asian Tuna Burger is amazing. There, I said it. It's fucking amazing. Kiss my ass and bark my hole, use my tool as a walking pole. The Asian Tuna Burger at Corner Tavern is all of $7 and amazing.. . Eat it. Now we're in business, ladies &amp; gents.
