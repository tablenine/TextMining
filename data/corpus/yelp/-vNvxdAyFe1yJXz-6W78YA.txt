First, I am surprised by the reviews.  I love this place and everyone that I have taken here has loved the food and the service.  The food is great and we like the service.  . . If you are going on a Friday or Saturday night, you will most likely have to wait.  The seating is "lunch hall" style.  You share with others...  I have never had a bad experience with the seating.  Its BYOB, which is great if your looking to save a little cash.. . The food is excellent.  The dumplings are great!  When I first started going here I tried to always get something different.  Since I have become a regular, I stick to my favorite, Lamb and Brandy Dumplings and Asian Egg Noodles... Good serving size, spicy and not over priced!. . Great place to bring your friends if your looking for a different type of setting and somewhere reasonably priced (BYOB), then you need to try this place.  Good Luck!
