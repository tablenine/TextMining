Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Disclaimer: My review is based on my visit there over a year ago.. . Mmmmmm nothing beats a nice juicy dumpling. This place originated in Taiwan and I'm glad that it is in the US. Sadly my chance to eat at the location in Taiwan was thwarted because the place is apparently massively busy ALL day long. Crowds of people just waiting all the time.. . I have heard from others that the original location (in Taiwan) is definitely better, but these dumplings were pretty damn good! My way of eating them was to lift them gently with the chopsticks (careful otherwise it will break and you'll lose all of the juicy deliciousness inside) and put it on a spoon. Then just spoon a little bit of sauce over it.. . Even though these things are hot (temperature) as hell and you'll probably burn your mouth eating them, they taste great!. . It is definitely on my radar whenever I visit the LA area.
