At first I wasn't sure what to expect, well, ok, I expected something awesome but was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the ambiance is nice and the service was great. We ordered a couple of things off the mozzarella bar part of the menu... Pretty yummy on 2 out of 3... I was pretty disappointed at the main attraction, in fact we had to send it back because it was way too salty. The bar was well stocked and they don't carry the usual variety of alcohol, considering I'm a straight up Jack neat kinda fella, they didn't have that. The bartender did offer me some alternatives, then I considered a Heineken, that too they do not carry, I ended up with a beer that was pretty good however I do not recall what it was, just ask for a Heineken and they'll say we don't have that and say what's the closest thing you have to that. The dirty gin martini with a twist was very good! The first time I ordered the drink they brought out the twist on a little platter, I made a remark to the server saying, hmmm... So this is a serve yourself bar? In a very light hearted joking manner even laughing, needless to say, my second go at the drink came with the twist already in my drink! I thought that was pretty funny! . . Anyways, nice place, nice ambiance, but the reviews I've read pretty much say the same, food was too salty for their taste including my own. . . You will notice my review is mainly about the bar and not the food, I wasn't overly impressed considering this is an Iron Chef restaurant. Perhaps my expectations were high, but for what you pay for and to take the time and have dinner there, I don't see why you're expectations shouldn't be at their highest. . . Don't know if I will be going back yet or not.
