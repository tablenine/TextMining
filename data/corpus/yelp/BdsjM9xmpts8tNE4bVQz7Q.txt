Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
This Cheesecake factory could not be located in a better place. And the decor and service at this restaurant are top notch as well. BUT the wait times are seriously insane. It gets suuuper crowded on the weekends and you can definitely count on getting a long wait. But besides that, this location is top notch and, of course, you cannot leave here without having some dessert!
