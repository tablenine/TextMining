NUMBER 19~~~!!!! (pastrami, cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on rye).. . This is by far the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. I heard the brisket dip and corned beef sandwich was really good too. . . But damn Gina~!! This pastrami sandwich was off the hizzo. I must go back. . . If you want the hours and prices of this place...read everyone else's reviews. Just know that #19 is frackin' good and I emphasized it~!!
