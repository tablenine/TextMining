Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
I LOVE Holy Taco.  We come here a lot because it is A) delish, B) close to home, C) great staff, D) MARGARITAS...arepas, queso and guac are awesome.  I love both the vegetarian and chicken quesadillas, and the shrimp taco.   And the patio in the spring/summer is fantastic.  Highly recommend!
