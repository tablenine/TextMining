hype hype hype . . booo.  snobby waiters, trendy atmosphere, boring food.. . forced valet parking, a line out the door for noisy noisy dining.  we had to scream to hear each other.   i got the duck, and wanted to send it back, but opted to rush home and pretend i never went.. . Atlanta, why do you get tricked by places like this?  There are so many quality places for less money.
