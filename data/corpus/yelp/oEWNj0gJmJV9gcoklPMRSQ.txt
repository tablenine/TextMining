Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
I had a lovely dinner at May Street Market over the weekend with great company. We walked in on Friday night at around 7:15ish, and the restaurant was pretty empty... we were seated at a corner table by the window. It was the best table in the restaurant imo. . . The restaurant itself is warm, cozy and kind of rustic looking. The bench by the window is super comfortable, as there are several accent pillows to make you feel like you are sitting in a bed of clouds. . . So we started out with cocktails... my buddy had a Manhattan and I had a glass of Chardonnay. Everything was fantastic so far. . . I LOVE the bread service here. The loaf came out warm, with a hard and chewy exterior and softness inside. Try it with some truffle spread or a their salted butter for a delicious treat. . . We moved on to their Tuna Tartare... one of my favorite dishes ever. If it's on the menu, I will always order this dish, and May Street did not disappoint. A bed of diced tuna topped a spread of tuna carpaccio, greens, a drizzle of something amazing and tart... it was probably the high point of the meal.. . For the main course, I had their Red Snapper special. It was presented on top of spring peas, snow peas and other vegetables, and was just ok. At first I thought the fish was over cooked, but it got Â better as I worked on it a little. I have to admit, it was kind of lacking in flavor... how disappointing, right? . . My friend had the braised short ribs.... and it was also disappointing. It was over cooked and a bit dry. Perhaps it was the cut of meat? Not sure.. . Service, however, was outstanding. . . I will likely be back to try the rest of the menu and the tartare of course.
