I can't seem to understand why I've never been here before!  Cute restaurant that I've already suggested to two friends.  I had the chicken &amp; brie sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was magnificent!!  The way the flavors from the fries and the sandwich mixed together in your mouth...simply can't be put into words!. . will definitely be back!!! (with friends!)
