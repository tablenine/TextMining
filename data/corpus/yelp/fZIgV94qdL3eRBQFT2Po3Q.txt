Took my dad here for a birthday dinner and even though I'm not for fusion-whatnot cuisine, this place was really nice. The food had a nice twist between Thai, Chinese and even a hint of Indian which made for an excellent Me-Ga-Thi (stir fry chicken with noodles). I swirled it around to find they had added fresh coconut to the mixture which was a pleasant surprise. This place is known for it's whole catfish and I could definitely see why! It's literally like a "catfish steak" and my guest has not stopped talking about it for days. Finished the meal with the Coconut Banana Cream pie...filling was excellent but the round crust was a little too thick and quite dry. Seems like a nice place to go for a first date or if you are looking for something a little different, was happy to finally check out a place in the Fulton Market area and would like to keep that up!
