This is a 5 star review based solely on the #19 pastrami sandwich. I've been to all the places I'm suppose to go to for pastrami in LA and in NY. The #19 pastrami on rye, with coleslaw, Russian dressing, and swiss cheese is the near perfect food. . . A study in textures and flavors. The bread is soft and crisp at the edges, the pastrami has the perfect amount of spice, saltiness, and a good ratio of lean to fat. The coleslaw and Russian dressing balance out the richness of the pastrami, and the swiss adds a little good cheese funkiness and creaminess.. . The matzo ball soup is also really tasty. Â Something nice and clean.
