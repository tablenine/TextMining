I hate to say it, but I was really disappointed. Â . . My salad was not very good, my deep dish pizza wasn't very good... too many whole tomatoes and not really a sauce.. . Just very blah compared to other Chicago deep dish venues.. . The main dining room lacks charm and is basically a low-ceiling, no window room, nothing special.. . With so many other pizza places in this city, I'd opt for an alternate spot.
