Best sandwich I've ever had. I don't think I'll ever eat pastrami anywhere else again, there's just no point. I've also tried their corned beef, which is good as well. I love the bread, soft with a hard crust. Enjoying your sandwich with creme soda is the way to go. . Usually I go to here around 2pm for lunch on weekdays. It's a good time, not too crowded, service is always good. . . It is very pricey. $17.00 for a sandwich, add a drink, maybe a side, add tip, and you're looking at $20-$30 per person.
