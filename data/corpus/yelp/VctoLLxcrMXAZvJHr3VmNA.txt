Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Well the little lady was slightly, if not completely, hesistant to go to Roscoe's on account of the security guards in the parking lot and the guy selling Tu-Pac and Black Jesus t-shirts in front of the door.. . But once I coaxed her in I was able to get her to stay seated and complete a meal with me.  And what a meal it was. The Carol C. was as succulent as the menu said.  I pulled off pieces of that hot and greezy fried skin and you KNOW I DIPPED THAT BITCH.  The waffle was delicious; warm and soft. Not cold and stale.  Little lady ordered herrsself a buckwheat waffle, although slightly apprehensive on account of the Lil' Rascals character being of the same name and all.  But my baby loves soba ... sobeit.. . And while I am partial to Crystal's, they had the good ole' Louisiana Hot Sauce brand on the table, which I too love, and once I poured it all over my candy [sic] yams I felt like I was back at Powell's on Hayes once again.  . . I will most certainly return -- although I have to wonder if there are better chicken and waffles houses up in herre.
