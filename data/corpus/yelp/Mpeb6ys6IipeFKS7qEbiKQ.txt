Well, the word is definitely out (hello, NY magazine) and today when I went at 3pm there was a line out the door, a small "crowd" inside, and a few people waiting for their sandwiches out the front door. The girl at the register seemed slightly stressed (although friendly) and the people waiting were generally in good spirits as they waited about 15 minutes for their porky goodness (though I heard many wondering why they couldn't take names or hand out numbers to avoid order confusion with so many people waiting).. . I ordered my porchetta sandwich to stay and managed to snag one of the six seats at the counter (and one of the last few sandwiches before the bread ran out). The pork was juicy and flavorful and before long I was licking my fingers. Definitely worth the wait. I would have ordered some of the sides to try but with the crowd this afternoon I imagined I would be eating my sandwich standing up--not very conducive to eating beans or potatoes. Next time.. . The place sort of reminded me of Abraco just a block away on seventh as in it was about the same size (minuscule) Â and equally packed. In fact, after my sandwich I headed over there for a perfect espresso to top my perfect sandwich.
