The wife and I had a late (8:45pm) dinner here on a Thursday night on a visit from Chicago.  We were jonesing for some good sushi on our last night here and were NOT DISAPPOINTED!. . The place was pretty crowded, but no wait at that hour (kitchen reportedly closes at 9:30 p.m., but I find that hard to believe as they were still making stuff for folks while we were there.)  We got two seats at the sushi bar and couldn't have been happier there -- min. 4 orders, which we had no problem filling. We had a couple of the Sake sashimi orders.  Hamachi, Kampachi, and Fatty Tuna sushi.  A spicy scallop hand roll (not on the sushi bar menu, but didn't faze the chef one iota).  And, a spcy tuna roll.  Everything was fantastic.. . All that and a bottle ($25) of an extremely good and mellow Gingo sake, we we tabbed out at about $100.. . All in all, fantastic.. . Arigato Godzaimas!
