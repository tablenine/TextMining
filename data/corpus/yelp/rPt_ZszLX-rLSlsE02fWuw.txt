Let me just start off by saying that I was never a fan of french dip sandwiches (notice the 'was').  I never enjoyed the dry sandwich that I had to dip into the au-jus and was left with eating the soggy, just soaked sandwich.  BUT that all changed when I came here.. . I wasn't excited at all coming to this place, even though I've heard about them countless of times, and  we definitely had to try it since it was on The Boyfriend's and I's list of restaurants to try while we were in SoCal.  We went into the place, and found a lot of people actually there.  The place was really roomy and had a lot of picnic tables, so you were able to find a seat pretty quickly.  . . We ordered the beef french dip along with a side of macaroni salad and potato salad.  At first, I thought we were missing the juice for our sandwich, but they actually dip the bread for us already.   I looked at it, and thought I was just going to have a 'Meh' type of reaction, but it was surprisingly really delicious.  The bread wasn't so soggy, the outside of it had a nice dutch roll crunch to it, and the beef itself was just soooooo good!!  Usually, the meat on these would be tasteless and dry, but the one here was very juicy and tasty!  I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed their french dip; it automatically made me a fan french of dip sandwiches.
