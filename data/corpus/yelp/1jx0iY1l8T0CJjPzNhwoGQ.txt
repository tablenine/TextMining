Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Close to home, but far from perfect, Tito's Taco's always has a line in front of it for reasons unknown to me.  While it isn't bad, if time is money, then you may want to start saving by avoiding this stand.  Advice is to park around the corner or across the street on Washington and walk over - the small parking lot is a little hectic when it's busy.. . I've only tried the taco's, and they've always been pretty good - everything's freshly made to order and hot, but I guess I was just expecting taco's from heaven with the raves I had heard from other people.  While they were good, they weren't heavenly so this place ranks just a-ok to me.
