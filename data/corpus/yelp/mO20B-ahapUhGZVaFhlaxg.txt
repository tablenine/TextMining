#19 = the best sandwich in life.. . I had it on Saturday for lunch, its Monday and I'm still thinking about it.. . Thick slices of the softest rye bread, and the most tender pastrami- cured in brown sugar, so it falls apart like a brisket- complimented by the thing slice of swiss cheese, fresh cole slaw, and some pickles on the side.. . This is an amazing sandwich experience. . . The location is really crappy, but the second you bite into that perfection, you're not worried about your car being broken into for a split second.
