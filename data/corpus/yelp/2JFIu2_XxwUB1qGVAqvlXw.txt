all i've tried are sandwiches and salads, but DAMN those desserts are so tempting!! i need to remember to come here the next time i am craving something sweet...the outdoor seating is so quaint. i love sitting outside for lunch here. AH and i also love that when they ask if your coffee is for here or to go, they say "china." lovely.
