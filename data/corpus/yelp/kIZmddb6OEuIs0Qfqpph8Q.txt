Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Honestly, I think Costco have better Polish dog than Pink's.. Only go there after a night out with friends in hollywood, and I usually stay in the car while they wait in line for almost an hour. Will I make a special trip there for their dogs, the answer is hell no.
