Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
My two friends and me decided to hit up this place due to its great fame. Parking was a mess because it's way to compact and cramp up with the amount of customer they had. This is definitely casual/fast food dining type of restaurant. We went on a Sunday night around 9 pm and the wait was around 40 minutes before we got the chance to order.. . Lets just say that what I find luring with this place is their sense of creativity with hot dog. It's pretty much you name it they've got it kind of menu. Anything edible that does not go wrong with hot dogs..they've got it. They're quite famous for their chillidog so I got one of those and also the Muholland Drive Dog. I would have to say that their chili dog was nothing special but a typical chili dog that you can get from any average hot dog place. The MULLHOLLAND DRIVE DOG Â was a 10" STRETCH dog with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, nacho cheese &amp; bacon. The overall taste was quite pleasant but didn't give me that never forgetting taste where I would seek after again. To me, a good hotdog should be unique to the point where I will want to go back for it or maybe even crave for it at times. Like for a good hamburger, i think in N out really deserve their name. It's like if I ever want a burger, in N out would be the first in mind when it comes to good taste. Sadly, Pink 's Hot Dog did not achieve that for me.
