This is, bar none, the best sushi i've had in years and the price is decent for the quality of food.  Mitch, the cheif, is friendly and informative and get's fresh sushi in every tuesday and thursday.  I can't recommend this place enough.  I bring friends from out of town just to eat sushi here.  Infact, go to your favorite sushi place, then order the same think at Toro and you will never go back to your old sushi haunt again.
