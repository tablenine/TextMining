Hearing all the rave, I decided to take a look myself. Service was mediocre but not bad. We had a game hen as well as a red meat dish that i can't remember now. But the food was exactly that, relatively forgettable. I felt that the meal overall was on the heavier side and flavors tended to be very heavy and more fall/winter like than spring (we went in May). Overall food was under-seasoned and always a little cold as if it had sat longer than it should. Not bad but none of the wow factor that everyone's been describing. The appetizer was by far the best meal but that was the meat and cheese plate. Also the dessert (some berry tart) was quite nice as well. But the main courses left a lot to be desired.. . Decor was what you might expect as a nicer Cheesecake factory and the furniture on the patio was not quite proportioned properly. . . Willing to give it another go to verify if it was an isolated experience.
