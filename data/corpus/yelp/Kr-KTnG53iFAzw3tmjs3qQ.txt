I really really love this place. I've been here twice and can't get enough. Although I have nothing to compare it to cause I've never had Hainan chicken elsewhere. The chicken is juicy and tender. I usually will end up eating only the dark meat, so I think the next time I'll ask for only dark meat. . . Adding loads and loads of their chili sauce and ginger...You have a mouthwatering delightful explosion of Asian goodness. . . They have other dishes which I found unusually unfitting for this restaurant; pasta dishes and pizza? It doesn't matter because the real reason to come here is for the chicken and rice!
