Hands down the best sandwiches ever!!!  The bread is just unbelievable.  It's so soft and fresh and amazing!  They have a lot of creative sandwiches to choose from - my personal favorite is the Sloppy Pollo.  . . The have fantastic baked goods too - their monster cookie is to die for.  I get salon services from Studio Within and after all my appointments I walk next door to Panes Bread Cafe.  It's like a treat to me!! . . Make sure to bring cash!! . . Enjoy :)
