I wish I could give .5 stars because this place was a definite toss up between a 3 and 4 star review. The food I had was mixed -  etouffee, cup of gumbo and a corn muffin - the etouffee was good but not great, the gumbo was pretty good and the muffin was delicious (or maybe that was the honey-butter it came with... which might make anything delicious). I would most definitely come here again, especially when I want gumbo because it was a good experience, but it seemed to lack a bit of the fun I enjoy when it comes to cajun/creole/whatever-you-call-food-from-New Orleans. The problem with the etouffe was that it had a little bit of a fishy taste to it. Nothing bad, but it was clear that the the shrimp or crawfish was not fresh and could have been improved a bit -  maybe go with just one of those and make it fresh or just a better quality frozen option.. . Apparently the menu changes regularly, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that next time the food is a little improved (wouldn't take much to get to a 4 star). Either way, it was good enough food and, if I had not been hung over, the gigantic cocktails looked  and sounded like they might be fun/trouble -  It was a few years ago now, but I did have some version of a Long Island Iced Tea they had there - it tasted horrid but it was a definite one and done cocktail. Kudos to that.
