You go here because it is not Starbucks and that it has a sizable menu.  You go here to sit in the lofted front window space on cushions on the floor in front of mini tables and have a gigantic brownie and delicious tea.  You go here to relax and have a good time with friends. You go here to study or look for a special something to put on your own mantel at home.  You go here because they are a neighborhood institution and friendly.
