Best Thai food in Atlanta hands down. They have great entrees, but the build your own pad thai is the best i have had here. Since I am a vegetarian, i get it with tofu, and it is always cooked perfectly. Speaking of no-meat, they have some great options for us herbivores. Amazing basil rolls, with this tasty peanut dipping sauce, and coconut soup with tofu are my staples. As far as cocktails go- get the Thai Tea Martini. If alcohol is not your thing, get the jasmine tea. The atmosphere is a nice mix of all kinds of people. Oh, and the interior design is modern, which done impeccably. This is a good place to go for a great dinner experience, for a low price. My only peeve is that they close too early; i tend to eat late.
