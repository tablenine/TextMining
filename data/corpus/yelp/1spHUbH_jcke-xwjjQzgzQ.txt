Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
A White Guy, a Black Guy, and a Pacific Islander walk into Tank Sushi fifteen minutes before they're open. (and the door was open) A server or someone comes over to us and says they're closed. We note to him that they open in fifteen minutes; he looks at us like we are from Mars and says we should come back in fifteen minutes then. Ok... so we go outside the door, but not all the way on to the sidewalk (it was cold and windy out) as we decide on our next course of action. (should we wait in the cold or go someplace else) While discussing what to do next, another guy comes to the door, we think, hey they came to their senses and will seat us early. WRONG! He says, you can't stand in the door way and we should leave. What? Then he stands there to ensure we leave the premise. At this point we were like screw this place. I'm not sure how exactly we offended them by going in fifteen minutes early, but we will never go back there.. . Here is what should have happened: We walk in fifteen minutes early, they mention that they are not open yet, but offer us a table and water if we would like to wait inside and look at the menu. We gladly accept and take a seat, happily waiting until they officially open and take our order. . . Pros: None. Cons: Rude. Cost: Unknown. Overall Rating: -1 of 5. Recommendation: Stay Away From Here
