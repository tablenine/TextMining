There is really nothing bad to say about this place. I've been here only once (but we're going there for lunch in a few) &amp; I had to order the Cuban sandwich, of course. I will say that it is not nearly as good as the late Cafe Atlantic's Cuban sandwich, but it was pretty spectacular. I also ordered the side salad with cilantro dressing. WOW. That dressing is amazing. . . The potato balls, guava cheese tarts. meat pies, everything else is also pretty fantastic. The thing I like most? They have super traditional desserts like Opera cake, Napoleons, &amp; triple chocolate mousse cake, all of which I'm dying to try (mostly to see if they are as good as the one's I've made in my baking class).. . If you're passing through L.A., this place is an absolute must. Also, I pity you because you don't live here.
