Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I am absolutely obsessed with the Griddle. My girlfriends and I go here as often as we can. I've skipped class and work just to make it to the Griddle after a rough night. The Kicking and Screaming breakfast tacos are heaven on a plate. I've never been so obsessed with a restaurant. The prices are not only incredibly reasonable, the portions will last you with enough food for at least 2 days. GO TO THE GRIDDLE!
