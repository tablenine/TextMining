I'll keep this short and sweet.  Huge portions, definitely share.  No matter how hungry you think you are, you'll have enough food for 3 people.  If you eat all of one entree, you're a sick bastard.  . . Great pasta and seafood, awesome salads to share, great $17 Pinot Noir on the wine list.  . . Get the bread pudding for dessert- it's freakishly good.. . An extra plus- if you have to wait for a table, you can go across to Maeve (the bar across the street) and get a drink.  Rose Angelis will call Maeve when they're ready to sit you.  . . I've been here about 5+ times and am continually pleased.  Will definitely keep going!
