The food is not worth the $14 salad price and $12 sandwich price as it is not that great.  I had the hummus turkey sandwhich which was interesting but not super delish and my friend had the portabello mushroom sandwich which was better but not to die for.  But the atmosphere of outdoor seating is wonderful  This is another hip LA spot to be seen but I actually manage to block everyone out and imagine that I am in a far far away land and it worked!  . PS, I would love to eat the red velvet cake but I am on a diet.
