I love this place, this is my ideal breakfast spot in LA. Great location, not over crowded with a bunch of LA looky loo's and star gazers. The few times I've been there, there was no wait. There is a great outdoor patio with large canvas umbrellas. The food is excellent.  Benedicts galore, ham, salmon and even a portobello one!  Brioche french toast with carmel and banana.  Friendly, unpretentious service.
