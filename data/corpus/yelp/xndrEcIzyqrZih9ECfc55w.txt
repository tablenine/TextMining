I have to wonder what all the buzz is...  The place has great potential but hasn't hit its stride if you ask me.  Happened by on the weekend and dropped in for lunch.  Restaurant was less than half full and already was so noisy you had to yell across the table...an echo chamber.  Menu was very limited - salads, a few sandwiches and pizza.  Maybe dinner menu gives more options but I found lunch selection to be lacking.. . Nice touches - interior is very hip, staff very professional.  Complementary sparkling water is a very nice touch.  Salad was delivered - after 15 minutes - and was delicious.  Very fresh produce.. . Sandwich was a major disappointment and not eaten - do you really make tea sandwiches on baquettes and forget to put anything of substance inside???  I thought these were delicate sandwiches - fresh bites of taste and zest.  These were logs of bread...  On the upside, management was a class act and did not charge when they saw a full plate returned.  The burger was a good, solid meal but nothing special.  Fries were a disappointment.. . Desserts were great, fantastic - chocolate tarte that will knock your socks off.. . Bread delivery gave a clue to our meal...it looked freshly made, brought hand wrapped in a towel and dropped on our table to munch...but it wasn't the least bit warmed...much less hot out of the oven.  Hot bread would have been so much better and reflect the talent that lurks in the kitchen.  Lots of places can deliver this...Louie needs to step it up and reach their potential for the prices they are charging.
