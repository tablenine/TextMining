Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
I usually don't write reviews unless I've had an exceptionally good or bad experience. Unfortunately, it was a bad one. My friend and I have never had Argentinian food before and were excited to try this restaurant out. We could tell it was a popular spot on Melrose Ave. The food was OKAY. Nothing special. The waiter was cute but his service was lacking. I asked for more bread. He forgot. He offered my friend a refill. He forgot. Then the bill came and we ACCIDENTALLY tipped him $2 on a $28 bill because of a miscalculation. So we leave the place and the waiter chases us down! Asks us in a degrading tone if the service was bad and had us in complete and utter shock. We were unaware of what he was talking about. We ended up giving him $6 extra thinking we didn't pay enough. After everything set in we realized we had paid enough and who was he to be entitled to a large tip when his service was below average. We have both been servers in our lives and never have we felt ENTITLED to a tip. For that waiter to demand a large tip when he didn't even deserve it in the first place made this experience at this restaurant very unpleasant. I will not go here again.
