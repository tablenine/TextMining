I had really high expectations for this place.  We made reservations, still had to wait a while (after getting there on time), and got seated at a small table.  I did like the building it was in, and the atmosphere would have been great if it wasn't so packed.  Oh well, if it's so packed...it must be amazing right?  . . WRONG!!  The West Coast is not the place to eat pizza!!  Didn't get it, sorry.
