Restaurant: Baoguette
Category: Vietnamese
Excellent lunch choice if you work in the area. . . I have had the "Baoguette" sandwich, which is basically the Vietnamse banh mi. This is a very good version of the sandwich, with smoky, slightly sweet pork, creamy pate, and nice crunchy pickled vegetables. A great deal for $5. Probably not as large as the versions you can get downtown, but still satisfying and flavorful.. . Just as a note, there are whole peppercorns incorporated with the pork, so if you're not a big fan, look out and don't chomp on the little black nubs.
