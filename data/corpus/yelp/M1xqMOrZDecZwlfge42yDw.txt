Record breaking heat on a Friday night in June.  Went in to El Myr and it feels just like it did outside.. hot as hell. Ordered a cool drink, which was good, but it def didn't cool me down.  The shrimp tacos I had were super good, fresh tasting and perfect for the hot weather outside and in.  The chips suck though, be forwarned.  Food is cheap, air conditioning is apparently not.   Defintley check out their cheap eats but try and go during the fall.
