Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
Along with all the other Yelp reviews, I concur- the Yelp $25 Nacional 27 special is a great deal but more importantly, N27 has great food!. . The space was smaller that I thought it would be for a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant- just one large, high-ceilinged dining room.  It was also not decorated with the traditional bright, flashy Latin vibe, instead simple with white and beige curtains.  The service was great and the décor was more upscale and subued than the average Latin restaurant.. . When we sat down, the waiter brought us an amuse bouche to "acclimate our palate to Latin flavors."  It was smoked chicken with black beans on a tortilla chip- tasty and a nice touch.  We had the Signature Platter appetizer which consisted of four tapas-like small treats: a plantain croqueta, a shrimp skewer in adobo sauce, a chicken empanada, and a shredded lamb taco.  For dinner, I had the Pacific Blue Nose "Huachinango" which the waiter described as a type of grouper fish.  I based my entrée order on previous positive Yelp reviews and it was great: a grilled, meaty fish on a bed of green rice.  The dessert really capped of the night: we both ordered the Cuatro Chocolates which consisted of four tastes of chocolate in different forms: a "chocolate sorbet" as described by our waiter but really was like a combination of dark chocolate mousse and gelato, flourless chocolate cake, a chocolate cookie, and a frothy chocolate milk spiked with Kahlua served in a shot glass.
