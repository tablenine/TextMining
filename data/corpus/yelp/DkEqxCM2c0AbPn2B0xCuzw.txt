Nice place to chill out and enjoy a cup of coffee.  I have yet to sit up front on the pillows.  Kopi offers a unique and relaxed environment.  They also serve food here too, but I have only tried their fresh mozzerella sandwich, which was delicious, but overpriced!!!  I need to learn how to make my own.
