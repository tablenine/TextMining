I had dinner here with a few girlfriends, and overall, I was impressed.  The cocktails were all delicious (particularly the rootbeer in the rye), and the food was all very fresh.  I particularly liked the duck egg raviolo with morel mushrooms and asparagus, the burrata cheese and the lemon spatzle.  . . I don't know how frequently I would seek out an almost exclusively vegetarian restaurant (the only non-veg item was a scallop dish) at this price point, but I did enjoy my meal.
