I've been here a few times over the years.  It's a fairly large place with lots of rooms on various levels.  I've been to a private party on the second floor and also for St. Patrick's day on the main floor.  I enjoyed each and every time as they offer a variety of beers.  I hear the roof deck is what sets this place apart so I will have to try it eventually.. . This is your standard chain brew pub.  Nothing amazing but no reason you won't enjoy your time here.
