This was my first trip to Chicago and we were recommended to come here. The cheese was gooey-ooey-yummy. I was pretty much stuffed after one slice. It was super thick and the crust was delicious. I absolutely loved it. The staff was nice and organized. Prices were reasonable, and the wait really wasn't so bad, especially because it was Lollapolooza weekend. . . I have eaten at Pizzeria Uno here in San Diego which sells deep dish pizza and I actually like their crust better, its so buttery flakey...so I'm at least happy we have that place on the west coast as well.
