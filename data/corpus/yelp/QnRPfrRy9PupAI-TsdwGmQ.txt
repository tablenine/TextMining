Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
This a great place for wurst, frites and great beer.  There is an eclectic selection of sausage, in addition to the standard German brats and bocks.  The frites are delicious and paired with inventive choices of sides, such as chipotle mayonnaise.  The only downside here is the crowds; you are probably going to wait in line a while and people like to take their time choosing.  Once you order and get your drinks, it is off to the large dining area where you can share a large table with some new friends or wait for the smaller tables along the edges.  If you just want to try the beer, skip the line and head straight for the bar in the dining room.
