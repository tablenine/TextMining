The burgers here are reminiscent of those sold at In-N-Out, except that the filler options are different (and cost more).  The fries have a medium thickness, and mine were disappointing because they were soggy.  If this place wasn't so overpriced, and if the fries were better, it'd get 5 stars in my book.. . I love the character of this place.  There's nothing like ordering food diner-style.  Our server was an older gentleman, and when we ordered fries, he slapped two tiny cardboard plates on the table and then proceeded to aggressively empty ketchup onto them like no tomorrow.  It was awkward, but hilarious.
