I love Porto's.  I have been going the the Glendale location for as long as I can remember.  The potato balls are amazing and the chocolate croissant is the best I've ever had (and I have had my fair share).  The major drawback is that it is always crowded... and for good reason.  It's really good food at pretty great prices.
