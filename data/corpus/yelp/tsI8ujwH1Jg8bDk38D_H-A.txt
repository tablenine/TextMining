I LOVE THIS PLACE. . . It's like $2 for a sandwich. If you order the thit nuong (grilled pork) sandwich I think it's like $2.50? And for all you people who usually pay with credit cards, this is a CASH ONLY place.. . I always order the banh mi ga (chicken sandwich). They cut the french bread with a slit in the middle, rip some of the dough out, add a bunch of veggies, some soy sauce, butter...after the first bite you literally enter pure bliss. I'm not sure what pure bliss tastes like but I imagine it would taste like this.. . The bread is crispy, crunchy, and soft on the inside. BE AWARE IF YOU'RE A FIRST TIME EATER HERE cause you need to eat in the brown bag or else crumbs will fly left and right. The chicken is shredded up and already seasoned. They always put these green, super duper SPICY peppers in there so if you're really sensitive to spicy food, ask for no hot peppers. For me...it's perfect :) . . They also offer a wide variety of other vietnamese dishes. I had the bun thit nuong (grilled pork with thin noodles, loaded with veggies, fish sauce on the side) and it was pretty tasty.. . This place is hard to beat. I wish I could give it 10+ stars.
