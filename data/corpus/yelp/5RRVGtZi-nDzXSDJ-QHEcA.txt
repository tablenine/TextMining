Question!. . Say you have a choice between McDonald's and Daphne's for lunch.  It goes without saying, right?  You'd choose Daphne's for their mediocre imitation of Greek food over a pathetic reheated super-nitrated hockey puck hamburger at McD's, right?. . Well, that's about the difference between Papa Cristo's and Daphne's as far as Greek food goes.  . . It blew me out of the water.  It was like I was attacked by flavor Argonauts and Sparta kicked the Persians'  kabob asses while Homer was strumming some wicked spanakopita-shaped lute.  Zeus even grew some delicious gyros baby from his head, and I was there to taste it all.............. . Yes, you should definitely try this place.  There's lots of parking, and the service is polite.  Anyone who works there that is related to Papa Cristo is extremely friendly in a Greek way that takes you off guard because for a moment there you almost forgot you were in the middle of LA... . Not only do they have amazing, freshly-grilled and carefully arranged Greek food coming to you very quickly and happily, they also have a market where you can order stuff to go to remind you of your Princess Cruise to Santorini..... . Wow, wow, wow, and one more wow.  . . I'm there for the Thursday night all-inclusive "Big Fat Greek" family dinner.. . My wife and I were fighting before we got to the place, but the food totally repaired our marriage, and there's even leftovers for any future disagreements in the next 48 hours..... . Don't go to Daphne's.  Make the trek down Pico and try this place out.. . It will make you and anyone you bring feel good about Greece.
