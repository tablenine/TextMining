Thought about this place a few months ago (during my dark pre-Yelp days), and reminisced about how cool it was to go here, even if it was my one and only time.  Was it expensive?  Absolutely.  The best way to go here is to resign yourself to following the MINO principle (Money Is No Object), and you'll be fine.  Maybe the food wasn't the best in the world, but how many times in your life are you going to be able to eat dinner under a Tiffany stained glass dome, inside a Victorian quasi-mansion?  For me, it was a pretty low number to begin with (okay, technically, the number was zero), and will continue to be a very low number, but at least I can say that I've been, thus bringing my grand total to "1". . . I was literally mesmerized by everything I saw there, from the decor to the memorabilia everywhere I looked.   Although I don't consider myself to be a magic fanatic, I can certainly appreciate the art and the mystery behind it.  As far as the Magic Castle and the concept itself, there's nothing in town that compares.  And THAT my friends, is why I gave this place 5 stars.
