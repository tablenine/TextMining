Restaurant: Thumbs Up Diner
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
YESYESYES!!!!!!!!! ok to sum up Thumbs Up: Good-good food. GREAT-GREAT prices. Friendly staff (most of the time)... Seriously, you can have a FULL breakfast meal for under $6-7... so for first-timers, you could start with the pancake, regular (there's a healthier buckwheat one, but it tastes just a lil' too healthy for me... howEVER, my "healthier" friends swear by it)... then there's my absolute favorite menu item: CHICKEN SAUSAGE LINK.... oh YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! loves it... the eggs are made to order (and they REALLY make em exactly how you ask for it)... the french toast is delish too. It's MASSIVE, so don't be greedy and order 2... just start with one, and when you SEE how LARGE it is (plate-sized), you'll thank me for my wisdom;-)... then there's the Catfish... farmraised. battered and fried up... very well-seasoned... you can't go wrong here... And of course there's a "dinner" menu that boasts a BIG-FAT-HEARTY burger with fries... impeccable diner cuisine;-)... On the many occasions that I've dined at Thumbs Up, I don't think I've ever seen anyone spend over $12... and that $12 was more-or-less a 3-course breakfast;-)... Cons: the line can be redicules at times and they don't accept reservations... but it is SO worth the wait... they also won't seat incomplete parties, so make sure your folk are PUNCTUAL! ... and IF at all possible, ask to be seated in Cavanique's section... best waitress EVER... her job is actually an artform;-)... final CONs: they close at 3pm and it's ca$h only, but there's an atm on site...
