With so many reviews I doubt I have anything new to add but here goes.... . Beautiful space to have a snack in. I didn't eat in the dining room but folks looked happy there. The bar was a madhouse on a Friday night by 8pm. Our server was slammed but made every effort to remember our order and got it right. Yummy wines by the glass. My first taste of pork bellies - um, yum! The cheese and meat tasting menu looked really great but they were out of two of the cheeses we wanted to try so we got stuck with a pretty basic parm. Pricing is fair for portions and they are perfect to share.. . The bathroom situation is a little nuts. Plenty of room to stand in line for one of the three private bathrooms. I had a good conversation with a nice lady while waiting but some shiny shoed greasy guy faked charm and cut in line in front of her. I'd go back earlier in the evening next time to get a spot at the bar for tapas.
