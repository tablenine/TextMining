Like the name insists, this places food is also Rock Bottom.  I am failing to see what people see in this place.  I am not really even motivated enough to write a proper review because I was really not impressed with much that it had to offer.  Overall the atmosphere was like a dark TGI Fridays, and the food like an upscales Chilis.  I guess if you are boozing it might rock...but restaurant I did experience wasn't anything to write home about.
