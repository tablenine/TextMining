This is one of my favorite lunch places that is walking distance from my office.  Almost every entree I've ordered from here, I have loved.  They've got amazingly tasty turkey burgers, wraps and the split pea soup is fantastic.  Oh and the cupcakes....so good I want to cry.  They ruin my diet every time. But I can't help it because they're so good.  The service is here pretty darn good.  The place is super popular and there tends to be a bit of a wait.  In many cases it's worth the wait.  On occasion you can see a minor and sometimes major celebrities here.  I could care less about them, but it is kinda cool  to say I was sitting at the next table over from so and so.  I go for the food, the celebrity sightings are a bonus.
