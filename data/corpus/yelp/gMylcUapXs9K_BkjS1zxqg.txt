Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I love me some fat and juicy steak, and the kind that they serve here at David Burke's Primehouse is no exception. I came here with a few of my friends for Thanksgiving dinner and was impressed with the exceptional food and service. Although I originally was drawn to the David Burke Thanksgiving pre fixe menu, I quickly changed my mind and opted to order a "Kentucky" Rib-Eye, instead. This bad boy was HUGE and the flavor of the meat was so wonderful and succulent. My mouth is watering now just writing this. As each of us scanned the menu, we all decided to scratch the Thanksgiving menu and order steaks and sides, instead. I was pleased with our unanimous decision. We had these delicious buttered corn biscuits to start with. AMAZING...For our sides we all shared the mushroom risotto and creamed spinach. Â For dessert, we all decided to order something different so we could sample the various sweet treats that they offered. I ordered the cheesecake lolipops, mostly though for the dramatic effects. The lolipops were brought out with SPARKLERS. I thought it was FUNtastic! The icing on the cake for the evening was that our server gave us fresh take-home containers filled with turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie and the usual Thanksgiving spread to enjoy at home. I was very excited to have had the chance to try both their steaks and have a little piece of Thanksgiving delight to take home. Loved it. The food, drinks, service, and ambience at David Burke convinced me that I will need to definitely come back again...
