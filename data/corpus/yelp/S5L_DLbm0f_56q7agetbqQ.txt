Great new spot in downtown! The drinks are really amazing.. which doesn't hurt when you're waiting on people *ah em*  it also doesn't hurt that the service is impeccable and the servers are quite easy on the eyes.  The food was great and I highly recommend the portobello fries and porkchops with apple sauce.  Their souffle is quite delish too... I'm looking forward to going back soon!
