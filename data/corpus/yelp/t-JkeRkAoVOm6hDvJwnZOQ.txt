Chicken, waffles, GRITS and lots o butter! This place is the best. There's usually a long wait at the LA location, but the Pasadena location is not as crowded and the food is just as good. The collard greens are really yummy and the grits are to die-for! Definitely give it a try! And Yes - I've been here many times sober and it's still very good.
