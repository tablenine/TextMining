Nothing but the BEST for my 500th review!!!!. . We can smell the wonderful taste of the Koji truck before we turn into the street. Kogi short rib burrito is as good as it get!!!!.   - the rib is tender &amp; juicy,  and the sauce is soo unique!. . I would skip the Kogi dog though, nothing special there. . this is the highlight of my LA food trip!
