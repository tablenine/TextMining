Yeah yeah.....I can't add anything new to the 350 other reviews for this spectacular temple of beef.  This has been my favorite restaurant for the past 10 years.  . . But I want to just say this to the future diners here. By all means. Take your time while you eat. But when you're done, pay your freaking bill and leave!  This is not the place for you to hang out and chat with your friends!  This is not the place for you to be texting your friends to see what you're going to do next.  See that mass of people along the walls and outside?  They all just became your mortal enemies. And whatever good karma you had when you walked in here will now replaced with utter hatred and wishes of bad things happening to you. . . Seriously though. It's just common courtesy.  Leave.
