Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
LOVE this place! The atmosphere is upscale sports bar and I LOVE the decor. If I ever design a restaurant-this place is exactly what it will look like. Heck, I'll try to build my future home after it.. . Service was great, lots of good choices on the menu, and just overall great atmosphere. Can't wait to make my hubby take me back there :)
