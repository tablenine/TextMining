I went here tonight for the first time in at least a year. I've been a little scared to come back because the last time I chowed down I almost had to pull over on the drive home because my cholesterol-induced heart palpitations were freaking me out too much. . . But, a friend was in town, so it was a special occasion and I just couldn't say no! I got the Carol C. Special (duh) with a side of potato salad (but they gave me candied yams!). It was still delicious, minus the mix up. Their potato salad rules. Candied yams, not so much. . . The chicken has never been my favorite part, but tonight it was extra tasty! I've noticed that their waffles are a wee bit tinier than usual, but that's probably a good thing.. . I ate almost my whole plate, but I made it home without feeling like I was going to burst! I don't know whether that's a good thing or something I should be concerned about. Probably the latter. Whatevs!
