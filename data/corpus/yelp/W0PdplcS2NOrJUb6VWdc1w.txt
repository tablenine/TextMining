Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
A mexican restaurant close to the park is a must... who doesn't crave a margarita on a hot day?  Zocalo's covered outdoor seating is ideal and the location is great, but I was a little disappointed.. . Sure, I played it safe and ordered a chicken quesadilla, but I expected to get a little more than grilled, unseasoned chicken and cheese.  I guess I learned my lesson.  My friend ordered the El Pastor taco and was raving the whole time. . . The queso was smoky rather than spicy (almost a Gouda flavor) and the chips were just okay.  But the house margarita was good, our server was nice and free valet parking appreciated.. . All in all, an A-OK experience.  If you go, be a little more adventurous than me and I'm sure you'll be pleased!
