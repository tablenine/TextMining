when you want some delicous pancakes or waffles, this is the place to go.  if you have an enormous appetite and can eat huge stacks of the stuff, this is the place to go.  if you hate hollywood types, long waits, crowded places, or long waits for single stall bathrooms (wtf?!?  this place is way too big and crowded for that nonsense), this is not the place to go.
