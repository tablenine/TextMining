So went to this place with my wife's family for a Sat dinner. We got there at 5pm and yeah.....It was wall to wall packed with people. . . Parking....if you find a spot in the small ass parking lot. Then consider yourself lucky. Note: I saw a lady and her kid almost get hit by this car in the parking lot...WTF! Yeah it was busy. . . Waiting area...it got so busy that I got claustrophobic. I had to wait outside half the time. . . Waiting for table.... if you have a party of 10 or more. Welcome to the world of 2 hour waiting. . . Yes it was busy as fuck. People running here and there and loud. . . When the people at the table you are going to be seated at is getting ready to leave. The waiters come over to your spoke person of your group and you can preorder your meal so it will come out shortly after your seated. Good attempt at be quick and efficient. . . The Food.....lets be honest. People don't fucking come here to go through all the shit listed above if the food wasn't good. . . Yes it was definitely was good and beyond. . . Would I come back.... maybe but not with such a big group and come at a better time.
