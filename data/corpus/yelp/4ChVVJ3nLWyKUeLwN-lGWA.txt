Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
My family is visiting Chicago for the first time ever- and I've lived here for 3 years.  I had so many ideas of where to take them, but you know how it goes with visitors.  After a few sites, we found ourselves at the bottom of the John Hancock, and they wanted Cheesecake Factory next.  . Ummm.... . We had a 3 and a 4 year old with us, and waited forever to be seated.  With all the tourists there with young children, I was surprised to find out that there is no section for kids foods in the novelesque menu.  Do they think they are really that fancy that they can't bother to have a kid's menu section?  Pssh.  . . We all know the portions are grotesquely huge, and tonight was no different.  But size isn't the only thing that matters, I guess.  I'm a fan of comfort food (lord help me) and I found the mashed potatoes and popcorn shrimp to be really good- not together though, ha.  Everything else (sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, corn mystery side dish) was flavorless.  Mac n Cheese balls- narsty!  Salad- brown lettuce?!?. . And I really don't like how all the servers wear tight, white, and most times a bit see-thru pants.. . ps- I don't like cheescake, but I heard that they do it well.
