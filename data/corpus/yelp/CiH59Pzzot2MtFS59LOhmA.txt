Smack me in the face, I love this place.. . I consider the pricing completely fair considering the food you receive. Â The Sangria is amazing, mouthwatering empanadas, and the dijon-mustard glazed salmon over mixed greens is my standard. . . Great patio for outdoor dining and conducive to networking with others.
