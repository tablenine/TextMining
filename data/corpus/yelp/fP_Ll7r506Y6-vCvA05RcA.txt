Restaurant: Baoguette
Category: Vietnamese
My fellow gastronome from Manhattan just could not wait to taunt me about Baoguette being spotlighted on Eyewitness News last week. . Emails and phone calls came flying in and layin da smack down; "We are better! We are better! We are better... Queens S**K". . Well... we cannot have that, so several of us from Queens strategized and headed down last Saturday morning to the Baoguette Caf√© location in Mrray Hill.. . Five of us sampled almost everything and here are our rating so read and weep:. . Regular Pork Banh Mi- not any better than Queens and not as authentic; $5!! I can get two for this price in Queens.. . Sloppy Bao Banh Mi- OK, something different; it is good; but $7!. . Catfish Banh Mi- hmmm... skimpy on the ingredients; it is only OK another $7! Chef had a bad day or a shortage on fish?. . Sticky Rice- this was actual pretty good but $8!!! There goes the gas money.. . Roasted Fish Vermicelli Noodle- pretty good but also $8. Duh!. . Well, there you have it, Queens Dudes say, "It ain't good enough."
