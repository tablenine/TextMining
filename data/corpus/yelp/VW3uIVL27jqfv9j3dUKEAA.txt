Maybe I shouldn't base a whole yelp review on a bar's lighting and ambience but that's what I'm doing. Sorry. . . I don't remember what I drank here or whether or not I had any fun but what I do recall is waiting to use the restroom. And upon waiting, I saw this crazy little lazer light show being displayed on the floor. It looked like little sperms swimming around in a puddle. . . If I was high, I probably wouldn't have left that spot in front of the ladies room. But I wasn't high and eventually my friends came searching for me. . . All in all, I felt out of place here in my dirty jeans and sneaks. Lots of nicely dressed folks sitting at modern tables drinking cocktails while crazy light shows blipped along to dance tracks. . . if anything, go here to use the restroom.
