I finally stopped in here today to get take out.  The atmosphere was much nicer than I expected it to be after reading everyone's reviews about it.  It was cute and clean inside with maybe around 10 or 12 (?) tables.  We got a falafel plate and a vegetarian plate and took them over to Piedmont Park to eat.  Both were good, but I like the vegetarian plate better, b/c it had falafel plus baba, hummus, and my favorite, tabbouleh.  We would definitely go back.  I was bummed we forgot to order desert.  They have baklava and rice pudding!
