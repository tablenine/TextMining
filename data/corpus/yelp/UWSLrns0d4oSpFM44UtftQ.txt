I think this place has some of the best fresh seafood you can find (at least in the midwest...). Everything I've had here has been delicious. They do import all the fish (duh!), but from the best locations, i.e. Alaskan and Nova Scotian salmon, Maryland crab. The place has a great upscale feel, but is still down to earth - the staff was very attentive and friendly. It is a little pricey, but for quality seafood, it is worth it. I have only been here when someone else got the check though! Also great drinks!
