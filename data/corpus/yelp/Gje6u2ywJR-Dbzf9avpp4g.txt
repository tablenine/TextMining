Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
I have to admit, I am not a huge fan of French cuisine (besides crepes, of course).  It's a bit heavy for my taste with all the cream sauces and gamey meat.  But, my roomie loves all things French, including Comme Ca and since it is a casual stroll from our apartment ~ we decided to dine there Friday night. . We sat at the bar and were taken very good care of by adorable bartender Tim.  I liked the decor and the overall vibe of the place.  It can be a bit loud in the dining room, but I actually think it was less so up at the bar. . We decided to order a couple of entree's and share them.  We had the red snapper and the tortellini.  Both were quite good.  The snapper was grilled to perfection and seasoned nicely.  Served over seasoned grilled vegetables and yummie little potatoes.  I appreciated that this dish was light and fresh and absent of any sort of heavy creamed sauce.  The tortellini was good as well, though nothing spectacular.  I liked the hint of fennel and the light sauce.  . I love that they bring the bread to you as a mini baguette in a little paper bag.  A nice touch.  And the peppered butter for the bread was tasty.  . We decided to pass on desert, but Tim served us up a couple of giant, fresh, sweet as candy, strawberries.  A sweet treat from a sweet treat.  . I will be back... if not for dinner... at least for a cocktail and a little eye candy.
