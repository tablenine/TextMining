"My name's Kristina, and I'm a Milk Virgin...". . Well, that's not exactly how it went, but you get the picture. I needed recommendations, and what I got was salvation. After ditching an ecorazzi event going on down the block at Rolling Greens, I needed a pick me up IN A BIG WAY. That complimentary organic vodka-acai- coconut water cocktail and vegan oatmilk-pumpkin-chai cocoa truffle just didn't cut it. MAMA NEEDED SOME DAIRY!. . So when I found parking around the corner, and was greeted by a Norwegian-looking hipster milkmaid at the counter, I knew I was in luck! She knew the drill: Mini red velvet cupcake poppers (I'll take 3), an oatmeal butterscotch cookie (Great idea, but not as good as what was to come...) and the prized item of the night: a coconut ice cream bar dipped in chocolate and covered in toasted coconut!!! This luscious dessert unleashed a flurry of happy drugs in my brain, and I ate it all on the ride back to Venice. Thank the gods of dairy for curing me of eco-fatigue!!! . . All eco-consciousness aside, mama's gotta have her Milk.
