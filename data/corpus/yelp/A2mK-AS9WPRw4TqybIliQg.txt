Korean x tacos?! I'm IN!. . Came upon this taco truck when this was right next to our parking lot in downtown. It was around lunchtime and there was a whole crowd around it. Must be good. right? . . So we stood in line and waited and waited, and about 25 minutes later, we finally got the chance to order. They have tacos and burritos, with Korean shortribs, Korean spicy pork, chicken, tofu. Mmmm... . We got the shortrib and pork taco, and the dessert of the day (seemed like everybody was getting one) which was a caramel chocolate cake with tapioca filing. . . Another 10 minute wait and our food was ready. Served in a paper tray these looked absolutely delicious!! There was so much filling that I had to eat some of it before I could eat them in 'taco form.'  I had the pork one. Flavours of  cilantro, lime, and onion relish, a crisp salad of cabbage and Romaine lettuce dressed with a sesame-chili salsa roja, and then garnished with radish, lime, and orange wedges.The pork and everything all together just makes this taco really awesome. REALLY awesome.. . Just try it.
