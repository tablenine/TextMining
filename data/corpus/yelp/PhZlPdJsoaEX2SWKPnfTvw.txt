Come here every Saturday for brunch and it never lets me down. Everything about Blu Jam is 5 stars. Food is excellent, service is amazing, and the bathrooms are always squeaky clean (which is a major plus in my books). Blu Jam Love Forever..... . Food: 5 stars. Service: 5 stars. Atmosphere: 5 stars. Price: 5 stars
