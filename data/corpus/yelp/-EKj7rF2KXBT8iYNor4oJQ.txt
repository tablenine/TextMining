Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I don't frequent Roscoe's often, but I was quite impressed during my last visit (May). I ordered the only meal that I order here. I believe it is called the Carol C's special (2 pcs chicken, 1 waffle). The chicken was crispy and delicious, the waffle was yummy too. I tried some of the macaroni and cheese...(as usual, watery and not that cheesy). I've had mixed feelings about this place, ever since my first visit (to the location on Colorado in the early 90s--no longer open).
