Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
I think Hae Woon Dae offers the best Korean BBQ on Buford Highway - quality of the meat wise.  Whatever you order, the meat is always fresh and well-marinated.  They are always tender and juicy!. . The only downside about this restaurant is the interior and service.  What is up with the space?  I feel like I just entered the time machine and traveled back about 30 years?  Probably they opened their business 30 years ago and never did a thing to change the restaurant.  Moreover, the owner, who was a typical Korean guy (as in not talkative and stern looks), served us.  I was super uncomfortable - and I actually can communicate with the guy!  But this really isn't rude service.  It's just how he is.. I can't blame that!. . Hae Woon Dae does offer a great Korean BBQ.  However, you have to tolerate typical traditional Korean guys and dining at almost no light.  I'm sorry, nothing's perfect!  (At least you won't have to pay a huge tip? Ha)
