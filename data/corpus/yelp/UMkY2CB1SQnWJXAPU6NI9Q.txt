Our Birthday Party went there on Tuesday - Blues night and just had a wonderful time.  Menu was interesting and not overpriced with a great southern flavor to go with the music.  Our food server was very nice and helped us select food.  The owner Eric even made a special treat for our table when he found out it was a B-Day party.  The highlight was the amazing Blues Guitarist playing absolutely authentic acoustic guitar blues.  Really made the night special and nothing like so many "run of the mill" bands you hear around town.  Will definitely go back.
