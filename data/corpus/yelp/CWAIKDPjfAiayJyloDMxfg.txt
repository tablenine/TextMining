I ordered the chicken sandwich (only $3.50), the baklava, and this fluffy sprinkled dessert. I'd skip the chicken sandwich and go with the gyros sandwich (which was what my friend got). I normally don't like gyros because of the meat, but they make it SO good here! We also got the octopus, which was grilled instead of fried, and that's always a good thing. The baklava and the fluffy white powdered dessert are great gift items for friends.. . Sat outside on a sunny afternoon, with free olives located behind the cashier. At 4pm, it was easy to find seating, and my friend said that it never gets too crowded to find a seat as many people take it to go. I probably wouldn't come back because I was expecting the taste of Mediterranean food for some reason...and not a huge fan of Greek.
