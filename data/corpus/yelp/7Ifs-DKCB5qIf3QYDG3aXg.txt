Only one bad thing - the freakin' crowd...expect to wait even at 7 in the morning...other than that - I LOVE THIS PLACE!  The cheese rolls, potato balls and butter croissants are my ultimate favorite things to get here.  I'm so glad they expanded a while ago but it seems like it got worse...anyway - always worth the wait...forget coming here on a holiday....2-3 hours wait before you get help....may be a little different now that Burbank opened up...
