you want pure awesomenessss? this is the freakin place. i will drive here anyday anytime to fulfill my Roscoe's cravings. this location is the first one that opened, i heard. and the one where all the celebrities supposedly go. but i havent seen any. maybe cuz im too busy to look up from my yummy plate of awesomeness! this location and long beach are my favorites. long beach location is a little bigger and nicer looking but that doesnt really matter to me when it comes to Roscoe's. . . JEANNE JONES OMELETTE!! gooey yummy cheese &amp; juicy ass chicken packed in an omelette with a waffle on the side. oh yeaaaaa. damn, my Â mouth is watering just thinkin about it. the hell you still doin? you must try it. go now go. wait, take me with you, pls :)
