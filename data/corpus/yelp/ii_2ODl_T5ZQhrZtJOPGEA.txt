Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
I order in from the Pasta Bowl pretty often, usually on Sunday nights when I've had a rough Saturday night and need some carbs.  The cappellini pomodoro pasta is my favorite, but they have lots of options on the menu. They also have a really good salad with goat cheese.  They get pretty busy so delivery is a bit slow, but it usually arrives within an hour.
