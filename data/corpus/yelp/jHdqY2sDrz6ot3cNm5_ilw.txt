Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I ordered a tostada, chicken tamale, regular taco, enchilada, complimentary(?) salsa with chips, and small strawberry soda.  It cost $9.45.  None of it was bad, but is just wasn't great.  The salsa was very tasty but almost completely liquified.  I don't think any of it was very healthy, either.  I would rather go to Tacos Por Favor and pay $6ish for a great burrito and chunkier salsa.
