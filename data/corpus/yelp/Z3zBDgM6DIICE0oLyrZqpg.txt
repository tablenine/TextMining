A Hollywood hotspot when one sees for the very first time would say, "THAT'S it?" This little Lonnie Moore shack looks like a cyclone picked up a New England cottage and dropped it into the buzzing crevice known as Las Palmas and Hollywood Blvd. The focal point of this venue is the very cozy courtyard area (complete with fountain!) flanked by booth-like seats. Overall the whole place was exactly as I imagined it to be though...rather small.. . I can't comment about the crowd or the horror that is waiting to get into it, because I've never had to wait.. . On Thursdays, it's the most poppin' with the typical blond-hair skinny tan Christian Audigier crowd and is almost impossible to get into if you're (1) a lone wolf; (2) a group of men with no $$$ to dispose; (3) an ugly or fat girl (sorry, this is really how it works in HWood).. . Here's a tip though...on Mondays, it's a much different crowd thanks to the rock 'n roll scene, and it's a lot less pretentious and the environment is much more feel-good as the door is less tight, so you'd have a better chance getting inside without BS.. . Surprisingly, the bouncers and doormen here are some of the nicest and friendliest I've met, unlike next door at Element where they talk shit to you as you walk by them on Las Palmas (how do these douche bags get hired?). . An FYI...the crowd here is not only extremely pretentious, but VERY aggressive. Infamous for its parking lot shooting and parking lot brawls between party-goers, a good number of people that go to this place really aren't afraid to sucker punch you or yank on your hair over a little stupid scuffle. I've seen a woman get socked in the face real hard by another woman just for saying "excuse me" trying to walk past her. WTF? Bitches need to take an effing chill pill.
