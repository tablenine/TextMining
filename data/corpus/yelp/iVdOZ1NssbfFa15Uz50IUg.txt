Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
I can't believe I have yet to review Brick Store Pub.  . http://www.brickstorep.... /. . It's in the the heart of downtown Decatur, and is such a cool spot to grab a beer-- especially if you can swindle a spot outside on a warm night.  Yes, their beer menu is extensive (with a ton of Belgium varieties), but the food is worthy of a trip, too.
