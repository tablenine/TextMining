Had dinner here after going to the Taste of Chicago so it was an interesting change. Got a martini for my drink and it was shaken, but should I feel that for you to have a proper martini mixed, it should be stirred (guess I am no James Bond).. . The bread was cold and the butter was almost room temperature. Both were fine. Since I was in Chicago, I though I should try the fried smelt. The batter was not too thick but it was also not crunchy enough, although the smelt were cooked all the way through and were completely edible. The sauce that came with it was almost like thousand island, and the fried capers added nice touch to the dish. Also ordered the pan seared foie gras which melted in my mouth. The currants added a nice sourness to the taste along with the balsamic vinegar.. . For the meal, I ordered the braised "Kobe" waygu beef brisket with a cannelloni of watercress, "confit" cremini and white beech mushrooms, grey shallots, buttermilk ricotta and herb salad. The beef was very tender, but too overcooked, and I received 3 pieces of meat for $36. The mushrooms were fresh and the salad was good.. . We also go the farm plate of roasted quail, crisp kurobuta pork belly and a coddled duck egg "enrobed" in la quercia proscuitto with scallion jam, lacinato kale, "duck fat" fried rose finn potatoes and thyme. The quail was cooked well done, and the skin was crunchy. The pork belly was sweet &amp; a little tougher than I like, but the duck egg was perfect.. . For dessert we ordered the Naha "rocky road" sundae of dark chocolate ice cream, marshmallow "fluff" and cracked almonds. The sundae was very sweet, and had a good crunch with the almonds.. . The decor was modern on the inside and the waiter was ok. It was a decent place to eat.
