Elements Kitchen is one of my favorite places to eat in Old Town Pasadena!. . It's located a few blocks south of Old Town on Fair Oaks and what I appreciate about it is its flavorful ingredients that saturate their sandwiches, soups, salads, and their mac-n-cheese!. . I've had their curry chicken sandwich and their cuban-style pulled pork sandwich and both were good,  but the star at this place is the mac-n-cheese.  The mac-n-cheese is creamy with a perfect crust.  You could pay extra to accessorize it with bacon (what doesn't taste better with bacon) or wild mushrooms w/ truffle oil.  Their drink selection is limited to lemonade, iced tea, punch, and water.. . Elements' Kitchen is very small and seating is primarily outdoor.  Cost of entrees range between $10-$14 and food portions are small for the price.  They also closeup around 4:30, so make sure that you check their hours before you venture off Colorado to head here.  . . Regardless, I feel that Elements is consistently good with its flavorful ingredients and its unique menu.  I like that it's a small place and I feel its menu of sandwiches, salads, potato chips, and lemonade, paired along with the outdoor seating makes it feel like a picnic that is a few blocks removed from the center of Old Town.
