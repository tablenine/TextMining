I had to check this place out after seeing it on Man v. Food.  My verdict is it's OK.  Not great; not terrible, but definitely over-rated.   The hype this restaurant gets is amazing considering its average at best sandwiches.  If you're a guy you will need to order two sandwiches to satisfy your hunger.
