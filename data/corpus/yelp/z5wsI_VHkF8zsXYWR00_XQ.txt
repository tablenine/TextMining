Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
My sandwich at Joan's On Third was dy-no-mite! I had the chicken, brie and carmelized onions on sourdough. It was pressed like a pannini, but not necessary grilled. Fantizzle, it was!. . Mr. Biscuit and Steve enjoyed their sandwiches too. Parking and seating can be a bit dicey as we sat at a high bar at the window and watched others hover for an available space. The price was approaching the high end for me ($13 for the sandwich and a bottled water), but I was happy to pay it for such a wonderful lunch.. . They have many salads, side dishes, market and of course, desserts. The Snickers cupcake I had was the best cupcake next to Sprinkles in my opinion. I will definitely come back! Their brownie, old fashioned chocolate cake and flourless chocolate cake were equally delicious - we like dessert in case you didn't notice.. . Non-food related bonus: The bathrooms are exceptionally clean.
