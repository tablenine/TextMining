I like you, Bluebird, but I am not "in like" with you.  . . The wine list is nice, the atmosphere is great, and you were the first place that fed me "slab bacon" which I cannot thank you enough for.  They just seems to be something lacking.... perhaps it is how attentive your staff is?  They are nice, but they only pay attention to me when it suits them.  I am not impatient or high-maintenance, but I want my wine glass to be full.  Always.  The mussels were good, but they weren't nearly as desireable as my other suitor's, The Bristol.   I like you Bluebird, and I will be back... but who knows when.
