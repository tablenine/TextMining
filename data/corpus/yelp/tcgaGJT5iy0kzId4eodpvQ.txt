This place makes the best chicken ever!  Its so moist and flavorful.  I love to top it with the onion salsa that comes with their Jalea and I don't even like onions!  This is the only place that can get me to eat onions.  Everything here is excellent.  They also make great Sangria.  The restaurant itself is narrow (as most NYC restaurants are) and always busy.  Love it!
