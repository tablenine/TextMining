Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
The decision about what to rate Umami burger was a really tough one--harder than usual.  I hadn't heard about it, but happened by around lunchtime, and since I was early for an appointment.  The Umami burger was very good.  But at $8, it didn't come with fries.  They were an additional 3 dollars.  They were good.  But $11?  I don't know.  The garlic potato salad tasted incredible, but the consistency wasn't great.  Maybe because they weren't waxy or red potatoes, but others (including purple) instead.  The "umami" stuff about the burger was good.  But the parmesan cheese wasn't strong enough to hold its own against the meat and portabello.  That said, the place is expensive.  I don't know.  I'd probably come back, next time with booze.  But they really ought to be able to give you a burger and fries, however fancy, for $10.
