Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I live here, so coming to Casa Bianca isn't as big a deal for me as it is for other folks. Â I do love the pizza here &amp; there is a reason for the line folks! It's damn good pizza with a nice crispy crust. I like the old school house salad with oil &amp; vinegar. We also get some toasted Italian bread with garlic. The atmosphere is part of the trip--it hasn't changed much over the years. Cash only &amp; Closed Mondays. If you do have a hateful wait, go up the street 1/2 block to The Chalet and have a lovely drink while you wait. They pour a good drink there! You can usually avoid the line by going early or on a weekday. You can also park behind the hardware store after they close (1/2 block up the street)
