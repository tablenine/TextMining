Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Had the miso broth ramen; spicy level #4 (mild)-- it was good-- but nothing to rave about. The portions were large, prices are fair-- that is until you add on the toppings. I assumed that the ramen came with sliced pork, but to my dismay this would be considered an additional "topping"-- ie. add on $1.50 to my bowl. Very bummed about that-- especially considering the amount you already spend on the ramen itself. The only item I didn't really enjoy in my ramen was the bean sprouts-- only because there was soooooo much that I literally had to push it to the side of my bowl before I could eat the noodles. =[
