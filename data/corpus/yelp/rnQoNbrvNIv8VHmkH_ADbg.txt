Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Jumping from bar-to-bar last night, the conversation kept shifting back to chicken n' waffles, thanks in large part to my roommate's friend who I kept calling "chicken n wapples" (her last name is wapple), &amp; no shit, a dude walking by on the street yelled "ROSCOE'S!" &amp; gave me a high five.. . I should also note that I live in San Francisco.. . Roscoe is a legend. I'd like to shake his hand.
