THIS PLACE IS BETTER THAN DISNEYLAND!  The cheese rolls are addictive; be very, very careful.  The refugiado (cream cheese and guava) is also amazing.  The fruit tart is ridiculously affordable.  Everything is affordable.  The sandwiches are meh.  I love coming here.  The first time I came I pressed my face against the glass coverings and soaked in the awesomeness.  The dulce de leche cookies are SO GOOD!  I think I gained 5 pounds because of this place.
