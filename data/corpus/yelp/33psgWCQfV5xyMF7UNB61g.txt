I love cheese but this place is just out of control. Yes, the views are pretty. Yes, the garden area of the restaurant is cool. NO... the food is absolutely one thousand percent NOT good. The food here is aaaaaawful. It tastes very much like "tourist food" to me. I've been here twice. Both times were on dates with dudes who didn't know me well enough to know that I'm a pretty huge foodie. DO NOT order the sushi. Â If you are even somewhat of a sushi person you will be disappointed. You MIGHT be able to get away with their uninnovative steak and wasabitatoes, but that's about it. . There are soooo many other better restaurants in LA. Don't waste your time friends.
