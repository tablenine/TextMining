Now I know that these guys have some decent burgers but the attitude here sucks! I went here with a friend who has food allergies and they told us that they absolutely would not modify orders at all, the menu is award winning and they will not budge.  When asked what would happen if someone ate something that killed them they casually responded "well you can try to sue us but it wont hold up in court."  You know what guys, the lawsuit might not hold water but Word of Mouth does in this town.  Beat it, in this town you're always a few pounds of ground chuck away from being yesterday's news!
