I don't have anything remarkable to say about this lil' place. I worked right next door for a year or so and never stopped in, after eating there this morning, I don't take that as a total loss.. . Don't get me wrong, the food was fine, the service was exceptional, the music was great. Well, it was thursday morning at 10, I would expect if you were serving breakfast during a weekday you would be on your a-game.. . The coffee was limitless, I had the cornbread french toast which was just enough to be energizing. I prefer this in a sweet breakfast. Too many times you go for the sweet choice and you walk out half asleep hoping to get home as soon as possible to take a nap.. . I'm eager to try this again, and this time go for a savory option, so that MEANS something. Upon first impression though, above average but not a mindblower.
