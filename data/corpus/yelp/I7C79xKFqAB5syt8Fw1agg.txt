I walked in to a near-brawl at Cafe Agora, between Al and a guy who seemed to be a regular. As I didn't catch the beginning of their conversation, I can't say who was in the wrong, but there was definitely some serious anger being thrown back and forth. The customer stormed out in a huff, Al shook things off and smiled.. . There's no direction as to what to do when you come in here. Order at the counter? Wait for a server? Pay before or after? While I'm still not positive of the regular order of things, we ended up placing our orders at the counter and waiting until Al delivered our wonderful, wonderful food to us. We split an order of hummus, and dare I say it was the best hummus to cross my lips. Heaven, and the pita was equally great. My chicken gyro was equally great: well marinated, fluffy pita, and fresh tasty tzatziki. It was a ton of food, but I managed to scarf it down. . . Al brought out some pistachio baklava to end the meal and it was equally divine. He truly is a character and makes the experience all the more fun, just be sure to bring friends who are cool with this kind of thing. Not exactly the spot for stodgy business lunches or first dates.
