Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
A solid American breakfast. I was originally looking for spot in Venice then found U.Bill's on yelp and it was great experience. Sunday morning, the place was slammed on a 45 minute wait but the wait staff were still super friendly and accommodating. Piping hot coffee and outstanding hash browns.
