We spent the weekend in L.A. and went to this place for 2 consecutive days: first for a casual dinner, and then for brunch. Both times I had crab cake (sandwich and benedict) and it was delish. My husband had the fish and chips both times, which he says was the best F&amp;C he's ever had. The presentation was delightful and the food itself did not disappoint. I suggest that they expand the interior as the order process is somewhat chaotic especially for Sunday brunch. The staff were great and very helpful. I was taking pics of my crab sandwich and F&amp;C, and one staffer offered to take our picture. I love this place and would go back anytime. It reminds me of The Ivy without the papparazzi, and yet the environment is unpretentious. Oh, and did I mention the sweet potato fries? You gotta try it.
