A delightful surprise in this off-the-beaten-track location. I happen to work at King Plow Arts Center, so we're always looking for new haunts on the Westside - thank you!  I met a colleague here for business but, two pitchers of margaritas later, we just ended up talking about why men can't pick up their wet towel and why Liza Minelli's eyebrows look so weird.. . Anyhoo, it was jam packed which, honestly, surprised me. I mean, this place is not convenient to anyone except those that work in the building, drunk men and strung-out strippers leaving Body Tap or F&amp;B industry folks going to Restaurant Depot. . . We started with the guacamole and queso - both delicious. Followed this with a cheesey quesadilla that satisfied completely. I will say this, this place is not about the food - it's not going to be a meal you'll remember past the buzz of the tequila.  It is however, a fun spot, with fun people and a great vibe. We sat outside, so I only got to experience it when headed back and forth to go tinkle, but it definitely felt good in there (if not a bit loud - but that's every restaurant in Atlanta). Small, too, which I think is another key to success - smaller places look fuller and busier which equals success in the minds of diners.. . Service was so-so. We were the only table outside, so I'm sure we weren't high on the waitresses list simply because we were out of sight. I'll let it go this time - but if that happened inside, I'd be pissed.. . I will for sure go back, but probably only for lunch. I would never make this drive from Emory for dinner - just not gonna happen.. . Welcome to the neighborhood, Bone Garden - we're glad to have you. Now, can anyone tell me what's up with Liza's 'brows anyway?
