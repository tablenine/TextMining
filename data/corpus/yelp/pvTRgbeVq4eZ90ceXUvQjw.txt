What David D. said. The staff is what carries Fortune Cookie. I had lunch there today. The speed of service was 5 stars and the staff was very friendly. The food came out VERY quickly but it was fairly average [I prefer Chin Chin II]. I had the General Tso Chicken with Hot and Sour Soup. The soup was OK and the Chicken dish was decent--on the plus side, the chicken appeared to be white meat unfortunately it was also swimming in honey based sauce. In short, the dish needed more broccoli and rice and *much* less sauce.. . Again, the food was OK but the service was FAST. Did I mention they were _F_A_S_T_!?_ Â I'll try them again soon.. . Finally, David D., where is better Chinese food in town that you speak of? Still looking for killer Chinese in Atlanta.....
