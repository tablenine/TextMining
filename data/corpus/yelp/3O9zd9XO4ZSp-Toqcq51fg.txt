Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
This is the best Cajun restaurant outside of New Orleans.. . Ever since my visit to New Orleans, all the Cajun restaurants in California were nothing but disappointments. Thus, when my friends invited me to join them for dinner there, I hesitated. . . I am glad I went because The Boiling Crab is not like the other. The food there are as tasty as authentic Cajun food in New Orleans. The catfish was crispy on the outside, soft and moist in the inside. We also ordered the whole she-bang and that was delicious. The sausages, the shrimps, the crawfishes, mmm....finger licking good (figuratively and literally!)!. . Three of my friends has since visited The Boiling Crab because of my recommendation and they all love it. I can't wait to go back there again.. . Con: Long wait during dinner time.. Tips: Go during lunch hours if you can.
