Arterries are clogged. It's all good.... i lived to talk about it. . It's all about Scoes Special #1 and Scoe's Special #2.. Both obviously come with chicken and waffles. The waffles are to die for! #2 comes with their special gravy! Ooooo weeee. I saw a dude in a zoot suit in the parking lot. Like a pimp!
