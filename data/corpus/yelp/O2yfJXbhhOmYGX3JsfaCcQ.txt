ok so i came here one day after a hot day's hike with a friend and my pooch. geared up in hiking shoes, a dirty white t-shirt, work out shorts, and legs covered in dirt, i strolled in to milk to be unpleasantly surprised by photographers shooting something for GQ. ANNOYING.. they were shooting something right next to us outside, completely disregarding us and moving the chairs and table around. finally, being super annoyed and tired, i asked if they needed us to move. of course they said no but kept on moving shit around us like we were in their way and a nuisance. . . ok so whatever- on to the food at the joint. i had their herb roasted chicken sandwich and a salad. nothing memorable, quite bland. the one thing i DO remember is the strawberry shortcake. . http://YUM.it. s served on a biscuit type pastry and was nothing like any strawberry shortcake i'd ever had. next time i come here i'll just stick to their desserts and take it to-go.
