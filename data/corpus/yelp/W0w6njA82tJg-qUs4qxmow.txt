Yo biatch. Gimme a hot dog! You could be the last person in this place and the first one out. It's all a matter of who has the loudest voice and can be aggressive in getting your food. Homie don't play dat if I'm hungry. Their cheeseburgers are quite tasty too. I still give Suzi's the crown of late night!
