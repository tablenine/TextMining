My coworkers and I loved this place.  First off, our waitress was extremely friendly and very patient during my "would you get this or that", "what about this or that."  She recommended her favorite dish and a few others if I were to come another time.  The specials looked really really good as well.. . Nice wine list.  Inexpensive options for a glass of wine, as well as a bottle.  My sangiovese was very good.. . The pizza was amazing.  I liked it better than Pizzeria Mozza.  I know that is heresy in L.A., but its the truth from my point of view.  I liked that the center was not soggy and the edges were not burnt to a crisp.  I had the lemon pasta (it has a fancy name I can't remember.)  It was so light and refreshing (normally oxymoron descriptors for pasta) and I really liked, though it may have too different of a taste for some.. . I also liked the funky, casual interior.. . We can not wait to come back here again!
