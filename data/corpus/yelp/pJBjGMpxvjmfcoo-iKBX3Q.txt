me: one pulled pork sandwich, one grilled chicken and brie sandwich, one ube shake. guy: sorry we're out of ube shakes.. me: ok, one pb&amp;j cupcake. guy: sorry we're out of pb&amp;j too.. me: really? what are you not out of?. guy: it could be worse. we're not out of the food items. . me: X____X. . sigh....i really just wanted something sweet. why'd you have to run out of the two things i really wanted? why?!. . when we got here, the wait was out the door. when is it not right? i expected a pretty long wait but we ordered in about 20 min and got our food quickly thereafter. we also scored seating too! it's really not as crazy crowded as it looks. i am thankful for a short wait. Â  . . with that said, the sandwiches are about a 20 minute wait good. anything more and it's kind of not worth it. maybe the pb&amp;j cupcake will change my mind. i'm hoping that next time i'm here, they'll have the sweets.
