Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
I only recently joined yelp, and made the conscious decision not to go back and yelp about all the places I had been to, but to start anew.  Thankfully I had Papa Cristos for dinner last night so I can yelp about it today.  I've gotten take out from here many times, and it's been delicious every single time.  The gyro is really juicy and flavorful.  The aroma alone will get you, it makes my dog go crazy.  Oh and the pita, it's fluffy and thick, not your average sliced-down-the-middle supermarket kind.  I always get the gyro dinner plate.  The portions are huge, enough for two meals, and a little for your dog.  The cheese pies are good too, flaky, layered pastries.
