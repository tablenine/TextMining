This place is really, really good.  i haven't hung out that much in this part of town recently, so for those of you that haven't been to the new re-developed section of Culver City in the last year or so, you will find that a lot has changed.  great shops, a weekly farmers' market, and a ton of new restaurants.. . i was lucky to be invited to lunch by a friend and i must say that i now have a new westside go-to place that works for a casual lunch, a date dinner, or even a good choice for a group meal for family visiting or a birthday dinner.  i had the pasta with shrimp and asparagus and my friend had the pea ravioli with mint cream sauce... both were perfectly prepared.  great fresh pasta and the execution of the sauces was as good as one could ask for.. . this place also has a very extensive wine list so it's good to either know a good bit about wine or go with someone that does (i fall into the latter category).. . basically, i couldn't recommend this place more highly.  i will definitely try this place again.  so close to 5 stars, definitely 4.5.. . also, the staff is really friendly and knowledgeable.  all in all just a fun place to nosh.
