awesome, just awesome, but beware, it's very expensive. took my friend out for his b-day and the bill somehow came out to $180/person.but honestly, i'll pay it again just for their cheese-bread. . quality of their meats was impressive as well as their wine list Â (according to my friend) i couldn't tell good wine vs 2 buck chuck from Trader Joe's.....just give me scotch damnit.. . best braziliann bbq restaurant i've been too but i will still chose korean bbq over brazilian anyday.
