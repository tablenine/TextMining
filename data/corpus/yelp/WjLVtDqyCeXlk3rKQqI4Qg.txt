Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Went here with my boyfriend last Saturday since he lives around the area and I was craving Korean BBQ.. . The neighborhood it's located in made me doubt the place, but once we were inside, it was a whole different story. The place was clean and something about the decor made me like the place even more.. . The service was a little slow, I think it was because we were seated in the corner, so they weren't able to see us whenever we needed assistance. The workers are really nice though. They helped us cook our meat since we were a little busy watching the Lakers game that was going on.. . The meat was pretty good. We (well, more like I) ordered the Korean BBQ Beef and SooWoon Seasoned Beef Rib. The meet quality was good I would say, and the size was the size of the portions was above average I would say. . . I would say the salad had a different flavor compared to other Korean BBQ restuarants I had been to, not saying it's a bad thing though! The side dishes were pretty good, they served what you would usually get at any Korean BBQ restaurant, except they also served a 'house special' side dish, I really liked that side dish.
