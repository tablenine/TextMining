i never imagined vegan could be so tasty!  this place has choices from everyday vegan to macrobiotic meals.  . the bf and i were introduced to rfd by another couple after a late night at work.  i had the spinach pasta and "meatballs" and the bf had the rfd "burger".  the pasta was yummy, the sauce was even better..the meatballs...out of this world.  made with grains, beans and peppers they were so flavorful that the part of spaghetti and meatballs i ignore and roll off to the side was the part i devoured first.  ken's burger tasted incredible.  the patty was vegan and red in color but it packed quite a bit of flavor and i'd be interested in ordering that for myself sometime.  i should also mention that the cashew cheese is yummy on anything!  the side my bf got with his burger was mashed taters and they were sooooo good!. for dessert we shared the chocolate cupcake (hostess style complete with the white swirl) and the blueberry cobbler with rice cream.  both desserts were yummo!  . on my second trip i tried the veggie wrap, but instead of collard green wrapping i ordered the spinach tortilla.  the guac inside was soooo yummy...next time i'll order more.  the house salad dressing, however...not great.  i most likely will not get that again. . overall....rfd is yummy and i'll return again and again!
