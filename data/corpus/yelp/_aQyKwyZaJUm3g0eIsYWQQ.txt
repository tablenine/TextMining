I had a great experience with this restaurant. First of all, Valet parking is offered for free. Our food came out really quick and the waitress was really nice and did her job well. Food and atmosphere was great. The menu is pretty much only seafood, so this may not be the best place for you if you don't like seafood. I will definitely return to this restaurant.
