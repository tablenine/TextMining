This is absolutely my go-to place.. . I've always had great service (upbeat, attentive but not like stalking-you attentive), the menu is awesome, and the rotating beer selections (and prices) are outstanding.  The pick-up option is pretty quick (about 15 minutes after you call). . Things to try: santa fe chicken sandwich, onion ring things, kettle chips (fresh made chips topped with hot sauce and blue cheese- tasty, just dont make out with anyone after eating them), stuffed turkey burger, ANY burger as long as its on the dark rye bun, black bean soup!, and strawberry chicken salad. . and the 4 layer chocolate cake is the size of a dinner plate.  be sure you're ready to go into a diabetic coma after eating it. it's worth it though!. . The only downside is the kids menu.  I'm fairly certain that the mac and cheese is from that famous blue box..
