Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
cheap, yummy, entertaining and relatively guilt-free. that's what palms thai is. the live entertainment is seriously a hoot. it really does make the dining experience a bit more valuable - seriously! (i'm a sucker for value-added elements, hehehe). the panang curry was pretty good. so was the pad thai and bbq chicken - my only 'iffy' selection was the chinese vegetables dish... could have been less oyster sauce-y. i also liked the chrysanthemum tea but it kind of tasted exactly like the boxed variety at 99 ranch. . . $38 for a 4 course dinner for 3, including beverages (not including tip). what a deal! . . i'm going back - after i try rambuthan thai... then i might edit this review as a sort of compare and contrast kind of thing.
