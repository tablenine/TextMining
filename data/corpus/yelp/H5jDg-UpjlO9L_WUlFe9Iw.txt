Went today and had the best pastrami on rye that I have ever put to these two lips!  The brisket wasn't too bad either.  And to boot is an amazing potato latke that is a beautiful thing.  If I were staying I would be at this place at least once a month.  I will be having Manny's withdrawals in a few days.  Boo!
