Just had dinner here tonight with a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.. . When we first walked in, we were seated right away.  The place was busy but there were tons of seating available, including upstairs.. . Our waiter was super friendly and wasn't too pushy and the best part was that it was Happy hour from 5PM till close!. . At first the prices threw me off because I couldn't believe sushi could be good if it wasn't outrageously priced, however, it was delicious =). . I got the pink roll which was spicy tuna wrapped with salmon and then a tempura roll.  The rolls were the perfect size!  I dislike humongous rolls and the rolls presented were decent sized, a teeny bit on the small side, but I like that.. . Overall - this is my new go to sushi place =)  Its good fish for a decent price!
