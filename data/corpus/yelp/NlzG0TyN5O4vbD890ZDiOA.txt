Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Joy's is my favorite Thai place in a city that Thai places are a dime a dozen. This place is wonderful, great service. You can also order on their website online and save 10%. I eat here at least once a week. My favorite! I especially recommend the panang noodles and the spicy chili noodles.
