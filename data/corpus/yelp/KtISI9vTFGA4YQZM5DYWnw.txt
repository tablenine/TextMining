Yummy Yum Yum!  Japanese tapas with soo many choices.  I've had tofu salad, oden soup, steaks, calamari, grilled fishes, skewered chicken, the wings... ALL is DELISH!!. . Great place to go with a small group and drink, eat, and be merry.  I LOVE this place... just sad that they don't have one in Little Tokyo b/c I would go all the time.. . It does get extremely busy and the wait can be 30-45 minutes sometimes.  So don't go when you are starving, be patient, and the servers have always been fine with me.  No complaints.    Oh some of the tables are close enough to where you can where you're practically in each others conversations.   But who cares... I was more concerned with the food and SAKE.
