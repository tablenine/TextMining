In the five years I've been in Atlanta and of all the choices I have near L5P I keep wandering into this place.  . . It's odd, it's sometimes creepy, the music is loud and the food is good.  Every time I drop in there is always something new hiding in the decor I didn't notice before, and I can honestly say I have not had a crappy experience there.  . . The only reason I don't dish out five stars is the seating situation can sometimes be very dire and you'll barely have enough room to move when it's packed full.  The upstairs patio is poorly designed and you will be forgotten about up there but overall not a bad place to go for a decent burger.
