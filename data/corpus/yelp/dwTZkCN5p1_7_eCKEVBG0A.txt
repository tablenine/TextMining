Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Myself and two friends were eagerly awaiting trying this restaurant, as we have seen umpteen great reviews and were super pumped.  I ordered the Umami burger the way it came, my friend ordered the SoCal burger with skinny fries, and my other veg friend ordered the veggie burger with fat fries.  Here's the summary: this place is a victim of overhype, as having such high hopes resulted in a big letdown.  The "five senses" they speak of basically can be summed up in one: SALTY.  Everything is so sodium-laden, you'll have to drink like 5 glasses of water upon leaving or you'll have serious gut rot (which 2 of us had anyway).  On the Umami burger, there is so much ketchup that you can't taste the meat, and on the SoCal burger there is so much cheese (same result).  Also, the bread is saturated with butter and the burger, in general, is oozing with grease. Note:  you might want to consult your doctor before dining here.
