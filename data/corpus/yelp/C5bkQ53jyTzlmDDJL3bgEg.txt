Met a friend here last night for the first time. Immediately I noticed the "club beat" type music-which I liked- and cute decor. . Our waiter was a bit odd and the chairs were uncomfortable, but the food was good. . It was just a quick meal, so only an entree for each of us. No appetizer or dessert. . I would go back with friends to try more of the expansive menu.
