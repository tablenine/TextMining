Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
Incredible food set in a posh setting like the historic Beverly Wilshire is what the Cut is all about.  Great ambiance.  The extensive wine list compliments every aspect of the menu and covers a wide range to fit any palate or budget (for a steakhouse).  Service is extremely professional yet a little too sterile. The servers own personality should shine through in making recommendations and describing the food.  Unbelievable selection of quality Japanese Kobe as well as American Kobe and U.S.D.A choice cuts.
