I had an interview in Little Tokyo, and I thought I'd look up a yummy place nearby for lunch. I came all the way from San Diego, and Sushi Gen did not disappoint!! The line was so long and we barely made the cut since they close at 2pm. We were 3 minutes past closing but I begged the host to add us on and he conceded. It was a good start already.... . We were seated and a little rushed by the waitress, but understandable and nothing to complain about since they squeezed us in before closing. We got the Ankimo (monkfish liver) appetizer, the Sushi Deluxe and the Sashimi Deluxe.. . The Ankimo dish was amazing!! Great presentation, just the right amount of ingredients and garnish. YUM.. . The Sushi Deluxe was nothing to rave over. The Sashimi Deluxe, on the other hand, WAS AMAZING! It's presentation, quality, variation, and value were great for $30 that was well worth it. The sushi bar chefs were so funny and nice too, they kept entertaining us! They put prawn heads on their fingers and did a puppet show, and when they presented us with our Sashimi Deluxe, they all gathered and ooohed and aahhed: "Sashimi Deluxe....oooooooOOOOOhhh". . They were friendly too when I kept asking what this was and what that was :). . My bf and I were stuff and completely satisfied. They recommended a good sake as well. Would love to go back!
