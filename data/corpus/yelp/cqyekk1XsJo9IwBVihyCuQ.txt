I think this place is a bit overrated, and I'm not a huge fan of trendy hipster places that are hip for the sake of being hip. There is no sign outside, so you have to be "in the know" to come here. The parking lot is tiny which is annoying but there is also street parking with meters so it's not horrible. Cash only is a pain especially when you are pho-ing spur of the moment. and I hate waiting in line for 20 min to get a table, which sucked. . . The broth was pretty good, and huge portions made the higher prices ($7-8) for pho almost worthwhile. Lots of noodles was nice, I wasn't able to finish the whole serving, because it was about the size of a large, and I usually get a regular. I ended up with the beef balls in my pho Â along with the rare beef and tendon i ordered, so bonus?? My Vietnamese iced coffee was DELICIOUS but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up as far as I've seen. The eggrolls looked good and so did the other noodle bowls and stuff that other people in my party ordered. I'd definitely come here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to drive all the way to silverlake just for this. Quality wise, the pho was the same as at Pho99 in west LA.
