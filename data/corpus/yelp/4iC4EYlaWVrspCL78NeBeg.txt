Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
I'm officially done with Comme Ca.  I didn't like dinner there, my first visit, but read several good reviews for breakfast/brunch on Chowhound, so wanted to give that a try.  At first I thought, yeah, it seems better than the dinner I had, but in clearer hindsight, it's only better for brunch because the prices are lower.. . Had the croque madame and a bloody mary.  I love the bar and drinks at Comme Ca, but that bloody mary was a huge disappointment.  It was weirdly sweet and I could barely taste the vodka.  The toast for the croque was so over toasted, it was all dried out and it was a real fight cutting that thing.  Plus all that chewing.. . Here's the kicker: there were flies--FLIES buzzing around the whole time.  They decided to throw open the windows, which let in multiple flies, which hung out with us all through brunch.  GROSS.  Disgusting.. . Ok, so the Intelligentsia coffee was good, the brunch service was good, and I still like the non-bloody mary drinks.  Therefore the 3 stars.. . Have no desire at all now to try Sona.
