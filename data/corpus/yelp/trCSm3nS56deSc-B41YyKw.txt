Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
My Korean BBQ experience is very limited, so I'm by no means an authority.  I came here after first going to the KBBQ festival which was a total clusterfuck.  After 5 minutes of that I had to have some KBBQ because the shit smelled so good at the festival but I was not waiting in line for it so I just hopped in the car and came here.. . I opted for the short rib and it was very good, nice and tender and flavorful.  My head was spinning with all the sides and I wasn't quite sure what everything was (one of my Asian friends could have come in handy at that point), but I figured out my favorites.. . Would definitely like to go back with someone well-versed in the ways of KBBQ.
