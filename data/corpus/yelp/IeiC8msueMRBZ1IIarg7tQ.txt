i've had a long standing affair with salted cured meats, namely that vixen named pastrami.. . before i could drive i would make my parents take me to the local delis, the jerry's the roxy's, canter's. all good pastrami. . . when i got my license, i began to explore what culinary treasures this city had to offer, but for years never thought about there being such a pastrami sandwich, head and shoulders above the rest. . . first, as much as i like good service, i seem to like good service exponentially more when it's not an american serving me. the charm isn't there, like when my ukrainian server took my order and served me the most glorious sandwich i've ever explored with all 5 of my senses, all between smoke breaks. i sometimes feel like you should be scared of the person helping you, and there's nothing like a ukrainian woman to handle that objective. . . on to the food itself. wow. thickest cuts of pastrami i have ever seen. perfectly cured, salted, temperature. the rye was just the right amount of crispy on the outside and so soft and warm on the inside. heavenly.
