Restaurant: Over Easy Caf√©
Category: American (Traditional)
This is the best place ever!!!!!!!!. . It is so laid back and has the most amazing food! They aren't stingy with anything! Huge salads, massive burgers, and the pancakes cover the whole plate. Whatever is on the specials list... get it! Always incredible!. . And if the great food wasn't enough, the chef/owner came out of the restaurant after we had left to tell us thank you for coming in. Who knew people were still that decent?!. . I AM IN LOVE WITH OVER EASY!!!!. . P.S. Phil down there is an idiot, there are lines of people that stretch for a long time waiting to get in, common sense would say.... move it along, you're no special than anyone else.
