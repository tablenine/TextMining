Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Fortunately this place's reputation for exceptional steak is well-deserved.   The Prime Porterhouse for 2 is definitely the way to go - tender on the inside (assuming you get it medium rare) and tasty, grilled &amp; peppery flavor on the outside. . . Not being big into red wines, we ordered a white.  It was a Spanish wine (Pazo Senorans - Albarino 2005 (Rias Baixas)) with a crisp and refreshing flavor.. . The only disappointing part of the dinner was the dessert.  We got the parfait, which was really below average vanilla ice cream with some praline, whip cream and chocolate syrup on top.   I'll take my Dairy Queen over that any day!!  As high end as this place is, I expected more.  . . Overall it's worth the trip if you love beef.
