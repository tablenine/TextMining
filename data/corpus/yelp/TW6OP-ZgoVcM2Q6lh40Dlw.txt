Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
Ping pong was delicious! It has an extremely extensive Asian fusion menu... lots of Chinese and Thai dishes to choose from. I had the kung pao shrimp and it was delicious, very light, and a Gossip Girl martini which was also great. I used to work at PF Changs and they literally had like every dish that Changs offers on their menu which was slightly strange but they tasted completely different so I was OK with that. it is a small restaurant, very modern d√©cor. I was having extreme food envy with everyone's dishes and everyone I was with loved the place!
