Soooo good. So very, very good.. . I've only been there once, when the GF took me for my birthday. My wish is that they didn't have to be so expensive. But alas, they are. However, if you want a special night out, get your reservations and go. . . A meal consists of stages of increasingly large dishes, going from appetizers up through a main course. Small plates, perfect for sharing and sampling. And I'm the kind of person who'd rather have a little great food than a big ol' plate of mediocre food. Great combinations of flavors, using seasonal (and local-ish) ingredients. Presentation is wonderful, from the ambience on. It was a packed house when we were there, but our table felt like its own little island. Service is pleasant and efficient.. . I can't wait til I have one of those "full-time job" things that people talk about so I can afford to come back here more.
