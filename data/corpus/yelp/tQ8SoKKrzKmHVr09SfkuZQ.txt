TGs is simplicity done right, and to order. Although the line to the street may be daunting, i feel like it moves pretty well, as the salad-iers (that's what i call them in my head) hand-toss (with their hands, in gloves of course!) a wide selection of fresh salads. They do a few hot-plates &amp; sammys too. Oh, and soup!. . Me? what do i order? Well, everything looks &amp; sounds so good, yet i always wimp-out and go for the same salad every time, their Nioise. Now I'm not sure if it is just the fresh-grilled ahi, the super dressing or the fingerling potatoes, but this salad always makes me 1) happy and 2) actually full &amp; not savagely hungry 2 hours later. (c'mon, you know what i mean. A salad is usually the perfect meal if you are eating again within three hours).. . Another plus is the beer &amp; wine menu; nice, light pairings for your healthy meal.
