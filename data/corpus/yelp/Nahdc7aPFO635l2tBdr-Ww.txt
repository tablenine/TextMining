Well I went in with pretty low expectations and was still underwhelmed.  That pretty much sums it up.  Bad to mediocre samosas. Underflavored bindi chaat. The naan was more like flatbread than yummy fluffy naan.  The lamb rogan josh was slighty off.  Saag aloo was pretty good, the large chunks of dried red chili pepper helped give it some heat.  The tamatar had a lot of flavor..just not good flavor.  As I was leaving, I overheard the host turn away a couple without a reservation and it actually made me terribly, terribly sad.  With all the wonderful, delicious Indian restaurants in the city, I really can't understand why people would choose this place.  Don't get me wrong, the service was great and the restaurant is nicely decorated.  But for me, when I go out to eat, FOOD is above all the most important part.  I'd rather have 5 star food with 2 star service, rather than the other way around.  I guess those who can only enjoy Indian food in a super sterilized environment will still continue to go.  But those who actually enjoy the deep, satisfying flavors of real Indian food should look elsewhere.
