This is going to be short and sweet...maybe. . . Pros: . Great Tomato's on the caprese salad . Mozzarella cheese was good... . . Cons: . Totally over priced...I seriously felt like I had be DUPED! . Pizza crust was paper thin and bland as all hell. . Completely over hyped by transplants with stars in their eyes for anything celebrity.
