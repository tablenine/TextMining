A star each for the following:. . Ambiance. Decor. Location. . Other than that, the food was mediocre at best. Â The s.o. says the food is similar to Maki Yaki or Maki Maki.....hell...you get the point.. . Thats ok though, its a nice effort on the Dolce Group....you cant be good at everything, and just having star affiliations doesnt make it a great restaurant.
