Restaurant: South City Kitchen Midtown
Category: Southern
South City Kitchen is FANTASTIC! The setting is so very classy, quaint and cozy, just oozes with sophistication with those lilly white table cloths on those intimate little tables. As soon as I sit down at the table, without a shadow of a doubt I have to start off with the chicken livers and carmelized onions appetizer for starters. Yum! The buttermilk fried chicken is by far numero uno with me. Wouldn't want to eat all of that everyday unless you want to have congestive heart failure and your cholesterol to go through the roof...LOL...but I always make an exception for this restaurant and this dish. Of course they have many other things on the menu, but this is just my favorite. South City Kitchen is definitely a nice romantic place to take date also.
