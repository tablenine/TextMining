Restaurant: The Water Grill
Category: Seafood
Probably the finest prepared seafood in Los Angeles that is not Japanese. Elegant decor, with impeccable service. Location is a little edgy being downtown but worth the drive. Water Grill is one of those restaurants where getting dressed up and dining with family and/or friends will be a wonderful memorable evening. A+
