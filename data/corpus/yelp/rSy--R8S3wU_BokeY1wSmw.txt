I just want to update my 5 stars with another 5 stars review. We came here with gramps and cousins from out of town. There are 10 of us. We got there around 11:30am-noon, and got seats right away. The service was excellent. The waiters were attentive especially to grandparents. One guy was walking around chatting up customers, I think is the manager, kept coming around asking us if everything is good, very friendly. The food was excellent. We got the usual stuff, lobsters, clams, fresh fish (a little small, but we got two portions), french beef, a few veggies, and a chicken and shrimp dish. I think we had total of 9 dishes. Everyone was stuffed and happy. Great service, great food, and the bill came down to be around ~$250 which was not bad at all for 10 people with a large size lobster. Highly recommended.
