Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
I recently came here for brunch with a friend and had a great experience, and I've been here a few times.. . I love the way this place feels like a small little restaurant without feeling cramped. I also really like how it is decorated, making you feel at home.. . The food is amazing here! I got the Katie Cakes, which were delicious. My friend got the Breakfast Casserole, which were also incredible. Even though I was completely stuffed, I got some cupcakes to go to bring back to my roommates. We had the orange creamsicle, boston creme pie, and moon pie cupcakes. All three were wonderful! . . Each time I've come here, I've really enjoyed my experience, and I know that my friends who have joined me have felt the same way! Definitely worth going to if you're going to be in the Andersonville neighborhood.
