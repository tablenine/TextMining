$10 valet parking zOIKS!??!  I guess you pay to have a chance to wait for your car next to the likes of Reba McIntyre (who was there but I missed because I street parked it and hiked 4 blocks away).  Might be cheaper just to get an oil change across the street at Jiffy Lube and tip the guys over there to hold onto your car for an hour. . . Definitely the best pizzas I've tasted in terms of flavor.  Texture was typical... nuttin' real special.  Some of the pizzas here are just bursting with amazing flavors.  Some others not so much.  The 5 of us each ordered a pizza... that's it and that's all.  Mi Familia style yo.  Unfortunately, all these froo froo pizzas have names that I can't and never will remember.  So coming from a customer who speaks normal menu English, I recommend the following... . . 1.)     The Meat Lovers...  Just look at the pizza with the most amount of meat on it and you've found it.  Really rich in meat flavors.  Perfect starter. . 2.)     The Mushroom Pizza... Look for the one that says "fungus" or whatever.  They say that digestion begins with your nose and the aroma of this one was something to inhale. . . 3.)     The Breakfast one...  Bacon and a raw egg splashed on top.  Gives you exactly what you crave for.  Go ahead and try putting on some Farmer Johns links on top of a Di Giorno.  It won't be the same.        . . I would avoid the cheaper ones next time like the Margarita one.  The price wasn't bad, especially sharing between 5 of us, and just downing straight pizza.  A little too loud and a little too packed.  Crank out a delivery or take-out system and I'll be sold.
