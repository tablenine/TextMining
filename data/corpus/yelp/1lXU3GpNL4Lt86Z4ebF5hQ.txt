Hi, Canter's! You're not very good, are you?. The most this place has going for itself is that it's open 24 hours. Apparently that means that they never have off hours to clean up the place or cook good food. Maybe close the place for an hour or two, Canter's?. . Yes, in some ways, it is an LA institution. You can read all sorts of accounts of famous musicians running over here after a gig during the 60's folk rock or the 80's hair metal days. Kudos to them for not going out of business. And yes, they have cantankerous old women slinging coffee who have been there for 30 years. But guess what? That's not an oddity in most parts of the country. If you want crabby waitresses who have hated their lives to serve you bland bagels and pickles on greasy plates, I can take you to any truck stop town in the midwest. But why come here and fork over a boatload of money for it? So you can feel as if you're a part of history? . . At 3 am, I'd rather deal with the hipsters at Fred 93.46 or Swingers to get some good food.
