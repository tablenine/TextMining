Update:  I came here last Saturday and food was consistently good.  I am impress with the mussels and chorizo--generous portions and tasty.  Wonderful service-- they held our table for an extra 30 minutes after I called them to let them know we were running late.  . . I had a lovely dining experience here last night.  It was intimate and cozy and food was wonderful.  Since we were planning to have a light dinner we ordered the Spanish cheese plate ($13), a steal for decent quality of cheeses , also the patatas fritas and my favorite dessert there- churros and mexican chocolate.  And the best part, no corkage fee, so you can bring your wines and not get overcharged!   Also, the servers were attentive and friendly.   I definitely would go here over the one on Hollywood Blvd because it has a more intimate ambience and friendlier service.. . Caveat: (8/25).  We returned to Cobras last night.  If you don't want to be around  tons of  loud, obnoxious, drunken  teeny-bops, this is not the place to go .  These obnoxious people definitely took advantage of the free corkage- I saw one person take out her wine from a Trader Joes bag. What happened to this place?!!!    Unfortunately, b/c of this experience, I will not be returning to this location anytime soon, maybe I'll start returning to the Los Feliz location.
