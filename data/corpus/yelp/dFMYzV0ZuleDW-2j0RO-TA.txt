Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Came today for a late lunch and it was packed!  It was my very first time and a very good experience all in all.. . My friend and I ordered the Half Spicy Fried Rice and each a bowl of ramen.  I was told that Orochon 4 was the best level of spice by all my friends who frequented the restaurant.  However, I do like spice A LOT.  (If you've had the 'atomic' wings at Wing Stop, you'll understand my comparisons.  I've had those and made it through some rough pains.)  I ordered the IMPACT Orochon 3 and my friend had the Orochon 4, both in miso broth.  . **Miso broth is healthier for you and tastes a lot better in my opinion.**. . The spicy fried rice was pretty delicious!  The spice kinda sneaks up on you and it's done very well.  As for my ramen, it was very good!  I wasn't overwhelmed by the spice, but I did taste its presence.  It was a very good balance.  I can't give more stars because the ramen was simply noodles, excessive broth and excessive bean sprouts.  I guess I was expecting more than 5 pieces of bamboo and 2 pieces of pork...I think you're allowed to add more to your bowl for additional prices, but...paying more than $7 for a bowl of ramen is pretty ridiculous to me.  . . SIDE NOTE: A guy sitting next to us attempted the challenge of Orochon Special #2.  I think he failed. :(  There are pictures of many successes, and I was saddened that most of them were men.  More women to step up to the plate?
