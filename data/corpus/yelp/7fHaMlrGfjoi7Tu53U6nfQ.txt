OMG Heaven is a slice of pizza....or maybe it was just a pepperoni that looked like the Pope....but whatever, this pizza is divine!  I ate my entire pizza and was even temped to ask for a bite from all my neighbors' pizzas. Everything looked SO good!! Our neighbors at the table next to us (actually in my lap - be prepared to get cozy with fellow diners) got a salad that looked fab. i was drooling...... . Besides all the gorgeous pizzas, the apps looked really good too! I first thought my friend was on drugs when he suggested the squash blossoms - but no, drugs were not to blame for this selection. Let me tell you, they were amazing.  Good wine, good apps, good pizza, good vibe, good mozza. I'm in love.  I couldnt read half the words on the menu, but the waitress was super friendly and helpful with the translations. She even described our artichoke pizza as delicate and beautiful! I didnt realize that baked dough covered with toppings could be delicate, but now I know, now I know...... . Just a heads up, it gets SUPER packed. so make reservations or be prepared to wait a bit.
