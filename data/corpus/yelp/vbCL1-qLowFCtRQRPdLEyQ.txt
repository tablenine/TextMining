Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
This place gets a plus on account of having outdoor seating, as in the Andersonville area spacious outdoor seateries are somewhat scarce. . . I've ordered a couple of things from this establishment, mostly in the realm of hamburgers. Last time I was there I ordered the Guacamole BJ (bacon and jack cheese), very bashfully. In fact, I sort of trailed off at the "BJ" part and the waiter excitedly finished my sentence for me. I'm all for sexual innuendo, but when it comes to my food I really don't want to be thinking about Guacamole BJ. Are you going to serve the sauce in condoms or maybe tubes like KY comes in? . . The staff is generally friendly and helpful. I went there on a night where there was a margarita special and me thinks it was premixed Sauza. It was just "ok." Â . . The thing that I simultaneously like and dislike is the presentation of the burger. It's as if the chef or cook finished it and then FINISHED IT stabbing it in the heart with a steak knife. When they bring you your burger the handle is protruding from the bun. Well why not just cut it if that's what you're inferring? I don't know, I'm weird I guess. . . But really the food is just alright, pretty average and a bit pricey for what you eat. If you want a really good burger in the Edgewater area go for Edgewater or Moody's.
