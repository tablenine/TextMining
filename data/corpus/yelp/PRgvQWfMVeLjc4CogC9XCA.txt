I usually don't like eating things that rhyme with my name.. . But today, I had one of their peanut butter banana cupcakes...and oh lordy was I a happy bunny!. . I've always loved every delectable dessert I've gotten here, from their special Jeannie's Cake (very fruity and weighs like 40lbs) to their chocolate iced creme puffs.  *insert drool here*. .

Oh, and their answer was *insert eyeroll here*
