Dear Crust,. . Gave you another shot and I'm still a fan!  This time my party of 3 split the shroom pizza (yum) and another pizza with eggplant (double yum).  However, I was disappointed to see the sun salad is no longer on the menu!  We tried the winter salad and it's nowhere as good as the sun salad. Please add it back to the menu; we all could use a little sun in the winter.  And while you're at it bring back the banana cake too!. . I'll be back...even sooner if that sun salad reappears!. .
