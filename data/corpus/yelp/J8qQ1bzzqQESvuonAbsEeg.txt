How do I love thee, let me count the ways.  Just about everything that I have tried at Portos has been fabulous.. . The chocolate croissant is to die for.  Flaky, buttery pastry with a nice chocolate filling.  I just can't imagine it getting it better, but it does.  How's that you ask?  Well, they finish the croissants off by dipping both ends in chocolate.. . The guava cheese turnovers seem to be the "signature" pastry, with its sweet and tangy mixture of guava and cheese filling.. . The potato balls are big raquetball sized pillows of mashed potatoes coated in a cheesy bread crumb mixture.  They are then quickly deep fried, I think, to give it a nice crunchy outside and smooth as silk on the inside.  At the heart of the potato ball is a nice mixture of ground beef that sort of tastes like chili.. . The only thing that has been subpar is the Cubano sandwich.  It wasn't as crunchy as it should have been but still very tasty.
