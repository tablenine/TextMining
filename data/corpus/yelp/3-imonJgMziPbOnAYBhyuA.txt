When I first stepped foot in the place I started getting a little worried as the place was filled with scenesters. I was thinking this was going to be a menu filled with designer rolls and people proud that they can use chop sticks and know a handful of words in Japanese. Once we got seated at the bar we started to order simple stuff (salmon, sea urchin, scallops, etc). The fish was fresh, but I have had just as good at lower prices. For whatever reason the chef must of sensed we were not looking for baked/honeyed/japenoed/etc sushi and made us a few things that were not on the menu (the type of stuff you don't eat with soy sauce) and I was quite impressed with what he put together. I give the chef (Leo) 5 stars, but the restaurant 3-4 stars. If you love designer rolls (and don't mind paying a little more) then you'll probably love the place.
