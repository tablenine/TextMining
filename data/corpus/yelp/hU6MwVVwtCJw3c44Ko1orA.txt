There are few brasseries I would compare to my east coast fave haunt, Balthazar, but, Comme Ca comes close. I actually would give it 3 1/2 stars, except I can't figure out how to rate a 1/2 star.... I do agree it's pricey, but, it is W. Hollywood and it is impressively staffed for its size so in all fairness, their fresh produce, seafood, ingredients etc have to beckon a higher cost.. It's great for gal-pal gatherings, mom/sister dates and couple rendezvous. . Their desserts are from Boule, that is a definite ++ and their lunch menu offers up satisfying, reasonable dishes. Do not pass up their salmon tartare appetizer - oh so rich and fresh!. If you are wary of their prices, try to hit them up for the next Dine L.A. event when they offer prix fixe menus at a discount.
