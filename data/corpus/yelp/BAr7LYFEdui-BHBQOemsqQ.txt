Great location.  Phenomenal view of Los Angeles.  Would definitely take friends from out of town here.  Great way to see Hollywood.  Food is actually a lot better than it used to be.  Portions are very filling.  There's a bar there for drinks at night.  Very well done decorating.  Valet parking is very easy.
