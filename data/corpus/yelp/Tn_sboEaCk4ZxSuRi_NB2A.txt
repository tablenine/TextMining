Okay.  This is the oldest Korean restaurant in Chicago for a reason: food.  The atmosphere, service, location, parking can improve big time.  However, I come here for the best nangmyun and cha dol bae gi.  The reason why I give this place 5 stars is simple.  It cannot be beat in the quality of the food.  This is the best Korean restaurant in Chicago, hands down.  If the food is okay, I would never come here because other factors suck.  The service is horrible unless you speak Korean and wait sucks.  However, if you notice that when Koreans wait in line for a table, you know that this place is authentic and good.  I would not recommend this place to introduce Korean food to non Koreans as it requires a deep understanding and appreciation for authentic Korean cuisine to take it all in.  Heck!  I'm still developing my palate for the nyangmyun.
