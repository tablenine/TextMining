I went here with a friend who traveled from Irvine to LA (~30 miles) to eat here EVERY WEEK for an entire year. That definitely says something about not only the food but about a kind of familiarity that people like to establish when it comes to mom and pop shops. . . The restaurant is small and cozy. There are no tables; you can only sit behind a horseshoe shape countertop that surrounds the grill, cashier and other employees scurrying around. There's a very 1950's feel to it and they even use an old fashioned cash register, probably one that's been there since it's opening in 1947.. . I've heard rumors that the wait can be pretty long but ours was only for about 15 minutes. Of course it is a bit awkward to stand around considering that the place is relatively small. I was tempted to stare at people eat to encourage them to hurry up.. . I ordered the regular cheeseburger which is topped with Tillamook cheddar (one of my favorites) and barbeque sauce. The meat patty was good but not too seasoned. The fries were tasty, nothing out of the ordinary. When the waiters bring it out, they even pour your ketchup for you. . . Luckily, we each wanted pie so I was able to taste the apple pie (what they're known for), pecan pie and boysenberry pie. I don't prefer any of these fruits/pies so my opinion is fairly unbiased when I say that I enjoyed the pecan pie the most. However, it did come out a little lukewarm (I like it piping hot!). It definitely took some effort to make room in my second stomach for dessert though.. . I think this restaurant's strong point is definitely the fresh ingredients in each and every item, not necessarily it's superb ability to season the meat or it's unique menu variety. It's a cute place to take someone for a casual meal.
