I like fried chicken but I'm not big on waffles, so my review may be a little ironic. I never planned on trying the place out but today, against my will, my boyfriend thought he would take me.. . My first thoughts on their chicken? Just "okay." People hyped this place up a little too much so I guess I expected more. The fried chicken is nothing I can't find at a local grocery store or anywhere else for that matter. The fries were horrible; dry and bland. I have to admit though that their waffles were awesome; soft and fluffy! The only reason I'd ever go back is if someone I was hanging out with wanted to eat there. What can I say? I'm a people pleaser :)
