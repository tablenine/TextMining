When I heard that my family wanted to come here, I kind of panicked.  The reason being is that there was 5 of us.  For those of you know have been here before, you can kind of feel me on this one.  Not that it's impossible, but getting a table for anything more than a party of 4 is near impossible.  Perhaps the first 2 tables when you first walk-in can fit 5 most of the time, but beyond that, because of the bar, would make it a very tight squeeze.. . When we eventually got seated, which didn't seem terribly long despite having 5 people, I already knew what I was going to have.  I was going to get the Daikoku ramen, and decided to get the combo with fried rice.  My brother and sister in law had never been here before, so they obviously both got the ramen.  My sister in law got the kotteri flavor, which was hard to describe, but it was different in a good way.  My dad got the kotteri as well and my mom got the regular.. . My fried rice came out first I pretty much devoured it.  I mean, it is a smaller plate, but yeah, I practically inhaled it.  I think it's this diet I'm on.  I have flashes of gluttony.. . Everything was good as usual.  Oh man, just thinking about it now makes me want some.  My mom is absolutely in love with the broth, so much, that she brought home her leftover broth.  She had finished all the noodles, and just had the broth, but she still took it home.  I think it's still sitting in our freezer....
