Restaurant: Shout
Category: Bars
Shout is in need of a Gordon Ramsey makeover... . Someone from the group suggested Shout for dinner because it was just around the corner from the W Hotel we were staying at - what a mistake. . it was a Thursday night about 8 PM, there were only 2 other tables of 2 people in the entire restaurant. I should have known better when I saw the sign by the front door "all you can eat sushi lunch for $10". . . The menu is a hodgepodge of sushi, sashimi, pizza, and TGIF. . The fish special I had was over cooked and under seasoned and the BF had a Shrimp and Andouille Pasta, neither were appetizing but we ate it because we were starving and didn't want to seem rude because we were with people from BF's work.. . By 10PM, just as we've all paid our bills, they turned off all the light and were ready to kick us out.. . NEVER AGAIN!!!!!
