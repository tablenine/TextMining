The one problem is that they will only hold reservations for fifteen minutes (although we got them to hold it for 30 minutes the other night!).. . The wine is byob- I believe it is $4 per bottle.. . Great dishes:. -the socca cakes (with either topping). -crispy lentils (amazing). -bacon wrapped dates. -beet salad is amazing. -wood fired mushrooms. -asparagus (pretty good). -the risottos are usually good. -the steak with cucumber is good too. . desserts:. -churros are great. -chocolate panna cotta is amazing. . The only thing I didn't like was the eggplant bruschetta.
