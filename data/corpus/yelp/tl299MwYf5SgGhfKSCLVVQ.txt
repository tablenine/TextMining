I love Moody's when it's cold out. Fireplace, dark wood everywhere, cheap wine, hamburger. Yes, yes, yes and yes. The patio in the summer has a lot to offer, spacious, also has the tasty hamburger and cheap wine, but for me it is best to go in the dead of winter. And don't forget to hit up their web site for money saving coupons as my dinner companion did....
