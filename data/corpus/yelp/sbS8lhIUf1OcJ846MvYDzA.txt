Sunday Brunch with the ladies.... We waited, and waited, and waited.. Finally got a table and had a hard time choosing from the extremely extensive menu.. We waited, and waited, and waited.. FINALLY!  My waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Very good! Very huge! All the ladies had many bites.. Their food, however, was ok...not really anything to write home about...even the oreo pancake that I had really high hopes for was just ok... We waited, we waited for the check.. . I don't think I want to wait and wait like this again.
