After practically a year of getting a menu under my door for this place, i finally tried it. I think part of the reason i never did is because i was so annoyed at the free flowing menus being slid under my door. But i moved, therefore didn't have to deal with it anymore. Ok enough about that. The food. Loved it. We both had the pad see eiu -- that's always been my bf's go-to thai dish, and i never got to try it because he makes it so damn spicy. So finally i decided to get my own, and i loved it. I was so disappointed with myself the next day because I thought while i was eating it that i would save leftovers for the next day, but clearly i was a hog. Delivery was quick and efficient, price is great. They have good coupons too, so always use one! You know where you can find them? On the menu ...which is probably being slid under your door, as we speak.
