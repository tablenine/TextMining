Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
After trying a few "hot n spicy" ramen places, I decided to forgo my own digestive system and go for it. I ordered the #1 and it was perfect for me. No additional chili oil was needed along with my miso ramen. Ordered the cold tofu which came a bit on the sour side, so -1 star for that. We arrived here right at 11:30 and there were lots of peeps waiting already. "Should I stuff myself and not enjoy the tofu festival?" I thought.......hella ya. Bring on the ramen. Ended up eating 1.5 full so my sumo belly said "ding" (meaning its DONE). Great broth and the pork was fantastic. Not too fatty but shreds with the lightest touch.. Wash it all down with a can of green tea and caffine kicks in. Tofu festival, here I come!!!!
