Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
I love Brick Store. Makes me happy every time a friend suggests it for a Friday night out. Dauntingly large list of beers, if you are picky and/or not adventurous, find a kind you like and remember it, because some of the beers are definitely more interesting/distinctive/weird than others! But their list is always an education in hops.. . Put your name in for a table when you get there, but it'll take like 45 min or so, and in that time, you can head on upstairs to the attic and stand around and drink beer. The whole place has a very cozy feel, and it's fun to stand around and drink beer in awesome glasses with your friends of course! Food is also pretty good if you find you want something after a few Heffeweizens.. . Kind of out of the way of life...but totally worth it.
