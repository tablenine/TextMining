LOVE love this place! . . The food is extremely affordable, absolutely delicious (I recommend the Melrose salad), and the wait staff is friendly and fast. . . The ambience is romantic/fun/casual, with the patio being the best place to eat. They serve bread with an oil/pesto when you sit down (which is amazing), and have great sangria - as long as you don't like it too strong, which is isn't - at all.
