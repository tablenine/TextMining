Don't you think the test of good food is when you're full and can't help but eat more of it? Cause honestly, when i'm hungry...ANYTHING can taste good.  So I did the test today, my family and I had some chow fun as an 'appetizer' at around 6pm before our drive out to Rosemead (we're near Hollywood).  We arrived at 7:15pm with 30 people already in line,  waited 2 hours before we received our food and let me tell you, I was super excited because I heard good reviews from friends and the smell from the truck was mouth-watering. But after the first bite, I was a bit disappointed...literally the kogi truck is a mix between Mexican and korean food.. . 1) The Short Rib tacos ($2/each) was simply a flour tortilla (not warmed or anything) wrapped in a sweetly marinated cabbage and meat.  The flour tortilla didn't complement the meat well.  My palate was expecting tomatoes, salsa, cheese, and carne asada, NOT something sweet. But after a few more bites, I got used to the new combination.. . 2) Kogi sliders ($5 for 2)- these are simply mini-burgers with the same meat as the marinated meat and cabbage above. . . 3) Kimchi quesadilla ($5 each) - which is kimchi and cheese with a spicy sauce on top.  Smells divine, and the spicy, tangy and cheese works somehow.  Brought an extra one for my mom because she loves kim chi.. . Recommendations:. - Definitely come here if you've never tried this before!  You can meet people in line and the anticipation is exciting! And where else can you find a kimchi quesadilla!. - Don't come with too much expectation. - Arrive early, at least 45 minutes or you'll be waiting for a LONG time. - Bring water or buy water.  The food makes you really thirsty afterwards. - Bring cash.
