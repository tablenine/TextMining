I wish it was closer, or that it would be open on Sunday's since our church is right around the corner. . . We think the nachos are the best!!!! Yummy! The Fish taco is also excellent.  We tried the sesame fries for the first time today, and they are definitely worth a shot.  The chipotle ketchup that comes with it is a nice sauce for the fries.  . . I got the beef burrito today, and I love the kimchi fried rice that's in the burrito.  . . It's a little on the salty side overall, but I enjoy the food a lot!!!!
