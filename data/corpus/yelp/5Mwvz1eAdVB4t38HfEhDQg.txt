Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
Spago occupies the space of the old Beverly Hills landmark Bistro Gardens.  It's a pretty space filled with the old money ladies of Beverly Hills.  The food is sometimes great and sometimes ordinary, but chances are Wolfgang will come over and say hi.. Expensive but definitely a treat.
