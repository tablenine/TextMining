3.5 stars - here's why:. . The sushi is delicious. There's no doubt about that. I had heard a lot of great things about Sushi Gen, so I had very high expectations and honestly my expectations were all met. I had my usual - yellowtail, salmon and a spicy tuna roll. Everything was great but the bill was over $30. At Hama or Komasa the bill would be around $20 for the same meal. I'd rather save $10 on a dinner that just as tasty.
