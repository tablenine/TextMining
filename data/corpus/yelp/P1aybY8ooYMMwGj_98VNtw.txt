Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
The cult of Mario Batali strikes on the West Coast. . . I have had many a good meal at his New York restaurants, but he cannot make pizza to save his life. . . There is a funny part of "Heat" by Bill Buford that records Mario's inability to make pizza. (Mr. Buford, a New Yorker staff writer, spent months and months working under Mr. Batali. It's a great read, btw.). Mario couldn't get pizza down. So simple, yet so complex. When I first went to Otto, his NYC pizzeria, I thought something surely must be wrong, but when I heard the word of mouth, my opinions were confirmed. . . Anyway, believe the hype, or rail against it. For my money, I'd still rather go to La Buca on Melrose and land one of their white pizzas drizzled with truffle oil.
