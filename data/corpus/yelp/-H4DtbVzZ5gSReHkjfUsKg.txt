I'm a big believer in taking crappy items off the menu; stick to what you know and don't serve crap (fish) here.   So stick to Oyaka bowl and Ramen and Takana.  . . The service here is always poor and though there is no excuse for poor service (it's not fast food), the ramen is worth coming back for.. . Shinsengumi has a better vibe and a staff that drinks with you.  The last time at Daikokuya, behind the counter were 2 Mexican cooks and 1 Hapa waiter.  In LA we have become a mish-mosh juxtaposition of everyone, losing cultural ties and trying to chase the pretty penny by cutting costs, even on the front lines (The chef??).  I guess that is what makes us Angelenos.  Where's the authenticity?  . . Ah well, the ramen was good.
