I give this place a 10 for ambience and a 6.5-7 for food.  That is why this place gets three stars because in terms of restaurants, i'm always a fan of things being the other way around.  I'm serious--this place feels like I could step out and be in SoHo NYC, which is a great feeling for me.  The food is just decent.  I wish it was delicious.  It is lovely to look at, and the servers are good--par.  But that is what this place is all abt.  Looking good, and having a lot of good things to look at.  Some lovely ladies and I were there for brunch so I tried the poached eggs in fra diavolo sauce which was medium in taste, and the french toast which was also medium.  I also got the Caesar salad, presented in the best way: long crisp leaves, brushed with the dressing.  Lettuce?  Great.  Dressing?  It needed more tang and more pizzazz.  Translation?  Lemon juice and anchovy.  And salt, which we added, and was fancy.  Go there if you want to see beautiful ppl looking out for other beautiful ppl.  Bring a friend there to impress LA-style (appearance-wise for those who need to know what i'm saying).  These are the greatest merits of this place, not so much the food!  I guess the look of the digs just makes me expect so much more culinary-wise.
