Restaurant: Craft Atlanta
Category: American (New)
We arrived at craftbar ten minutes prior to our reservation. The design of the restaurant is warm and inviting. The bar area was buzzing with people. The polite hostess took our coats and told us that we would be seated "shortly." Â We proceeded to fight through the gauntlet to get a cocktail. The design of the bar itself is not conducive to ordering drinks while waiting to be seated. It was full of people eating dinner that did not have reservations and/or could not get a table. I felt bad reaching over the diner's food to get my drinks and then pay for them. The bartender was, rightfully , more worried about them than selling me a few drinks. After 45 minutes we were seated, almost an hour after our reservation time. This place was more oversold than a Delta flight to New York. The time passed pretty quickly because we were entertained by the cute girl in the very short dress who kept laughing hysterically causing her to raise her arms and completely uncover her entire tiny thong. Our waiter was attentive, polite and friendly. Overall the service was good. He answered our questions and made a couple of recs. The food arrived pretty quickly. The appetizers/salads were good, the main courses forgettable (mine was warm) and the deserts very good. I would wait and try them out after they work out their kinks.
