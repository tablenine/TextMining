Knowing my love of brunch, my husband took me to Over Easy for brunch on Valentine's Day. This is only the second time we've been there, but it was love at first bite. . . The first time we went was over the summer, and we had to wait about 30 minutes or so, but the free and fantastic Julius Meinl coffee was a major plus. That time I had their take on the eggs benedict and it was very good. My husband had the blueberry crunch pancakes and they were to die for! Hence our return trip so I could order those pancakes. . . Waiting outside in February sucked more than it did in the summer, but again, the coffee and now knowing that the food is awesome, makes it worth waiting for. We waited about 30 minutes again, and yes the door kept opening and it was cold every few minutes, but I just kept my coat on and it was fine. It's not really a linger for 3 hours and read the paper kind of place, anyway. . . For Valentine's Day their specials looked amazing, and it was hard to choose, but I was craving those damn blueberry crunch pancakes again. My husband had the bacon pancakes (bacon mixed into the batter) and I had a few bites and those were delish. I couldn't resist the pancakes and they were even better than I remembered. Just enough cinnamon and granola, and those succulent blueberries in those fluffy, non greasy pancakes. Heaven! . . Can't wait to go back!
