Restaurant: Tin Lizzy&#39;s
Category: Mexican
okay, so the service.. not the worst, but definitely not memorable... the decor, completely wack. the food, subpar (although im sure this could be attributed to my odd taco choices). all in all. sorry tin lizzys. it was only a one night stand.. at lunch.. . tex mex... only at nuevo laredo for me.
