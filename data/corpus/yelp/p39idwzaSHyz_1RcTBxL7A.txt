Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
I have been to Mermaid Inn on many occasions - thankfully. . . It has all 3 of my favorite NYC restaurant ingredients:. . 1) Downtown in location. 2) Small, intimate atmosphere Â (want it to feel like a mom &amp; pop shop). 3) Exceptional quality @ reasonable price (FRESH is key). 4) Solid wine list. . Mermaid Inn embodies this list. It is small, unpretentious, inviting and warm. The menu (both raw and cooked) is rock solid with one of the best lobster sandwiches in the city.. . I could eat there once a week without hesitation.. . Last weekend they accommodated us after 10 with no reservation and allowed us to consume a bottle of wine and eat off the menu specials - all while never letting us know if they were annoyed by us keeping them late.. . All in all - it's a fantastic fish love fest.. . Advice - eat anything, it will all be good. It's just that kind of joint.
