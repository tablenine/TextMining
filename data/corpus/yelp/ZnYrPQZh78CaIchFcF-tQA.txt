Restaurant: Hackney&#39;s Printers&#39; Row
Category: Burgers
Ate at Hackney's in Printer's Row tonight.  It was a$$ awful.  Anyone who thinks the food there is good, probably works there.  A fly landed on my food and screamed, "Fuc@! This!  I'm going to Flacos Tacos."  The food was so bad, my date punched me in the stomach and called me an a$$hole.  The food was so bad, I got a red light ticket afterwards and I didn't give 2 shi!ts.  "World famous Hackney's burger?!  There are ppl in Indiana who haven't heard of that sh!it!.  That meal was so bad I'm going to Taco Bell and White Castle just to even things out.  Spicy fish tacos?!  More like bland flavorless a$$ tacos.  I dunno what skin tastes like, but after eating their fish tacos, I do.  Hackney's needs to do ppl a favor a close shop.. . Overpriced.  Server didn't ask 3 tables how the food was.  I know why.. . Their fries were okay.
