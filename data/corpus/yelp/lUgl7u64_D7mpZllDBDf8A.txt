Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Yummy, yummy, yummers.  I love Roscoe's in Pasadena.  They have the best waffles and the fried chicken is prefect.  I love any place where I can get greens and waffles.  It's always lively in here and the service is pleasant enough.  I have zero complaints.
