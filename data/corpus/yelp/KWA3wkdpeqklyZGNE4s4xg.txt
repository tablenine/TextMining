Restaurant: Fat Cat
Category: Bars
Make no mistake, Fat Cat is a welcome neighbor in this part of Uptown. It has a bustling night crowd that weighs down it's end of the block, and is helping to rejuvenate the Broadway entertainment corridor.. . The inside is expansive with thumping music, lots of TVs, pool tables, tall bar tables and a sizable wraparound al fresco dining area with wicker chairs and sofas. It's much more bar than a restaurant, however the food is pretty good. The thanksgiving turkey sandwich is yummy, as are the vinegar fries. Stay away from the chicken fried steak. . . In the end there is nothing particularly wonderful or exciting to recommend, and I feel the place kind of lacks identity or soul. I never really feel comfortable there for long periods, but it's nice to stop by for the occasional beer and burger, especially during the summer months.
