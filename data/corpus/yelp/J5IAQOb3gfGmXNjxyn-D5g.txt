Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
I'd give this place 1.5 stars if it were an option. This place is NOT terrible though. The service was good and the food didn't make me sick. My main beef: the quality of the food does not stand up to the price. I can get a much better taco at Taqueria Del Sol for nearly half the price. I'm probably capable of making everything I had better at my own home. . . To speak of the food more specifically, everything seemed a little off-balance. The nachos were a little over-salted. The guacamole was grocery-store fare even though it ran around $6. The fried chicken tacos were far too flavorful but the pork tacos needed some dipping sauce. . . It's just not working as far as food quality goes. Chop the price of everything in half, and I might give this place 3 stars.
