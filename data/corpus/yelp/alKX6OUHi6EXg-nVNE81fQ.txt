My rating is based on the service and the lack of luster for the prices. I noticed many people commenting how good the curried chicken salad is and I agree the taste is spot on, but what is missing are the "extras". The bun was filled with finely minced chicken, mayo, seasoning, lettuce and maybe a cranberry or two. How about a tomato slice or perhaps chucks of chicken with celery or green onions? My sandwich came with a side of mixed greens---and that pretty much sums it up. The greens were dressed so lightly I could hardly make out any other flavors other then greens. Also, the same gripe I had with the sandwich, no accompaniments. How about throwing in some cherry tomatoes or some cucumbers to make my $12 sandwich worth it? My friends and I waited over 25 minutes for our lunch. The staff was friendly but some reassurance about where our food was would have been better. I actually thought our ticket had fallen on the kitchen floor.
