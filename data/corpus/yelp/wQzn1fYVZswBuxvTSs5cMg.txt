A favorite Atlanta tradition of mine.  Great beers on tap and amazing wings for a place with the word Taco in it.  The reason why this place is so great is its so versatile.  Its great to watch a Braves, Falcons, Thrashers, or Hawks game or you can just go after a rough day or night at work.  Either way you leave a lil light headed and full of hot wings which is always a good thing.  They have many locations and some are better then others but this is the closest one to me and being the first its inherently the best.  A must see for Beer enthusiast if you be a local or a visitor its sure to please.
