Restaurant: Elements Café
Category: American (New)
The food at Elements Cafe deserves 4* but the lack of ambience downgrades the restaurant to 3* only.. . Elements is on Fair Oaks south of Colorado.  It is...LITERALLY on Fair Oaks (technically Dayton St.) because there is practically no indoor dining area at all.  There are maybe 10-15 small tables crammed onto a sidewalk with patio umbrellas.  The view is not at all impressive staring out onto a parking lot.  It can get hot if you're not directly shielded by one of the umbrellas.  Bugs kept falling or flying into my ice water so the poor waitstaff had to replace multiple times until I finally used my napkin as a cover.. . Every table starts off with homemade potato chips.  Great idea because there's a bit of a wait for the food and the waitstaff keeps em coming!  . . My ELEMENTS CHEESE STEAK was pretty good.  They use thin strips of sirloin, green bell peppers and a moderate amount of cheese inside a baguette.  My side salad was nice.  It was a pretty tasty sandwich and I appreciated that it was not a greasy overstuffed cheese steak as I had expected.. . J's CURRY CHICKEN SANDWICH was awesome!  It was on a soft rosemary foccacia roll, which may have been baked by Europane.  The chicken salad itself was delicious.  The chicken was very finely shredded (I liked, J didn't) with a light curry dressing, mixed in with onions, dried fruit.  I thought the balance and flavors were spot-on.  . . Service was shaky, as if it was a new restaurant ...but its not.  I probably won't return unless it's an overcast, non-windy day.  Too bad b/c it's kind of yummy.  I hope they have the opportunity to expand into some of the nearby boutiques so that they can have a proper dining space.
