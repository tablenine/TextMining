Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
THIS PLACE IS A WHOLE IN THE WALL DREAM! Not only is the food amazing but the owner Manuel is amazing too. ask for the cola for your coffee ( its not really cola).  I love the friendly atmosphere and manuels topes.  Family favorite for sure.
