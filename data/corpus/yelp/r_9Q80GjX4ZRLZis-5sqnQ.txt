I can't decide if I love the rice or chicken more. But the Hainan chicken dish definitely combines two of my favorite foods. I shouldn't tell you that they probably cook the rice with sweet, sweet chicken broth and lots of oil which makes it as addicting as crack. And the chicken may seem like just plain old chicken to the untrained eye. But it's moist, even the white meat, and plentiful. Â Props to Savoy for removing most of the bones and taking away that chore away from us. I don't even touch the hot or ginger sauces because it totally doesn't need it - just a sprinkle of that soy sauce. I wonder if that's plain old soy sauce or some variation but when it's mixed in with my meal, it makes it taste darn scrumptious. . . And you already know that the place is tiny, there's no parking and at peak times, there can be a loooonnng wait. So I always take it to go. I don't even have to call beforehand and usually I'm out of there in 5 minutes. The last time I bought it, I couldn't even wait till I got home before I started devouring it in the car at a red light. The people in the nearby cars must've thought I was a pig. But I'm pretty sure pigs don't eat chicken.
