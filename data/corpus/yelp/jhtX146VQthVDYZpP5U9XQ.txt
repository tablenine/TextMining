Despite the fact that it was 12 pm, the "ran out" of 4 of the 5 lunchy items, and the country fried steak with biscuits and gravy as well.  I settled for the pastrami and swiss omelette.  Others had the Waffle and various pork products with egg and cheese sandwich and a veggie omelette.. . Food was not bad, buiscuit was a little flat, grits tasted a little funny.  The waffle sandwich was more like a waffle, pork and egg kabob; not really sandwich format.. . The service was pretty bad.  Waiter had no clue about anything on the menu, neglected to mention they were out of their lunch items, and put the bill on the table half-way through the meal.
