Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
After working out over at Bally's, my fiancee decided to waste all the hard work because he was in the mood for a burger.  So, we decided to go to the Counter.  After looking at the astronomical prices for this "byob" - build your own burger, we just stuck to the regular menu.  I got the trifeca - three cheese grilled sandwich and he go the old school - cheddar burger.  We also decided to split a single fry.  The food was really really good!!!  However, I'm just turned off by a couple of things.  If you are paying for a $7 to $9 burger - you would think it would come with fries.  Instead for a order to share it ranges $4 to $6!  . . I would go again, yes, but it definately not worth the price.
