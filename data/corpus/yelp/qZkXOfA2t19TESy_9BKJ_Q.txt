True to the name, Batali &amp; Silverton dish up the most sublime mozzarella you'll ever have.  We tried the caprese salad with bufala mozzarella and the burrata with speck, and couldn't have been happier with our choices. The cheese is melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  It just doesn't get any better, folks.. . However, the same accolades do not come to mind when I consider our entrees.  The word we decided on was "overpowering;" in each dish, one flavor overtook the others to a fault.  In the duck ragu gnocchi, the taste of the dumplings was hidden by the overly-salty sauce; in the bass entree, the sauce atop it was also a bit too strong.  I wasn't entirely unhappy, but for the cost of these dishes I'd rather have 4 cheese plates.   Next time!
