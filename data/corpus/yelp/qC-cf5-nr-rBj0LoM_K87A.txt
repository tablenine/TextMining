Restaurant: Umami Burger

Ninja, please. Overrated and overpriced...Unless you want to empty your wallets on oily, small-portioned $9-12 burgers, and kill off more trees with lots of napkins, then by all means, help yourself!. . Umami burger (#1 on the simple menu) = 2 stars. Too oily and too darn small. The fried piece of cheese was cute and the meat was kind of flavorful at first, until you take more bites. Â Even though the patty was thicker than your average hamburger patty, it was very much drenched in heart-clogging oil and fat. Now I'm no die-hard dieter nor am I even health-conscious at all, but this was too much for me. Lots of people seemed to think the burger's very juicy. It's not juice; it's oil. Not even the tomatoes and the lettuce could add much to the flavoring of the burger. I had to use tons of napkins to wipe my hands while eating, not just afterward.. . The onion rings = 3 stars. Not bad, but I definitely have had better beer-battered ones at other establishments, e.g. Tops in Pasadena. Again, too oily.. . I forgot which burger my eating companion ordered even though I tried a piece of it, so that's saying something.. . I'd suggest you try Umami once. It's one of those "OMG-gotta-check-this-off-on-my-bucket-list" sort of experience. But would I come back? Most likely not.
