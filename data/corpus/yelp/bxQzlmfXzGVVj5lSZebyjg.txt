Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
When someone tells me they're heading to LA I automatically blurt out.... . Go to the Apple Pan for me and order a hickory burger with cheese, fries, rootbeer and an apple pie ala mode.. . The Apple Pan has arguably the best burger in the world - I was on a trip to Japan and was reading a newspaper featuring, you guessed it, the Best Burgers in the WORLD - guess what was #1? Apple Pan. . . Besides... you never know what celebrity or old Hollywood writer you'll see in the corner...
