Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
Pasta Bowl is a great value.  The pasta dishes are similar to what you would expect to find a high end Italian restaurant, but at dirt cheap prices.  The food is consistently good.  Most dishes are around $8.  Atmosphere of the restaurant is very basic, not too fancy, but the food makes up for it.
