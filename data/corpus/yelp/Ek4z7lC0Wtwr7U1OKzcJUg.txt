Great, great, great Korean fusion food, and so flavorful that if it's close to me, I'll be willing to stand around for half an hour to get it.  I've had the tacos and the short rib burrito, and they're to die for.. . So maybe I'm the odd twenty-something out, but when you have about nine different trucks, haven't you proved that the concept of Korean / Mexican fusion is salable enough to finally open up a restaurant in a stable, fixed location?  I mean, seriously, put one on the West Side, another one in the Valley, and another one somewhere around Pasadena or Eagle Rock.  At that point, let us come to you.. . I'd give Kogi 5 stars, but checking the website to find out where it's going to be is inconvenient as all get-out.  At the risk of losing my indie street-cred, the food isn't more delicious because of the effort I have to expend to get to it.
