Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
When I think of Brazilian food, I think of meat, meat, and more meat served on swords because I've only had Brazilian food at a churrascaria (Brazilian bbq place).  Bossa Nova is definitely NOT a churrascaria, but I had a pleasant experience nonetheless.. . I went to Bossa Nova for an early lunch on Saturday.  When I opened the menu I expected to see a plethora of meat options, but was surprised when the menu contained a variety of items including salads, pasta, and even pizza.  While that stuff looked good too, I decided to order from the "Hot From the Bossa Nova Grill" menu, where they have more traditional Brazilian dishes.  I ordered the traditional skinless, boneless chicken breast that is cooked in a variety of Brazilian herbs and spices and served with black beans, rice, yucca flour, salsa, and your choice of fried plantains or french fries (I chose the fried plantains).  For the appetizer, we chose the Coxinha (chicken and cheese inside of fried breaded dough) and Croquete de Camarao (shrimp and cheese inside of fried breaded dough).. . The appetizers were delicious...very, very tasty.  We had two orders of each and it was enough to feed four people.    My dish was delicious too!  The chicken was tasty and juicy, but was a tad too salty for my taste.  The fried plantains were awesome!  You must order these when you come here.  The portions are big here, so come hungry!. . This place was not crowded when we arrived at 11:30 and finding parking was fairly easy.  However, it started to fill up as it got later and later.  There is a very small parking lot behind the restaurant and there is metered street parking, but Sunset Blvd. gets pretty busy so I would suggest trying one of the side streets first.
