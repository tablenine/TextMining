This place is AWESOME..........but always crowded.  SO BAD they are not open for more hours on the Sat and Sun.  I saw this news bit on Fox 5 in the am about 3 yrs ago and ever since I've been treating myself to this place.  only problem I've ever had was that one time the waitress was not particularly attentitve and a little bit on the nasty side when it came to the drinks but that was my only experience and I havent had a bad experience since.  I'd recommend this place to anyone.  LUV IT!!!!!!
