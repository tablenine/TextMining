I was getting over a cold and getting ready for bed when I heard my phone ring. "Hey Nicole! Remember that taco place you wanted to try, Kogi? Well they're by the Hyatt and we're like 80th in line so come!" It took about a second of deliberation before I grabbed my keys and headed out. I had dinner earlier so I wasn't really hungry but after an hour in line, in the cold, my appetite and curiosity needed satiation. Between the six of us, we tried a bunch of delicious items: blackjack quesadillas, short rib Kogi sliders, tacos, burritos, etc. Everything was really flavorful and unique. They were scheduled until 12:30 but stayed open to take care of everyone in line. We didn't get our food until 1:30 and there were still 30 or so people after us. The only downfall was finding out they weren't accepting credit or debit cards (luckily had cash on me). Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu (heard good things about the kimchi quesadillas)
