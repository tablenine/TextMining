Like mentioned many a time, expensive, but great.  Their seafood selection is unbeatable.  I'm not quite sure where I can get a better tuna or swordfish steak in town.  . I'm not a big fan of the parking lot in this location though.  Sure, it's huge, but  it's a b*tch to get in and out of, between Home Depot, Petsmart, Borders, Eats, etc etc etc.  Not really Whole Food's fault though.
