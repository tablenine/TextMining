Restaurant: Ok Cafe
Category: Diners
The food almost didn't matter.  The signed copy of "To Kill A Mockingbird" by the hostess stand made this English major's heart go pitter patter.  How could you not love a restaurant named after one of Scout and Jem's haunts?. . It was full on Thursday morning for breakfast, and the wait for the food reflected that.  But the cheery waitresses kept the coffee flowing, and really, who cares if you have to wait as long as you're fully caffeinated?. . The orange juice was truly fresh squeezed, and all the breakfast items had that great homemade fullness to them.  You don't get pancakes like these at IHOP, that's for sure.  OK Cafe's location right next to 75 means that I won't have an excuse to stay away for long.
