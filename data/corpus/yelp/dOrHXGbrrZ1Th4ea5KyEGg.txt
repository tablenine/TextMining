:o/. . My friend wanted to check this out because it was featured on Man vs. Food.  Gahhh......  This is what I would consider poor man's ramen.  The soap base was extremely salty and looked like a mess, so it wasn't appetizing at all.  With probably the same wait time as Daikokuya, just walk a couple blocks down, and save your bowels from the explosions that will follow for a couple days.
