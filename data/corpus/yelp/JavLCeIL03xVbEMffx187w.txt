Me gusta Gloria's!  . . My friend introduced me to this place, and I have to give her props for that.  We came here to celebrate her 30th birthday.  The sangria was the best I've ever had, and it was really strong too.  And I think it made her night that she got carded on her big 3-0.    . . The food serving size was ridiculous.  I got the Pollo Rancheros, which turned out to be enough to feed a family of 3.  The chicken was tender and the spices were yummy.  My friend got her usual Pupusa plate.  I appreciate the amount of cabbage they gave her.  She also got a free flan for her birthday.  . . The ambiance is cute.  It looks like a great date place.  The main dining area has about 20 tables.  There's a small bar in the back.  The servers were all very nice and attentive.  Parking is on the street.  . . I'll be back for sure.
