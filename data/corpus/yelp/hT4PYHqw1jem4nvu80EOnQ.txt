4 stars for the restaurant experience, but if i could rate the ramen separately it would get 5 stars for sure! best ramen in LA, i find myself trying to find reasons to trek downtown to eat here.  . But be prepared for a long wait (esp. if you're in a group).  What i like to do is sign up, then head across the street and checkout the plaza shops, maybe pick up some chichi dango or try the new froyo place.. Parking can also blow, but if you can have someone hop out and sign up while you lurch around for parking, you'll find something before your table gets called.. I'm a ramen lover (whether it be at home, on sawtelle, or in little tokyo), but i wouldn't call myself a ramen snob.  Nevertheless, until someone presents something better to me, this place holds #1 for me
