I consider the pastrami on rye at Langers to be nothing short of a religious experience.  The bread is perfectly crisp on the crust and doughy at the center. The pastrami is greasy, full of flavor and just all around delicious.  I've tried the eggs and several other dishes but really that is not the reason to go to Langers.  You come here for a sandwich, probably the pastrami on rye with slaw and russian dressing.  I think its better then Katz's or any of NY institutions.. . They are not open for dinner, you can call ahead and then call again when you're at the curb and they'll run out to your car.  There's also parking a block a way, just be sure to validate.  . . There is a subway station a block away.
