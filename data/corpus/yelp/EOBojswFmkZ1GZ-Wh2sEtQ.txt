I had dinner here with my boyfriend last Saturday and we walked right in and got a table at around 7:30. Â We sat on the patio, which was very quaint and nice.. . We started out with one of the spicy maki rolls as an appetizer, and it definitely had a kick, thank goodness the waitress was on hand to keep refilling our water glasses. I was in the mood for sushi and tried to tropical roll. The sushi was very fresh and I loved the pineapple dipping sauce, I was practically licking the bowl clean. He got the chicken curry and said it was some of the best Thai food he has had in Atlanta lately.. . It is great to find a good sushi place in the Highlands area.
