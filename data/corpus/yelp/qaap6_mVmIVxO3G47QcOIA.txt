Solid!. . Line out the door can be intimidating but it moves by quick. They have suuuch a variety of sausages, it's amazing! I never realized you could practically make ANYTHING into a sausage until I saw their menu.. . I tried the Mango &amp; Jalapeno (chicken/turkey) based on a recommendation, and the fact that weird meats and meat combinations freak me out. To compliment my sausage I added caramelized onions and sweet peppers, although this is misleading because the onions are simply grilled, not caramelized at all :(. Friend got the Sun-dried tomato &amp; Mozzarella (chicken/turkey) which I remembered being good, but I think I liked the Mango Jalapeno better.. . We ordered a large fry to split and holey moley do you get a lot! They're super thick cut and Belgian style. We chose Curry Ketchup (strong curry flavor) and Sundried Tomato Mayo (I am such a sucker for SD tomatoes!) to dip. The fries were good but I think since they're twice fried, some were kinda burnt :\ Although I do appreciate the potato meatiness from the thick cut.. For drinks, they have a huge selection of craft beers and even craft sodas. I went with a strawberry beer on tap (sticking to the fruity sweetness of my meal) which was really tasty!. . The communal seating here is.. different. The picnic tables are difficult to get in/out of and you are bound to have someone trying to "squeeze through" brush their butt up against your back. -___- this happened multiple times, haha. Plus, the tables are covered with butcher paper and aren't continually replaced... You can imagine eating over someone's previous ketchup squirts on the table! It's a different experience but next time I'm definitely sitting elsewhere.. . I'll be back for a spicy sausage and hoppy brew next time. Can't wait :)
