This place is really a gem. It's reliably delicious for brunch or dinner. The service is professional and friendly, the food is scrumptious and creative, the atmosphere is cozy, pleasant and fun. I've been here at least 3 times and it's been very positive each visit. This is a great place for groups--particularly for a girls' night out--or for a romantic dinner for two. It's not easy to achieve that balance but somehow they managed. They have a nice wine list with a good range of prices. You won't break the bank by chowing down (and drinking up) here. Looking forward to my next visit!
