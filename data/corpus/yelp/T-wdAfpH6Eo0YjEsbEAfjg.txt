Me likes!. . This is one of the b.f.'s favorites, so I HAD to try it out during my first visit to Chicago in almost four years.  Weird that I never ate at Hugo's when I literally lived right around the corner back in the day......., but I digress.  . . Shrimp on ice, lobster for my colleague, filet for me, spicy corn, oh my!  (My filet was a bit overdone, but who cares, it was still good).  Great wine selection, great vibe, a crowd that was both super casual/super dressy.  We didn't get around to dessert as we were both stuffed, but good God man, their selections are huge &amp; look delish.  Maybe if I hadn't had that Ghiardelli ice cream soda at 3 o'clock.......
