I went here on a friday afternoon and waited about 30 minutes for a table for 3. There are only 2 kinds of ramen on the menu, the one with the soup and the one that is dry, with the soup on the side. What makes your meal different is if you get the combo meal for an additional 2-3 bucks. I had the shredded pork and tried the tuna sashimi and the salmon eggs from my friends. The shredded pork was so good! It had chunks of seared pork with a sweet teriyaki sauce on top and some seaweed over rice. I also really liked their salad, it had shredded cabbage and a creamy dressing that didn't taste like anything i had before. I tried to finish everything but toward the end of my ramen, i was getting sick of eating. The combo meal can definitely be shared between 2 people.
