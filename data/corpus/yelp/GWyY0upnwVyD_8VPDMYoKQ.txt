Restaurant: Cameli&#39;s Gourmet Pizza Joint
Category: Pizza
actually, i think this is my favorite pizza place in the city. get a monster slice they look like they've been cut from a 32" pizza. huge.. . (gaw! it's near an older kroger, but it's not that big a deal. it's atlanta, get use to living in a city peeps.). . EDIT (2008): Cameli's has recently undergone some changes that I'm not so sure about. It's a sit down be servered place now. It has a bar, a neat little living room area and some pinball tables (currently Monopoly &amp; some boxing thing[with no tilt!]). They also removed some of the old favorites from the menu. Â . . I liked the hole in the wall feel to it they had before. I haven't enjoyed it nearly as much the last two times I've been there. I hope they figure it out soon.
