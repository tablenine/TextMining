Came here for DineLA dinner on Sunday. Interestingly, they only serve the DineLA menu - you cannot order any dishes off the regular menu.. . The appetizers for the table were apple and endive salad and salmon rillette. These were okay - not bad, nothing special. . . We split the entrees of diver scallops, short ribs, and beef sirloin amongst the table. The scallops were a bit lacking in flavor, and a little undercooked. Both the short rib and sirloin were very good. It came with fresh mushrooms, roasted vegetables, and potatoes au gratin - all pretty good. By now, we realized the portions weren't huge...maybe a little on the smaller side.. . Dessert medley was nice, but kind of hard to split. Chocolate espresso tart, roasted pear, ricotta cheesecake and assorted ice creams/sorbets were served. These were in pretty decent portions, but nothing totally stood out.. . At the end of the meal, we got mini brownies as mignardises, and everyone at our party got a $10 gift certificate to come back to the restaurant - which I thought to be pretty damn cool. . . This experience overall was around 3.5 stars. A pretty good deal for $44 per person. However, I've been here for lunch and sampled a substantial amount of the menu, and this place is definitely deserving of 4 stars.
