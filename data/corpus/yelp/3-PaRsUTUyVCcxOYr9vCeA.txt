Not sure about the recent spate of negativity ..... and I'm gonna put forth my review to turn the tide - deservedly so. This place rocks! It is consistently great food and service and in my opinion, a great date place. I prefer to walk-in (not recommended for parties greater than 2) and dine at the one of the two bars - you can sit side by side and actually converse - go for seats at the mozzarella bar if you can. Watching the plates come together is entertainment in itself. . . I prefer to stick with creations from the mozzarella bar and the pastas. That way you can order more plates to taste and share with your SO. The food is marvelous! The pastas are well-flavored and well-proportioned; perfect for sharing or for you to consume entirely. Highly recommend the wild-boar and the ox-tail ragouts. The service is terrific. The bartenders and waitstaff know the menu inside-out and in my experience, they're funny and fun to talk to as well.. . And finally, don't bother with valet. There is abundant parking on Melrose!
