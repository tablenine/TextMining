Great place, multiple levels including a bar on each and of course huge patios. The one upstairs over looks downtown and a nice sky view in my opinion. The second patio is on the back side and much large, it wasn't open due to the place being new and not packed (yet!).. . The food was great, the oysters were HUGE and of good quality but my only gripe was that there was no small forks or no raw horse radish. The horse radish was mixed in with the cocktail sauce too. Lobster bisque was OH MY GOODNESS good and it was worth the heavy cream in it trust me.. . All in all it was a great place, and I believe it will be packed in the future to come.
