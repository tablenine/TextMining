In this world there are few things that I like better then good BBQ, and Smoke delivers!  . . We walked in around 6:15 and there were a few tables open, so we grabbed a big one in the back.  . . There was a tasting event with Metropolitan.  They had three of their beers: Krankshaft (Kolch), Dynamo (Copper Lager), and Flywheel (Bright Lager), and you could try all three for 7 dollars.  I have  had all of their beers many times, and I love them all.  Doug, the owner and brew-master was there answering questions about their beer.  I always like to support local businesses!. . My wife and I split  a plater that came with spare ribs, pulled pork, and brisket.  The pulled pork and the brisket were not that great.  I like brisket that is sliced, not pulled.  The Pulled pork was too stringy.  I like my pork chopped.  The ribs were excellent!  They were tender, but not too tender so that they fall apart.  They had a strong smokey and well spiced!  Our sides consisted of the mac &amp; cheese, the baked beans, and sweat potato fries!  They were all awesome!. . I will defiantly go back again!
