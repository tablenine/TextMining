This place will provide you with a one-of-a-kind experience.  There is nothing else like this in the world that I am aware of.  I don't want to give away any details as that will take away from the fun.  I will tell you that the setting is an old mansion/castle in which you can roam freely.  There are many rooms with various things to see and do.  The food was pretty good on both of my visits (one dinner and one brunch).  The enchiladas at bunch were fantastic and my steak dinner was also very tasty.  The food is not what gives the 5-star rating though.. . The shows are exceptional.  They feature some really interesting magicians.  The castle itself provides and incredible ambiance.  It is a must-do in Los Angeles.
