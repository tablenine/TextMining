The salads here are absolutely delicious. The ingredients are fresh, flavorful, and healthy! I've been here a few times, and always have a superb dining experience. It does get a little crowded, so be prepared to wait if you're coming during their busy times. If you haven't tried this place yet, it's an absolute must!! The quality is amazing, and their portions are generous!
