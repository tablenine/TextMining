i would like to come back in the summer time and sit at their patio. Â winter nights are definitely too cold...but they did have heaters running. otherwise, they also have inside dinning. . . we ordered their bruchetta... their bread was very good. and for my entree i ordered their shrimp and garlic pasta. it was a lil too creamy and thick for my taste, but it was still very yummy.. . they have a case full of desserts. i didn't leave enough room this time around for desserts but would def come back to try some.
