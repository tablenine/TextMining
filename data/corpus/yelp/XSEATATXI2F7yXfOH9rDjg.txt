this place is TINY so be sure to get there early and wait to score a table - its worth it. don't expect to be seated quickly on Sundays though.. everyone comes here after church and the line is usually over a block long.. . the chicken is friend to perfection.. not too greasy and not to charred.. seasoned really well. the waffles are huge. seriously, i think one meal can serve two. if you are ready to get stuffed, come here - you will not regret it.
