Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Nom, nom, nom. . That is exactly what goes through my mind in the moments before I walk into Bottega. The place is just pure magic. I feel like I'm walking into a bright shining food mecca with all the sparkly lights reflecting off the glass windows.. Must order: Portobella fries w/ special sauce! You won't regret it.. This place is surprisingly casual considering the decor, service, and cleanliness. I love this place on so many levels. I can't pick just one thing besides the portobello fries. I order something different off the menu everytime I've been. Only thing to stay away from: Clam Pizza.
