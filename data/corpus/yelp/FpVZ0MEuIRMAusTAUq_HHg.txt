Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
It's actually a 3.5. Kristina had a Heavenly Hef, which was excellent and I had some beer that was suggested to since I like Heineken, which was mediocre. We went there expecting a long list of food, but it was very small. We got a basket of sweet potato fries, which was excellent, and two Father's Office Burgers. We are not big fans of onions but the caramelized onions on the Office Burger was really good.. . Only thing drawing us back from going again is the price. It was a great experience but nothing too exceptional.
