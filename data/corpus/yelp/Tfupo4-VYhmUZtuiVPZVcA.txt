Bite is best for their amazing specials.  The regular menu items are also good, but the specials, they are amazing.  I have only been here for breakfast once, and it was delicious.  I can't stress enough the dinner specials, yum.  Staff is decently friendly, but they usually only have one waitress for dinner and it gets pretty busy, so you can understand staff being overwhelmed.  . . I have noticed that they don't seem to have very good ventilation.  When you walk in you can usually smell the food cooking, and when you leave you will probably smell like the special, just pray it isn't catfish.
