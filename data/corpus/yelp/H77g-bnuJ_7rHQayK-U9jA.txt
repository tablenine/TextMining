Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
This is very quickly becoming my favorite place ever (aside from my other homes:  Ria's and Octane).  Therefore commence the love letter to Brick Store:. . The food is absolutely wonderful.  I got the veggie gyro and it was soooo tasty and only $7.  I'm pretty sure that can't be beat.  Especially since they have the best variety of beer in town.  They have a rotating draft selection that will almost always boast something you haven't tried (and possibly a new favorite... Abbay des Rocs?  Yes, please!).  If you aren't sure that you want to try any of the draft beers, the bottled beer list is ginormous.  From lagers to lambics, you are guaranteed to find something amazing.  And apparently they have wine and liquor as well, for those who do not enjoy the sweet nectar that is a good ale.  Who knew?  Brick Store:  you have the option of being the most pretentious place in town, but you go the other direction and make it a place where I'm just as comfortable as I am at home.. . If you want to skip all that, I'll make it short:  Brick Store, I love you.
