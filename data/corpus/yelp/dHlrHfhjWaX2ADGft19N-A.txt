Headed to Park Tavern with a couple yelpers for 'spiralween'. Over all I had a good time. I had the pleasure of viewing some of the most creative costumes that night. Packed together we partied with Michael Phelps, Elmo, The Gingerbread man (BTW very yummy) and with Justin Timberlake who came with his d!ck in a box. . . Although the bartender was a little rude in my opinion, the atmosphere here was very inviting. None of the characters seemed to mind me chasing them across the room just for pictures and were happy to deliver great poses for my entertainment. The greeters were nice and very chipper (nice way to start off the night), the bouncers were very friendly and easy to please with my twisted sense-of-humor (nice way to end the night).. . Although I doubt I'll try this venue next year, it was a great experience and I was left with little to no regrets.. . For the select few that are interested. My costume was more retro attire. I simply pulled out a few of my 80's favorites, although I wasn't going for the "80's music video dancer", I have to say that is a step up to what some of the other chicas at this party were dressed as.
