This is a local landmark that definitely lives up to it's reputation.  As a kid, my family and I use to pass by here all the time when we would go to Chinatown, it wasn't until a few years ago that I finally stopped by to try it.  Yesterday, I brought my bf here since I knew that he's always up for a french dip sandwich and what better place that from the place that supposedly invented it.  We both ordered the beef with swiss, he got the mac salad, I got the split pea soup, and a piece of pecan pie to share.  While we were in line, bf noticed that coffee was still 9 cents a cup.  Everything is served up fresh and quickly, by ladies that look like they've worked there for decades.  I can see why they've been open for almost 100 years and hopefully for 100 more.
