This place was very satisfying.  I had the Bun Xao with shrimp.  . The portion was too large for me to finish.  The shrimp were a nice size and clean; the noodles were great.  Everything was cooked very well. The sauce tasted like vinegar infused with sugar-very unique and a nice compliment to the salty flavors in the dish.  The prices are very reasonable and the space is huge and airy.
