on my first trip out to wicker park my boyfriend and i landed here. we had to fuel up before commencing on a search for the marc by marc jacobs store (i had forgotten to yelp it before leaving...oops!).... . anyway, after perusing the block for tasty looking restaurants we landed here. prices are very reasonable for brunch and the food was very very tasty. they were serving brunch, so i had a bloody mary and he had a mimosa (both really great...$6). for my main course, i had a sandwich (w/really fresh mozzerella) and delicoius pasta salad!! i think bf had pancakes? either way he and i could have licked our plates clean. . . it looks like their menu changes often, which is great...and the prices were reasonable. id definitely go back!
