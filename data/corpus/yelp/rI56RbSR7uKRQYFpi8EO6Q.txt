I wish we had a place like this in SF. I came here with some friends super late but the wait staff were so accommodating with NO attitude (don't you love that?). I mean, I'm talking about ordering a jelly donut coffee right before closing and they did not grunt or sigh. Waiter guy, I love you.. . The decor is so so cute. I want to decorate my place just like it with the toille wallpaper, robin's egg blue rolly chairs, and red leather sofa -- love it.. . The menu is so divine without being pretentious. I can only speak for the drinks and desserts but they were all superb.. . I see that they're going to get their liquor license soon so it's gonna get way more bumping.
