Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Sports Bars
As a cool chick I met last night mentioned, Barney's is like Frat Boy Heaven, but ... sometimes that sort of place IS heaven. I won't go so far as to say I love Barneys, but this location suits me better than the Santa Monica site, which is LOUD and obnoxious and saturated with televisions. Also the service at this location is excellent and they have a good beer selection, Still, I like divier, grittier, less trendy bars with worse pool players.
