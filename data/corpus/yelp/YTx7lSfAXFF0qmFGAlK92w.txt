When i try use my free grill chicken coupon on KFC got turn down said come back certain time, i decide to try the rescoe which is located next to the KFC, they had special to take out (economic special 5 things fry chickn for $6) great deal. After eating popeye chicken nearby, i can tell you is day and night difference, the rescoe chicken is a lot like home cooking represent south the southern tasted while popeye is more like steroid msg base chicken. Â I had stomatch problem after eating popeye chicken but not rescoe.
