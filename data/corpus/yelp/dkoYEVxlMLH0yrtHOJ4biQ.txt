Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
This Brutha loves soul food and if you do too i suggest you make the drive to hollywood and try this place at least once. the chicken is perfectly fried but still full of juicyness the waffles are so tasty the melt in your mouth the mac n cheese taste like it was made by your southern grandma (if you had a southern grandma) the corn bread is light and full of so much flavor that you don't even have to put anything on it.. . if you go to roscoe's be prepared to eat they give big portions and you'll want to eat every bite. my wife and i went for lunch and 1 plate of food was enough for both of us.. . i don't go to hollywood often but when i do i'll be at roscoe's eatin chicken and lick'n my fingers.
