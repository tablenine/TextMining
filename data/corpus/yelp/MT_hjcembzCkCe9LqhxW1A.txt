been here twice. the first time wasn't impressed with the food, i got a regular brat. but the beer selection was fantastic. and the bartenders were very nice, attentive and knowledgeable. . . the second time i went i check yelp for the most popular sausage and got the rattlesnake and rabbit. i was soooooo good. i loved it. and of course you have to get the fries with truffle oil.. . i love love love the beer here, can't say it enough
