Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I. Love. This. Place.. . I don't believe I got my point across. If I was deathly allergic to seafood, then call this my last meal and send me to heaven. . . I believe I came around 7 or 8 on a Wednesday night, and this place was packed (it was winter break). Hm..when is this place not packed? If you wanna get seated early then come early (about 5pm-6pm). Came with my friend and his girlfriend (3rd wheel ftl) and we were told the wait was about 1.5 hours. Got my name down and I kid you not...we spent an hour decided if we should go or stay. Thankfully, the waitress got us seated in only an hour so it wasn't too bad. But honestly, once you smell that smell that you smelt...it's pretty much over. Nothing you'll eat will taste as good or satisfying as eating boiling crabs. I can't recall what we ordered since it was about a month ago, but I can tell you the bill came out to be around 120 dollars for just 3 of us. Damn, now I wanna go back. . . Btw, don't even bother considering the "alternatives" (i.e. Captain crabs and that other cajun place across the street). It's not even close to being the same.. . Oh, parking is pathetic. It'll make you jealous of handicapped people. You'll see what I mean.
