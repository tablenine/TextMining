I give it 4.5 stars!. . We were starving after getting in late, so walked the 8 blocks from the hotel down to Gibson's for some highly anticipated meat. I got the petite filet mignon (I have a small stomach) with a side of creamed spinach, and bf got a porterhouse with side of mashed potatoes. The house salad was kind of whatevers, but its not like you go to a steak joint for salad right? My steak was good, the perfect size and perfectly cooked. The porterhouse was tasty too, I really liked the salt seasoning on top. Mashed potatoes and spinach were excellent sides, but holy cow, wayyyy too much food. Definite red meat overload. Oh, and I got a raspberry martini which was mmmmmmmmm PERFECT girly drink!! Sugar-rimmed glass and all. Â It was about 10pm on a Sunday night when we came for dinner, and it was still really crowded, so I think that's a testament to how popular and well-liked this restaurant is.
