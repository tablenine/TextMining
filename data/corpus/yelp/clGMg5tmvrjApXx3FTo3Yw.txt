Restaurant: The Tavern at Phipps
Category: Bars
Almost pathetically mediocre, worsened by the fact that it's in Buckhead. I would never choose to go here, but a colleague insisted it was amazing so I went with her against my better judgment. Smarmy waitstaff and mediocre to subpar food. Very little in vegetarian choices. The glass of sauvignon blanc I got was very good - but that's where all my compliments end. I got a thai chicken salad without chicken and the waiter hassled me about it! Not because it's a pain, he just couldn't understand why someone wouldn't want to eat chicken. Oh, and apparently they didn't account for the fact that there was no chicken in the salad, so they doused the whole thing in peanut cilantro dressing, thus making my salad inedible.. . Never again.
