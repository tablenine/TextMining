What else could possibly be said about the place that has about a billion five star reviews? Don't ask any questions. Just go. Get the Daiko ramen and the shredded pork bowl combo. And another tip: even though every ounce of your being will want to take another bite, stop when you're full! They have to-go containers and then the bliss that is Daikokuya can extend into the next day (and trust me, it stays delicious even after being reheated)!
