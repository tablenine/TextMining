Went on a Friday night and was much better then I expected.  Although I had read reviews saying it wasn't a dive bar I still expected it to be more like a dive bar and it was not.  Sure it has bar type food and a bar with lots of beers on tap (not like 3 or 4) at good prices.  From what I could gather it looked like they had 2 or 3 dining areas/rooms and they were more like a casual restaurant then a dive bar.  If you like trying different beers you will like this place.  You will see democrat memorbilia on the walls and I got the feeling a lot of democrats eat there but whatever your political stripe is fine from what I saw.  A fun place and much more then I expected.
