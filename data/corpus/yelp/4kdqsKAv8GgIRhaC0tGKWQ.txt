Tried this place late night, several sheets to the wind, and while I don't remember much about the experience, I do remember how terrible the pizza was.  If this is what passes for NY style pizza, I feel for the Big Apple.  . . I've never lived in NY, but I gotta believe that the large foldable slices with a thin but slightly chewy crust I've heard those that have rave about isn't what they serve here.  It's more like floppy cardboard with bland sauce and low quality ingredients meant to fill the void in late night diners stomachs who don't feel like waiting at Flash Taco or Underdog.  2 stars for quick service though, but like I said, I was drunk.
