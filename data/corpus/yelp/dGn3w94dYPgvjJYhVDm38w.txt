Restaurant: Bottega Louie

Womp womp... That is the feeling I got after eating at Bottega Louie. You walk in and the place is beautiful. I mean, if this blog was just about the decor of a restaurant then Bottega Louie would be top notch. BUT, and this is a big BUT, the site is about food. I kept it very simple and ordered a cup of coffee, a waffle and a side of turkey sausage. The coffee was good, but nothing special. . . The waffle was dry, overcooked and room temperature. I like my waffle hot. It lacked that doughy interior that I love in a waffle. And the butter was frozen. I absolutely hate that. If the butter is meant as a spread, it should be room temp. Otherwise, you are just wasting your time trying to spread it across any surface evenly. See in the picture? . . This is not for the faint of heart, but the turkey sausage looked like what comes out of man's best friend when he is excited. Totally lost my appetite. . . Along with the bad food, it was horribly over priced. If you are going to make me pay extra for your fancy shmancy build out, the very least you can do in return is serve amazing food. Fail.. . 2 out of 7 GREED Owners care more about the check than about the food.
