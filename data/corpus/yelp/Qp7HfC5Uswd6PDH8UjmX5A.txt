I went here last Saturday with my sister and cousin for a night of hanging out.  It ended up being a perfect place to unwind and enjoy good food and company.. . The staff here is very courteous.  I just wanted to make that point clear.  We go in and try to find a seat.  You've got to be aggressive in finding a seat since there's no line or whatever.  We waited for maybe 15 minutes outside before we were able to find a seat.  You can eat inside or chill on the patio outside.  We went inside to order and grabbed a few beers and ordered food.. . I ended up ordering The Office Burger.  I must say it is VERY tasty!  I was surprised with the taste.  It has caramelized onions and boy are they good.  The shoestring fries are also very good!  We kept munching away on those things all night.  I usually am reserved about eating at places that serve drinks like how this one is set up but the food here is amazing.  . . Overall, I think I'm going to add this joint as one of the go to places in LA.  I liked the overall ambiance and vibe in the spot.  It's a cool place to chill and hang out.
