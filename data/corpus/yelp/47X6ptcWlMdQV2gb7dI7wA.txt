Restaurant: Caf√© Circa
Category: Restaurants
I think the Blackened Tilapia or the Spicy Mango Shrimp dish is the way to go here. I have ordered both on multiple occasions &amp; have never left disappointed. The interior of Cafe Circa is spot on... hardwood floors, dramatic curtains, dark wood, etc &amp; they seem to draw an eclectic crowd from all walks of life, which I enjoy... makes for excellent people watching, if nothing else! The service always seems ever-so-slightly off to me &amp; they notoriously are out of some wine, some vodka, or some drink item we've ordered. All in all, it's a great place to start or end an evening with that special someone, especially if you're there on one of the evenings with live jazz... perfect for setting the mood!
