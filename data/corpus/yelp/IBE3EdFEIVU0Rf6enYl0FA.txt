I looked up at the menu and gasped a little in my head expecting cheaper prices but I knew that it'd be worth it.  I ordered the porKetta sandwich totally pronouncing it wrong the first time and waited excitedly for my order.  . . As I step out onto the street and take my first bite, I'm terribly underwhelmed. This is THE porchetta sandwich. It has to be better. I take another rip at the very chewy bread and juicy pork bits but it was no better than the first. The flavoring of the pork was not something I was into and the sandwich overall needed some sort of toppings.  Whoever claims that the flavors of the pork will suffice...they are wrong.
