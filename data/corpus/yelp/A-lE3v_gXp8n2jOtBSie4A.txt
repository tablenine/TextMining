Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I get quite frequent cravings for Orochon, but then after I get there and slurp down my salt #4 I feel like I am going to die of saltiness.  You have to eat your bowl quickly (despite the heat!), because it is NOT good when it gets cold (or spicy...that is one good trick for getting past the spiciness).  But I definitely recommend adding the delicious chunk of pork, and also an egg.  Sometimes the service can be sloppy (hey, where is that beer I ordered 30 minutes ago?), but like I said -- you'll start getting the craving too.
