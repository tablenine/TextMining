Took my mom here for brunch on a saturday around 11:30 and had a great experience. She had the chilaquiles and claimed it was one of the best breakfasts she has ever eaten. The pico de gallo was fresh and fantastic. I had the breakfast burrito which was also outstanding. the portions were huge and we could have gotten by with splitting one. We also shared the cinnamon orange french toast. The first serving was cold so we sent it back, expecting it to be heated up, but they brought us a fresh portion and it was amazing. Not too sweet, but a great balance of flavor. My mom even said the coffee was great. I would recommend it to anyone for brunch on Saturday, it was not busy and there were no urbanites with strollers or kids milling about so it was peaceful and relaxing,
