Market Bar, with all your West loop Glam- Love it! - good additional the Randolph area...you do a great burger and interesting take on the margarita and Dirty- I do avoid you on the weekends and  everyone is freshly spray-tanned and you cannot move on the roof, but I suppose that is one of your assets as the view truly is great. Food is pretty decently priced and haven't really had anything I didn't care for and drinks are the typical $10-$12 range and are poured on the stronger side.  I will be back and hopefully you'll work out a few of the service areas that you are currently lacking.
