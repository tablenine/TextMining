I've been coming here a lot ever since I moved to Chicago. It never fails to make me smile - always lively inside, friendly waitstaff, cute and creative food/drink options, and average prices (at least for this city). I usually get the Big Kahuna Hawaiian burger cause I love me some teriyaki on a burger! I always want to try the deep fried twinkie or milkshake or deep fried brownie bites and banana foster bites, but I get SO full from my meal the I don't have room. One day I will go just to get dessert.
