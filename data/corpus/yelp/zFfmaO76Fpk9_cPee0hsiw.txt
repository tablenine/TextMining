Damn.... I mean damn that was good lobster.. . Tastes so good when I don't have to pay for it, good thing mom and pop were picking up the tab.  $80 for I think 5 lbs of lobster?  I'd say it was worth it considering the quality of the lobster and the preparation was very good, like a typical cantonese style lobster but I seriously think Newport does it the best in SGV.  The garlic, scallion, onion, lobster roe condiment which is stir fried with the lobster is so very good that I was using it as a topping for my rice.. . If lobster is too rich for your blood their other entree's aren't very expensive and are very good.. . We ordered: . . fillet mignon cubes - very tender and actually tasted like steak meat. . fried squid w/ lime and peper salt - on paper it looks like a typical . Cantonese restaurant dish but its very unique here, a bit of Vietnamese influence on the cooking can be seen. . Lettuce wraps with chicken and shrimp fillings - comes with a head of lettuce cut in half and you use the lettuce as a wrap for the chicken + shrimp filling, the flavors in this dish are very VIetnamese influeced as well with hints of mint.. . Sour and spicy seafood soup - not for everyone but I liked it even though I typically dislike sour and hot soups.  Chunks of tomato, pineapple, and tender fish tail.  Such a strange combination but so good especially with the spicy fish sauce condiment to adjust the spice level to your own liking.. . Overall it would have been a moderately priced dinner without the lobster but whatever, nothing like recession-busting lobster to make me feel better about unemployment!
