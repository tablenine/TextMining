Went here for some dinner after our dance lesson and I have to say from a food standpoint, this place is great! . . I was surprised though at how small it was inside. I was thinking from what I had heard that it would be a bit bigger.. . We started out with the chips and salsa and some fresh, homemade guacamole.  The guac is nice and chunky and has a really good flavor. I ended up getting the fish taco, the beef enchilada and the chicken empanada. They were all quite good but I liked the fish taco the best.  It was sweet, fresh and the fish was cooked just right. The beef enchilada had this tangy/spicy sauce on it that, afterwards, ended up giving me some heartburn but as I get older I find I have less of a tolerance for spicy foods so that in no way reflects badly upon them.. . All in all a very nice, very tasty meal.
