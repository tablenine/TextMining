I guess this place can either employ great magicians or great cooks - tough to keep both.  Let's just say the magic was better than the food... but not by that much.. . We got calamari to start.  Someone was practicing their magic in the kitchen.  The trick: making shit smaller.  The subject: calamari.  I had to pick through a lot of fried shell to get to the calamari.  . . I wasn't crazy about any of the meat choices so I had the seafood linguini.  Again - someone fucking around with that magic wand.  Where the seafood be at? Couple of shrimp and some calamari rings does not constitute a "seafood" in the dish name.  . . At $50 per person, it was a bit much - by the way - not including the $25 at the door. . . We skipped dessert and went right into the shows.  I am writing this a week later and I can't say anything sticks out in my mind as amazing.  The guy that MCs the show in the main room was pretty funny, but that was about it.  . . Great first time experience.  Not sure if I would come back.
