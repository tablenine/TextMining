Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I must first admit that Tank is my first experience with a sushi restaurant in Chicago....but honestly I didn't find the quality to be much more exciting than that of Trader Joes pre-packaged sushi plates.. . While the service was extremely attentive and prompt, and the atmosphere minimal and inviting, there isn't much more to say about the place.   Skip the desserts, they seem stale and flavorless.  Drinks are pricey too.. . I should probably give it another try, but I would absolutely put Tank close to the bottom of my sushi list.
