Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Went to Lawry's and the Prime Rib was YuuuMMMMy! I have to say that it was humm humm good! I went because they had a special for two. The meal came with a Lobster tail, salad,desert, and coffee for only $99. This was an awesome deal.. . I have to say that the cream of corn was to die for and I could probably eat that alone. Remember, order the cream of corn as one of your sides because it is great there! Loved IT!. . The atmosphere was beautiful and highly romantic..sOOo boys! Hurry up and impress your date by taking them to Lawry's for this meal, it will definitely win the girl over.
