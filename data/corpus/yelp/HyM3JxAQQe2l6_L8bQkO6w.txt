Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
I came upon this place somewhat randomly while searching for a place to go for my bachelor party dinner.  The reviews were very high (about 4.5 stars) so I made reservations; I wanted to try something new.  The night before the dinner, I mentioned Buona Terra to a couple of friends and they commented that they eat there regularly and love it.  As a result, I expected a lot. . .perhaps too much.  I ordered the spaghettini w/ spicy sauce and seafood.  It was good but not great.  My 5 other friends had similar impressions (ie. Rigatoni, Gnocchi, etc.)  My personal favorite Italian in Chicago is Mia Francesca, and they're still supreme in my book.  The one high note of  the evening however was the prosciutto appetizer.  It was fantasic.  For dessert, the tiramisu was above average.. . In conclusion, if you're in the area it's a decent place for Italian.  The service was as good as the food.  However, I don't think I"ll be going back soon otherwise.  Prices were reasonable at $12-$16 per plate.  A lot of other people love the place so it's definitely a place to try once.
