Not only did I leave happily full smelling like a stick of butter lost in a garlic factory in Louisiana, I also left with a TURTLE [insert joke here]. . . I guess when BC receives deliveries of live Crawfish on a weekly basis they sometimes also are blessed with lifes other little surprises. Namely, live turtles from the marshes of Louisiana. And yes, the stork in this case was BC and we (roommates and I) were the lucky recipient parents. . . We've noticed he/she will ONLY eat real pieces of baby shrimp and not the turtle food pellets. Just our luck... our little bundle of joy is a highbrow, high-class, prima donna from Louisiana.. . ***DISCLAIMER: the turtle was NOT cooked in our bag of crawfish. Â It was given to us, alive, by a waitress who got it from the chef who found it in the live crawfish container.***
