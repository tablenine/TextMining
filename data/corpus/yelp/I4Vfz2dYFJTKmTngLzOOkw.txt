The sooner they open one up in San Francisco, the better the world will be.  5 stars does not do it justice.  Why is it so freaking hard to do good fried chicken in my fair city.  Is it the fog, is it the wind, maybe it's the sustainable chicken?  Let's go down there with a UHAUL and load this place up and drop it off right smack dab in the middle of Hayes Street.  Who's with me !
