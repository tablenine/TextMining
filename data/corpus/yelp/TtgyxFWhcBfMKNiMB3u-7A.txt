Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I avoided this place like the plague, even after several recommendations. "Why?", you say, because of the fashion-obsessed hipsters that continually occupy the corner its located on. Any place that has a regular clientele like the one I see frequenting Gingergrass must served over-priced-fusion-crap! But I was wrong, well... at least about the food. Gingergrass has a wonderful menu, not traditionally Vietnamese fair, but none the less tasty and not over priced. My wife and I regularly order; Green Papaya Chicken Salad, Pork Chops, Chicken Pho, and the Chocolate Banana Spring Rolls to go. Yes, takeout, I still can't stand the crowd!
