The moist and savory cesar salad is what keeps me coming back to Real Food Daily. It is the best vegan salad I've ever had -- perfectly seasoned cesar dressing, wheat-free croutons, capers and not too much sauce. I brought some home with me and my non-vegan sister was floored at how mouthwatering it was. I also like their T.V. dinner, Salisbury Seitan and the Yerba Mate and Chai Lattes are good. The veggie loaf and seitan steak were definitely more flavorsome than their farm animal duplicate. Most of their other food offerings are also non-wheat, for those who don't do wheat.. . I did encounter some strange food items that weren't necessarily bad -- just tiring. The lentil-walnut pate with rice crackers is simple and delicious in moderation. The problem is there is way too much lentil-walnut pate. The cold sesame noodle salad had too many soba noodles. However, I couldn't get enough of the peanut sauce.. . I also enjoy their desserts here. Their cakes are fresh-tasting which makes them absolutely delicious! This is in comparison to some vegan restaurants' desserts which taste like they've been lounging in storage for two weeks.. . I love going on dinner dates with non-vegans here to surprise them at how rich vegan food can taste. But I do feel compelled to monitor what they order.
