I went to No Mas this evening (how pressed am I to write this review) and I must say, the food wasn't as bad as the reviews made it out to be. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.. . I had the fish tacos. They were solid. My brother had the burrito and thought it was very meh (I wasn't shocked. Who orders burritos at a place like this?) The margaritas were great. Guava FTW! . . Besides the food, the place looks amazing. Great patio! We stopped next door and grabbed a few churros on the way out and they were great.. . I'd come back here. Nice ambiance, decent food, great drinks. It works.
