This is pretty much one of my favorite restaurants. The food may not be traditional but it always leaves me feeling fresh and light as opposed to fat and disgusting.. The vegetarian pho and the bo bia rolls are my favorites. This place is so reasonably priced and you can grab a good bottle of wine at Silverlake wine to accompany your dinner. . The crowd is kind of obnoxious but there are hot waiters and last time I was there Ron Livingston was at the table next to me. I was so tempted to mention the post-it break up but I resisted.. This is a restaurant that has never disappointed me and that is much more than I can say for most things and people. Wow, bitter much?
