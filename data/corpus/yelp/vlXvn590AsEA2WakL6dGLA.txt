Some claim that this is one of the best burgers in LA so I had to try it. I've lived in LA my whole life and I love burgers. The burger was ok at best.. . I tried both the regular and hickory burger. Neither was anything to write home about. I expected a lot more from a $7 burger. It wasnt especially big, no fries, nothing except attitude for $7. . . This is a tourist trap at best.. . I'll stick to Fat Burger or In-n-Out any day over one of these burgers. Both are head and shoulders above this place.. . At best you are paying for nostalgia maybe. I don't know. It didn't do anything for me. Its not worth your time (long line.. think Disneyland).
