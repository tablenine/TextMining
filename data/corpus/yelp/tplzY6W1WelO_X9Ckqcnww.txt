I got me some (potato) balls!. . On Saturday, after our crochet group meeting across the street at Panera Bakery, my friend Jane &amp; I headed over to Portos.. I've had some of those delicious fruit tortes at parties, heard the hype, but have never been in.. . So, of course, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about!. Wow, that place is hopping!  . 4pm &amp; it was crowded.  Four Disneyland-type queues to work the crowd!. . I wanted to pick up some of those potato balls I've been hearing about.. Got a packaged dozen.. . The line(s) situation is a bit chaotic &amp; confusing, we both had to switch lines &amp; then I had to go to yet another line to pick up some sandwiches I added on. (1 star docked). No biggie.  I guess it's part of the experience.. . While standing in line, I couldn't help but look at the baked goods.. Oy, I was drooling.. Jane was picking up a fruit tart &amp; some cheese rolls for her family.  She offered me some of the cheese rolls, but I've been eating out a lot lately, so with regret, "No, that's okay."  Damn my diabetes.. . Those balls.....just as good as hyped!. Warm, crunchy on the outside, mashed potato-y layer that leads to the meat filling in the middle.  I guess the word to use is: savory.  Not something I could eat normally, but so good that I'm putting these in my "Special Treat" category.  Worth making the trip over there in the future.. . OOOOOOOOOOOO !!!
