There's a reason why there are over 100 positive reviews to this place. It's simply the greatest! Clean restaurant, fresh food, and friendly environment. . . Pork dumplings (the juicy ones) and Rice Cake are my favorites. A must try. . . Usually there's a wait but I for one think it's worth it. Down fall: They are closed bewteen certain hours.3-5pm? Not sure..
