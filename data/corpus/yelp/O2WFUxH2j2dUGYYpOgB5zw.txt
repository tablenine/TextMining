I've read a couple of reviews in the Weekly praising the pulled pork sandwich and the fries. So, I've just come from my first visit to the Oinkster and am now convinced that the writer is on the take.. . I had the touted pulled pork and the fries and liked neither. The sandwich was made with mushy pre-chewed pork that was so bland that catsup would have improved it.. . The fries had the consistency of straightened Cheetos without any flavor. They were dry and crumbly. Maybe they would have been better if they had been served hot.. . Friends who had been to Oinkster were negative about the food and warned me away. The Weekly raved so much, I had to try it, anyway.. . I should have paid attention to the bad word-of-mouth.
