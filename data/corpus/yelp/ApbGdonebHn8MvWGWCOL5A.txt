I've been hearing all this hype about this Kogi BBQ truck, so I had to go and see it for myself.  I made a lunch trip to LA hoping that the line wouldn't be too long.  I waited about an hour, but I must say, it was SOOOO WORTH THE WAIT!!. . I knew I had to try their signature Korean Short Ribs not only because it was popular, but because it was something different.  Before I got to the front of the line to order, we were told that we had an $11.00 limit (not including drinks) in order to serve everyone.  I was fine with that, and that would be more than enough for me to get what I wanted.  . . So I ordered a Korean Short Rib Burrito and a Korean Chicken taco, but I guess my order got mixed up and I ended up with a Korean Spicy Pork Taco, which was pretty good.  Personally, I like tacos. But after tasting the the burrito, I know better next time not to waste any time on the tacos!  One bite into my Korean Short Rib Burrito and I fell in love!  It was literally a FOODGASM!, unlike anything I've ever tasted, and hands down, THE BEST BURRITO I have ever tasted! It was filled with romaine lettuce topped with a special dressing, sesame seeds, and some cheese.  And it just totally HIT THE SPOT!. . If you love Korean BBQ, Kalbi (short ribs), and burritos, you're going to love the Kogi BBQ Truck!
