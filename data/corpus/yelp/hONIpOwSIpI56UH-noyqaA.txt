Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
I had been here a few times before. I went with a couple friends yesterday because the weather was so warm compared to recent temperatures. My friend wanted to get some barbecue, so I told him we should go to Smoke Daddy. He was in heaven. He got a barbecue chicken sandwich with mac and cheese. He also tried the Shiner Bock beer, from Texas. He was also very impressed with that. . . I was NOT impressed that the waiter forgot my coke. But, hey, it happens. I just munched on the sweet potato fries. I think they could make them a little crunchier rather than soggy, but the taste is good. Give this place a go if you are craving some bbq.
