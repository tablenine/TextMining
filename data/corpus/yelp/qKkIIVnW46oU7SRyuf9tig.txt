I have dreams about this place and it's always the same. I'm waiting in line and it's snowing and right before we sit down (even though I don't know who "we" are) I wake up and start to cry.. . I love this place and if you read all the other reviews, most of them all talk about the Mediterranean flat bread and the salad here you mix the two dressings together to create the best tasting dressing in the world! The world I tell you! . . Man I miss this place.. . Do they not serve beer any more?
