Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Well.. there are quite a lot of reviews of Hide, most good, some not-so-good.. . I typically go with my girlfriend, who just happens to be Japanese, legitimate, L&amp;R confused, speaks 4 languages Japanese.  She also happens to know everyone who works there and works nearby at another place 3 nights a week.  I'm not sure I get any better service than anyone else, but I know what to expect, have eaten pretty much everywhere in LA and NYC, and I don't worry about what's not available.. . Hide has first and foremost, high quality fish second to none.  Everything is fresh all the time.  They close early (9pm??!?!).  They pack an enormous amount of staff, an enormous amount of customers, and an enormous amount of tasty fish into a place I'd call a small studio apartment.. . It is literally the best sushi you'll find anywhere.  The cut's aren't gigantic, but much more generous than tons of places with bad fish.  They won't serve you anything bad.  They are generous about making sure your ocha is topped off, and if they are busy and miss you for a few minutes, happy to oblige if you bring it to their attention.. . Try the jellyfish!  Ask to see the Uni before you order it.  The Toro melts in your mouth.  The salmon was good enough to get 3 orders!  Unagi is the bomb-diggidy, but the Anago is oishii yo!. . I have seen bad reviews of this place, and I honestly can't believe it.. . Cash is a drag, but if you don't mind hitting the atm, you'll save 40% over another place.  2 pieces of Uni sushi for $5.90!  Can't beat it.. . I would say that if you're interested in a hip, trendy, crowd, Hide isn't the place.  But if you love great fish, and don't mind the lack of bullshit in the atmosphere, it's the best place I've been in town.  I've had the same quality and more atmosphere other places, but for twice the price.. . Gambatene!
