Been here a few times and loved the food , so I decided this would be the spot I would go to for my birthday dinner. . . I had the ropa vieja and it was delicious. It came with black beans, white rice, and plantains. The portion was a little small for my taste, but by the end of the meal, including bread and appetizers, I was deliciously full. . . I had the raspberry mojito and it wasn't my very mojito I've ever had. I'm one of those Americans that prefer sweet mojitos. I know.. makes no sense. But I liked it. I also had a strawberry margarita... yum. . . Overall this place is excellent. Can't wait to go back.
