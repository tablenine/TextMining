Alright, I totally forgot about this place.  I understand that its a "glorified Cheesecake Factory," but frankly I'd rather eat at Cheesecake factory.. . Firstly, the help here is bad.  And when I say bad, I mean like awful.  You'd think that during a lunch visit, service would be moderately quick, and they'd want to move people in and out.  No sir.  Not only were they slow, but they were also slow in the mental sense.  They are much like that one kid in elementary school that was mainstreamed with the normal kids, but everyone knew was actually retarded and should be in a special class.  I know you know the one I'm talking about. At my school, Jimmy could usually be found with his pants around his ankles taking a dump in the urinal.  . . Anyway... Onto the food.  This place is awful awful food.  And I've been here at least 10 times, because I used to work nearby.  I've ordered many different, greasy things, and all of them were greasy and made my poop sick.. . My biggest qualm with Luxe cafe, is the jackasses that dine here.  Obviously I am not a great person, but I can handle myself in public and at a restaurant.  The morons that dine here, think they're either God's gift to mankind, or they think it's Disneyland.  It's like a fucking circus of morons, all trying to fill their faces with sweaty meats wrapped in thin layers of pulpy cheese.  . . This is NOT a good restaurant, and I feel for you if you ever must eat here.  Also the bathrooms look like someone opened up a fire hydrant of compost and couldn't shut it off.  Since the toilets didn't work, I guess I had to open up my 40 pound bag of peat moss over the urinal, just like young Jimmy.
