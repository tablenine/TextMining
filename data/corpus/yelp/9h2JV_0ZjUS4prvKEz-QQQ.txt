Restaurant: The Modern
Category: French
This restaurant was a high priority during our week in new york for CMJ.  We made a reservation for the bar area because we were dining with musician friends who are sensitive to price.  Honestly, I was glad we booked at the bar, the portions are half the size and the prices probably a little bit more then half and that was OK with me.. . The food was very good modern french, served in a kind of modified tapas style (the menu has sections called "1, 2 &amp; 3" and the waiter encourages you (agressively, in my mind) to order at least three plates per person. Wife &amp; I did that, friends got by- easily- with two dishes.. . The general style of the cuisine should be familiar to anyone who's eaten "nouvelle cuisine" in the last decade- small pieces of very rich protein, different kinds of non overwhelming sauces and a little bite of grain or vegetable with each course.. . In my tourist costume of american apparel polo and jeans I felt underdressed, but I've eaten at enough five star restaurants on the west coast (gary dankos, french laundy, chez panisse) to not really give a fuck.. . The courses were uniformly outstanding, not a sour note was stuck, but I do heartily disagree with the restaurants assertion that you need three dishes at least to fill up. Maybe if you are a huge fatso.. . The wine list was impressive and not overprice that badly.
