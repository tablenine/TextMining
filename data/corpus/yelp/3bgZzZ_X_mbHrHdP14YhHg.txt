Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Great (maybe the best?) first date place. The food is good enough and the martinis are just gimmicky enough to keep you and your date occupied enough to figure each other out.. . Much can be ascertained about a person by how they handle themselves at a martini bar / restaurant. What do they choose? Are they experimental? Are they faking their knowledge of things? How do they act after a drink or two?. . Find out all this and much much more at Lola's.. . My one tiny issue with the place (and most places in LA as a lifetime resident) is that at the level of what they charge for the food, drinks, etc (which I don't mind) they don't need to charge for valet. A validation from the waitress and a tip for the valet should suffice.. . Okay, I'm done.
