I am not giving this place 5 stars for their famous "pizza pot pies."  Rather, I am giving this place 5 stars for their phenomenal house-made salad dressings (which come with the huge Chef Salad portions) -- a garlicy sour cream dressing that is reminiscent of tzatziki, and a sweet and sour poppyseed that will make you want to eat nothing but salads all day long.  Not only is each dressing perfectly deliciously on its own, but combine the two, and it's a match made in heaven.  You can buy bottles of the salad dressing (which must be kept refrigerated) to take home with you, but alas, for someone who lives thousands of miles away, that's no longer possible (especially with the no-liquids flying rules these days).. . The Mediterranean bread is also quite flavorful and serves as the perfect accompaniment to the Chef's Salad.. . There is always a long wait on weekend nights, but go a little later on a week night, and you won't have to wait long or at all.
