Say it with me kids: Die-Ah-Bee-Tees.. . I am fearful of getting diabetes from the overconsumption of sugar and fat at this establishment. While it is very satisfying to consume fluffy buttered waffles smothered in sugary syrup ALONGSIDE chicken- fried to a golden glow, of course- the best way to cook anything, really; I have to say that I if I stop chewing, I can almost feel my arteries cringe a little. Yes, that was a run-on sentence. I tend to use those quite a bit, you'll find.. . Anyhow, not much else to add to the plethora of reviews by other more eloquent (and probably more optimistic) yelpers. Just a word of caution: the next time your inner child screams for fat and sugar, tell him/her to shoosh because you can't afford daily blood sugar tests- you have to pay for gas.
