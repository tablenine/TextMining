Restaurant: Honey Pig

DS, PY and I decided to try this Korean BBQ place.  It was sort of a trip for me to head all the out there but I was interested in eating some Korean BBQ.  Honey Pig is definitely a good name for a Korean BBQ place.  I braved the storm and drove up to Duluth for some Korean BBQ.  Upon parking my car, one of waiters came out with an umbrella and escorted me to the door.  Now I call that service.  The guy had to literally look out the and watched for cars to park in the lot and I might not even be going to Honey Pigs.  The menu is pretty simple.  You just pick your meat of choice.  We had pork belly, thinly sliced bugolgi beef, and boneless BBQ spare ribs.  All the meat was pretty damn good.  There was a few different wrap options for the meat I have not seen before.  The only that I was really familiar was the lettuce leaves.  There was thinly sliced of flour paper and thinly sliced of radish.  I preferred the tradition lettuce and the sliced radishes.  I thought the flour wraps were too oily to hold with your bare hands and lack the crisp you get from the other two options.  There was also a ton of options to make wraps with.  Among them were grill beansprouts, grilled kimchi lettuce, garlic, jalapeno, hot sauce, Korean sauce (which I don't know the name off), and a pickled jalapeno and onion combination.  I was already stuffed by the three types of meat and all the wraps I have made from it.  Someone should off warned me about their end of meal additions.  When we said we were done, the waiter brought out the fried rice, squid, and soup.  That's a lot of food.  Everything was done pretty well.
