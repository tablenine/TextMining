Restaurant: Over Easy Café
Category: American (Traditional)
So the sassy eggs has affected my life, my mouth salivates at the thought.  I was introduced to Over Easy a couple of months ago by another Yelp Member and friend Mildred.  And since then it has quickly become one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places.  . . The size of the cafe is small, but cozy and the traffic of people eating and waiting is pretty constant, but I have not yet had to wait to sit to eat.  . . If you ever come to this Cafe, must haves are of course the sassy eggs, the banana stuffed french toast, and their multigrain toast is delish.  They also have a good amount of teas to warm you up on a cold chicago winter day!. . Eat here, you won't be disappointed!
