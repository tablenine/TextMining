So, given this is my local go-to takeout food, you have to take this review with the natural bias that it is full of. That being said, I think Tender Greens is top-notch as far as fresh, healthy food goes. I think I have had everything on the menu, and I still come back for the Ahi sandwich with spinach green salad. The trick is to call about 10-15 minutes ahead and order - the line at TG can be ridiculous at times. However, more than once they have not had my meal ready when I have called ahead - seriously poor communication at this place. They are trying to fix this with making everything automated (i.e. orders by name flow through system with tickets), but it still isn't fool-proof. . . If you're in the area (seeing a movie, being too trendy at the few wine bars lurking around the corner), consider checking TG out. They have Stone beer on tap usually, which is also a huge plus.
