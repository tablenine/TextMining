Restaurant: 123 Burger Shot Beer

Great for a group.  We (about 20 people from a cast) showed up on a Saturday night and took the private downstairs room.  One big (-) for the private downstairs room is no AC.  Yikes.  . . The price is right, however, I just looked at the website and the pictures of the $1 burgers, $2 shots, and $3 beer are a JOKE.  The website shows this big burger with lettuce, toppings, etc.  No.  It's a slider.  A good, greasy, clog-your-artery slider.  Also, you have to buy 3 of them.  So it's really not $1 burgers , but 3 burgers for $3.  Follow me there?  . . They have great sweat potato fries ($3).  Sweet, salty, fried... can't get much better.  . . The $2 shots are weak and only 1oz (50-100% less than a "normal" shot").  .  But, they are $2... so buy 3 and call it a shot.  Also, there is a short list of only sweet shots that are $2.  Bummer.  . . For us, the owner and waitress was also very helpful and fun.  Put AC downstairs, add some decent shots with 1.5 oz, to the $2 menu, and I can easily see this jumping up to the top of my list.
