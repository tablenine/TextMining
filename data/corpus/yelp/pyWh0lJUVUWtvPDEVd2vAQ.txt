It's true, the guacamole here is choice. Served fresh table-side with lots of lime juice and a nice spicy kick (unless you request it mild) it's some of the best guac you can get in Chicago and for the highest price... at $8.00 a pop it's not necessarily the best deal on the menu but it is impossible to pass up. . . The rest of the menu does follow suit with slightly higher prices than what you've come to expect for Mexican fare, but the quality of the amazing dishes more than makes up for it... the empanadas and sopes surtidos ("little masa cups") are yummy starters that are not only beautifully presented but positively delicious. The Arrachera Adobada Plate with grilled flank steak and veggies was juicy and perfectly cooked, but when ordered with the intention of sharing, it fell a bit short with portioning... kinda skimpy. . . On a side note, I also once hosted an event here upstairs in one of their party rooms for 45 people. The room was lovely and appointed like the rest of the space... lots of gorgeous Mexican tiling and artwork, tons of candlelight and our private bar was on point. Add in their attentive service, it was very impressive to my clientele!! We did tons of passed hors d' oeuvres, their signature fresh guacamole, hand shaken margaritas and premium liquor for all under $35 p/head. Viva Adobo Grill!! The party was such a fantastic deal while just a dinner or lunch here often seem overly-expensive. Hmmm.... . . Either way I often find myself dreaming about that guacamole so I know I'll be back. As a matter I fact, I think I hear that Adobo Margarita served martini style calling my name as I type. Gotta jet..... . . ........I'm coming Tequila!!!!!!!
