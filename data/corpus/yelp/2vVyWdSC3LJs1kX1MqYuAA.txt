Apple Pan Review Haikus . * . . The simple comfort . nestled amongst condos, malls . The simple menu . . * . . The cheese is stacked high . Gordon serves you the best stuff . and your stomach sighs. . . * . . Tower of iceberg . steak burger and perfect fries . they pour your ketchup . . * . flakey crusted pies . ingredients are tasted . real cream on my pie . . *  . . Does it have to rock . Can it just be old fashioned . Yes quality forever . . (the end) . . when I lived in LA this made me feel like there was something normal and untainted left in the world.  Did you know that many of the employees have worked there for over 20 years ?  That comforts me somehow, even when they are surly.  You see, if you're nice and you follow the rules, they are nice to you.  I miss Gordon and I heard he asked a friend about the Chubby Bunny.  I don't know why, but that makes me feel like a champ.
