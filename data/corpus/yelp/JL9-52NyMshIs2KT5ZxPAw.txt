Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
I went there today with a couple of friends after going to a catered lunch. I said I wasn't going to eat anything. This changed after I saw the menu. A pound of snow crab for $6.99?! (+$2 since it wasn't takeout and they boiled it for me) My friends ordered a couple of pounds of crawfish and then one of the meals. . . This place is spicy. I didn't expect my boiled crab legs to come out covered with Old Bay, but it was incredibly good. Probably the best crab legs I've ever had - very meaty and positively fell out of the shell. I got this with the corn on the cob ($1 for 2 half pieces) which helped to cut the spice occasionally. . . Sure, the place is tiny, the music sucks (Christian pop - really?!), and it is impossible to find it without doing a U-turn on Buford, but this is some seriously good service and seafood. Definitely going back.. . The owner told us that they are getting po-boys NEXT WEEK.
