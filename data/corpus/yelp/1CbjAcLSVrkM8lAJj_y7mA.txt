Restaurant: Mirai
Category: Sushi Bars
I have been to Mirai a few over the past years and it never disappointed. . . There are 2 levels of seating. Upstairs is a lounge and bar (louder) and downstairs is more of a normal restaurant seating. . . The food is delicious. My recommendation is to get the chef's special maki mono (rolls). I haven't had rolls this good anywhere. These aren't your bland tempura crab or spicy tuna rolls, each roll is a work of art (and is priced so ~$15).. . Not the best environment if you want a romantic date, since it can get loud. But a splurge on Sushi with a group of friends = perfect.
