This is a very good sports bar.  I will definitely go here to watch sports, particularly if I am watching with a group.  It is big and spacious and shiny and new on the inside, and they offer the typical Taco Mac fabulous beer selection.  The service seems to be very friendly - I have been here twice and found our table server as well as the bartenders to be extremely pleasant.  The food is what we have all come to know and accept at Taco Mac: it's decent if you stick to basics like chips and queso dip, nachos and wings, but disappointing if you stray much further.  They also do have Photo Hunt, which is fabulous.. . On a Friday night, they seemed to have a big crowd most of whom were not watching a game of any sort.  I don't think I would make this my normal hangout destination (I do live much closer to Cypress Street ;) but I would happily go here to watch a sporting event on TV.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Taco Mac!
