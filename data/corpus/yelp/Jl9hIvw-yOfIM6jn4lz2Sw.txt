OK, we have to admit it--we went just because its famous.  I had the vegetarian dog and my husband had the Rosie O'Donnell.  We weren't very impressed, but enjoyed the beautiful day out back on the patio for a bit.  If you're shopping at Melrose/LeBrea, its worth hitting up just to see it. From a tourist perspective, I don't recommend going too far out of your way to eat there, unless you're in the neighborhood.
