Mm... Ramen.... My first impression of the place.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??. The line was insanely long!!!  The moment i went inside, I really felt like I was in a japanese ramen house.  The decor was very  ethnic (which i liked!) but the resturant was cramped and stuffy.... . The pork ramen was yummy! The noodles were a bit hard but I didn't mind.  THE SOUP IS GOOD!!! i ended up pouring some soup into my tuna rice bowl just to savor it a bit longer.. hee hee.... . Btw.. i think its a better deal to get pork ramen+tuna bowl combo then just tuna bowl. ;0)
