4 Stars only because of limited seating. I had a big group of friends with me and it was already packed, so we had to walk across the street to sneak into the already closed mall and eat at 2 of the tables. But anyways... . The burgers are delicious, you watch them make them right in front of you, and theyre pretty big burgers. I also got the slice of apple pie, and that was alright. It was super juicy so when we were running across the street it spilled in the bag. But the ice cream scoop was still intact and that was tasty. :)
