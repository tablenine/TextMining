panes is delicious.  everything i've had has been well above-average.  don't forget, it's cash-only :). . the tortilla salad is great, as is the todo italiano.  i highly recommend the chicken club.  the only thing i wouldn't get again is the hummus appetizer.  it's just so-so.  but their bread is incredible.  definitely the highlight of every meal there.
