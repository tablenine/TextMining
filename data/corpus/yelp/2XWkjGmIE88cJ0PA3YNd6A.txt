Ah, HB it's been a while, but I am still a huge fan of the wonderful things that come out of your kitchen. I want to see the man behind the curtain! What's going on back there? Whatever it is, I like so keep it up.. . BUT, and this is a big one, you really need to work on that whole size thing (in terms of the size of the place of course). but they say size isn't everything. who are we kidding? it is indeed. Just a smidge or two larger and we'll be best friends again.. . Menu items worth mentioning:. . Smoked Gouda tasting appetizer (nice portion size). truffle fries (tasty but don't dare trying reheating them). smoked chicken sandwich (outstanding). . other noteables:. Staff did a great job of managing our small group and other tables throughout the dining room, give or take a few hiccups and waiting games, OH and they are still BYOB and will keep your beverages chilled.
