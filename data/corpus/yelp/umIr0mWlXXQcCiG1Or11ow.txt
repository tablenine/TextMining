Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
My income primarily goes to three places: mortgage, utility bills, and Cafe Selmarie.  At one point, we were dining here at least once a week (sometimes more) and I have never had a bad meal here.  Everything is delicious.  The outdoor seating is nice -- especially when there is a live band playing in the square -- and the waitstaff is awesome.
