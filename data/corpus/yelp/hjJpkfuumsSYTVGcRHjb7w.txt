monday night football! home-made mustards served in tiny plastic! eagle rock families!    a robust veggie burger with layer of fancy thousand island, served in a grilled bun------- crowd energy in the place was amazing, community! evan got a pulled pork sandwich- purple cabbage, sliced like the earth.    french fries with shimmering garlic aoli--------- green bay packers fans,   the myth of the peanut butter and jelly cupcake (we ate a typical brownie instead----dreaming of diners-----) . . beer on tap too!  easy to maneuver menu---------
