Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
My curiosity: Born from the hype and daily crowds out-the-door. My impression: Overrated. . My one experience at Casa Bianca Pizza seems to be my last. After waiting an hour for a table for three and about an hour for our large vegetarian pizza to arrive our expectations were diminished when the bland product - made with canned mushrooms, dull sauce, and an unmemorable crust - arrived large and disappointing. I was baffled by the still growing wait-list and noise filled dining room...what was all the hype about? Maybe pizza isn't the real signature dish after all.... . Then again, my sister once took a pie to go and divulged that on her drive home she nearly finished the whole thing.
