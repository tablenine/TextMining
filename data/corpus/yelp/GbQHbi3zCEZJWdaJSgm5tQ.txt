Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This is my favorite lunch spot. Lovely staff, great little menu, fun atmosphere, always a good playlist on the speakers and such tasty sweets. The coffee is also the best - Intelligentsia! The specials are almost always worth ordering, as are the salads in the refrigerated case. The regular menu of sandwiches offer something for everyone - the house made roast beef sandwich and smoked gouda &amp; avocado sandwich are two of my favorites. I've tried them all and have been pleased with all. The pastries are always fantastic - love any struesel bar and the lemon lavendar sugar cookies. Â And I love their black iced tea. Breakfast is also tasty - hard to beat their granola!. . I love Milk &amp; Honey, and wish I still worked across the street!
