Expect a big hot mess!! Food all over your hands and face.. it's the best way to eat!!. . Whenever I am craving shrimp and crawfish, this is the place to go! There is nothing like sitting at a restaurant full of people ready to get down and grub! I usually order 2 pounds of food for myself just because you eat and eat and eat and don't know when you are full until you stand up. Get the whole shabang because it is all buttery, garlic goodness, especially when you peel off that shrimp and soak it into the sauce.. mmmm =] . . The catfish is alright.. not the best but it helps balance all the heavy buttery taste of the sauce. I prefer the cajon fries just because carbs with shrimp is soooo fulfilling! The clams, sausages, and corn are all very good as well!. . This place gets reallyyyy packed!! So don't be afraid to order to go and lay it all out at home!
