Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So, my last time at Pink's was about 10 years ago. I just couldn't figure out why I couldn't recall what they tasted like. Now I know, it's because they suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. Good lord, wtf - talk about hype. It's not worth the line, hell - I wouldn't get one without a line. I can't believe I spent that much time waiting for it, usually when I'm hungry and have waited in line for that long - anything taste good, that is not the case with Pink's, they managed to suck even after all that. . . The reason they get two stars? Well, simple - it's because we placed an order of about 6 different dogs, and two types of fries - and the guy remembered the whole thing in one shot. I need to find out how he does this, it was downright impressive. Unfortunately that little parlor trick is only worth a 1 star bump for the mediocre hot dogs.
