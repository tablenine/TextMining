I've dined here twice &amp; love the decor, sitting on pillows and the food.  The borek is delicious, as is the zatar bread.  The chicken choban is very yummy.  . . My only complaint is that a child (not sure if it was the child of a person that works there or another customer) would come to our table alot.  It was cute at first, but when he started grabbing sugar cubes, licking &amp; biting into them and putting them back in the bowl or on our plates, trying to take off with my drink and jumping around and behind us on the pillows.  I felt like we deserved a discount for babysitting after having to tell this child 'no' several times.
