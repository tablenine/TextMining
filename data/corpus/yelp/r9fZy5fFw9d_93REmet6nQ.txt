Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I lurve my meat so I was salivating by the mere thought of Fogo de Chao.  I had only been to one Brazilian meatfest prior to this (PICANHA Palm Desert) and it was the worst meal of my life (= bad bad food + terrible terrible service).  Anything, even meat cooked on a George Forman Grill by a toddler would have made me happier.  Fogo de Chao had a decent salad bar and the meat quality was okay to me.  Nothing fabulous.  The meats were all either too fatty or dry/chewy to me.  But the service was good and that counts a lot when you're dining out.  I'm not a fan of those cheese filled bread balls, one or two is enough for me, but people rave about them.  I went on a Sunday night and it was not crowded at all - I felt foolish for worrying that I was late for my reservation.
