This was a nice place to come for drinks and appetizers on a beautiful late-summer night. . . We sat outside on the patio, so I can't comment on what went on beyond the bar or hostess station.  Outside though, it was quiet and comfortable, and able to accommodate our group of 7.  . . Our waitress was patient with our group, and made a suggestion to switch the drinks we ordered to something that would give us more bang for the buck, and I thought that was cool.  The mini classic mojitos were good, but next time, I'd pass on the pomegranate ones and stick with the classic.  . . Of all the small plates we ordered, I only sampled the vegetarian ones.  While I didn't think any were spectacular, the artichoke and goat cheese arepas, and the boniato and plantain croquetas were good.  My boyfriend also said that the sofrito shrimp cazuela was very good.  . . I'd like to come back and check out the inside seating, as well as the rest of the menu, or at least the vegetarian dishes on it.
