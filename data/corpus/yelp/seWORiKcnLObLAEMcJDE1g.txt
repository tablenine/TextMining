Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The prime rib was really yummy, and the portions were huge. People raved to me about the "spinning salad," but I wasn't that impressed. What turned me off about the place was the ambience. There wasn't any! People were dressed in sweatshirts, hats...My direct view was of a man sitting in a booth with no socks on. If I'm going to be paying that much for food ($120ish, for prime rib for two and 3-4 sides and two glasses of wine). If I'm spending 60 bucks a person, I like to sit down, and feel special...not like I'm at a freakin Chilli's.
