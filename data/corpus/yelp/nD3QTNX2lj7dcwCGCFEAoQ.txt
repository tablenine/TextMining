Roaming around culver city induced a great appetite and perusing yelp pointed me to Tender Greens.. . I wish I had tried the ahi tuna and mashed potatoes that everyone had been raving about but my Steak hot plate + romaine hearts was definitely something that piqued my taste buds. The steak was juicy and appealing while the salad was fresh and was moderate on the dressing (which is something I prefer). The mint lemonade was also a plus and kept me hydrated as I chilled out on the outdoor seating.. . I will definitely return to try their tuna/mashed potatoes/beer offerings~
