Whoa, this is probably the best sushi I've ever had.  Of course, I have only eaten sushi in Southern California, so I don't have a lot to compare it to.. . As many have pointed out, it's crowded, cash only, and the menu is sparse.  I was embarrassed for the couple next to me who tried to order a Rainbow roll, and the sushi chef responded, "Japanese style!"  . . The two of us spent about 40 bucks for both of our meals. We didn't order alcohol, but the drinks are limited to water, beer, sake, and soft drinks.  . . Everything we tried melted in our mouths.  The albacore was the highlight of the evening.  I ordered things I would never usually try, and was not disappointed.  . . Go here for fresh, real, sushi!
