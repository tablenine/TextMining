My boyfriend took me to Red Light on our date night, and gosh, I hope he doesn't read this.... They clearly put a lot of money into decorating Red Light.  It's gorgeous, and everything from the seating to the lighting flows together well.  That said, their menu could have deserved a little more attention.  I'm a vegetarian and we went to Red Light in part because they have a vegetarian menu- a piece of paper laminated that's handed to you separately.  (PET PEEVE: why segregate veg dishes?  it's not like meat eaters would be offended if they were in the "real" menu.)  . I ordered the eggplant dumplings and the curry.  The dumplings were good, though the portion was a small 5 pieces.  The curry was terrible.  I've had better at Thai Village on Division.  The eggplant in the curry was undercooked and spongey, the mushrooms weren't washed well enough and were gritty, and the potato in it was overcooked and sticky.  . I'd go back to Red Light for a drink at the lovely bar... but not for dinner.
