There's not much new I can say that hasn't already been said . . . . Poor service, mediocre food, overpriced, they love to squeeze large parties into small booths, etc.. . I'll eat here in the Summer as it is the only place around with outdoor seating.. . And what is up with the bathroom?  Why is there a lock on the outside?  Do they plan on holding me hostage?
