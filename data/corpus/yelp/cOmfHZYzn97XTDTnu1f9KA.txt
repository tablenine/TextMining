More of 3.5 stars given the price. I spent $40, not including drinks. The bacon wrapped dates were delish by far. The steak was ok. The mushrooms were very good. Nothing was a standout, but nothing was bad either. It's a cool atmosphere and a cool place to go with friends and try lots of different food. . . You can bring your own wine.
