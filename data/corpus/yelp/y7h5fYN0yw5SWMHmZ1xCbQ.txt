yes the line is long and you will wait but that is NOT the fault of the store.  There are just that many people that love the food.  They have at least a dozen people behind the counter taking orders and there are a half dozen ringing up the orders.  There is even a gal taking orders from people in line. They honestly fo all they can to move things along.  There is a separate section for cater and that sort of cake orders, plus a separate section for non-bakery orders.  Yeah you might need to wait for a table but there are even spots outside if that is your thing.  As far as things to get you MUST MUST MUST try the coconut macaroons.  Best on the planet.  The elephant ears are amazing.  The gauva and mango rolls to die for.  Everything chocolate just wow.  This place is deadly for the diet concerned.. . ENJOY
