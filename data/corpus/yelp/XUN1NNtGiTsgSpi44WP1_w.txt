I really like the soup, and the noodles (I get them cooked hard) are light and deceptively filling. I've been here a couple times and I'm still finding my favorite "preference" as they allow you to choose how heavy your soup base is, noodles (soft, regular, hard) and a sundry of things to add like chashu and egg. I enjoyed it, I also had it with the gyoza which was decent but not particulary memorable.
