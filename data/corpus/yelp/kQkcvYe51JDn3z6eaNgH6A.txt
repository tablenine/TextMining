Wafels and Dinges was absolutely delicious! Visited NYC from Cali in Februrary and knew we had to try Wafels and Dinges after watching them on Throwdon with Bobby Flay. The guy who worked at the wafel truck was super nice. Liege wafel + spekaloos + fresh strawberries + fudge = absolute deliciousness!!!! The wafel itself was quite messy to eat but it was sooo good! Wish they had one of these in California!
