Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza

Maybe I was expecting too much???  I had heard so many rave reviews about Mozza, that I was really expecting a lot.  But while the pizza is good, it's a bit overrated.  . . For our antipasti, we had the olives, fried squash blossoms with ricotta, and green beans, hazelnuts &amp; mustard vinaigrette.  Not sure why we ordered the olives, except that my friend loves olives.  The squash blossom and green beans were just ok.  . . For the pizza, we ordered tomato, fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions, gorgonzola dolce, fingerling potatoes, radicchio &amp; rosemary and the long cooked broccoli, caciocavallo &amp; chiles.  When we finally got the pizzas, they were all burnt, which ruined the flavor of the pizzas in part.  The best pizza of the three was the fennel sausage.  The other two were very bland for some reason.   I've been to Mozza twice and had similar experiences.  The pizza is just ok, and definitely not worth a long wait.
