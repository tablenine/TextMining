As soon as I was gonna give up on Chicago's taste in clothing style, I walked into Rodan.  Most stylish crowd I've seen in 6 months!!!  Oh gingham dress shirts, striped bow ties, red lips and chucks....I love you Rodan or to be more accurate...I love you Rodan go'ers!  Anywho's drinks weren't the best but pricing is reasonalble.  Place is kinda small.  Good music, props to the DJ!  =)  Yay!  I'm coming back!
