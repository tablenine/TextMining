Yum. Yum. And more yum.. . My bosses took me here for my good-bye dinner, as I recently quit my job after a little over five years of employment. For starters, we ordered the bone marrow flan, pork belly, and tuna tartare. Wow, all three of these dishes were friggin delicious. I can't even say which one was my favorite. The bone marrow was super rich. The tuna tartare had a pretty unique flavor (with the wasabi aioli was it? and the crunchy cracker type thing that came with it), and the pork belly was just deliciously rich and filling.. . I ordered the American Wagyu. Wow, talk about incredibly tender. I enjoyed every single bite. After the apps, I could only finish half my steak. We shared sides: macaroni and cheese, polenta, and sauteed spinach. The mac n cheese was super rich, and also delish.. . For dessert, I had the bruleed banana cream pie. Ok so I had first thought I wouldn't be able to eat much after the huge meal I had just devoured, but once I took one bite of this dessert...I could...not...stop. The dessert was so light, and mildly sweet...it was perfect! I finished the WHOLE damn thing!. . Wolfgang Puck also came around and said hello to all the tables. =) That was a nice touch!. . I would love to go here again...but only for a very very very special occasion! It's just so expensive. I'm lucky I got treated out!
