Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
Word of advice: make a reservation :-)!! This is place is always packed.  . In a world where good sushi equals snob places Ikaka-ya succeeds by offering a relaxing yet trendy atmosphere and great quality sushi!  . . Try at least one of their specialty sushi, the waiters are really good in recommending you rolls, just say what kind of fish you like and they will impress you.  . . Good prices and great people watching.
