Easily one of the quirkiest places to stop, eat and drink in Atlanta -- and that's saying a lot. Listen, this place is an institution here. Hokey or not, let's pray it sticks around. When I want a mai-tai, I want it fruity and I want it in a coconut, and I want there to be guys in Hawaiian shirts that serve it to me. That's asking a lot, and these guys deliver. The rest of it is all tourist trap -- but so is the World of Coca-Cola, and I'd still tell you to go there at least once in your life. Do it. You know you want to. You won't regret it, and you'll have a fun story to tell later. Trust.
