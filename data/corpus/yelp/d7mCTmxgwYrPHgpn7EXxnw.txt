Wow...you may have to wait in line for a little while, but they'll bring you cookies.  It's worth it.  Awesome for brunch on the weekend.  The prices are very reasonable and the variety of breakfast foods is insane....from sweet potato pancakes to pumpkin/walnut Belgian waffles.....and the craziest is their AMAZING crabcakes.  You wouldn't think crab cakes for brunch, but you'll be glad you did it.  Enjoy!
