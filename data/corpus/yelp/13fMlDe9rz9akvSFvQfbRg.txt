My ladyfriend and I went here last night for my birthday (Thanks for remembering buy the way) and it was great from beginning to end.. . Upon arrival the host greeted us and kindly wished me a happy birthday. We had a great table inside and could have chosen their cute outside area but it was just a tad too humid. The waiter referred to my date as Ms. Last Name which I thought was really classy, and asked my last name and called us by them the rest of the night. I've never seen another restaurant do that so I was hugely impressed.. . Their margaritas really did rock my face off. I had the passion fruit and my date had the prickly pear and both were just the right amount of alcohol to their respective juices. I liked mine better because it was just a little more boozy. If you go there you MUST get a margarita.. . The jack cheese fritters I thought were just alright but my dining companion really loved them. The sauce was like a sweet mango glaze and really made the dish.. . I had some illegally caught peruvian sea bass that was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. The fish was perfectly cooked to accentuate the buttery nature of this great fish. It had some sweet potato mash with it. . . My ladyfriend had the shortribs that were also amazing. Really soft meat with a fantastic flavor. They came with mashed sweet potatoes. You can't lose with sweet potatoes.. . I'd say this place is more of special occasion venue as the check was probably north of $100. I'd highly recommend going with someone who will pay! ;)
