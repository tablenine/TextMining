I think this is the safe bet for picky eaters.  It's one of those places that has everything for everyone and if you can't pick something there to eat, then just die or eat water.  I always go for the endless soup bowl which is pretty damn delicious, but one has to wonder why it's so in expensive.  I do agree on the price thing however because whenever I think I'm only spending 8 dollars it ends up being 15, then I just feel embarrassed.
