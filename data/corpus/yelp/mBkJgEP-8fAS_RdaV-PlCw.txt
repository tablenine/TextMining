Restaurant: Spoon
Category: Thai
It's one thing to be an overrated Thai Restaurant, it's another thing to be an overpriced Thai Restaurant.  But, if you ever end up being both, then you pretty much suck at life.. . Spoon is right off Marietta street, close to downtown.  A cool lil decor, very intimate, very dark, and somewhat cozy.. . But for some reason, someone felt that they could justify making a $7/$8 Pad Thai dish cost $13 bucks.  And that same person crunching those numbers perhaps had a hand in making the actual food...cuz it sucks just as much.. . The great thing about Thai is that unless its utterly incredible, it should be relatively cheap.  . . Not so, not here.  . . This place actually seems like it would be a cool spot for cocktails, but the food is sub par.
