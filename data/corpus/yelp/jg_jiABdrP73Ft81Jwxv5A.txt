Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Make no mistakes about the Shabu Shabu house. It is the best and worth the wait. When we first arrived, we didnt know how strict their "way" of seating and serving was, but we quickly caught on that it must have been inspired by the military. . . First, when you arrive, write down your name and if you want a large or small plate of beef. ( 15 slices large, 10 slices small). If you want it lean or extra lean, please specify. . . Secondly, do not LEAVE the establishment and come back. You must wait there and close by. . . Third, they seat the next round of customers every 45 minutes to an hour. So if you arrive at 5:30 , you might have to wait until 6pm depending on where you are on the list, or else, its 7pm. They are very good about honoring your place on the list. . . Fourth, DO NOT BY ANY MEANS take their one million and one, hot colored flyers on the wall that tell you NO CELL PHONE USE ALLOWED inside the restaurant as a joke. They mean it. Sit, eat and leave. They dont want you to drop your iphone in the water. . . Lastly, enjoy your meal. Its fun to dunk, slurp, drink, eat and just plain enjoy your shabu shabu experience here. The busboys work like a well oiled machine. Fast and quick. The owners are always on premises. The man at the front with the list and the woman handing out checks so they will be ready for the next round. . . They will give you extra rice if you want within the hour, but if you try to eat slow or not leave, you must either (A) order more or (B) order more. If you dont, they will just politely walk over and turn off your burner for your pot of water. Easy as that. . . So, I would highly recommend this place not just for the yummy food and cheap prices but mainly for the authentic experience of eating in Little Tokyo with some discipline, where you know your place in line!
