Standing on the corner of Orchard and Stanton at 10:30pm I was starved.  Where to go.....i need food now!  Pork buns, yes, i went to the gym earlier, and since i do that for the sole purpose of eating fatty foods i craved a slice of heaven on a fluffy bun.  We looked at the menu and I immediately gravitated to the King Jaffe Joffer.  1. i'll eat anything that references "Coming to America" and 2. it's lower in saturated fat since it's wagyu skirtsteak, and knowing i was going to be in bed in an hour i didn't need fattness sitting undigested in my tummy.  We also ordered a Chairman Bao to share, since we are purists and know where the action is.  The Jaffe was great, not fatty, but super flavorful- a bit small, but as a quick bite it was perfect.  Nothing beats pure rich fatness or pork.......the secret is out, Jewish girls love pork.  The sandwich was super flavorful, good mixture of meat and fat.  Since the place was closing up, the one employee working that night gave us boiled vinegar peanuts since it was the last day they were serving them.  Too bad....they were really interesting.  I prefer my nut with a crunch, but these had a good bitterness to them.  I'll be back, i want the Bao fries and perhaps the uncle Jesse (tofu, i know.....).
