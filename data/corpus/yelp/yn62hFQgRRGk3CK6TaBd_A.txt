This place is completely over-hyped.  Perhaps we were lucky that by the time we arrived on Sunday afternoon the crowds had died down and we were seated pretty quickly.  The meal was not great, so if we'd ended up waiting an hour or more my rating would have been less than one star.  I ordered the chili, which was good, but seeing as they don't actually make it on site the least they could have manage to do is heat it to an edible temperature.  As a side I requested the garlic bread.  Call me crazy, but I expected something more than a piece of wheat toast with butter and garlic salt.. . As one of the other reviewers cautioned "don't look up at the ceiling or you'll loose your appetite".  Well, the same goes for the bathrooms.  I was pretty grossed out by the filthiness of the place generally, but the men's room at the Griddle made some of the gas station restrooms I've been in look like a day spa.   The music was also way too loud.  I go out to eat with friends becuase I want to visit with them and it helps if you can hear what they are saying.. . I will say the service was good.  I liked our server and she was attentive.   Having been a food server in a very busy cafe I have a lot of respect for someone who can stay on top of things, especially when they are are nearing the end of their shift.
