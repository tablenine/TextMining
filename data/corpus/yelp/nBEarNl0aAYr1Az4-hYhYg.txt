Awesome Spanish tapas in a simple space. BYOB with great little wine shop next door. I love that our food came over time, instead of all at once like so many tapas do. Totally enjoyed the meal even though it was really loud and hard to hear my date. But the great service and yummy food makes up for that, even though they don't have sangria!
