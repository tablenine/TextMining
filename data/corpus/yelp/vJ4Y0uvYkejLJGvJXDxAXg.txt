Okay, so I said I would never cheat on Pizza Metro.  However, I did dabble a little with Crust in the summer.  If it makes PM feel better, I faked my enjoyment of the pizza.  I mean, it was alright...a bit pricey, but their vodka flights made me feel less guilty.  And really, it was the server I was lusting after.. . I'm a slut.
