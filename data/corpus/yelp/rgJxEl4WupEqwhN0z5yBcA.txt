Rock Bottom is great!  I love the Erik the Red beer.  The Boubonzolla Burger is my current obsession.  Take a burger, roll it in peppercorn, glaze it with bourbon sauce, top it with crispy onion straws and your choice of two sides and you have a tiny slice of heaven.  Or a heaping plateful of heaven!  I've gotten fries and steamed broccoli (a girl has to pretend to eat healthy) the last two times.  I have noticed the burgers tend toward well-done, so I have adjusted my order accordingly.  The medium-rare burger came out much juicier than the medium burger.  . . I've been to the rooftop deck, but just while I waited for my table to be ready.  I seem to remember not being able to see the street directly below... I guess they don't want their guests to "accidentally" knock a beer on the people below.
