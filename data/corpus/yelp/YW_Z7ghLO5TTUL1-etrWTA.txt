I understand the comments about it being the only thing in the immediate area -- and if you live close to it, I can totally see giving it 4-5 stars.. . But if you're considering a trek to Tom's, I'd encourage you to reconsider.. . Don't get me wrong -- the food is good.  But the 30-45 minute wait for a table, along with the trek to get there, make it pretty hard to be satisfied when all's said and done.  Chances are there's a place serving up just as good (or close to it) of food in your area, without the wait and the considerable pilgrimage.
