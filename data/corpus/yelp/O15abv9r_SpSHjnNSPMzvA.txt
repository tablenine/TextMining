Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The noodles were good, but didn't live up to the hype. I ordered the soy sauce, #5, with bean sprouts and egg. The order came and I was disappointed to see that the amount of noodles they give isn't exactly proportional to the size of the humongous bowl. The bean sprouts I ordered actually seemed to make up half of the order and while the menu said the ramen was served with veggies and pork. I had a total of four nickel-sized pieces of pork. It definitely made me full and it was a good meal, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Mainly due to the horrendously expensive parking.
