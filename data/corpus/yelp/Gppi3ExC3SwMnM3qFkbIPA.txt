Category: Steakhouses
Coming to Fogo de Chao made me realize how much I love being a carnivore!!! You start off by going to the buffet loaded with cheeses, salads, fruits, and Brazilian style appetizers. When your ready for the main course, you flip over your little card to green and let the games begin!!! In no more than 10 seconds there is about 5 different guys in your face with everything from lamb to chicken to bacon wrapped filet mignon, and all cooked to your likings!!! You can tell they take great pride in what they serve and how they serve it!!! Very expensive but very worth a try!!! Unless you can find street parking, your gonna have to pay for the valet. This place also has a very large slection of fine wines!!! I dont think I will come here again...... to pricey!!!
