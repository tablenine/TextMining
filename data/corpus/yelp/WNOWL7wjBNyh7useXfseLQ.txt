Sausage! SAUSAGE? SAUSAGE!!  BEER!  A wurst lover's dream come true. They offer amazing exotic varieties, though it's probably more of a novelty to eat them than it is a savory culinary adventure.  The duck/bacon wurst is to die for. Plenty of excellent German and Belgian beer. And the truffle fries. OH the truffle fries.. . The only "beef" I have with Wurstküche is the line, the horrible long lines that wind around the tiny lobby where you order. It's kind of a frustrating setup if you don't have patience.  I don't recommend going on a weekend evening.
