Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
In my quest for the best corned beef and pastrami sandwiches on the planet, my journey recently took me to Langers.  Holy cow!  Not literally, because it's not kosher, but still...O.M.G!. . I went with my hubby and we did the same thing that we do everywhere that they don't actually offer a corned beef and pastrami on rye (aka the Woody Allen at Carnegy deli).  Can I just sidebar for a second and ask why there are delis out there that haven't figured out that when these two meats come together in your mouth between rye with some spicy mustard, the world just stops for the briefest second?  But I digress.... . Anyway, he ordered corned beef on rye and I ordered pastrami, and we swapped halves.  YUM!!!!  It was so good, I made my own Woody Allen and ATE THE WHOLE EFFING THING.  Meat. Candy.  As far as sandwiches go, this is the one to beat.. . And now for the rest of the restaurant...  They make their own cream sodas served from the fountain, which is way better than opening a bottle of Dr. Browns.  They serve egg cremes, which I didn't have, but HELL YEAH!!!  This is a classic deli.  They didn't have pickles on the table, which is one of my litmus tests, and they didn't have any baked goods for sale on the way out, but the food makes up for failing my weird east coast childhood deli tests.. . Finally, a little note about the other delis in LA.  I went to Canter's a couple of years ago - decent, if you don't know better.  Nate and Al's (earlier this week) - will not be returning; tense vibe and soggy bread, although they do have pickles on the table.  Still, I'm taking my dad to Langer's when he's in town.
