Maybe I had a bad experience, but I was not impressed by the ever-so-popular Versailles. :( Ordered the garlic chicken and it was just chicken. BF ordered the steak pieces or something...I actually did like the plantains since they were a little rough and not all gooey. Rice and beans are ehh, regular, I've had better. The service was not so friendly but pretty fast. Oh yea, and the worst part was after we ate--me and the BF both had stomach and head aches the whole night. Fun times.
