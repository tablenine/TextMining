Mmmm. 5 bucks for some tasty, good as it gets banh mi.  There is not much to review here.  You go, you order one of about 4 variations of banh mi, they make it freshly for you, it gives you that perfect combination of spice, sauce, processed meat and bread and it is done. An excellent hole in the wall
