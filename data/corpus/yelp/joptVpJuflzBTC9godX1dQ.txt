Yum! . . Had breakfast here last Saturday morning with a friend who was about to leave the country. We both ordered the French Toast (highly recommended by our waitress); I got the standard 4 piece order with maple syrup (a bit soggy for my taste) and she got the citrus (looked good!) . . The service was good and the outdoor patio was a nice place to eat on a sunny morning. No celebrity sightings for us! . . They have valet parking, but if you're willing to walk a bit you can probably find a spot on the street.
