It wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that I would rave about to all my friends, either.. . Had their signature bowl of ramen, a spicy tuna roll, and gyoza.. . I liked how they take their orders on those little PDAs. . . It was a Saturday afternoon, (the day of the Chinese New Year parade), wait was about 45 minutes.. . Didn't witness anything that made me yearn for another visit.
