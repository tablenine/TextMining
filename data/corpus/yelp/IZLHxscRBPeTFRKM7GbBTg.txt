The ice cream place to go in LA, has an old fashioned sort of soda fountain feel, with a modern twist. Great desserts and ice cream flavors. Must try the ice cream sandwiches which are made with Parisian macaroons! I have been craving the ice cream sandie ever since I first tried it...must go back! Coffee toffee is a must as well. . Cute date place too! My friend and I sat outside on the street side tables...open late night.
