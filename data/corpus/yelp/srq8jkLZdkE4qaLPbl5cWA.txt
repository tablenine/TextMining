Restaurant: Mediterranean Grill
Category: Greek
I agree with most of the other people; while M Grill is not stellar compared to all med restaurants, they are cheap and the food is consistently good. I like that the falafels are crispy in the falafel sandwich.  I don't like the pita they use and wish they would get some better bread.  I love the Greek salads, and the potatoes are awesome, perfectly crunchy outside, while melty hot inside.  Bonus: sandwich and potatoes or sandwich and salad costs about $5.50.  You can't beat that at all.
