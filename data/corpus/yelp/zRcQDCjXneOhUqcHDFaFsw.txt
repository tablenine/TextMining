Okay they have the best coffee that I have found in LA. They serve it to you in a french press and they actually have quit an array of beans to choose from try the Ethiopian . . . As far as the food I had the Huevos rancheros with chicken chorizo and a delicous tequilla laceed sauce.  it was goood i mean real good.
