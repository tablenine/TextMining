Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
A very secure 4 stars. Its great for anyone that holds at least some appreciation for the sandwich. The menu is extensive, but narrowed down by meat (or lack thereof) choices for easy picking. . . I would suggest staying away from the create your own for a while. There are just so many choices and even the creations that are cause for grimacing (onions and peanut butter??) are oddly satisfying. Anyway, you already need to pick your sides and your bread... might as well stick with an already-conceptualized sandwich. . . On the negative, the wait-staff does tend to be preoccupied.Still, you get your food in good time, generally. . . Try the outdoor patio. Order the ice tea of the day. Enjoy your lunch. . . Good times.
