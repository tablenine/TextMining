So my bf and I finally tried this place too see what all the fuss is about and seriously with all honesty, I didn't see anything special about the place. Granted that the size of the burritos are overwhelming but that's about it! There's a line to get into the place (which I got all hyped up about because I was thinking, wow this place is going to be really awesome). The place is small and you literally have to bump elbows while you eat. The service is okay ( servers kept passing by in front of us and we were sitting at the counter too before someone finally took our order). Food was mediocre (I found a bone in my Okie de pollo burrito (gross). Overall, I've had way better food than this.
