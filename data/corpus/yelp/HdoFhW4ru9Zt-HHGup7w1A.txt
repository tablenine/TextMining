Category: Thai
oh my gosh.  i love sura soooo much.  seriously.  i had been totally turned off of thai food for a while due to bad experiences with it on my college campus.  . . i find the environment pretty funny.  everything is white, red, and plastic.  one day i would like to eat my dinner in one of the swings.  but we'll see about that..... . the food is absolutely amazing.  the vegetables are fresh and delicious.  so far i have tried the taro egg rolls, classic noodle with tofu, and the lemongrass dish.  all delicious.  it is now my go-to for a great meal in lakeview.. . the price is pretty reasonable too.  an appetizer and two entrees for right around $25.  i definitely am not complaining.  . . try it, you'll like it.  i swear.  im in the process of recommending it to everyone i have ever known in my entire life.  pretty much...
