Restaurant: Mediterranean Grill
Category: Greek
This is one of those places I feel compelled to like for some reason.  Nothing is truly stand-out, there is better Mediterranean food out there, and the place itself is pretty small and can get crowded.  Yet somehow I'm always drawn to return and I find myself dishing out 4 stars.  But hell, I guess that's what restaurant owners strive for:  The kind of place people like "just because".      I usually get a gyro with feta added and a Greek salad.  Again, not the best gyro I've ever had or anything, but still delicious.  Actually, the Greek salad is one of the better ones I've had.  I'm partial to the tangy dressing.  Good tzatziki too.  Gyros are useless without good tzatziki!  Probably the thing that makes Mediterranean Grill worthy of 4 stars is that all of this good food is cheap!  I think the Gyros run 4-5 bucks and the combos 6-7 bucks.  .      All in all, the perfect place to drop by for a quick lunch or dinner.
