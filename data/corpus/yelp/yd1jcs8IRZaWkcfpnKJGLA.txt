Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
One of the things I miss most about living in LA is Umami Burger. Everything about it is perfect!! The bread, the burger... oohhh sooo moist and flavorful.. writing a review about it makes me miss it more.. I crave for this burger all the time and wish they had one here in NY.. I have not had a burger in NY that can match or compare to Umami Burger.
