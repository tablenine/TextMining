Despite my sincere love for my dear friend Erin (R.), I must admit I'm not a huge fan of Toast.  Forced to come here a second time due to Doughboys being closed, I ordered the closest thing to what I migh've gotten at Doughboys.  Soup and salad.  Which were totally decent enough.  The waitress was incredibly nice (and thanked me for asking how she was doing) and lovely...the thing about it was that it struck us walking out that we'd just paid thirty dollars for lunch.  And that seemed silly.  I mean, when I'm going to Doughboys to get the french dip (otherwise known as the best sandwich in the world), I know I'm going to get something so incredibly wonderful that it tastes like art in m y mouth.  At Toast it just seems like kinda simple food with nothin' special, and then, BANG!  Thirty bucks.  So I guess my rating is just kinda meh.
