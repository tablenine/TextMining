Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
This is probably the best steakhouse on the West Coast.  Overall, dining experience is outstanding.  Lobster mashed potatoes are phenomenal.  The steak is not as good as Peter Lugar's, but the appetizers, wine selection, sides, and service far exceed the Brooklyn veteran.  NB  Ask to be seated upstairs in the wine room.
