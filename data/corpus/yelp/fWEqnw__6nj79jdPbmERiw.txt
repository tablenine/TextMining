Restaurant: Stanley&#39;s Kitchen and Tap
Category: Southern
"Wait, isn't he from here?". . Apparently, my never having heard of Stanley's before elicited the same response from 2 people who are not from Chicago.  Honestly, I had no idea it was that seminal of a restaurant.  . . They put up a pretty good breakfast buffet.  I think, in the end, I tried: biscuits and gravy, waffles and fried chicken, bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns, mac and cheese, corned beef hash, and maybe some fruit on there somewhere.  . . All-you-can-eat-heart attack?  Yes, please.
