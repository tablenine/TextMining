Amazing and tasty little burger.  Went here on a Sunday after walking around the farmers market just outside.  Although the food was a bit expensive ($10 for a burger) it was well worth it just to have the outdoor atmosphere of cheesy Euro-pop bands playing with a good burger, salty fries and a ice cold beer.  As far as the quality of the burger, I only tried their traditional burger that comes with 6 ingredients.  I'm not much of a gourmet burger fan (see my review on Father's Office), but this was just delicious.  Made medium rare with juicy tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, Parmesan crusted cheese slice, secret sauce and some others to ignite the taste buds.  The fries were a bit too salty for my taste but came with a tangy hot mayonnaise-based sauce to dip in which added an extra kick of flavor to my pallet.  The beer that came with the meal was a Jasmine rise based Thailand beer that was all together flavorful.  Would totally go back.  Service could improve, but I wasn't even focused on that as the food took my mind away from all of that.
