Ssooooo busy! Always filled. Do not go to this place is you actually like having a private Convo let alone having any personal space, very crammed. The staff Â are slightly emotionless and monotone but provide super quick service. As well as the food being amazing. You have to shut off some senses here to really enjoy the food.
