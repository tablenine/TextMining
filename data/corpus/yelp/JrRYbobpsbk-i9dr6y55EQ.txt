Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Is this place really considered a dive? Because it was clean as a whistle, people were friendly, food was great and I didn't have to shank anyone for a beer. Yes, a well-earned 4 star rating.. . I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about the place-- beer snobs and beer noobs will find something to whet their palattes here. Prices are just as they should be-- house beers and PBRs for around $2-3/ pint and someone classier beers run, at most, $6/ pint. Not too shabby if you ask me.. . Food was fried to perfection. Tried the nachos and fries (2 separate dishes, for the record)-- greasy food to soak up all that beer I drank. Although I didn't expect Manuel's to make my tastebuds sing, they sure did "ahh" in satisfaction.. . Manuel's seems to fit the bill of both the place to kick it with friends and voluntarily eat food that will go straight to your hips (see above: nachos) or the place to get a beer before you go more beers. Laid-back, unpretentious, down to earth-- a place worth a repeat visit or two.
