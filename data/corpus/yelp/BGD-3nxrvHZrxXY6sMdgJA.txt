Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Gloriaaaaaa! G-L-O-R-I-A!. . Gloria's is what a neighborhood restaurant should be.  It's features good food, cheap prices, and a warm, inviting atmosphere that you rarely find in LA restaurants. The matronly Gloria often works both the tables and behind the scenes in the kitchen.  She has an amazing ability to memorize the orders of large parties as well as remember that your favorite dish is the delicious Tortilla Soup.  . . Nearly everything on this menu, which includes both Salvadorian and Mexican specials, will not disappoint you.  From the Pupusa Specials to the house Tamales, you will always leave Gloria's feeling full, satisfied and looking forward to your next visit.. . The best thing on the menu, for vegetarians and carnivors alike, is the Tortilla soup.  It contains a virtual garden of delightful treats.  Carrots, zucchini, potatos, celery are stewed together in this ensemble featuring whole pieces of avocado, cheese and crispy tortilla strips.. . To drink, the Wine Margaritas offer a light compliment to many of the entrees.  The Mexican Hot Chocolate, made from real milk, is rich and not powdered-based.. . The House Special Burrito, while not as large as the shoe-box sized burritos at nearby El Abajeno, is still enough for a meal and a half.  . . Overall, you will taste the dedication that Gloria puts into her dishes.  If you plan on going to Versailles next door, don't even think about parking in front of her restaurant, as she will let you know.  Besides, why brave the line at Versailles when you can eat at Gloria's without the wait.
