After a few months, I decided to give these guys another chance. Unfortunately, the best item to get here is still their cornbread. The wings were good too.. . Tonight, I had the rib &amp; brisket combo. What a disaster.....both came drenched in bbq sauce to mask it's bland taste and dryness I suppose. I also tasted my friend's bbq pork, dry too. . . If it wasn't for the good service, I might've given this place a 1 star.
