Ok, I'm not a K, but lately I've been going off to a lot of K stuff! Booking club, K-BBQ's, Sun Dae, Spas, Karaoke.  I agree with most posts here that say the meat quality isn't the best, but it definitely does the trick. For the price you pay, the quality you get, this place is worth checking out.  I usually end up paying about $25 dollars when I order Beer.. . The place is great for groups and even though you're on an outdoor patio it does a good job of making you smell like you rolled around a BBQ pit for days.. . The waiters are a bit ehhhh, but its either hit or miss at K places. This one's a miss.
