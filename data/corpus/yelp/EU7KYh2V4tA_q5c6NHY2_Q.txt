I'm a fan if 'The Company' is paying, but hell no if it's on my dime! The entree cobb salad is the size of a starter at most places and the portion sizes just leave me hungry. The Hen of the Woods mushrooms are good, and so the hamachi and so is the bread pudding, but for a modest amount of food it was $250 for 4... FOR LUNCH. . . The food is good, as it damn well better be, but maybe it's the recession wallet talking but at those prices, I'm happy to eat 50 days of Subway sandwiches for lunch instead.
