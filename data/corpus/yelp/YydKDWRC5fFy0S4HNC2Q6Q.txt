Oinkster made me eat like a fat pig, which is pretty much a success in my book. I tried the oinkster pastrami, the pulled pork sandwich and a side of belgian fries. all 3 were great. but make sure you ask for a side of BBQ sauce for the pulled pork- this is imperative. . . It wasn't too crowded when I went (Mother's Day around 8pm). My only knock would be that its a bit on the pricey side at about $10 - $15 a person.
