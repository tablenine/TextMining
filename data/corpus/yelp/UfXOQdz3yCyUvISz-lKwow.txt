Hard place to get in, but after dining there I wonder why?. The decor is reminiscent of  being in a Restoration Hardware store.. The service was excellent; single malt whisky was poured directly from the bottle into our glasses.  The bread was good, the wine was excellent but then at $180.00 a bottle, it better be. But  the food really was  not up to great standards. The portions were so small, I would suggest they use dessert plates instead.  I ordered some potatoes with rosemary on the side, they should renamed it "main salt course with added potatoes". My dessert was some nice textured yogurt on an uneatable cookie. I went to the Pizzeria Mozza several weeks ago , and I enjoyed tremendously, so I was rather disappointed when I tried the upgrade.
