I tried many kebabs and liked all of them on my different outings here. The main lure for the place is the lively atmosphere, the hookahs, the belly dancer...did I say the hookahs? I used to love mint and apple but lately watermelon is great!Seatings are comfy and you are sure to have great fun on a weekend...book in advance or be ready to wait!!
