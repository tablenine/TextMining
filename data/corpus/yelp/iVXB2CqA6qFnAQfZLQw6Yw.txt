They have so many stars, I thought why not?  I will add my 2 cents worth for all that it matters.. . Read about Langers and the first time I had time to go it was on a Sunday.  Dreaded Sundays they are closed!  So don't go on Sunday.  This weekend we had time and we ventured there for lunch.. . It was everything and more from what we read.  The sandwich was amazing!  My stomach was able to finish 1/2 order of chili cheese fries and 1/2 sandwich split.  The #19 is what we got!  It is there most ordered sandwich.  Pastrami, rye, russian dressing, and coleslaw and don't forget the swiss cheese!  YUMMY!. . The bread was fresh.  I love how the soft part of the bread was so flavorful of rye.  The crust was a harder consistency and totally made for the texture of the sandwich.  The pastrami was fat free which seemed amazing to me.  It was perfection.. . The chili cheese fries were ordered simply to see how good they could be.  They are a good competition to some of the best chili cheese fries around.  Flavorful chili and the cheese was perfect quantity.. . They serve Coke.  I love when a restaurant serves Coke and not Pepsi (sorry Pepsi).  They also have Cream Soda.  Yummy too!  . . We loved our sandwich so much we bought a pound of pastrami and a loaf of bread to go with a pint of coleslaw.  I think I can swing the swiss cheese at the market.  Tomorrow means we have homemade Langers!  I am sure it will be delish just not as good as getting it there!. . You must go if you like pastrami!
