Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
"What would really be good right now would be some pizza and beer."  Exclamations like this one (made on Mother's Day mind you) are one of the millions of reasons I love my mom.  She didn't want a fancy schmancy white china place on her day of honoring, but instead some cheesy goodness and a pint to wash it down.. . Well, her wish was my command so we made it over to the Fellini's on Ponce, where for $20 we split a salad, a slice of the Fellini's special, a spinach and cheese calzone, and a blue moon.  Once our food was delivered to our table on the patio next to the fountain (yes, Fellini's keeps it classy, even on Ponce), I quickly remembered why I am indeed a fan.  The salads at Fellini's are kind of an awkward size.  Too small to be an entree, but way too big to be a side, as they are overflowing with crispy romaine, black and green olives, mushrooms, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a blanket of freshly grated mozzarella.  It was the perfect size to split as an app.  The Fellini's special has a little bit of everything, including my favorite spicy sausage and extra cheese.  I had never had a calzone there before, but I'm very glad that I've now had that experience.  The spinach and cheese calzone was a huge portion stuffed with fresh spinach and served up with a generous side of marininara.  The only downside was the minimal amount of ricotta.. . Awesome cheap pizza and an awesome Mom.  What better way to spend a Sunday afternoon?
