Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: Bars
Nothing special. Decided to stop in here on a Saturday afternoon and it was busy but not super crowded. You can get the same type of coffee from any other place in Chicago, so it's not like the menu is super inventive. . . The cool art work on the walls adds a different dimension to Uncommon Ground that you won't find anywhere else. We sat in the back area, and it was less than desirable. It would of been better had we sat in the front (i think). Will give it another fair chance though.
