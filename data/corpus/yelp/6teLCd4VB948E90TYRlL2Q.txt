no brainer - winetasting extravaganza in LA with your closest friends and a fantastic host.  the manager is an absolute doll and oh so knowledgeable about the vines and the wines.  happy hour is a steal with cheese and nuts and acoustic guitar.  and the food is way better than it need be, try the pizza quatro frommagi.  I only wish they could figure out a way to taste test bubbly...
