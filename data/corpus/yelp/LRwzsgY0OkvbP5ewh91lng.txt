This new restaurant is in the part of Brookhaven with all new restaurants and businesses. It's right across from Haven. It may not be a large restaurant, but the food is fast so there's a quick turnover. . . FOOD: We started with chips and salsa($1.25), which tastes very fresh. We also had the calamari($6.50) which is cornbread battered with chiptole mayo. I had the fried fish taco and fried chicken taco, which were both very good. I liked the fish over the chicken, but it may be that the fish had more flavor. 2 tacos with the apps. were more than enough food for me.
