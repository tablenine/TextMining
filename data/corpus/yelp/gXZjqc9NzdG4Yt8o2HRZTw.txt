The first problem with the restaurant is that it does not live up to it's hype.  The second is that the food doesn't live up to its price tag ($57/person). . . The salad bar is of high quality, but the selection is underwhelming.  I can honestly say that it has less variety than any other Churrascaria I have been to.  The plantains, mashed potatoes and yukka were bland and uninspired.  . . The service in the joint was impeccable.  Everyone was attentive and not pretentious. . . The meats, clearly the headliner of the show, was were the dinner lost a couple stars.  Everything was extremely gamey, overly salted, and many of the cuts of meat were very fatty.  The linguica even had a funky flavor, and it's pretty hard to mess up sausage!  Each member of our party left a plate of meat on the table with no interest in a doggy bag.. . In closing, what has happened to restaurant row?  It has become so ghetto.  There must be a direct bus line from compton.  Even the bartender looked like he belonged in the wu tang crew, his hair greased down with crisco or something.
