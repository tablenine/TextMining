Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
If you love pastrami, this is definitely the place to go. They give you a cup of aus ju (i think?) if you ask for it. I've only been here late night after a night on the town and it always hits the spot. It helped that I lived a few blocks away too. The outdoor area is fantastic too, especially with the lovely weather down south.
