I've thought about reviewing this place many a time but have put it off because of how many reviews it has so far, but you know what? Not reviewing this place is burning a hole in my Yelp pocket, so to speak, so I'm going to bite the bullet and tackle the hipster happenin' hotspot, Fred 62.. . I've been going here for years now on a fairly sporatic basis and as far as late-night diners go I rate this high, but that doesn't say much because I have yet to find a late-night diner that I really enjoy. I'm a sensitive nighttime eater the way I'm a sensitive early morning eater... I just can't eat anything heavy, greasy, or fatty during those hours without wanting to induce vomiting (TMI?). . I enjoy Fred 62 because it allows me to people-watch the cute indie boys Â waltz in and out of its doors and well as snicker and scornfully eye those tragically over-hip-hipsters. You know the ones.... . Anyway, food-wise this place makes a valiant effort to cater to vegetarians but, alas, not to vegans. To win my heart, friend, you must go through my stomach. I think it seems inevitable that this place will go vegan in some capacity, and let me be the first to cheer them on.. . If I'm in the area, I'll tag along, but as Jerry would say: Fred, look to the soya.
