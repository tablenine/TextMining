Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Stopped off here on my way to LAX after a weekend spent stuffing my face at various places across L.A.. . My friend and I split a pastrami sandwich and order of onion rings.  The sandwich was freaking huge and stuffed full of luscious, fatty pastrami.  Your arteries will hate you for the full frontal attack on their well being, but it was tender and delicious.  Onion rings were bomb too.. . In a way, I am sort of glad we don't have this in SF.  I could definitely see myself eating here everytime I go out drinking.  That wouldn't be so good on the wallet and REALLY not good on the waistline.
