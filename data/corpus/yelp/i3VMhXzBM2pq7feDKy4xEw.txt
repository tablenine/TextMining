Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
Let me start off by asking you a few questions? Do you have a lot of money? Do you crave a great steak? Well, if you said yes to both then Cut is for you! The steaks start off at $40 a pop. Yikes! Once you have swallowed that bitter pill then you can enjoy what turns out to be a very enjoyable experience. There is an extra charge if you want sauce or a rub!!! Ouch. Don't get me wrong. Save up your money and take your significant other here. You will look great and you both will have a great time. Oh yeah...call for a reservation because this place does get packed.
