Usually no trucks but... yes. It's that good. I'm willing to eat my previously spoken but sacrilegious words about how overrated the trucks are. Yes, people, I was wrong to doubt the Kogi.. . Have the blackjack quesadilla, but share it, it's filling!! Hubby had the pork tacos, said they were decent, he wasn't a huge fan of the short rib taco but he loved the blackjack. Thank god he ate half, it's HUGE, like I'm gonna be if i keep eating these things!!. . Also had some of the crazy chocolate things that they have on one of the trucks from double chin desserts. It was similar to a chocolate granola bar. My sister got it from another truck, shared with me and it was crazy!! DARK choc, crispy rice, caramel and a sort of smokey coffee flavor. So delicious, i can't believe she would share it.. . She swears by the calamari and tofu tacos. Next time, next time!! And yes, there will be a next time, and a next time, and a next... well, you get the point.
