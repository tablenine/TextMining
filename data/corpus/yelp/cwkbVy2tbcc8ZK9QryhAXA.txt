Expect long waits.  Was there on a Thursday night at 7:30.... waited approximately 1 hour.  Beware the "Mild" level of spiceness is on the hot side.  Reasonable prices and very tasty.  If you like seafood, this is the place.  Be prepared to get your hands in your food!  I would advise you not to wear white clothes.
