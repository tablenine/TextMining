Excellent.  Even though I'm from Chicago - home of Rick Bayless, I found Nava to be just as good, if not better than the Mexican food here.  Started with duck enchilada served with cabbage slaw.  The tangy cabbage slaw really complimented the duck without over powering it.  I also had the beef short ribs.  It was smoky and sweet, falling off the bone.  The best part is the huge portion.  I'm usually disappointed with short ribs, restaurants tend to serve a small piece since it is so rich.  Not here, Nava doesn't care if you fall over and die!  I finally got my fill of short ribs!  Unfortunately and wisely that meant skipping dessert.  . . Extra bonus, these pipped blue corn cakes served hot in the bread basket, not to be missed!
