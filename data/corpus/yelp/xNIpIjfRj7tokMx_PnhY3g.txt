I ate here today with a group of 8 for brunch. I ordered the classic eggs benedict and it was pretty tasty! I should have ordered the skirt steak and eggs because that was cheaper and looked more yummy. My boyfriend ordered the french toast with bananas and oranges on top and it was fucking amazing, like realmente delicioso! too bad he only gave me one bite. =T . . Next time I come here I'm ordering their french toast with some eggs on the side. . . Oh yeah and there's only street parking and valet is about $3.50. Not too bad if you're carpooling.
