I came here for a private event.  There were probably twice the number of people appropriate for the set-up.  So those who couldn't fit into the main dining area stayed by the bar.  Their loud conversations were distracting to the rest of us who strained to hear the presenters and the evening's honorees.  Still, it was cool to finally come here.  Plus, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger came out to say a few words!. . We started off with some passed appetizers.  Thanks to one of my friends we figured out where the platters were making their way out of the kitchen and positioned ourselves to get first dibs!  My favorite were the Peruvian Ceviche Tostaditas (marinated fish, lime, ginger and aji amarillo chile on crispy plantain rounds).  I also loved the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers.  They look like breaded and deep fried meatballs, but are actually filled with mashed avocado, herb marinated goat cheese, lemon and cracked pepper.  The third appetizer were the Mini Spinach Empanadas with pinenuts, raisins, manchego cheese and salsa verde crema on the side.  They were pretty good, but spinach is bad party food.  It always gets stuck in your teeth! . . Dinner was buffet style and I think it was good considering.  There were three salads.  A spinach salad with a citrus dressing that was too tangy for me, a quinoa salad and my favorite, the Spicy Caesar Salad (romaine hearts, fire roasted peppers and corn, tortilla croutons and argentine parmesan).  For mains, there were Green Corn Tamales (way too mushy), the Pollo Ciudad topped with a cilantro sauce (fantastic!) and the Chile Rubbed Mahi Mahi (only okay).  Plus rice and beans of course!. . Oh and one of the event sponsors provided free tequila for the evening...
