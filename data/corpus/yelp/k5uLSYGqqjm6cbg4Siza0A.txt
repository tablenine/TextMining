Stopped here recently with the wife since we were in the area...well, all that really matters is the food and it was very average...the chinese chicken salad looks and tastes very bland (at a min why not add in some shredded carrots or mandarin oranges for some color?) and the sandwiches are just pedestrian...and it's not cheap...but if the food were good who cares?  The place definitely looks cute with the market and bakery inside but don' t let the hip set-up fool you....the food is very average and overpriced.  We really wanted to like the place at first glance but we won't be back....you basically just go here to be seen and feel good about yourself that you're eating somewhere "hip" and different.
