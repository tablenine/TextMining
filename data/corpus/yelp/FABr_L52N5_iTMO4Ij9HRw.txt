Went to Lolas for happy hour and to celebrate a friends b-day it was fun and cheap. Found it weird that they charged us to serve a cake we had brought. Come on...its just a couple of plates!!! This would have given them a full five stars...but for me customer service is everything.. . Drinks and food were good.Ask for the Sliders they are good. . . All the best, . R
