Finally managed to find this truck last night.  It was exactly what I needed at 11 pm.  I tried all 4 tacos on the menu and the spicy pork taco was the best.  It was kind of hard to find it, because I was expecting it to be on Landfair and Ophir, but I finally stumbled on it after driving around a bit.  . . It might be hard to find parking, so bring a partner who can wait in the car for you while you order.  We were lucky when we got there, my boyfriend was able to find parking right away.  We stood in the cold and savored the delicious tacos.  . . I think $2 per taco is kind of pricey since it is fairly small.  Maybe they can do a special, 3 for $5.  Next time I will make sure to try the burrito.
