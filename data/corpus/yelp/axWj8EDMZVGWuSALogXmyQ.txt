Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
If I can't make my way to Daikokuya, I'll come to Chabuya because it's closer and I can get my ramen deconstructed, I think it is called tsukemen.  Basically, all the components are given to you on a plate and you are given a bowl of the broth and then you can dip in the noodles, chashu, bamboo shoots, etc and slurp up the noodles.  The broth isn't as good, but it is decent.  The ambience is also the most snazzy compared to the other ramen houses in the area and has more space.  If have a smaller appetite, then I will settle for the shrimp bao sandwich with is a bao bread with some lettuce and shrimp and sauce.  This is pretty yummy.  Since this restaurant is on Sawtelle, parking can be challenge, but there is a lot in the back and if you are lucky, it maybe a day where they aren't charging.
