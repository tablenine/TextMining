Sweet potato fries!. Wait, the burger's 14 bucks?!. Don't forget ID.... . I don't think I've ever been carded at any establishment before 2PM before, but I guess this is a gastropub and thus it's a given that you need to show ID before entering. Like everyone else says, the sweet potato fries, aioli, $14 burger and beer selection make this one of the coolest places to grab lunch in Culver City. Wait, WTF do I know about Culver City? I'm from the Bay Area haha. Anyways I enjoyed it a lot; unfortunately my bank account did not so much agree :(
