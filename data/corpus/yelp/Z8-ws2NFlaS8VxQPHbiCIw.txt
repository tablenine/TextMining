Great food and drinks.  The Sangria is excellent, and on Tuesday night it happened to be only $6 for a whole pitcher!  Also had a margarita, which was good - and it had a hint of melon or something special.  It had a real fruity taste.  We made dinner out of some appetizers, had the stuffed peppers, chorizo dip, lamb skewers, and shrimp cocktail.  Everything was very ethnic and unique, without being strange.  Service was good and the enviroment was appropriately themed.  Will be back for sure!
