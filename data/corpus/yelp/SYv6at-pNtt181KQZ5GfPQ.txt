Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
I love this place. From the first time I went in my high school days (I went to Loyola High School down the block), I have loved Papa Cristos. While the food is to die for, the service is very awesome. They are more than willing to help you decide what to order if you're a Greek newbie. My favs are the Spinach pie and whole wheat baklava. I know whole wheat baklava might sound like an aberation to true baklava, it's a great substitute if you're looking to cut calories. I can't wait to try their Thursday Greek family style dinners.
