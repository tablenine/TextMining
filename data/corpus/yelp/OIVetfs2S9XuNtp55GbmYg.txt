Work covered the bill as we were courting a potential new hire, otherwise I would probably never have gone here. I liked the furniture and ambience. Was impressed that they had vegan options, so they get points from me for that. I got the rice dish cooked in a lotus leaf -- a giant steaming puff ball that was the envy of my table mates when it was sliced open by the wait staff. It was buttery tasting from the coconut milk, but it could have used a bit more variety in flavor. There were vegetables and 1 or 2 pieces of tofu, but it's a lot of rice! We vegetarians don't survive on carbs alone! I enjoyed the mushroom wontons, lemongrass martini, and the pickle starters more than the entree. I would try it again, but it's not the top of my list.
