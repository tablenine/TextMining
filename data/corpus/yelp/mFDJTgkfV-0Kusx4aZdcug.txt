Unreal!  I've only been here once, but the food was out of this work.  We ordered a wide array of appetizers for the table.  The lobster rolls and ribs were unique and flavorful.  The lunch entrees were huge and they had a ton of options.  Some of my co-workers ordered the catfish (not on the menu).  It is one of the most impressive dishes that I have ever seen.  I had the crispy chicken #67, which was also a very solid selection.  I wish I had more money to become a regular here.
