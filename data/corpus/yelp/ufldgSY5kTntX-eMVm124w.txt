Restaurant: Five Seasons Brewing
Category: Pubs
I love 5 Seasons with every fiber of my being. The beer is absolute perfection (I particularly love the Sledgehammer but next time I'll try one of the beer "flights") and the food is really out-of-sight delicious, which is refreshing because, often, restaurants with killer beer fill their menu out with really ho-hum bar food. Not the case with 5 Seasons. Always opt for one of the specials, if possible, especially any non-salmon fish dish (the trout is divine). You won't regret it. If ordering a salad, go for "The Wedge." Mmmm. Yummy. But steer clear of the burger. While the grass-fed beef is delicious and they will cook it to order (yes, still pink inside), the sesame-see bun is really lackluster. 5 Seasons guys, if you are reading this, change it immediately. The service is usually very good. Though the last time I went (for my pre-birthday brunch) my server was a little scowly. Ordinarily, I can overlook this, but my parents were visiting from out of town and dropping a huge chunk of change on lunch for nine people, so I expected better. Did the server know I was trying to impress my folks with some stellar Atlanta cuisine and possibly score them some repeat business from out-of-towners? Of course not. Which is why a waiter should always deliver the best service possible. I'll chalk it up to him either having a bad morning or not wanting to wait on a 9-top even with the auto-grat. Still, I absolutely can't wait for the Marietta Street/Howell Mill 5 Seasons to open, so that I can visit more often.
