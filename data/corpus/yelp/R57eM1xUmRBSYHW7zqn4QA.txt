I've eaten here and Dolce, and hands down I'd rather eat @ Geisha House... Its a nice layout not to go for an everyday thing,but cute date spot. Or if you wana treat yourself to a nice glass of wine and chow on some sushi, why not... not a sake fan so no opinion on that.. Although I must admit I wouldnt go here for sushi alone.. I like the sauteed calamari over anything and the food is good. . price range varies on what you get a meal can run you 20, wine another 10..... price medium to moderately high. its fair for what they give you
