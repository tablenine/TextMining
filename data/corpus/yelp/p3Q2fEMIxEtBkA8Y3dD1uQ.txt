The 2nd &amp; 3rd stars are for atmosphere.  The atmosphere at this place is awesome -- I wish my house looked just like it on the inside.  The bar was cozy, yet spacious.  Our server was very attentive and the candied kumquat spritzer my friend has was tasty.  However, I soon realized I don't like duck fat.  And if ya don't like duck fat, your not gonna like the food.. . The pork buns appetizer was so-so...lots of  moist, doughy bun sandwiching trendily fatty pork (my friend commented she is not a fan of the "poor world war food" fad, and I must agree).   Next, the fish and chips.  One large plank of fish came out hot, crispy and steaming, yet offensively fishy and reeking of duck fat.  It was a strange, off-putting odor and I didn't want to appear fussy or low-brow to my table mates, so didn't comment.  But soon they noted on the odd taste of their food (another fish &amp; chips and a fried chicken plate) and we all suddenly admitted none of us were enjoying the meal.  I've read such great reviews of the fries on here, but really could not get past the weird smell.  Although the tartar sauce was delicious.  We decided to try dessert...no duck fat there!  Wrong...the ricotta zeppoles were also apparently fried as everything else and had the same "fowl" odor.. . Go ahead and call me low-brow, but I just didn't like the food we ordered.  I'll try again one day for a relaxing drink at the bar and stick to non-fried items.
