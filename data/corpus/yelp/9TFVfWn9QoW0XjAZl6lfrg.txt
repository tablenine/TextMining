It's been about 3 years since I last stepped foot at The Modern, so I don't remember much for me to be able to write a more comprehensive review.. . What I do recall:. . - Large space in a very chic setting (everything about it spells chic). - The mixed drinks are great.  Try their signature martinis. - The bathroom was interesting. - The food was well worth the money. - They refold your napkin every time you lazily slap it on the table. . This place is worth checking out.  I guarantee it.
