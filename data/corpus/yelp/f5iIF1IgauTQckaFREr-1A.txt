Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe

I've been here a hand full of times. I have to say that thier food is a touch Mediocre. Thier Service is Okay. The few times i've been, i had 2 different waiters come. I couldn't figure out who my waiter was. . . They have GREAT coffee though. I will give them that.
