Mr. Pizza, . . the things you do with pizza are magical. CPK's got nothin' on you. . . I mean, bulgogi pizza? Shrimp gold pizza? Potato Pizza? . . Well, I AM a meat and potatoes kinda gal. So, that potato pizza with bacon, potato, mushroom, cheese and delicious crust was fantastic! The cheese was so melted and great. The bacon was fabulous. I really don't care if it goes straight to my hips.. . Now, Mr. Pizza, you have suckered me into your delicious and--dare I say--radical--pizza idea...but those gold sticks came from left field. You know the ones: breadsticks with fried cheese on the outside but sweet custardy stuff on the inside? What the...? you can't toy with my taste buds' emotions like that. . . I will, however, satiate my palette with your awesome pizzas. . . Thank you, Mr. Pizza.
