After a hectic round of finals, the BF took me to Osteria Mozza to celebrate. We came on a Tuesday night and thankfully was able to secure reservations 2 days prior. I thought the food, drinks, and service were impeccable. . . The large wine list can be quite over whelming, but the sommelier does a great job picking a wine you like that's in your price range. . . To start, I ordered the butter lettuce salad with bacon, Gorgonzola, and egg. It was fresh, tasty, not overly dressed, and the Gorgonzola was perfect! The BF had Fior de latte, which I thought was a bit salty due to the salami and olives, but he loved it. I also had the Gnocchi which was filled with melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. He had the grilled beef with a fabulous balsamic sauce topped with arugula. Dessert was the bombolini. Perfect! The freshness and heat from the bombolini matched perfectly with the gelato and berry sauce. . . After my meal, the waitress even walked me to the restroom!. . It's definitely not cheap to dine here, but it is definitely worth it. For two people, 2 quartinos of wine, a dirty martini, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert, total came out to be about $90 including tax and tip. In a heart beat, I would come back and have the exact same meal!
