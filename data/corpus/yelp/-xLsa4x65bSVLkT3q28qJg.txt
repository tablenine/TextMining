It was cold, it was raining, and I had to leave the house.  I bribed myself by saying, "Katie, if you go out and run all those errands, you can pick up some soup!"  There's nothing better than really good soup on cold, rainy days.  I had read the reviews on MetroFresh and decided this was the place that was going to provide me soup (it's also really close to where I live and I hate leaving my 'hood).  . I arrive at MetroFresh about 1pm on a Thursday and the place is really busy.  I was surprised all the lunchers hadn't cleared out yet.  I was also surprised at how small the indoor seating area is, but I wasn't eating in, so I wasn't too concerned.  It was loud and I couldn't hear the people behind the counter most of the time, but I think they've been trained in the art of reading lips so I was content for them to understand me and me be clueless.  I took my time looking over their menu on the white board.  Since I couldn't hear the guy behind the counter explain the soups, he was kind enough to churn them up for me (HA!) so I could see what was in them.  I mimed to him "I want the chicken striattecilli (sp?)".  I also got the chicken salad (which had dried cranberries in it!! YUM!).  I whisked the soup home and devoured it.  The soup was fricken' amazing.  Pulled chicken, spinach, carrots, celery in a delicious chicken broth topped off with fresh grated parmesan.  HEAVENLY!. Oh my gosh, best soup in town ever ever ever.   I will go back because I have dreams about that soup.  I highly recommend going and can't wait to explore the rest of their menu.
