pseudocynics please desist from coming to this establishment because your edges may unravel here!. yes it's corny!. i liked it!. it felt like home in a strange sort of way.. while standing outside in the freezing cold, the meseros came bearing the gift of coffee and incongruous bocas such as sausage and chocolate chip cookies.. it reminded me of a foraging expedition in the fridge to find something edible for a surprise visitor. . gus was the bouncer and a dapper congenial fellow he is.. the fried eggs were fried, the bacon was bacon and the coffee tried hard to be coffee.. yes it's corny.. so what.. i liked it!
