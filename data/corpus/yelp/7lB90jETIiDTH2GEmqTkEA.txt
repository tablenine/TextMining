After waiting an hour to order and get our food, our expectations where high.  I had the pastrami sandwich (the plainer one) while my BF had a cheeseburger with gruyere and grilled onions.  We shared a giant basket of fries and tried the variety of sauces they offer.  I was bummed they were out of the PBJ cupcake, but alas, my opinion.  . . Overall, the food was good but nothing amazing.  I felt my sandwich was a bit too chewy and oily.  The burger was a bit better than average, but I think it was because we veered from a regular cheeseburger.. . Would I go back? Maybe....  Would I load up on Tums if I were to go back? Most definitely!   Talk about heavy! That pastrami sandwich weighed my down for days.
