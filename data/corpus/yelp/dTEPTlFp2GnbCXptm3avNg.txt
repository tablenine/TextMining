Admittedly, I'm being a little tight with the stars.  But check it out... If I'm droppin' $275 on a dinner for two (and one of us only had two sides, no entree) then five stars is what's EXPECTED and anything less risks my wrath.. . OK, let's start with what WAS five stars....  Martini ($18) was cold and strong and the shaker that was left at the table filled the glass twice.  The basket of bread that they leave at the table... top notch; especially the pretzel bread.  Personally, I think butter brought to the table should be rock hard... it wasn't.  But it was cold and plentiful so I can deal.  The glass of Duckhorn?  Top notch... and $22.  Let's move on to the salads... good, not great.  I had the Spicy Mambo/Wasabi Salad.  Imagine this... it's like a salad... but spicy.  Moving on.  . Let's cut to the meat of this review... the bone-in 18 oz Kansas City Strip didn't do it for me... this might have been my fault as it was the first time I've ever ordered that cut so not sure what a perfect one is supposed to look like but based on this experience I'll never order one again... it didn't suck but it didn't give me a $47 food hard-on either.. . Here's what cost Mastro's a whole star... my double espresso.  I know there are espresso freaks out there that talk about "bouquet" and "texture" and "finish"... give me a break.  But I know when someone has given me a short pour of strong coffee, slapped on an $8 price tag and called it a double espresso.  . . The high point?  Lobster mashed potatoes.  I mean, someone had to be brilliant AND stoned to come up with that.  It was all claw meat (which is fine) and it was $33 but there was a ton of it... and it kicked ass.  I took half of it home in a doggie bag and am going to put it in with my Grape Nuts tomorrow morning.  'Cause  I'm a classy guy.  Ask anyone.
