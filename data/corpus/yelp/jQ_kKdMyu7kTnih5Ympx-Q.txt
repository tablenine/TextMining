Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I had a heart attack just walking into Roscoe's.  Then, I looked at the menu, and needed a triple bypass surgery.  Then....I ordered my food and needed a defibrillator.  As soon as I received my food, I was sporting my brand spankin' new baboon heart.. . I really like Roscoe's.  It's the place where I can throw all of my cares behind, and order like it's my last day on earth.  By the way I order...it just might be.  I don't go for the regular Chicken N' Waffles, but order the Giblets N' Gravy.  This order comes with grits (gotta love em), and eggs (gotta love em too).  If I'm feeling adventurous, I'll have some waffles on the side.. . Everything I've had is pretty good.  It's definitely a spot to go for some good ol' fashioned Chicken N' Waffles.
