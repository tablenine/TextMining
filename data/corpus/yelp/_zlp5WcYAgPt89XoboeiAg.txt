Restaurant: FOX Sports Grill
Category: Sports Bars
Fox Sports Grill is not your typical sports bar.  It's more upscale, the food and drinks are more expensive, and the atmosphere is more like a club/lounge than a bar (especially on the weekends, complete with roped off lines and "bouncers" manning the doors).  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and the place is definitely more relaxed in the afternoons.  There are plenty of flatscreen HDTVs all over the restaurant positioned way up high (too high) displaying all sorts of sports.  One annoying thing about this place is they will charge you X amount of dollars, if you don't purchase any additional food or drink, if you stick around for a certain number of hours to hang out, drink, and/or watch games.  As for the food, it's decent.  Last time I came, I had the BBQ chicken nachos (pretty good) and our table shared a pizza.  Service was average.  Be prepared for a long wait on weekends as this place gets packed at night.
