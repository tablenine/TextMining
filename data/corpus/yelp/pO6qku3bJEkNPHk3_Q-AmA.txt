I ate here for the 2nd time last night. First time I had Tiny's Prime Rib bowl, and last night I tried the Sour Cream Hen House. Wow, talk about flavor bombs going off in your mouth! Using the word "bowl" to describe them just doesn't seem adequate. I've seen Roy Choi in there both times which is really nice because I've been able to ask him about the exact ingredients in the dishes, which is very important to me because my girlfriend has a few severe food allergies. Last night he pulled out the container of one of the ingredients to read the label for me to make sure it didn't have any trace elements of peanuts in it. So if you have a peanut allergy, you can safely eat the bomb-ass Rock Yer Road dessert. Parking can be a challenge if you go at a busy time, but I stopped by last night at around 9:30pm and there were multiple open spots in the small parking lot. Aside from that, you gotta cruise the street around the corner for street parking. But hey, don't be lazy, it's not a big deal, and the food is worth it.
