Headed here for some Birthday Libations and was pleasantly surprised. I suppose it is an indication that Wicker Park/Bucktown is growing up, or maybe its me. Hmm, anyway... . . Stopped by on a Saturday evening round 8:30, a friend had arrived just before I did and grabbed us a spot at the bar. While full it did not feel overly crowded which is nice. Water arrived with the extensive menu of beverages, nice touch, says to me that they want you to enjoy your beverages rather than get drunk. While I enjoy Beer, and there were a number that I would have loved to have tried, we settled on some Red and got the evening going. . . My impression was good, the service was impeccable and helpful. Will certainly head back to try some of the food options and their nice selection of beer.
