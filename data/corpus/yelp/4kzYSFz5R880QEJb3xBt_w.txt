2 weeks of early reservation and we finally booked the table on Saturday afternoon.    We ordered:. Squash blossom Pizza. Goat cheese Pizza with panchetta . Prosciutto pizza. meat balls appetizers . Salad. Pizzas were thin crust and delicious.   I like the thin crust more.   thinner is better.. Service was great.   Waiter was very attentive .   Refills kept on pouring.. On the other hand,   space is very limited.  Tables were small and cramped.
