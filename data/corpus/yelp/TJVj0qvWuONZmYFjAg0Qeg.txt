Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I really rate Din Tai Fung a 3.5 because of the horrible wait and our service (and I never complain about service), but 8 of us ate 200 juicy pork dumplings.  If not for the next activity  planned, we could have eaten more.  They were a delicious, yet deadly concoction that I can't wait to eat again.. . So here is the weird thing about the service... the people bringing the food were awesome.  The hostess, however, was weird.  When we gave her our order she said "This is 200 dumplings!  Do you know this is 200 dumpling?!?!?!  You want some for home, right?"  Um, no, none of us had a real meal all day.  We wanted our freakin' dumplings!. . She kept staring at us like the pigs we were.  But really, why?  Doesn't she want to sell dumplings?
