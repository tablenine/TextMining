I had the tuna salad for a quick lunch and was impressed by the quality of the Tuna and the flavor of the dressing.  I left full and satisfied.  The atmosphere was cramped but still great.. . At $17, before tip for the salad and a Diet Coke, I could probably find more budget friendly cafe, but I will probably be back to try again.
