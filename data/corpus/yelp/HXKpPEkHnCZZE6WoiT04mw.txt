great NYC vibe here in LA. Live music a little loud inside the bar area. Drinks are a bit pricey too but I'm used to dive bar prices @ half off. So yeah. the food is refreshingly new as well. The chef/owner is a riot &amp; quite approachable. all in all... a wonderful culinary addition to the city.
