Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I love ramen, and this is one of my favorite places.  I love the authentic feel of the environment (the yelling that was previously mentioned), and the fact that you can customize your meal -- how much oil you want in your ramen, the texture of the noodles, and the toppings.  I also love that you can order a half size, so you can enjoy all the other great izakaya goodies this place has to offer.  . . The bite-sized gyozas are homemade, and the karage (fried chicken) is also scrumptious.. . Coming here for lunch, if you get the chance, is also great because they have lunch specials that they don't offer at dinner, like spam rolls (a Hawaiian-Japanese favorite?).. . If you come for dinner, be prepared for a little wait, depending on the size of your party, but it's pretty well worth the wait.
