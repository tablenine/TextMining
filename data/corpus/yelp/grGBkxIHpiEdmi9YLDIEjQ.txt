First time I went here was on a friday night, it was busy, but not overcrowded. I got the chicken buffalo sandwich, and oh my it was awesome, I fell in love! It was huge and I couldn't finish it all. So when you have such a great experience you want to go back to experience it again and again!. . Well that would have been nice if it was anywhere even close to half of that, but it wasnt.. . Went there again, this time was during the week. It wasn't busy at all, staff was to busy talking and having drinks at the bar. Â (yes drinking on the job!) . .  I didn't think anything of it, besides I was here for the food not the staff. So I ordered my chicken buffalo sandwich and right away there seemed something different than the first time I had it. I think they changed it (bad move). So I eat it, mouth watering cause I know its going to be so good, but no! It's not good, in fact it was pretty terrible. Well needless to say that I ate even less this time than last time. . . If I do go back here it will be on a weekend they seem to do better then, and I don't think I will be getting that sandwich again.
