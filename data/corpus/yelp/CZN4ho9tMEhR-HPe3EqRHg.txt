Top Flr is the place I meet friends for drinks before we venture out into the city.  I've eaten the food many times (over a dozen) and I still have yet to find anything that reels me in.  On the other hand, though, their Yellow Roses cocktail is worth every penny and is so delicious you can't help but drink and drink and drink till you are so close to loopy you have to order something to eat just to keep from falling off your stool.  Space is limited and is often filled to the gills, but if you aren't planning on staying all night there's no need to moan about it.  So go for the drinks, enjoy the eye candy staff, but skip the meal.  You'll have a better night, anyway, if you don't blow your wad all in one place.
