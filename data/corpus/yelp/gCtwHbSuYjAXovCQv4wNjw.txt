i really enjoyed this bar as it has a great blend of everything one should be able to experience at a bar. First and foremost, their selection of beer was fantastic. Definitely get the Allagash on tap, it's delicious. Secondly, the way the bar was set up was perfect. If you wanted to chill, you stayed up front near the bar, but if you wanted Â bit more of an intimate setting move towards the back and sit on the comfortable benches. Due to the open space near the back, their is also enough room for a small dance floor while listening to the music the DJ is playing. Unfortunately, when i went the DJ wasn't playing the best music. But still, my buddies and I managed to get our dance on. I definitely see myself coming back here in the future.
