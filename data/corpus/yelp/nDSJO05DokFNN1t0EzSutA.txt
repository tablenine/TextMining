the place is cozy and you get a sense you're wanted there. the hunk of meat on the spit is just hypnotizing, great marketing that you have all the windows focusing on it and when you walk in the door it's the very first thing you see. i love this place. the pita chip and humus is all home-made. the classic doner with the tender juicy meat in it is absolutely sinful, you can also order it in a sandwich version or wrap(ask for extra chili sauce). just recently i got my order and switched up the side order and got sweet potato french fries...amazing
