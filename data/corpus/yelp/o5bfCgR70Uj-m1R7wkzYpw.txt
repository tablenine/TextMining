Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
To be honest, I wasn't uber excited to try this place out.  I've had the ramen at the Fountain Valley location, and it did not blow my mind.  Personally, I don't think it compares to Daikokuya's rich, flavorful soup base.. . So coming in with low expectations (Sorry, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to hurt my friend's feelings since he picked it and I did not want to discredit his taste), I was pleasantly surprised.  Let's elaborate, shall we?. . We started off choosing how we wanted our ramen made by marking options on a half sheet of paper.  This is not how it's done in FV and I'm easily amused so I liked it since this means less room for error.  Normal soup, normal noodles, and less oil + some bamboo and a HARD boiled egg.. . Service was quick since we opted to sit at the bar.  It was noon on a weekend and I had just gotten out of bed, starving without breakfast so I wasn't gonna be picky about where I sat.  Just feed me!!  Luckily we beat the lunch rush because the line went on for hella days when we left.. . I started eating my noodles.  YUM!  Nice, firm texture.  I sliced into my egg.  WOW!  To my unexpected satisfaction, it was not runny like how Daikokuya leaves it even after requesting how I like it.  The soup base was not bland like the FV location either and was very delicious and full of flavor, even without adding any extra condiments.  Fiesta in my mouth!  . . I don't know what it was, perhaps I was just in the right place at the right time and all the stars were aligned, but my meal was stellar!  Except for the spam musubi my friend forced down my throat.  That was a bit subpar.. . But other than that, this place rocks my socks.  I will never judge another place again without trying it, even if it is a chain.  Thanks Smitcha B. for my new found appreciation for Shinsengumi (Rosemead location only)!
