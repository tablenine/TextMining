Really great comfort food here. Â I'm never disappointed when I get something to eat here but I am not a fan of long waits as this place is always so packed but rightly so!. . I've only been getting take out from here when I am too lazy to cook and its quite affordable at around $6 per entree.. . The shaved ice here is really good too and nothing helps cooling off during a hot summer day than shaved ice, we maybe eating it with the AC turned on max.. . Not much to say since every other review has already said it but yeah great tasting food thats just as affordable as fast food.
