We were drawn in by the menu that features interesting ingredients and gourmet sounding preparations for a reasonable price.  Sadly it seems their best days are behind them as evidenced by all the positive press they received a decade ago, but nothing in the last five years.. . When I first sat down to write this review I had a little trouble remembering what we ordered which is never a good sign.  The salad we ordered was fresh but overdressed and really pretty small for 7 dollars.  The crab risotto cakes were crumbly and really didn't taste a lot like crab or truffle oil (come to think of it, they didn't taste like much of anything).  The tuna steak we ordered was cooked medium rare, but the seared outer portion was rubbery and flavorless.. . In all fairness it seems they are more famous for their brunch than their dinner and the service was pretty good.  Nothing we had was terrible and the prices are good considering they use fancy ingredients (crab, truffle oil, butter lettuce, etc).  But with so many mid-tier restaurants serving up great "american" fare, I don't think we'll be back.  Maybe for brunch, but probably not.
