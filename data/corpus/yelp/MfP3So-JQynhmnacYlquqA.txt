Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
If you want authentic Taiwanese grub then Din Tai Fung is your man.. . I haven't had anything here that wasn't perdy darn good. The *real* test however was hearing what my Taiwanese mom had to say about it.  Even SHE didn't have any negative comments about the food itself (you can't imagine how easily that happens everywhere else especially when it comes to food &amp; because she is a damn fine cook). But she does think they're a bit overpriced (again, that's pretty much everywhere though for her-- she's old school).. . I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but the 8 flavor sticky rice dessert is my numero uno, personal comfort food. YUM!  . I did delete a star, perhaps unfairly... but the crowdedness at all hours at this establishment makes your food experience there a little too hectic for my taste. In fact, I feel like they are rushing you the hell outta there as soon as they see you've cleaned your plate! Not a good place to go if you want to enjoy someone elses' company while doing some serious eating.  They did, however, open up a whole new area (oddly, on the other side of the adjoining wall). So, there is a lot more room and the atmosphere on the new side is way more "updated".  Nevertheless, the last time I ate there, I went directly to the new side and still waited almost an hour to be seated!!  If you build it, more will come (apparently)!. . Take-out is a perfectly acceptable option under these circumstances.
