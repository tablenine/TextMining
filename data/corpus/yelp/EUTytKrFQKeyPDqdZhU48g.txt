I love this Mexican Cafe.  Although I don't live too close, I think it merits a quick drive over and it's not too hard to find parking.  There is usually a bit of a wait but I think it is worth it!  I love the Mole offerings and the guacomole.  This is one of my fave. Mexican Restaurants in the city.
