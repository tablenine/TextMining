Am I missing something? I was expecting some over-the-top ridiculous AWESOME kind of breakfast. I mean this place is in HOLLYWOOD, right? LA has awesome food, right? this place has over 600 reviews, right? and 4 stars?. . i was completely underwhelmed. i've learned to not set my expectations too high but.... uh, this was not even on the radar. yes, our waiter was pretty hot, but i'm pretty sure he was younger than me and he called me "hon"... ANNND the service was super slow.. . and the food..... the "noisella"/nutella french toast was good, but sweetly overwhelming. i wanted vanilla ice cream to go with it; it would be a good dessert. my sister and cousin were with me and we split the noisella, the gone shrimping omelette, and the muscle omelette. they were just... ok. i mean, yeah, they were generous with the portions, and the toppings, but again. totally lacking flavor. i had to use a lot of ketchup (yeah, the gone shrimping has shrimp, pesto and capers... wouldn't expect needing more flavor, right? wrong.) not only that, but the gone shrimping was SWIMMING in a pool of egg or shrimp juice. i dunno, but i do not want a soggy, wet omelette! we had the turkey maple sausage with the muscle omelette, and it looked like (and had the consistency of) a hot dog. not even costco kosher quality hot dogs, but the super cheap kind.. . sorry. i really wanted to like this place - i really did! but it was just sub-par for me.
