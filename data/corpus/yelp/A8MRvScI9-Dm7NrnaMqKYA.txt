if u want pancakes for breakfast, go there asap and u will get the biggest &amp; most delicious pancakes in the world, and i assure you will not be disappointed. in fact, you will be crying with joy. share with 3-4 ppl, and u will still be stuffed and happy. i recommend you to order pancakes to share, and get sides for savory stuff like bacon, or eggs, cuz if you don't get your pancakes here, you are MISSING OUT!!! service is great too, and oh, their coffee's made with a french press. MMMmmmMmm...
