All the men who work here are incredibly sexy.  They make me blush.  And doesn't that make banana bread (which is already spectacular) taste better?    The downside is that I always trip over my words when ordering a latte.  . . It has a great cozy, kitschy atmosphere that makes you feel like you've stepped out of the city for a while and have ended up in some hip college town like Chapel Hill or Austin, Texas.  Nostalgia on the walls, great music blasting, and once again, hot collegiate-looking men making you a sandwich.   These sandwiches, by the way, are fantastic,  particularly the brie, tomato, and pesto.  Mmmmmmm.  The bread is homemade and oh so perfect.  Their breakfast pastries are also divine.  Incredible muffins, especially the carrot, which contains everything but the kitchen sink.. . There are also plenty of things to eat for vegetarians, which is always greatly appreciated from my end (I mean, I love grilled cheese, but sometimes it just won't cut it).. . Lunchtime can get a little insane with Greenwich Villagers ready to smack an opponent with their most recent Bleecker Street Records purchase in order to get a table.  But I'll say that the wait is definitely worth it.
