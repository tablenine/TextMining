This place has the BEST SHABU SHABU hands down.  I'm a big shabu shabu fan so I've tried many places such as this.  They have the most tender beef and they give you free rice refills!! And you have to try their coffee, yum yum give me some.  . . But there's always a long ass line.  I usually get there at 4:30 pm and put my name on the list.  Even though they open at 5:30, it's not for sure I'll be able to get in.  That's how crazy the wait is..... . But luckily there are some shops around the plaza so you can do a little shopping while waiting.
