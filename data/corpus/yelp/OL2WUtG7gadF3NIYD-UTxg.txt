Back in April, on the recommendation of a coworker, my boyfriend, his brother and I decided to eat here before a comedy show (Doug Stanhope) at the Lakeview Theater.  When we walked in to a pretty full restaurant I explained to the hostess that we had a show to go to in an hour and asked if she thought there would be enough time for us to get seated, eat and get to the show. (I hostesses for a number of years and a expect and appreciate when the host of a restaurant goes above and beyond just walking you to a table) She was VERY accommodating and got us 3 seats at the bar right away. The bartender was very nice, helped to make some recommendations on the menu.. . We split the Artichoke Cheddar Dip- YUM! But I am a sucker for anything with melted cheese.  My boy friend has the Reuben and his brother had the Shepherd's Pie. They both enjoyed their meals. . I had the corned beef and cabbage. It was incredible!  There were apples (or pears?) in the cabbage which added a really nice sweetness. And the maple glazed corned beef with amazing!  I did not want to take my leftovers into the theater nor did I want to leave any food on the plate so I spend as long as I could stuffing myself but was unable to finish the plate. It was the best corned beef meal I have had so far (don't tell my boyfriend's mom that!). . We were out of the restaurant in more than enough time to get to our show.. . I cannot wait to go back and try their late night menu. I just wish I were in Lakeview more often to enjoy this place regularly!
