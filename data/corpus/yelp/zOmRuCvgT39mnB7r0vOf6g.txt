Saturday Lunch: Smoked Salmon Benedict - Stellar!  Served on a potato pancake instead of biscuit raises the bar.  Flavors blend perfectly and textures original and better than I could have imagined.. . Lemon Ricotta pancakes with homemade blueberry syrup - Excellent!  The aroma alone is fantastic, perfect portion size and fresh lemon zest keeps this meal from giving you that "lead-girdle" feeling.    . . Brought home the garlic stuffed pork chop from the deli.  Wow...  just wow.   difficult to believe that a pork chop can reheat this well. Tender, moist, full of flavor.  I recommend against their instruction of full heat microwave at 2 minutes, did 2.5 minutes at 50% for perfection.  . . Brussel sprouts  with almonds really captured the nutty flavor of a good sprout without any bitterness.  Beet salad also sweet and really nice flavorful.  . . Truly Excellent Customer service.  Our coffee steward lumbered a bit for the only points off this excellent experience.  . . (Don't forget to visit 7 Grand across the street!)
