Pretty good considering my meal scared the crap out of Â me by being so big - I had the corned beef and cabbage. The four slices of corned beef were fine, but the cabbage was an actual head of cabbage... almost jumped in my lap! Very good eatery in the Fairfax District which is mostly Jewish, though the owner made sure the waitresses reported their tips to the desk for income tax purposes... oy-vay!
