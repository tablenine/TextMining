Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
In a city with so many food choices, why have just a hot dog?. . I guess if you had to have a hot dog, you should go to Pink's for the experience. I mean, it is part of the fabric of L.A., right? . . Or if you're getting your oil changed at the Jiffy Lube across the street, then you have time to kill.. . Or maybe you could send your private school-goin' intern to pick up your order. Tell him it's part of paying your dues in the bidness.. . Just keepin' it real.
