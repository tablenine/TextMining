Anyone in for Montezuma's Revenge?  Dear GOD.. . So my wife and I had been driving by this place for the past year or so always wanting to give it a try, but never remembering it when trying to decide on the nights activities.  Until yesterday when we did.. . We made 7:30 reservations and were seated pretty much right away at a spot outside.  We were given chips and two salsa's which were both very good with a nice kick.  Took a bit to get water to the table so our mouths were on fire, but no biggie.. . We both ordered our meals.  My wife got the steak tacos and I ordered the oysters with the tequila/chipotle sauce to start and the shrimp pastor tacos for my meal.  We also ordered a pitcher of their margarita on the rocks. . . We got the margarita's after a few minutes of waiting, and they were just ok. Tasted like it was just poured from a generic/pre-made mix. . . The oysters came out first, and these were just ok.  Nothing special. I've had way better.  I was starving, so I sucked them down.. . After a few more minutes of waiting, our entree's come out.  My wife ordered a side of cheese with her tacos, and they forgot to include and had to wait about 5-10 minutes for them to bring it out.  . . My shrimp tacos were very very boring and lacked much flavor.  I tried my wife's steak tacos as well, and they were the same.  Very bland, again lacking necessary flavor.  . . By the end of our meal, the margarita's were WAY too sweet and combined with lack-luster food, we headed out very disappointed.  Me with a pain in my stomach.. . Remember my comment above about Zuma's revenge, well, I have to end this review for my 3rd session since 6am.  . . Needless to say, I'd pass on El Barco.
