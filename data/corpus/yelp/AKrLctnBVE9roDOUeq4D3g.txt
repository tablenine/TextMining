As good as it gets.  . . The soup base is bewitching. Even when I was burstingly full, I still wanted to taste the soup as much as the very first sip.  I don't get it.  The fact that they only have one option for ramen shows that you don't really need to get anything else.. . The story of the soup base is that they use black pork... something? And they brew it overnight at an "undisclosed location".  They also have an option of getting a creamier (aka more fatty) soup.  You can definitely taste the difference.  It's SMOOTH.. . Downer.  We waited two hours for this.  Yes.  TWO hours.  But usually I hear it's much more bearable, we went around 1:30pm on a Saturday.  So avoid that.  Parking is difficult, but I think there's some lots for $5 flat rate.  And it's Little Tokyo.  . . $8.50 for ramen. There's also an option to take things to go- noodles, soup, greens, and meat separately.  I thought that was charming.  Their Fried Spicy Tuna was good too.
