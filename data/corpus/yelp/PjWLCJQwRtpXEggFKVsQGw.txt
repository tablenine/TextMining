As we walked up, my friend said "I hope there aren't all old people here" and I laughed.. I thought c'mon, it's 7pm and we're at a bar in lincoln park, why would there be old people?. The first thing I see when I walk in the door is a couple in their late 70-80s.  What a coincidence! but surely this would not reflect the inside..... . IT DID!  I guess the close proximity to steppenwolf and it being a sunday night persuaded all the post-theatrical geriatricals to come to landmark for a night out on the town (not that there's anything wrong with that).. . Anyway, the food was good.  I tried the salmon potato latkes, margherita pizza, and mushroom pizza.  Oh and the bibb lettuce salad, which was nothing special.  The pizzas were good though!  not knock-your-socks-off delicious, but quite satisfying.. . I don't know what it is with me and service lately, but our waitress had issues.  She kept getting confused and stressing about how we would do the bill, etc.  She was nice about it, but everything we asked her seemed to be somewhat of a problem.  Ah well, what can you do?  Perhaps she wasn't used to the late 20/early 30s crowds anymore...
