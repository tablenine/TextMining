Overrated, as are most things in this neighborhood. Dining area is horrible: wobbly tables are miniaturized, and patrons are squeezed into them in already cramped dining area, allowing you to overhear everyone else's conversations. Quaint? No, more like annoying. And only positive about the food = it was served hot.
