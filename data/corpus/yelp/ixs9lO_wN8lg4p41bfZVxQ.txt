I liked this place. Some people might not like it because it looks a little run down and it doesn't look like the cleanest place either, but I love the kind of country, old school feel to it.. . I got a meat and veggies plate with jerk chicken, baked sweet potatoes and mac n cheese. The food was good, and the portions were HUGE. I got three pieces of chicken, a generous scoop of mac n cheese, slice of cornbread and two whole baked sweet potatoes all for like 7 bucks. craziness.
