Really, people aren't lying about the horrible service. From the moment you walk in you just kind of stand awkwardly in the corridor wondering if you're supposed to seat yourself or if the host/ess was devoured by a giant monster before you entered. Eventually a waiter was gracious enough to lead us to our room after an exhausted, turmoiled sigh. This was a Tuesday night, too. If you're stressed out to the point of obvious irritability at 8:30 on a Tuesday, God bless your coronary system.. . The decor inside is definitely beautiful albeit a little over the top. Traditional doesn't have to mean a harem recreation, but I understand the image they're trying to portray. It would certainly be a romantic, movie-esque scene if it weren't for the unfortunate noise level. Their shisha/hookah is pretty pricey. But I guess you're paying for the combined atmosphere/smoky experience.. . I forgot the name of my dish, but it was lamb in pasta covered with a peppery yogurt sauce. It was really tasty but not something I'd be knocking down the doors for. After waiting 20 minutes for our check post-meal I was really ready to get out of the Cleopatra movie set. I'm typically patient to the point of meekness at restaurants, and willing to forgive shoddy customer service for amazing food. And on the other hand, I can look fondly at places with average food but a great staff. Cafe Istanbul really needs to choose at least one of these to amp up, preferably both.
