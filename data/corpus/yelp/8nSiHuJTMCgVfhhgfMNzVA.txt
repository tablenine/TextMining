Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Really?  There are 1108 reviews as I'm writing this?!  Well, I'm sure then there's no need for me to add any lengthy epistle on this restaurant of my own to the mix then since it's all been said before.  Pizzeria Mozza is usually one of my "must visit" restaurants whenever I'm in LA.  The crust on the pizzas is to die for.  I could live on the butterscotch budino, pane bianco and Mozza caprese for the rest of my life and die perfectly content (and probably young too, of a heart attack).. . It's pricey but worth it.  Also, be aware that as "the" place to be, there are times where a waiter will be kissing the ass of the party at the table next to you and sort of gloss over you.  Don't take it personally.  It's LA after all.
