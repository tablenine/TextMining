TGIFridays meets Taco Bell. Mediocre "mexican" food. When they start forming rice into geometrical shapes, I begin to wonder...kinda reminds me of grade school when the mashed poatoes just kept the shape of the ice cream scoop they were served from. Service was friendly but annoying. They were slow which apparently is the reason why EVERY busboy stopped at our table EVERY three minutes to ask how everything was. Mole sauce tasted canned. Rice had no flavor. Ordered patron, got bar brand tequila. Yes people can tell the difference, especially when you oder it straight!This place sucks. There is no reason Â for a restaurant like this to still be in business in the city of chicago. How do people eat this crap?! Top to bottom, this place was awful. I would rather order taco bell than eat this again.
