Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
First of all the food here is great!!  Good portions and very reasonable!!  They accomodate baby carseats which was a plus!!  I've been here maybe 8 times my whole life.  I love the food!  The service is great but it seems like they like to rush you out so they can clean the tables.  I thought there was a long waiting list but no one was there.  I went there with a family of 15.  We wanted to hang out and talk since we just got back from "The Getty."  There was alot of waiters looking at us to see when we were leaving.  Second...those valet drivers are crazy!!  They like to drift our rides!!  Seriously it was pretty scary when they were getting our cars!  Hopefully they are not affliated with Palms Thai.  Otherwise that's not cool!!!
