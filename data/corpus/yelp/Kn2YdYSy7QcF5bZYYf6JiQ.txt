Totally cool place to go if you wanna do something different.  You feel like you went back in time here!  The magic shows vary by performer.  One that I saw was amazing, while another on the same night was just OK and kinda boring.  You have to be a member or know a member to go.  Just that part makes it cool!  And you MUST dress up...that means coat and tie for boys and cocktail dresses for girls.  It's nice to go somewhere you get to dress up once in a while!  . . The food - I thought the food was not as bad as others had said.  I went there expecting really mediocre food but it sure surpassed my expectations!  We ordered the oysters for appetizer.  Good sized and fresh!  Then my bf ordered the prime rib and I had the rack of lamb.  Both were delicious, but I think the lamb was a little better.  The jalepeno jelly it came with gave it a god kick.  . . Don't miss this place if you ever get the chance to visit (invite by a member).  fun fun fun!
