If you're craving a french dip sandie or haven't tried one and looking for a good experience; this is the place to go! My girlfriend and I ordered the regular single dip and the lamb sandwich. By itself the the sandwiches were good, but combo-ed with their famous spicy mustard brings the meal to a whole new level; even the sandwich gods would smile.
