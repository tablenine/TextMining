I was overwhelmed with the bajillion choices for the sausage:  sausage with basil, cilantro, garlic, chili....wait....sausage with strawberry jam?? with chocolate??? wat the.....ANYhoo, their house made sausage is pretty delectable, I must say.  . . Also had their chicken nuggets - AWESOME!!!! Put me in a tub, fill it up with these babies and I'll eat my way out.  . . Also ordered their pork chop over rice. Wow.  I mean W-O-W.  For a little over five dollars, I got:. -  a fried pork chop the size of a baseball mitt;. -  half a can of del monte corn. -  2 cups of white rice. - 2 scrambled eggs. Talk about bang for your buck.
