For my money, Chops is simply the best steakhouse in the country,  . . They serve a more flavorful steak than Gibson's in Chicago (my #2) and Sparks in NYC (my #3).  Capitol Grill in Orlando is very good but not awesome. Chops serves a far better seasoned steak and tastier sides than their Atlanta competitor Bones.  It's more inviting and better flavored than Ruth's Chris (my #1 chain) and head and shoulders above Mortons (the most overrated steakhouse anywhere).  Yes, I've eaten at Charley's in Orlando (average at best), Mastro's in Beverly Hills (5 on a 10 pt scale) and the Angus Barn in Raleigh.  Chops' steaks are better flavored than most of the famous steakhouses in Kansas City.  This review doesn't count Lawry's in Chicago or Vegas which undoubtedly serves the best prime rib, but we're talking steaks here.  Finally, I have to admit, I've never eaten at Gene and Georgetti's in Chicago or Peter Luger's in NYC, so this can't be the definitive review :D.. . -  The atmosphere is clubby and again, old school which I like.. . -  Steaks are served with an amazing delicious char and are consistently cooked to order.  Best of all, they are perfectly seasoned.  In fact, it's the only steakhouse I've ever found that I've never had to reach for the salt shaker.. . -  The garlic mashed are outstanding.  I'm usually a creamed spinach guy at a steakhouse, but instead go for the sauteed spinach w/garlic and olive oil...the best spinach I've ever eaten.. . -  The waiters are professional and service is attentive.  They can be a bit full of themselves and one of them (Yanni) needs to learn how to better describe the menu (but he THINKS he knows), but overall the service is top notch.
