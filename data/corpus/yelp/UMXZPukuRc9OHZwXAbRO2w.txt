When I go to a sushi place these days, I'm generally looking for maki, the more creative the better (Banana? BBQ sauce? Mozzarella cheese? Yes please!) Mirai was a delight because it goes beyond creative maki to rethinking how Japanese and Japanese-inspired food should be served and eaten. They do have entrees, sushi and maki, but much of their menu is devoted to what is best described as "Tapas, Japanese-style" - small appetizer-like plates meant to be shared. We tried as many things as we could eat (and afford, place isn't for the budget-conscious), and everything was quite good. Standouts included the Yukke Toro(spicy fatty tuna tar-tar with raw quail egg and "chef's" special sauce), Kani Nigiri (spicy baked king crab nigiri-style, one of their most popular items and an incredible little packet of flavor) and my favorite, the Kimo (monk fish foie gras wrapped in octopus). Monkfish liver is mild but still something of an acquired taste, but I've acquired it and I eat it whenever I find it. I have only rarely found good octopus, but the octopus here was just the right firmness and a good complement to the monkfish liver's custardy smoothness. Also good were the tempura, the udon soup, the goma ae, and the unusual and flavorful teriyaki chicken. We finished off with mochi: mango, strawberry, and a a delightfully smooth red bean. Definitely warrants a return visit to try the rest of the menu. My friends also had Cucumber Passion martinis, which I sipped and vowed to try next time. Just be prepared to drop half a yard (aka a quintuple sawbuck). It may be pricy but we were suprisingly full given the small portions, so I have no complaints. . . I guess my only beef is: what kind of a fancy-schmancy Japanese restaurant serves you green tea as a pot of hot water and a teabag?
