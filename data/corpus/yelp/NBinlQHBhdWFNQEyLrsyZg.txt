Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Yummy to my Tummy! This may be the only place where my pocket book doesn't get mad at me. Why? Because it's worth every penny.  The steak...wow! The lobster mashed potatoes.... OMG!  I love this place. I can't make it often, but it's worth it everytime I go. I always encourage friends who come into to town to go.  Out of the three times I've been the service has been impeccable! Because I had reservations each time, they addressed me as soon as I showed up by my last name as if I was the only person in the restaurant.  I felt so special! My table was always ready and I've never had to wait. . My boyfriend was a little spooked about the waiter who gave us excellent service but would scare him each time he walked up behind him. LOL... other than that, I suggest this place for a romantic evening, a night with the girls or just a cool hang out spot at the bar.
