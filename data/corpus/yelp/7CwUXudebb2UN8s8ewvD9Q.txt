I was having a lousy morning. Just about everything that shouldn't, sucked. But when I went to Milk for lunch, my day really turned around.. . The specials sounded awesome---but too much for me in my delicate condition. So I had one of their regular panini's----Roast Beef with I think a bit of arugula and a horseradish mayo. I asked them to go gentle with the mayo. And they nailed it. Perfectly prepped, it lifted me back to where I'd like to be, and then took me higher.. . Topped it off with a potent espresso and killer CC cookie. Ahhhhh.
