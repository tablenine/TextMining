Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I had never had sushi before in my life before I went to Tank.  I had always had the idea that sushi was raw fish and seaweed, which, to me, was just plain unappetizing.  However, the food and tank is wonderful.  Everything is always so fresh, and there are so many options to choose from its hard to find something you wouldn't like!. . As everyone else has said, the weekend specials are great!  I recommend everyone trying Tank at least once!
