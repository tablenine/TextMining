I enjoyed the novelty of this idea and the feeling...that I am experiencing the LA's trend. Kogi is good to try at least once if you're in LA and they happen to be your neighborhood.. . The food is good. Short Rib and spicy pork. I would say the taste of the korean BBQ sweet sauce was too strong that it almost kill the natural taste of meats....but it still tastes good.... little bit greasy. But I totally enjoy the experience. It's a good street food. If you don't expect too much, you will have fun at the truck.
