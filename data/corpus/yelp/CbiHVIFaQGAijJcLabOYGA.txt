WOW!! Still thinking about it. I was here earlier in the month to celebrate a birthday. We had early reservations but dinner lasted about 3 hours. It was a Wednesday night and it was packed. Our server was Will, one of the best servers to date. We started off with a bottle of sparkling wine, which was excellent. Will gave us a rundown of the menu and a game plan. The menu is a bit overwhelming at first. Here is what we ordered: . ANTIPASTI - Octopus with potatoes. Perfectly grilled and just the right amount of acidity. . MOZZARELLA - burrata with cherry tomatoes - yum . SECONDI - Ravioli with ricotta &amp; egg and Buccatini alla Amartriciana. Okay, now I know most people including myself initially thinks its pasta. But, ITS PASTA. So amazing. I will go as far as to say that now any other pasta will pale in comparison. The amartriciana sauce is a red sauce and has a bit of a kick. I didn't realize that they guanciale (pork) which I have not had in a very long time. It was good, oh well. . PRIMI - Veal crusted with Porcini - I never had veal, but yum. Tender and perfectly seasoned. . SIDES-Rosemary Potatoes. Crispy on the outside and almost like mashed potatoes on the inside. Just the right amount of rosemary.. Dolci- Chocolate Gelato and Olive Oil Cakes . . I am gluten intolerant and the staff was very accommodating to my dietary restrictions. They have gluten-free pasta on the premise. They also made a point to serve everything that was gluten free on a separate plate to minimize cross-contamination. This included serving my cheese on a radicchio instead of a crostini without having to ask. . . The food was so good that we went next door and ordered a pizza to take home. Overall, lived up to the hype and would come back again.
