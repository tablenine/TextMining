Category: Mexican
so this is a fun place, especially at nights and weekends. people stand and crowd around outside waiting for tacos. it's decently cheap, not dirt cheap. and the food is only ok. the sauce they cook the meat in for the burritos has a really weird/interesting taste to it. it's not bad, just a bit different and weird. it's ok, a bit overrated, but it's cheap so...
