The best way to describe it is - gourmet southwestern food. You will love it. But expect a few twists. For example, tacos are common fare in southwestern cuisine, but not lobster or duck tacos. And they were great. The food will always be tasty - full of flavor. The environment is also very southwestern.. . My favorites: chicken relleno, mixed green salad with goat cheese/strawberry dressing, black bean enchiladas, smoked chicken tacos, and the spicy trio of filet mignon medallions.. . The best dessert in Atlanta - roasted banana enchilada.. . The service is exceptional. They want you to have a great experience and are willing to put everything they have into it.. . Visit often. They change up the menu a bit. There are always new things to try.
