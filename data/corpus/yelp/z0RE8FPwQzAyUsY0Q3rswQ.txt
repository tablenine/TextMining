Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Honestly, this place is not all that. It's a bit overrated.. . The dumplings are so-so. I like the fact that you can taste the freshness of the ginger within each dumpling but other than that, they're just okay for me. . . The spicy beef stew was a very big disappointment. This is something I always manage to get at most restaurants if they have it so I've had various different takes on it. Â Sadly, this was one of the worst. It was not at all spicy, the soup came lukewarm and for what you pay, there really isn't much. . . The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is great. Nice and bright. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. . . Overall, I'd eat here again but it's not exactly the first restaurant that comes to mind.
