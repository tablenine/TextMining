I'll admit. I cheated a little teensy bit on yelp. The reviews on Resto looked a tiny mixed, so I went to . http://menupages.com.  and they were pretty negative. Well, I love Resto. And in 5 easy steps you can too.... . Step 1: Listen to your bartender. Nick and Bobby know of what they speak in food, wine and beer. There is a separate beer glass for each brew on tap and the wine list is actually decent.. Step 2: Deviled eggs. Yes you heard me. Deviled eggs. But these aren't your normal Grandma's food-poisoning picnic paprika eggs. These are little post-modern bacon and egg concoctions served on top of fried pork toasts. Good thing there were only 3. Or I'd be 60lbs heavier.. Step 3: Lamb ribs... clearly the furry Belgian equivalent to pork belly. Loaded with fat. Ridiculously good.. Step 4: Soft shell crab salad... Gone in 20 seconds. My very dim-witted brain did measure happiness in that 20 seconds, though.. Step 5: Sausage... because no self-respecting, beer-imbibing girl would complete a meal without them, and this place does them so well!. . So there you have it. My rather remedial, 5-step program for Resto. Try it. Maybe it'll work for you too. And if it doesn't? Ha! More deviled eggs for me.
