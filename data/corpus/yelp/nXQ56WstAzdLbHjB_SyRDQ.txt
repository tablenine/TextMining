Quite honestly, I don't know if it's fair to even review the food here, because the cocktail flights suck me in every time.  Each time I go, I tell myself, "OK, I'm just getting ONE big drink instead of three normal-sized ones," and each time, the flights seduce me.  So by the time the food comes, my memory is, shall we say, impaired?  While the title for best drink in town still goes to Frontera's blue agava margarita, the depth in Nacional 27's cocktail menu makes it a worthy contender for best bar dinner in the city (and it's pretty easy to wangle a seat at the bar even on a weekend).  Bartenders are so knowledgeable, friendly, and very generous with their pours and tastings.  These are grown up drinks for those of us who have outgrown our appletinis and cosmos, and I am grateful that I can still order a fun, pretty, girly drink that doesn't put me in a sugar coma. . . The food is fine, really good in fact.  But if it were five star material, I'd remember at least one dish--and these days, all I can think about is El Corazon.
