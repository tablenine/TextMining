First of all, I hate Hollywood.  I really do.  I only came here, because a friend of a friend's band was playing and they're a Misfits cover band.  Now, here's the review:. . The bar: It was nice that there was an open bar for a half hour.  But after that, the bartenders passed me up time after time.  Apparently there is no first come first serve system.  They arbitrarily pick people to serve...which was mainly guys.  Kind've annoying.  The drinks were decent. I didn't order anything special.. . The atmosphere:  Dear god, douchebags galore.  The guys were meatheads and the girls were cheesy, fake-breasted, and basically wearing no tops.  This kind of place is where cliche meets toolbag.  *sigh*. . The one star?  That's for actually having an awesome band play and letting people mosh a little.  . . Would I come back?  No. Absolutely not.  I wouldn't want to catch tacky from the people who frequent this place.
