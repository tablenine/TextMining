Unique concept but average food.. . My wife and I tried this place after reading about it in a few places. Yes its counter service and communal tables but that's not much of a problem. The staff keeps things moving but when you see people waiting outside for chairs you tend to not want to linger.. . If I had stuck to the dumplings this would be a five-star rating. We ordered three different versions and loved all three. I also ordered a rice dish which was fairly good. . . What dropped the review down was the previous issue of being rushed combined with my order of the udon noodles. I don't know what it was but they tasted a little metallic or something. I ate all the scallops but could not eat the noodles or the broth.. . I doubt we'll go back again. Its out of the way and there are so many other places closer with better food.
