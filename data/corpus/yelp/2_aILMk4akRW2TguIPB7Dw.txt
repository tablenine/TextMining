I don't understand the love for this place.  It's not bad . . . the Hainan Chicken was decent; the beef curry pasta, well,  less so.  It's just that I've been to dozens of better places in the SGV.  If I were still living in Laurel Canyon and Savoy Kitchen was nearby, I'd probably go again.   But here in the SGV there are just too many better places.  It wouldn't be fair to leave it at that, so I'll mention some of them: Mama's Lu, Xiang Wei Lou, Kam Hong Garden, Luscious Dumplings, Mei Long Village, Pho Minh, Sea Harbour, Elite, J &amp; J.  In my opinion, any of these is much more deserving of your dining dollar than Savoy Kitchen.
