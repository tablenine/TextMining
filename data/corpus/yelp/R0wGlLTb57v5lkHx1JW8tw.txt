Huge fan.  Versailles is awesome.. . Great food, great portions, great prices.  You can't go wrong.  It's not fancy   at all - just Cuban food that's consistently good.. . I prefer the Venice location to the La Cienega, just because it's bigger and just had a face lift.  There's one in the Valley - I think by Encino and one in South Bay and I haven't been disappointed at any of the locations.
