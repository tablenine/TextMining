Great vegan food, and friendly service, but the kitchen can get backed up .  You'll be looking around the place and there'll only be a few tables, but something has gone horribly slow in the kitchen and it can take years to get your food.  I think they've gotta have just one or two cooks, but maybe that's why the food here is so consistent.  If you're looking for a detox from your cheeseburger binges, the food ( and the drinks) here are tough to beat for wholesome goodness
