I do not like waiting 3 hours for food.  We were  a party of 4, arrived at 7:30, and did not get seated until past 10.  None of our food was compted for the ridiculous wait!  The hostess was a bitch who wouldn't give us an exact time.  She just kept pointing to the . pages and giving us snooty looks with her over botoxed face and over collagened lips.  Was so tempted to give her my cousin's husband's business card and say, "why don't you let him fix your close to Heidi Montag look?". . The portobello fries were good - it didn't taste mushroomy so I ate it.  The clam pizza was also delicious.  The rib eye steak was good, but not exactly melt in your mouth good, and the lasagna looked old.  It did not look fresh at all, nor did it taste very fresh.  Pumpkin squash was dry but the smashed potatoes were yummy.  Their gelato was really delicious though.. . Oh yea, their valet was too full for my 2001 Toyota Camry, but had space for other cars.  . . Probably wouldn't return except for take out and their macarons.. . Oh highlight - Joel McHale going to the bathroom, which we were seated next to after our 2.5 hour wait, and our waitress was very nice.  She got a pretty big tip.
