Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I can't remember how long I've been wanting to go to Roscoe's Chicken &amp; Waffles. After a long, but pleasant drive from San Diego we finally arrived. I order the house specialty: chicken and waffles. After the first bite I was speechless. I was sent straight to la-la land. The portions are so generous I ended up bringing most of the fried chicken home and eating it alone in the kitchen -I was not sharing that little piece of heaven with anyone. Roscoe's totally lives up to their fame by serving great tasting food. If you're watching your figure though, don't go. This restaurant is not for the faint of heart; the food is greasy, but oh sooo good.
