Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
This is a good place to go for dinner if you are in the area - maybe before going to catch a play at one of the theaters that's nearby. It's always got a fun, lively atmosphere (don't go if you want quiet and intimate - so not the place) and from the couple times I've been there, a friendly &amp; attentive wait staff. The food is good too. I won't say its the best mexican I've had in Chicago - but definitely it's consistently good. And I do quite like their salsa &amp; queso....very yummy! It is a little more expensive then other mexican joints - but given the area and that it's very popular, I wouldn't expect it not to be. All-in-all, I'd recommend it if you are in the neighborhood or just in the mood for the type of atmosphere only Julio's can deliver (especially on the weekends). Otherwise....there are other spots I'd go to first if I want truly mind blowing mexican food.
