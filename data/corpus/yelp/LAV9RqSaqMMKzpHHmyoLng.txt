if there is a paradise for meat lovers this would probably be it.  AMAZING FANTASTIC FABULOUS cuts of meat that was fresh and oh so delicious!!!  . . [i've always had this snarky feeling that LA k-town would be a little bit more awesome than norcal el camino k-town...]. . anyhoo, we went to this place on a thursday night, and the place was packed (a good sign!), the interior was clean and well decorated (mad props to the granite tabletops), but the host could use a little bit more training in being nice to folks who are told to wait till their tables are ready... but in retrospect all that is moot when we ordered the food.. . ordered combination d, which had pork belly and bulgogi made out of chicken amongst other things, and it was the right serving for two people.  the price was worth it, and if there's something else to be raved about it would have to be the salad.  omfg it was the most delicious endless salad anyone could ask for- the veggies were fresh and the dressing wasn't overpowering.  if i could live a life of vegetarianism, i would probably live off of that salad and be totally content.  the grilled meats were also accompanied well with the sauces that were given to us.. . all in all, this place was just faaaaaaaaaab!!!  i'm glad we went on a thursday night, 'cause i can't imagine how ridiculous the wait will be on a packed weekend night!
