Doner Kabobs, for some reason it sounds like some swedish/turkish hybrid. Instead, although most of the elements are turkish i think, some italian nuances are thrown in. Instead of rolling these delish sandwiches in Pita, they are wrapped in a thin Focaccia bread. As well, there is a case of yummy gelato to choose from for desert. . . But as for the Doner itself (which i assume is the meat part), its much like a gyro meat, spicey and flavorful. Â The accompanying fixins are quite tasty....there's an undefined dressing or spice that puts it over the top and i couldn't really say what it is.. . Find youself cruising back from the Target in Eagle Rock. Stop by Spitz for a tasty lunch.. . Oh, evidently, the owners are graduates of Occidental College near by and discoverd the Doner Kabob on a trip abroad and decided to open the joint up. Thanks!
