Love this place. I come here once in a while for happy hour after work with coworkers or for dinner with friends. Their food is excellent from the salads to the burgers. Â Servers are attentive and friendly. As a non-beer-drinker I love that they carry Smirnoff Ice and Mike's Hard Lemonade! I think they're prices are reasonable on both the malt beverages and liquor cocktails.
