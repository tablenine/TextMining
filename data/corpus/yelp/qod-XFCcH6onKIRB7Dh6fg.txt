Know why this placed is called Oinkser's? . . 'Cause it's for pigs, fatty!  . . The place looks like so many diners in LA on the outside: like it's from the 50's or something and it was in Swingers.  LA obviously came before Swingers, but I didn't move here until well after that movie, so that's my reference point forever more, I guess.  Sue me.. . My friend recommended we go to this place, and he was very honest about having heard of it through that restaurant reviewer guy that everyone reads that writes for whatever magazine.  That's helpful, huh?. . The fries look kinda stale in the picture here, and that's exactly how they look in person, and you really think that's exactly what they're gonna be the whole time you're raising fingers full of the fuckers up to your lard hole, but the reality is anything but!. . They delicious!  So there's one point.  I've only had a couple different sammies from this place, and they have all been unique, juicy and delicious.  I've yet to try a burger, but my friend always gets one and they look excellent too.. . But I'm saving the best for the last.  The real reason you go to this place is for the sauce, pigs.  They make their own sauces and condiments!  Let me just tell you, as far as fries go, I've always been a ketchup hound and I never would have dreamed anything would change me.  But one of their dipping sauces they make is this mayo like concoction with garlic and shit in it... it is CRAZY good.  I haven't been there in a while so I forget about the other condiments and sauces, but like I said they're all freshly made and original.  . . So next time you look around and think of killing yourself, Eagle Rock resident, just remind yourself you guys have Oinkster's and Verdugo Bar, two of the very best places to go to!
