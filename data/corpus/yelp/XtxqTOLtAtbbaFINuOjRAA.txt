Great Thai food! The parking leaves a little to be desired, but it's a tiny hole in the wall with great food! The food is cheap and there's always a crowd, but you don't have to wait too long and the food is YUMMY! It's a trek from the westside, but my friend LOVES to go! It's totally worth it to him! I order chicken sate with the sauce which is great and any of the dishes that you choose will do you no wrong. Â It's a family-friendly place, in fact you are bound to find many Thai families coming in to dine and enjoy the great food! Come on in to Thai Town and give it a try! Yum!
