Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I used to come here a lot with my friend.  We would hide in a booth in the back and hang out (and order food of course).. . I always get the same thing, corned beef sandwich on rye.  It's just so good!...plus I hate the idea of trying something new there and regretting that decision.  The prices are a bit steep, but my love for corned beef overrides any thought to not dish out the cashola. . . But my favorite favorite thing about Canter's that makes it 4 stars and not 3, is the bakery!!  Everything is delicious and unlike their sandwiches, everything is really inexpensive.  Mmmm rugula.  I always get a bag of goodies to take home and devour while I watch Undeclared episodes. Plus, one time the guy at the counter gave me a free slice of cheesecake because he thought my friend and I were dating and he had just treated me to dinner.  We weren't actually dating...but for free cheesecake, we were that night!  . . **Open 24 hours, major bonus for all you googly-eyed late night freaks like me.
