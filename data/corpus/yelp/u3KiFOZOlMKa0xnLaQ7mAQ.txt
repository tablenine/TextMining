Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I've never eaten here when I was not at least legally drunk so I have no clue what it might be like as an actual culinary destination.  The pastas + pizzas satisfy a late night craving (I believe they are open until 4 AM)  Staff is fun and colorful.  Never had a bad time here at Bossa Nova.
