Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
It's a very small quaint, seat yourself, order at the counter, fast -food type Asian fusion place. The menu is an array of dumpling appetizers, noodles in broth, and rice dishes. A little over-priced. I had the ramen with pork belly and it was quite good. Ordered a variety of dumplings, they were kind of hit or miss. And the Mango with rice cake was very good. Overall, a nice place to try. BYOB. Not good for large groups. It is located in a plaza so there is free parking available.
