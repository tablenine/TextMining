The best sushi for the price. located in the art district of castleberryhill this is a west cost style small sushi and saki lounge. . . the sushi at wasabi is constistantly among the best I have had. The nice thing here is the great staff and atmoshpere. If you are hanging out at the bar around 9pm get ready to participate in the comsumption of the staff favorite Saki Bombs!. . Sit at the sushi bar and you will get the opportunity to make friends with the onwer Nahn. If his personality and service does not keep you coming back I would be suprised.. . Castleberryhill has a great art stroll the fourth friday of the month, so on these nights the place can get pretty crowded, but that can also be the best time to experience the great charm of this sushi saki lounge.
