I've only been here once, and it's was GREAT! I had a salmon appetizer (I'm forgetting the name of it), and a couple of drinks.  Prices where typical for this type of place.  It did take some time for us to get a table, but the restaurant was kind of "clubby", so me and my friends were able to socialize around the bar and dance a bit while waiting on our table.  Very cool atmosphere.
