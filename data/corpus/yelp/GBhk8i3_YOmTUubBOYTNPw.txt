Love this place.. . It's a hike out to the B Hwy for me but always worth the trip.  . . This is the only malaysian restaurant in ATL that i've been to.  They also serve Thai dishes.  It's clean, nice, and the food is top notch.  I think of Malaysian food as a hybrid of Indian and Thai.  Match made in heaven.  . . Selected Dishes:. Roti Canai: indian style pancake to dip in a curry sauce. Penang Char Kway Teow: flat noodles stir fried with seafood and an amazing smoky sauce.  Hard to describe the flavor of this dish but it's AMAZING.. Lamb Rendang:  lamb curry dish with coconut milk and cinnamon - thick and savory. . I once ordered the fried whole fish and it was not ok.  Overcooked and very fishy.  I believe it was snapper that day too if i'm not mistaken. The sauce had a bad afertaste too.  Other than that, explore the menu, so many options! . . Be sure to ask for the "picture menu" to see photos of dishes if you're uninspired.. . if you like indian food, vietnamese, or thai, go check this place out!
