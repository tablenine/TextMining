I liked the mashed sweet potatoes.  That's about it.  The service was non-existant.  Seriously.  I was going to send back part of my meal, but the waiter never came back to our table before our plates were cleared.  My grilled chicken with mango salsa was not half as good as it sounds.  . . The place was half empty on a Friday night.  Now I know why.
