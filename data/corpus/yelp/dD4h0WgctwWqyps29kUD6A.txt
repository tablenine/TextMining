Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
I was invited to join dinner with a group of friends, and I was delighted. . The restaurant had decent interior and mood, and we were able to sit without waiting. Well, it was Monday night. . I usually do not like criticizing on food when I am a guest, but this was an exception. Maybe it was just a bad night??. I had rabbit meat. My friends had spaghetti, steak, pork chop, risotto, grilled chicken. Oh, at the beginning, we had seafood platter. . My rabbit: soft, but slimy. The side dish, which was lever mouse, had a really bad aftertaste. I wanted to gag...... Spaghetti: Wayyy too salty. . Risotto: I guess it was ok. . Pork Chop: overcooked when my friend asked for medium. it was chewy and hard. . Steak: It was good.  . The Seafood platter: THAT"S IT????? for $95??????I think half of this price was earned on its appearance, and our excitement when it came out . Sure it looked cool. Although the calamari was good :P I couldn't stop eating. . . Although the food was such a disappointment, I still had a great time with my friends. . In my opinion, in LA, a lot of new, trendy restaurants are not really focused on making good food. Well, let me rephrase it. They do not know how to make good food, but they know how to entertain their  customers. They all kind of taste similar. What's different? Location, interior, entertainment and mood.  The expensive silver ware, a fine entrance... That's what people are paying for, more than what you should be paying, which is their chef's skill.. For people who want a romantic date, this is a good place. . Looking for good food? There are better places.
