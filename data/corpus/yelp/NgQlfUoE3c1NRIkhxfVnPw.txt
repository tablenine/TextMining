So we went to Fred 62 tonight after our art gallery thing because I sort of felt I should. It's one of those well known open-all-night-places in LA, so we were kind of close by, and we gave it a whirl. I really didn't know what I was expecting, but what I got - wasn't it. I think I expected it to be kitschier somehow. I don't know.... . Anyway, I got the breakfast sammy with bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns. Fran D. got himself a smoked salmon version of the same. Both were pretty damn yummy.. . We sat at the counter and even tho Fran thought the service would suck, our adorable server Talia was quick and friendly and hey - even adorable!
