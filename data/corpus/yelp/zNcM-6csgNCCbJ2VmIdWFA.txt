Yeah, yeah everyone loves Kogi's and I do too.  Tacos, Sliders, kimchi fries, and everything else is delicious.  The novelty is fun too.   The truck is better than Alibi room.  . . The only thing I hate about Kogi's is YOU!  Yes YOU.  You people who will wrap the line around the F'ing block or set up camp waiting for the goddamn truck to arrive.  A few times I have driven up with hopes of getting something delicious and then have left in bitter disappointment because your cloggin' up the line.  . . Also when you get to the front, do me a favor and order.  Don't just stand there and read the menu like its a magazine.
