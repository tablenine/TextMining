Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
I've gotten yelled at by people for liking Roy's as much as I do-- they feel the need to remind me that it is a "chain restaurant" with locations all over the US.  Well, I tell them to stick it where the sun don't shine, because Roy's is delicious and the service is, to this day, the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  . . The food is so tasty, starting with the edamame that's placed on your table in lieu of bread, to the lobster dim sum with white truffle emulsion for an appetizer (delicious and unique), to the entrees (my favorite being the butterfish over black rice with wasabi cream sauce), to the chocolate souffle dessert.  And if it's a special occasion, the dessert will come with a greeting such as "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate on the plate.  . . The service is shockingly good-- very helpful, attentive, and even folded our napkins for us while we were in the restroom (which were, by the way, completely stocked with necessities like hairspray, bobby pins, and other toiletries).  . . A great special occasion restaurant, although it seemed suitable for families and girlfriends having a dinner together as well.
