Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
My family and I have been buying our pastries from Portos,(Glendale location) Â back when you could go in from the back entrance straight through the kitchen, and to the front of the 'back then tiny bakery. Cuban and Colombian food are remotely similar so this is always a special treat! They are not only a flashback to my childhood, but a reminder of all the great celebrations Porto's has been a part of.. . My personal favorites are . Potato balls: Crispy on the outside, formed in a nice size ball, with warm, mashed potato surrounding a ground meat center. PERFECT!. . Guava Cheese Strudel-Flaky, buttery goodness with a guava and cheese filling that is sweet but not overpowering... This friend can not be imitated!. . Cubano-(Cuban sandwich) Slow roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese mustard and pickles on Cuban bread. The perfect item for a delicious lunch, OR dinner!!! . . Mango Mousse Cake- this is the celebration cake of choice at my house, birthdays, graduations, baby showers, this cake is amazing! And better than your basic icing and bland grocery store cake. . Two Layers of yellow sponge cake, and two layers of fresh mango mousse!! . . If you ever go there ,do not expect your typical Mexican Bakery items, Porto's lets you savor better pastries, better flavor and a better way to celebrate your festivities!
