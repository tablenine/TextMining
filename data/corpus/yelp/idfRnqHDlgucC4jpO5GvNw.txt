Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Steaming hot broth and spiced to your specifications, their ramen hits the spot.. . Especially when you're hungry, cold and in need of comfort food. . . Cheap.. . Parking available on the streets and nearby lots.. . This ramen place can be found on the third floor of the center.
