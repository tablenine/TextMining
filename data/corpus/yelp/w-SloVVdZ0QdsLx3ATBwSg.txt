There is a long line, but it's a part of the experience. I love going late at night talking to random drunk strangers.. . Their dogs are all delicious and totally worth the wait and its price. They are cash only, so make sure you stop by the atm before you get to the front of the line and its time for you to order. Their service is ok, but they have some pretty tasty refreshments.
