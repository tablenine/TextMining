I can't believe I became one of those people... I see a line and I think : oh wow this place must be really good!. . Don't get me wrong, I had good brekfast there, about as good as I did at Ocean Dinner... but I waited 1h and got typical SoCal breakfast food. Not worth the wait in my opinion. . . I tried. I enjoyed. Probably not going back unless it is on a week day to avoid the crowd..
