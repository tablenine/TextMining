i wasn't quite sure what to expect when i stood outside of landmark.  i was pleasantly surprised when i made my way inside.  really neat layout.  i love the catwalk overhead.  . . the bar and waitstaff seemed nice although they were a bit overwhelmed i think with the sheer number of yelpers flocking for the free stuff. . . a little bit on the pricey side, but not uncommon given the trendy area.  good times!  valet parking as well as a lot is available.
