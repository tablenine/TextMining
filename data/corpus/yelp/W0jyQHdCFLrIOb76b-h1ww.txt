I really liked the Ramen here.  Looks like there a quite a few mixed reviews.  I do have to say this was my first experiance with Ramen so I don't have much to compare to but I devoured the whole bowl of what I had.  I think I went for the deluxe.  The staff was friendly and they worked hard to make our wait for a table as short as possible.
