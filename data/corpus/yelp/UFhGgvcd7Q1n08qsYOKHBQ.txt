Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Dive bar? hmmm not so much..more like a local Democrat hangout. But the food was good (chicken nachos),the service was great for dealing with a group of 15+, the drinks strong ( thanks Kathleen), the company quite decent (hey we were a bunch of rowdy/drunk yelpers that night!!) As Dio so poetically put it some of us should have gotten 1 star for un-yelplike behavior! But it was all in good nights fun! Plenty of well lit parking beside the tavern as well as across the street. All in all a fun UYE with our new community manager!
