Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Despite some popularity on Food Network I thought Orochan's ramen was only a little better than mediocre. Their spice style is pleasant, and can be deadly if you want, but the noodles were undercooked (not al dente - I mean undercooked). The ingredient quality was good, but not inspiring. On the plus side, portions are large and the noodles are better the next day after microwaving.. . Shin Sen Gumi is leagues better!
