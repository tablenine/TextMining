Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
They're known for their massive Manuel Special Burrito which I witnessed but did not partake in. It looks like it could feed about 5 hungry people. There menu consists of your typical Mexican fare, burritos, taquitos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. A couple interesting things to note "Burritos can be made up to 6 feet long when ordered 24hrs. in advance deposit required for boards/refundable upon of board with receipt." They also have a special Lent menu that has items such as Taqullos De Papa (potato taquitos served with rice &amp; beans) or Fajitas De Eamoron (shrimp with grilled onion, tomato, jalapeno &amp; colored bell pepper served with rice, beans &amp; tortillas).. . I ordered two tacos, one carne asada, which was your basic corn tortilla taco, and one pollo, which was deep fried. The carne asada was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had. The meat was beyond words, it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Piled high as can be, it really should have been two tacos. The onions and cilantro were the perfect accompaniments and just the right amount.. . The pollo on the otherhand was sub-par, the chicken was somewhat gamey, it was shredded and there was about 4 times the amount of cheese then needed to be. Had I not order this abomination I would have had a much much higher opinion of El Tepeyac. The chips were good and they served a green and a red salsa, both were good but nothing to write home about.. . I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.
