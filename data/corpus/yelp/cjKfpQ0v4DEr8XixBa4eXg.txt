Toast is definitely a scenester-y place for brunch, no doubt about it.  But on a recent weekday evening my boyfriend and I were walking around the neighborhood, and decided to give it a shot for an early (around 6pm) dinner.. . There wasn't a wait in the least.  Not only that, but my simple meal exceeded my expectations and then some!  I had the garden salad, which involved a glorious excess of toppings, including garden burger strips, and was served in what basically was a mixing bowl.  Because it was so huge, my boyfriend and I shared the salad plus half of his smoke stack sandwich and still had a half sandwich leftover.  All of it was all really scrumptious!  . . The drawback to the experience was that halfway through our dinner the place started filling up with the sunglasses at night set and ceased to be as charming as it had been when it was half empty.   Oh and though they say they have Orangina it's really just a similar drink and not the real deal.. . Overall, though, totally cute place with the bonus of a couple couches on which to cuddle.
