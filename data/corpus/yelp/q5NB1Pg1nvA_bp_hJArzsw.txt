Even though i go here all the time... The garlic seeping from my pores this morning after is a screaming "review Me ! " . yes i did just quote my glands. or gland holes or . you get the idea. Anyway Versailles is one of those places for me where i could care less about the service.( which is never really bad ).  just get me that yum  yum in my mouth. that is all i care about. . so I used to get the garlic chicken. all the time every time. But now I've changed. let me tell you a little secret. ..and the secret is..............#25 Beef Stew. For serious the best beef stew ever ! you have to try it !  It comes with the plantains, rice and beans like most of the entrees. yum right? But listen to this here.... this is what you have to do. order a side of the garlic sauce. It's basically the sauce they use on the garlic chicken. it's spicy, garlicky..there's some lemon all up in there. So what you do is spoon a little of the garlic sauce onto your rice. let it soak it up. then put some beans on it. I call it flavor layering...... That with the beef stew,sweet plantains..and sangria.. ack ! it's so good.. . Additionally.. last night my friend ordered the avocado salad. which is for you if you love avocado because plainly...that's what it is. just a sliced up avocado with some raw onions. They give you oil and vinegar to dress it. she also had them bring her a plate of lemons to use with the oil and vinegar as a dressing. it tasted awesome !  salty..zesty and creamy... It's not pre-make out food if you know what i mean.
