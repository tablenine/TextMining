Restaurant: Kamehachi
Category: Sushi Bars
Gosh, my experience at Kamehachi was mediocre at best. I know I used to like it. Used to think it was the tops of sushi in Chicago, and I'm not a sucker for a fancy sushi joint either. Things were pricier than they should be for sure. Small plate of veggie tempura, $13.95? Weird. And eh. . The sushi itself was just average. I could go to a million cheaper places for average. I don't think I"ll go back.
