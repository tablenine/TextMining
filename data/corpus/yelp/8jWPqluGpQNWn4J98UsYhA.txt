Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
never fails. food is the b'z neez.. . staff is friendly..  I know it's probably because it's super super busy, but they need to bust the seats clean.  I was wearing shorts and had chicken stuck to my leg.. . who cares! I had roscoes chicken &amp; waffles!  . . scoes 1 or 2.... side of mac. . . that's it. game over. go. make a dream come true. . . ps. seating isn't as comfy as long beach though. I was pretty much in my neighbors conversations. . . who cares! I had roscoes!
