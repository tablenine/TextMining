Cute, rustic Italian outpost in the East Village. Cute in that it is a very small space with little wiggle room - as many restaurants are in the city. I met a friend here for dinner one evening. Seated at a high table situated directly under the speakers and in the main entrance corridor, we already felt a tad cramped, all the serving ware plus menus plus bread etc could barely fit on the tiny table. Luckily, we managed to consolidate a few things and mitigate the possibility of a dining disaster. To start, we ordered a lovely bottle of wine and split the Gorgonzola salad, which was a standard appetizer of this sort with the exception of very large leaves of lettuce. (I would recommend cutting them into manageable bite-sized portions). For the main meal, I ordered the gnocchi and my friend decided to try one of their pizzas (sausage and mushroom, I believe), for which they are famous. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! . . So in spite of the cramped space, the meal was great and service was average - not bad but not over the top memorable. The only really odd factor during the dinner was the stream of rap &amp; hip-hop hits from the past two decades BLASTING above my head from the speakers. Not the playlist you'd expect to hear at a rustic Italian restaurant, but considering there's a radio station next door, I guess you just gotta go with it...
