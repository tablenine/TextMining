Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So, why not just jump on the band wagon for this one?. . This was my second time trying this place.  I only came back because my friend's sister had never had it and she really wanted to try it.. . Tip: You really want to try this place? Go during the weekdays... cause if you go on a weekend, expect to wait 2-3 hours in a line.. . Anyways its a one time deal place, trust me.  The only thing I can say why these hot dogs are good is what they put ON the hot dogs.  Thats it.  . . So if you want a hot dog with more than just Kitchup and Mustard, then by all means eat here... but do it only once!
