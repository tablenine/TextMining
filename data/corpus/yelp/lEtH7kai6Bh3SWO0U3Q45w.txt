I was STARVING and this was one of the only food options available at the event I was at... the line was sorta long which I think was due to the slow service of the person taking the order.  Then I waited another 15-20 mins for the food.  Taking a bite I was so dissapointed.  My taco tasted like un taco de carne asada with some sort of sweet n sour/teryaki-ish sauce.  Nothing else on the menu seemed so appealing which is why I just got the taco (yes I only ordered one due to my skeptism). Overhyped taco!  . . Maybe the other things are good? I wont ever wait in line again to find out.
