Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I fear Kitsch'n suffered from too high of expectations for me. I love kitsch and I love breakfast food, so Kitsch'n has been on my Must List for a long time. But now that I've been, I'm in no rush to get back. The restaurant is cute, but the decor doesn't really live up to its name. It looks like any other diner in the city, but brighter. The service was spotty. Our waitress seemed to want to be anywhere else in the world, but the other people working were lovely. My food was good (I love that they had a veggie omelet with roasted red peppers and zucchini and other unexpected vegetables) but not great enough for the ten dollars I paid (+1 for egg whites, I admit). Overall, Kitsch'n is good, but unless you're in the neighborhood, there are better breakfasts to be had all over town.
