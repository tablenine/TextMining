We ate here on a Tuesday night and the atmosphere was relaxed and the service attentive but not overbearing. We opted to begin with martini's and a wonderful olive tapenade before moving to the soup. I got the creamy French onion, which was good, but my friend had the white bean with truffle oil and it was fantastic. I instantly wished I had chosen that instead..    For dinner I chose the duck confit and it was out of this world!!! I can not recommend this dish enough. My friend got the poulet rouge and it was good, but not as good as the duck. .     Be forewarned: the portions are gigantic, something I'm unaccustomed to in French restaurants. I'm a big guy and I couldn't eat even half of my dinner. Fortunately, it tasted just as good when I had the rest the next day. .    All in all, a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back.
