If you don't like the whole hollywood scene then yea you probably won't like this... at least this is what reminds me of when i first walked in, there were several large parties where people celebrating birthdays or events all glam'd up! The ambiance i would say is great, i love the decor and the whole trendy vibe, the 1.5 hrs we were there we experienced several pickup lines between the group of girls that were next to us and the guys across the floor... so it was quite entertaining as well. . The food i would say wasn't the best but GOOD!  I especially enjoyed Maguro Spicy Taru-Taru Crispy Rice, and Kobe Beef Carpaccio!  . . It was quite pricey for the quality, but i figure you are also paying for the ambiance and their excellent service!
