Restaurant: Lil&#39; Frankie&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Moved to the east village end of January and immediately claimed Lil' Frankie's as my neighborhood spot. This place has it all - AMAZING fresh and authentic italian food, a friendly and very chill staff, warm and inviting space and quite affordable. They have tons of specials that are updated constantly. The East Village Radio is right next door. A very respectable wine list. They are a sleeper contender for best pizza in Manhattan. What else do you want from me!?!?. . Only downside is they don't take reservations so on a weekend night you might find yourself waiting a bit. Definitely worth it.
