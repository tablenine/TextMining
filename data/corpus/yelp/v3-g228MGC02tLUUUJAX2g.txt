Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
I live a dual life.  I have an undercover persona by day (sorta... I am am more I guess in today's world "socially acceptable" by day WTF EVER!!!). . Anyway, because of the work I do, by day I hide the tattoos, dawn the glasses and look all professional and crap.  Because of that, I get taken to places like Hugo's Frog Bar which I guess is supposed to be impressive but is rather lost on me because if I am going to spend that much on dinner, I'd like a place that was a little more inviting to my real ego, not my alter-ego.... . But I digress... (as usual). . I've had the lobster here and I think it was cod.  One time when I was in my strict vegetarian phase, I just had broccoli as my dinner.  To be honest, I really wasn't that impressed.  The food wasn't exceptional, the service was REALLY BAD ( I mean wait, wait, wait for the waiter... I guess that is why he is called a waiter, huh?) and for the money, I think I could have a better meal with sides elsewhere.  . . I will say that the deserts here are HUGE (big enough and them some for two) and they don't skimp on the cocktails.. . When I rise a little bit more in the company and am paying for the dinners/lunches, this isn't the place I'm taking folks.  Too expensive and not worth it in my opinion.
