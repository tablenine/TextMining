Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe's is a hallmark restaurant well known by name and legend...so does it live up to the hype? The food was good and the overall experience was pretty solid. Thus I can honestly recommend the place if only to try once or to be able to bring your experience to the table when it inevitably comes up in conversation.. . When I went I wanted to go for what they were famous for so I got chicken with gravy and onions and waffles. The waffles are lovely but I personally prefer Belgian style, probably because that's what I grew up with. Chicken was solid and I liked the added addition of onions with the gravy. At close to $11 it seems a bit steep but it is a lot of food that tastes pretty good.. . Final thoughts: Definitely check this place at least once, and maybe it will strike a cord with you and you'll become a regular. At the very least you can say you've been to this famous restaurant and experienced the wonderful combo of fried chicken and waffles. For me, it's nothing special but it's a neat place to get a meal.
