Such good cuban food for such a good price.  There are several locations and all kind of look like a hole in the wall...which actually gives them their character.  The garlic chicken is SO delicious.  Just make sure you don't order it on a first date or if you have a big meeting the next morning cause your breath is guaranteed to be overwhelming from all the garlic and onions in your meal.  But it's well worth the stinky aftermath.
