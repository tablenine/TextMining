I have been here a bunch of times now and I am happy to be able to pick anything off the menu (vegetarian).  The food is good (not great) but definitely good.  The beverages are AMAZING.  Mmmm...spicy hot chocolate.  . . Service...hit or miss.  The last time I was there we had a totally unattentive 'I'm prettier than you' brunette barbie who was wildly unpleasant.  We waited a long time too.. . Worth checking out.
