Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I recently paid my first visit to The Apple Pan. The atmosphere was much more welcoming than other burger hot spots like the original Father's Office in Santa Monica. Snagging a seat at the counter didn't prove too difficult, even though the restaurant was packed during dinner. My friend and I watched the orders being cooked and were convinced that the secret menu had much more to offer than we thought, and the waiter told us we were wrong. . . We both ordered hickory burgers, which were great. The flavors weren't disguised by all the bells and whistles that other burger joints have. The burger, for me, was between the quality of In-n-Out and Father's Office. I will definitely be going back.
