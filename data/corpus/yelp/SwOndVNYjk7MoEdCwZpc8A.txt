Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
So the breakdown is that it's a tiny shack glued on to the side of an auto mechanic shop. A couple tables and stools, salsa bar, strange local art for sale on the walls...I don't know..... . The food is legit though ! There are two menu items ( Fish Taco and Shrimp Taco), some little cookie type item in a glass dish by the register, jamaica , horchata and assorted canned and bottled soft drinks in a cooler.. Your fish and/or shrimp is battered and cooked a foot in front of you, gently rested onto fresh tortillas and served for you to go make a mess of them at the self serve salsa bar. I think on a given day there are about 5-6 different kinds of salsa, bowls of freshly shredded cabbage and "sour cream" that comes out of a bottle with a pump top and has the consistency of milk (Don't get me wrong, It's a must of you like your salsa on the spicier side). I usually tend to get 2 or each when I go there and a jamaica &amp; I am always stuffed.... . It's a really simple joint packed almost every time I've been there. Friendly staff. Good eats for under $8... Can't really go wrong. . . NOTE: This place is CASH ONLY.
