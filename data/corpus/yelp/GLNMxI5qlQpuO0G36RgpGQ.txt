Restaurant: One Midtown Kitchen
Category: American (New)
I ususally love concentrics restaurants, but this one was a bummer for me.  Granted, I was there right before Christmas which is one of the busiest restaurant seasons, but I'm still paying full price.  Keep in mind that I'm in my mid 20s when i say this, but it was so loud that conversing with the other members at my table was difficult.  . . Service was terrible.  Our server was friendly, but she clearly had to a section that was too large to handle.  . . When our food FINALLY arrived, half the table's order was wrong.  The food arrived at the same time to the table next to us, but they too only received half their orders.  It turned out that our incorrect dishes actually belonged to the table next to us.. . Now, I have worked in the restaunt business for almost a decade, and the rule is the once food is left at the table, it is dead and never can be re-served.  I know for a fact that those plates left our table, went to the kitchen for one minute, and went right over the table next to us.  There's no way they could still be warm.. . All that aside, the food was just okay.  It certainly isn't as good as the other concentrics restaunts.  Although I will say that I love how they serve half size wine glasses which is perfect for me.  I'm not going to rush back any time soon.  I'd rather get a good take out.
