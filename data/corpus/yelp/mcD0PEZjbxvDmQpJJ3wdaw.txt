Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
gonna keep this brief: cash only. good prices. fresh fish. keep it simple, stupid (ie...no fancy schmancy rolls), attentive service, reasonable wait time, near giant robot, and close to beard papa where you'll have to go to get your dessert since hide doesn't have any.
