Theresa B. and I got together for a lil catch-up time at this quite lil cafe. I have to say that it seemed a bit out of place, as it appeared to be an old historic building. We decided to sit outside under one of their big trees in the front, and small leaves/flowers were constantly falling in our food and tea during our meal. Highly recommended for the shade, but not for meal time..... . You basically order your meal inside and the waitresses/waiters come out with your oder.. . I ordered their salmon potato pancake dish: pieces of smoked salmon on top of two potato pancakes with two poached eggs. Yum....I tried a little of Theresa B.'s salmon quesadilla, and thought it was just ordinary and the smoked salmon was a lil salty.. . The best part of the meal has got to be the dessert. I had their red velvet cake, and it was just delicious! It was a pretty big piece, as it better be worth the $8 price tag. Theresa B. had one of their cupcakes, and it was a bit dry for my liking.. . Definitely a nice place to have a relaxing lunch/brunch with some good friends...
