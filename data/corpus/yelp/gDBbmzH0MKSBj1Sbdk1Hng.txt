After all the hype I was expecting something really great here. After the 45 minute wait 6 of us were put at a table for 4. Now I love small places and do not mind cramped but this was nuts. Then to top everything off our waitress was the most rude and uncaring waitress I may have ever had. No listen I am not a picky person, if anything I am commonly known as the person who loves everything. But, I would rather have a burger from Moody's or BK. Sorry for the price and horrible service I will not be going back without some type of great incentive.
