Loved this place! Went for a friends birthday and had a little bit of a wait since it was a friday night, nothing out of the ordinary for a Friday night. Right when I walked in, I was in love! It had the whole NY lofty feel to it. I instantly felt like I was no longer in LA. The food was decent, nothing amazing but worth it for the price. My favorite dish was the fried mushrooms. All in all, it was a nice experience and I would definitely go back!
