Spectacular view of LA and romantic because of it. I wouldn't say the food is spectacular though. The food is "just okay" all the more because you have high expectations going in, with the restaurant's high prices, an inventive sounding menu, and the nice presentation of the dishes. Also, this is a personal preference, but I found the whole imitation palace thing with the gardens, gong, etc., cheesy and a bit much. It gives the restaurant a "theme park"-ish feel to it (goes well with Hollywood at the foot of the hills) but if you're looking for an authentic Japanese atmosphere, this is not it.
