Went there for Sunday Brunch, Amazingly good!!!!  Their distinct, organic Bloody Mary's are only $5 and very very tasty. . I had their Chilaquiles, wow, they are very satisfying and they had just right amount of heat.  Good move on my part.. Also, one of us had their Granola Pancakes, WOW.  Were those amazing, huge!  and very very very good.. . I highly recommend making reservations for this time, as it is a popular place.
