Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I have never been to Pinks when there has been a line longer than 10 minutes. I used to work down the street so we would always ditch out of work at 11:20 and get there right before the lunch rush. The dogs are ok... good for a quick bite and definitely filling. Not exactly a quality hot dog, though the toppings make up for it. I wont bore you with the menu because we'd be here for hours, but the menu would get 5 stars by itself for being creative and daring. I dont think I'd go there and stand in the hour line, as the food is just not that satisfying, but this is definitely a Hollywood landmark and its all about the hype... so tourists, just enjoy the experience and take a lot of pictures!
