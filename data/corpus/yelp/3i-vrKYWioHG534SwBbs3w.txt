I do enjoy the variety of food from different areas, especially if someone is craving Chinese and another craving Thai.. . My experience at the Joy Yee's in Evanston and on Halsted by UIC were decent. However, there is one incredibly rude waitress in the Chinatown location. Kind of an older woman, who seemed like she was the manager or something, but she very mean and even cursed us out in Cantonese (we had a few people who could understand) when we asked her for separate checks...
