Getting a nice greasy heap of food for cheap... is usually what makes me happy =). . . but i decided to be a little crazy and go for TENDER GREEENS. the name alone would have made me shudder in my younger days. but now, at a ripe age of 22, i feel i must be somewhat sophisticated, mature, and healthy i guess. . . i got a hot plate of steak slices, mashed potatoes, a piece of garlic bread, and caesar salad side for ~10 bux. the bread was pretty rock-hard, so I'll be trying the sandwich option next time. but all in all, it was pretty damn tasty and by the time i was done, i was quite satisfied and felt like i had something good.. . can't say ima give up my fatty faves, but I will definitely be coming back here again.
