Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
Lovely service, and even on a cold wintery night, the spacious dining room was cozy, warm and inviting. And as the dinner crowd filled in the room, it never got too noisy. Good crowd of eaters, not yellers!. . The two of us shared a couple salads (Persian and Mediterranean), bread, falafel, chicken kabob, couscous, shami - it was all so wonderful. The great thing about eating at Reza's, I have found, is that everything on the menu goes with anything else - the flavors are so complimentary - they match so well!. . A couple of nice drinks, and some lovely service by a dear calling us "dear" capped of a wonderful dinner!
