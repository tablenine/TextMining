Best Cuban ever (though I haven't been to Miami, or Cuba for that matter)! Everybody loves the potato balls, though I find them a little mushy. I prefer the chicken empanadas as far as appetizers go. And they're only like 85 cents! I've only ever had the medianoche sandwich for a meal, because it's so great. And the slices of cake are so cheap! It's like $3 for a slice of flourless chocolate cake that would be $8 anywhere else.. . Only problems are it's always packed and not open that late.
