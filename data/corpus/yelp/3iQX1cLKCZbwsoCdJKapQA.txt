Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
This is the best hidden gem of a restaurant in all of Chicago.  The food is fresh &amp; authentic, the service is personalized (thanks to Victor!), and the margaritas will knock you on your...well, you know!  Just this summer, they doubled the size of the place by adding a cozy patio in the back -- a great addition to the al fresco dining areas of Chicago.  Make sure you stop by Tuesdays or Thursdays when all the margaritas are half-off -- and tell Victor I sent you!
