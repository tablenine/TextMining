so, this weekend i decided i wanted to embark on the "Great Cupcake Hunt."  I went to a bunch of cupcake places on a search for the cupcake that would be able to dethrone the awesome cupcakes at Joan's.  A couple places came close, but none could topple the reigning king (or should I say queen) off the proverbial cupcake hill.. . my favorite cupcake in los angeles is the chocolate marshmallow filled cupcake at joan's.  this a moist, cakey, not too dense chocolate cupcake with chocolate ganache topping and a whipped cream/marshmallow filling.  its what a hostess cupcake aspires to be when it has dreams of grandeur.
