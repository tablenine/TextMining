To be honest the food was awesome, i had the creme de la creme french toast and it really satisfied my sweet tooth. i also tried the golden ticket and the black magic pancakes which were good however the black magic was a bit dry. . . Also the fries were good, it really helped offset the sweetness of the pancakes and freach toast. the only thing i didnt not like was the long wait which kinda killed the whole experience. from start to finish our meal took a total of about 2 hours. (sat morning). . so though the food was awesome and service was relatively good the wait really killed me, but i wont hesitate to go back just as long i have so extra time
