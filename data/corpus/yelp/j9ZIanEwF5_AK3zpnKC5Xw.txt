Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I think it's been a few years since the first time I heard of Roscoe's. I must admit, when people told me about it and how good it was, I was ... scared? Well, not really scared, but it sounded like a place I didn't want to try. So for years, people told me to try it out, and I've been to SoCal quite a few times in that few years.. . Last weekend, I tried it out. I was in SoCal with the boyfriend, and he REALLY wanted to try it. So, I figured why not? And I didn't want to hold him back, haha. . . We chose the Pasadena location since we were staying in Arcadia over the weekend. When we sat down, I already knew the food couldn't be too good for you - it's almost like you can smell the fat in the air.. . Looking at the menu, there really are no healthy options - but what did I expect. I ended up ordering the Big Mama's plate (I think that's what it was called) - Eggs w/Cheese &amp; Onions &amp; Biscuits and Gravy. BF ordered the Chicken and Waffles.. . I must say, the chicken and waffles is pretty darn delicious here. Yummy fried chicken, and I was surprised at how good the waffles were! Probably one of the best waffles I've had. After taking a bite out of my BF's plate, I realized that chicken and waffles is strangely a really good combination.. . My order was also really good. The eggs were practically drenched in a cheesy sauce with onions in it - yum. Biscuits and gravy were also good, but not the best that I've had. . . I've gotta say, Roscoe's is really good! They also have this energy drink called the Pit Bull, which my BF loved... Now he wants to figure out where he can buy them. I also liked there cool drink combos. I had an eclipse - part lemonade, part orange juice, part fruit punch... mmmm.. . Although it was so good, I did feel pretty heart attack prone the rest of the afternoon.
