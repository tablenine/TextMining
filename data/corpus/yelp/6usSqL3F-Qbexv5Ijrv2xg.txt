came here in september 2009 for a celebratory dinner with my husband.  we didn't have reservations so we had to wait awhile for a table, but we just sat at the bar and had drinks, it was no problem for us.  the hostesses and bartenders were very nice.  we finally got our table outside and it was very cozy and nice.  our server was very helpful since at the time i didn't know much about french or contemporary cuisine, he explained what things were to us.  i had a delicious ravioli (vegetarian) and my husband had a roast beef type of ravioli which was delicious.  the begin we had the caprese which was the most expensive caprese i've had to date, but also the most delicious.  to end, i had the white chocolate mousse, which was AMAZING!!!!! and my husband had the cheesecake which he loved.  overall, great dining experience.  oh yes, and it was a friday night.
