Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you want an over the top hot dog, this is the place to go. I'm not a big fan of the chili dog, or their original hot dog, but their specialty dogs? OH SO GOOD! Their Planet Hollywood and the Ozzy Osbourne dog are my favorites. Not only do they top their dogs off with a whole lot of ingredients that you just can't fit it into your mouth without smudging a bunch of cheese sauce or guacamole on yourself, but the combinations of the toppings equal heaven.. The wait for this place could take up to 2 hours or more, but believe me, the wait is worth it!
