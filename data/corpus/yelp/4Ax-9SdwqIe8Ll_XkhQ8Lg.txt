I might be adding to the craze, but I do have a sweet tooth and this is a great place to soothe it.  I've only had two ice-cream sandwiches here.  The first time, I had the ladybug and that is a yummy strawberry sorbet sandwiched between delicious macarons (french almond cookie).  The second time, I had the grasshopper, which has mint ice-cream, which I didn't like as much because it tasted a bit like toothpaste.  We'll see what my third tasting will be!
