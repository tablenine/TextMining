Restaurant: Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery

I love almost every place that has outdoor seating, especially rooftop.  Rock Bottom is certainly no exception.  It has great beer, and I'd recommend getting a pitcher, as per glass can be quite pricey.  . . Tried the Watermelon Mojitos last weekend, which were AMAZING.  The only downside is that plastic cups are small, filled with ice, and cost $9 each.  Next time I'll stick with just beer.  . . Also ordered the hummus appetizer, which I thought was a decent portion and was pretty good.. . I dream of living near by and walking over every night for some beer on the rooftop terrace.
