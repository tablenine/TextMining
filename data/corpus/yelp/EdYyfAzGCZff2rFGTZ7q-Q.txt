Total orgasm in my mouth!. . Savory, innovative and elegant. My dinner was:. . 1. Grilled Octopus Salad - to die for!.   - This was the best non-lettuce salad I have ever had..   - The octopus wasn't rubbery, the dressing was perfect, and I won't say anything else because you have to try it yourself.. . 2. Burrata from the Mozzarella bar - the freshest mozzarella with crispy bacon. . 3. Grilled Quail - tastes like brown sugar and not a lot of mini bones. . 4. Fresh Ricotta with egg - the raw egg delicious with the butter sauce. . 5. Rosemary cakes - omg!. . 6. Almond nougatine with chocolate cake - omg!. . Bill: $160 (includes bottle of Pinot Grigio from their ONLY Italian wine list). . --- Best experience ever!
