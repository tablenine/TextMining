Restaurant: Wasabi
Category: Sushi Bars
Here at Wasabi, sushi is exactly what it should be - expensive, with plenty of that wonderful melt-in-your-mouth feeling (meaning = fresh!). My friends and I each ordered a couple of rolls, plus some warm sake. Everything was top notch quality; you could tell they didn't use cheap rice or fish. The plates and presentation was also very nicely done. . . What else? First, there was minimal parking - either you can risk your car out on the street, or use valet parking (not free) in the back. Second, the place is tiny, dark, and not very loud - I guess a good date Â location. And lastly, the service was just meh, which was surprising because there weren't that many customers to manage anyways due to the small size of the place.
