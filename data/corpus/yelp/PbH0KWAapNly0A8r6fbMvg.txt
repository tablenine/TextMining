after all that i have heard about this place i finally hit it up.  stood in line with the local skinny jean wearing hipsters for about 20 min and ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage and the Louisiana hot link sausage, some fries and a couple of brews.  we took our number and walked towards the back where all the seating is.  this place is really neat and architecturally interesting.  modern and industrial.  anywho our food arrived and we both just smiled.  the fries - really good with a couple dipping sauces.  the sausages - WOW.  i had the hot link and my buddy had the snake...we passed them back and forth and shared.  both were so good and packing a real flavor punch.  worth the drive from my south bay beach bubble to the crazy la la land downtown
