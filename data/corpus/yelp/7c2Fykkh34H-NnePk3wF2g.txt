I ate dinner here last Saturday for the first time with J, T and F. While T and F have eaten here before, it was me and J's first time. And it was... DELICIOUS. I am so glad they took us there! F and I had the sangria, which was pretty good although I've had better (and worse). T ordered the Salvadorian beer. All of us had the pupusas (pork and cheese, cheese, and cheese &amp; herb) and they were amazing. The slaw that comes out with it was delicious. We also shared two entrees, Â the carne adobada (pork) and camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp). Both dishes were very good and flavorful. The tomato based sauce that came with the carne was mild yet full of flavor. I was expecting the sauce to be spicy, but it was surprisingly mild and it complimented the carnitas very well. The garlic shimp was buttery and full of garlic. If you love garlic, as I do, you will love this dish.. . The staff was extremely friendly. It felt like they were welcoming me into their home and was going to feed me till I popped! And, that, they did! The space is small, but I feel that is part of the charm. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food was well worth it.
