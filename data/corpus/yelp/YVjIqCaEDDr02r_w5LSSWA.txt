Sorry dudes, but I don't get it. I wanted to like this place b/c the wait is way shorter than it is at Daikokuya and the portions are big. BUT I didn't. Sad times. I got the miso ramen spice level #4 and my dining companion got salt ramen spice level #1. My miso ramen was meh. The noodles were well cooked, but I didn't end up drinking any of the broth cause it wasn't tasty even though it was laden with MSG. And I love my MSG. . . My dining companion said that the salt ramen #1 tasted weiiirdd but was adequately spicy. I guess if you had to have some spicy ramen it wouldn't be so bad to have it here. Packaged spicy ramen is a pretty good alternative though. . . 2.5 stars, but I rounded up to 3, as the wait, portions, and service were adequate.
