Category: Bakeries
Alcove is always a favorite stand-by. I love that it offers good out-door dining, good dessert, and a lot of choices. All the salads and sandwiches are delicious.. . Have been coming here for a couple of years now and I am never disappointed. . . Good place to meet friends or a casual first date.
