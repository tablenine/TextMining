Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Initially, I was underwhelmed by the legendary French dip at Philippe's.  I've driven by the place a million times, been intrigued by the sign's claim, but didn't get around to going there until last Sunday.  . . My buddy Gary and I spent a few hours at LA's central library checking out all the artwork there.  (You haven't lived until you've stared at the Dean Cornwell mural for an hour, humbled.)  Afterwards, I suggested we get a quick bite and Gary suggested Philippe's.  I was like, "Cool!" and off we went.  . . I was surprised to find the place packed at 3pm on a Sunday.  We parked easily (one spot left in the lot!) and inside we waited in line for about 10 minutes.  The young lady who served us instructed us to put our money on a little floral plate.  Since they make the sandwich right there in front of you, they don't touch the dirty money.  I was again surprised to find that they pre-dip the sandwiches.  I didn't know about that, but I went with it.  When in Rome and all that.  . . The sandwich was (another surprise) fairly small.  I guess I'd gotten used to deli French dip sandwiches that have half a cow in them.  This was like school cafeteria French dip (and the restaurant was only slightly better than a cafeteria).  And it was strangely comforting.  I dug in and at first I thought, "It's okay."  Then Gary said, "Try the mustard."  Ah....that's the secret.  The combo of the light au jus dip, the slightly fatty beef, and the hot mustard was just heaven.  The sandwich was gone before I knew it.  . . Now, even though I liked the mustard, I have to take away a star for the sandwich's reliance on it.  The French dip ought to be good on it's own.  Another half star off for not being in control of my dippage.  . . Overall, a solid 3.5 stars.
