Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
5 stars. Yes. Count 'em all. When I'm not AT Jerry's, I'm THINKING about Jerry's. The minute you walk in, you know this place is good news. I love the high ceilings, ala Old Oak Tavern (which I also love) and the bar area is pretty dramatic in a fuck yea kind of way.. . I've never had one of their sandwiches listed on the menu. Those are for suckers (although, they look really good). I always opt to create my own. Fuddruckers style, except Jerry's offers the most amazing ingredients and condiments known to man. I always go a little rogue when brainstorming what to put on my sandwich. But the wait staff are pretty friendly and have many times been my Tim Gunn to edit the way into good times. . . Yes! Eat here! Make your own sandwich. Make sure to put jalapenos on it. Tell them Imran K. told you to.
