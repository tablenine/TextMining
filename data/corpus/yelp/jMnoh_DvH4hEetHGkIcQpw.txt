Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Excellent!  Fresh fish, fresh and crisp shrimp, all fried to perfection and made to order.  They have a salsa bar so you can put everything to your liking.  The hot salsa, by the way, is pretty hot!  The horchata is quite nice, and the service is friendly.  The best part about this place though is the price!
