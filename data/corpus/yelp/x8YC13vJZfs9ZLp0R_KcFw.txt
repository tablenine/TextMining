Restaurant: Marlow&#39;s Tavern
Category: Pubs
Props to Marlow's for having Strongbow beer!-my 2nd favorite.  But the Tavern in the name is misleading, I think. It's a notch above what you would think a Tavern is.  I also wouldn't call it a pub.  Their menu is a little more sophisticated.  No chips and salsa or queso.  Instead they have queso soup and other soups of the day.  Instead of nachos, you have shrimp and crab "nachos."  Instead of dip, you have hummus...not your ordinary tavern menu..but all pretty tasty.  The only thing I wouldn't order is the salad. I've had better in Midtown.  There is a parking garage, but it's hidden around the corner.  Also, try to sit in Darrin's wait area. He's the est!
