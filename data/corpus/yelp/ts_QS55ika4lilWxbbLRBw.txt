ummm...first of all, i don't think i have ever had a bad experience from this place. . . I tend to go for their egg benedict and french toast. their generous portion certainly satisfies the hunger. Taste is good, and service is wonderful. Wanna people watch? It's a good place to do that too!!!. . BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT, they dont accept reservation. And what do you get for good food but no reservation? Be very prepared to wait for at least 30 to 45 minutes to get seated. ALSO, no dinner available. . . ooooo, yummy yummy breakfast!!
