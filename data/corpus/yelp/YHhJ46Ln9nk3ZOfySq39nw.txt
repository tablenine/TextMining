Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
After a briefly sour experience with trying to sit on the patio (they refused to let us move two empty tables that were about 4 feet apart next to each other so that four of us could sit outside), we had an AWESOME BBQ experience here last night.  . . I am by no means a BBQ connoisseur.  But the BBQ that came out of the Smoke Daddy kitchen last night satisfied me to the fullest extent possible.  For $15.95, I got a combo platter with super juicy pulled chicken and thick flavorful pulled brisket, both served over a slice of white bread to soak up all the juices.  Two sides, tasty green beans and a generous crock full of creamy mac &amp; cheese.  If I weren't capable of rising to this gluttonous occasion, I definitely could've worked 2 meals out of this order.. . Everything on the plate was delicious.  But it wouldnt've been complete without the trio of BBQ sauces that you can lather your meal generously with.  Everyone likes a different one... but for me it's the sweet 'n spicy mustard bbq sauce with just the right amount of heat that sets your taste buds alight without making you gasp for air/water/cornbread etc.. . It's not exactly close to where I live but I can guarantee I will be making the trip out here for some more bbq in the near future.
