Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This is one of my MUST VISIT places in Taiwan, so when I heard about its location in the US I was ecstatic!  Well, the food is good, but it's not nearly as good as the original Din Tai Fung.  Something is missing... the flavor, the ingredient (I was expecting to get those "dark bone chicken" in my soup, not regular, dried white chicken meat!), the hustling and bustling of international crowds dropped off by tour buses ... Ah, time to visit Taiwan again.  :)
