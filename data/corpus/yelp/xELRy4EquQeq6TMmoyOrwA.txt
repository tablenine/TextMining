Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
My three pence: Natural, Healthy, Diverse.. . Natural: All ingredients at Tender Greens are organic and locally procured. Also, this place makes any vegetable look amazing. I always drool (not literally, because they are also very clean) over every veggie I see.. . Healthy: Because the ingredients are all natural (even in their bottled drinks), you are eating a healthier meal. In turn you don't feel terrible after eating here. . . Diverse: Anyone can eat here: vegans, vegetarians, omnivores, and meat eaters. The full size salads are bigger than your head. Each salad is personally hand tossed so every bite is a well-rounded one that burst with flavor. If you don't like tender mouth watering angus steak, then you can get the Â flavorful juicy chicken, or the seared tuna.. . My favorite items are: flank steak sandwich (complete with grilled red peppers and a slight dab of mayo), the spinach simple salad (goat cheese and hazelnuts are my heaven), and the roma tomato bread soup.. . What I also like about Tender Greens is they have a weekly Specials Menu. It's a great way to be adventurous in a place that you trust. Also, if you are a dessert gravitron (like myself), then this menu will excite you with the weekly concoctions they bring in.. . Overall, Tender Greens is a place that delivers on taste, value and variety. I am never bored of this place with their wonderful staff and location.
