I am on a never ending quest for great Mexican food, especially fish tacos. I had heard mixed reviews about this place, from over priced to too crowded to small portions. . . I agree with the small portions part on the appetizers such as the queso and guac that was small but the guac was good and the queso was like a Velveeta cheese substance. The Ceviche Royal was AMAZING! I wish it had more chopped tomatoes but it was good. . It only had slices of the baby grape tomatoes with it. . . I got the fish tacos which were filling and good, the menu only offers the tilapia in the tacos as grilled but I thought I would ask if they could batter and deep fry them, I was in luck only on Thursday's and Sunday's do they deep fry the fish in the fish tacos, it was amazing and filling. I could only finish 1 1/2 of the taco's, my roommate had the ground beef enchiladas and she devoured the two and was stuffed. The side of pinto beans was also good. . . I highly recommend the margarita on the rocks, it was one of the best margaritas I have ever had! I was left wanting more of the salty lime goodness!! I recommend this place for a first date all the way to a family gathering or a birthday. It was very good and I will go back to try new dishes any day of the week!!
