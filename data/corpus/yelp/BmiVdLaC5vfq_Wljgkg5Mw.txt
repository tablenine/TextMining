I have to start off by saying the service here is absolutely fantastic but the cost and quality of food isn't really worth it.. . The chicken came out heavily seasoned but delicious, and the scallops were more filling then they appeared on a bed of corn and buttery fingerling potatoes. But I've had specials here (the catfish comes to mind) that was dry and kind of unappetizing. Their wine list is incredibly pricey however, and there's always a near-hour wait even on weeknights.. . It's been pretty hit-or-miss for me so I can't recommend giving Harry's son a shot knowing the high costs involved.
