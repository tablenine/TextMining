GOOD LORD, the wait takes FOREVER! Every time I've passed by this place, I've wondered why people would wait for such a long time to eat at this super crowded and dingy restaurant. . . Well this past Saturday, we decided to find out, braving the lunchtime crush, parking meter drama and some unexpectedly chilly weather. After a 45-minute wait, we were finally seated. After tasting the beef and the dipping sauces, I finally understood what all the hype is about, as other Yelpers have attested. . . But the one thing that put a damper on the whole experience for me was being rushed through my meal. I understand that this is supposed to be a quick eats for some, but, considering how long the wait is and the overall yumminess of the food, I would've liked to take my time and enjoy it. . . But this place is an assembly line and they have everything down to a science in terms of Â how people are seated, how things are set up, brought out and taken away...so that they can get you in and out as quickly as possible. So no time for enjoyment or savoring of any kind. You kind of just have to scarf things down and then enjoy your memory of it after the fact. Hope this fading memory is good enough to last me through next time's wait!
