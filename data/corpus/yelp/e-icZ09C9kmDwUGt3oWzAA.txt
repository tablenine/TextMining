Ever seen "Kitchen Nightmares"?  You know, it's that show where the host Gordon Ramsey makes his way from one failing restaurant to another trying  to make them successful.  In each episode he takes a trip into the refrigerator of the respective restaurant and unearths disgusting things like slimy vegetables, cockroaches, large pieces of green pork..., I think Delicatessen would be a great next stop for Mr. Ramsey.  . . After gearing up for a delicious mini meal of mussels in a white wine sauce and french fries, my boyfriend and I waited to be served.  What came out certainly looked like mussels, but upon swallowing my gag reflex triggered and I realized these mussels were not only old, but half way to rotten.  Just to confirm, I asked my boyfriend to smell the dish of mussels.  Mussels should smell salty like the sea and like the sauce they are cooked in, these mussels smelled like a dirty fish tank.  After one mussel each, we called the waiter over and he apologized, took the food back, and told us the meal (two cokes and fries) was on the house.. . When you see Delicatessen you know it is not going to be some amazing restaurant.  It's so hip and styled that you know it couldn't possibly have good food.  We knew this upon seeing it, but thought: It's rainy, we're hungry, and this is a fun people watching atmosphere, so let's eat a little something here.  I've been to other restaurants like this and while they haven't been great, they've been fine for the moment.  This place is scarily unconcerned with the food they serve and is a dangerous place to eat.  If you don't want food poisoning, don't eat at Delicatessen.
