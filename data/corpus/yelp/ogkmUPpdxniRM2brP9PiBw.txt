Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Been for lunch, dinner and dessert on seperate occassions. What did I learn? The only reason to go is for the gelato. The food, especially at lunch is mediocre at best. Their sandwiches are gross... they're dry, somewhere between warm and cold, and just overall un-appetizing. . . Dinner was Ok, but I hate going somewhere and spending $60+ bucks for two when I know I could have cooked it better myself at home for $20 bucks (including a bottle of wine.) . . The Gelato. Amazing. Dessert- ONLY people. Write that down.
