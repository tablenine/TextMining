The first time I was here, I know a different Bret but his name is Brent, who suggested this place only if you are a milkshake fan. He's a friend I met from Mike and Kolbe. Very good people in my opinion.. . I first did not know what to order because my eyes were so big, I really wanted to try all of it. I ended up ordering "The MILKIE Way Malt". The ingredients is what sold me on this item. I love malts and they included 3 chocolate covered malted balls on top of my order. We just ate lunch and stopped here for dessert. I was sooooo full and still wanted more after I finished.. . The second time we came here, I remember seeing a lot of food items like salads and sandwiches. I really wanted to try other items on the menu besides the dessert. Again we were here for dessert so I wanted to try "The Blondie" thinking it is another shake or something. You should have seen the girls behind the counter. They kept asking each other, can we do that? What did he order? They then placed a white chocolate blondie which happens to be a big ass cookie on a plate and about to serve up a scoop of ice cream. I asked them what this was because what caught my eye was the white chocolate and I was thinking shake. I was a man with a clouded mind with white chocolate on the brain. I ended up changing my order to the "Banana Peanut Malt" which I don't remember tasting any peanuts in it at all. I was happy to see malted balls in this order as well. . . Now I see an event that has posted for an open house on May 20, Tuesday from 5PM-7PM. Precisely the time I will be at work.. . http://www.yelp.com/ev.... . That's when I saw that I have not reviewed this place yet. Maybe I can take a day off on this day but until then, hope everyone enjoys.
