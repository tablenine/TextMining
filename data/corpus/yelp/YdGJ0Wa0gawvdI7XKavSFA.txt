good pho is very hard to find on the westside.  good pho that is open late is even harder to find around this city.  not only does pho cafe fulfill my craving, its modern decor makes me feel like i'm not at a typical pho place.. . my recommendations:. number 5 crepe as an apetizer if you're opting for something different than the cha gio or spring roll.. stick to pho tai or anything along with their beef.  although their pho ga's side sauce with ginger and herbs is delicious, their broth could use a little more flavor.. they're open until midnight, but beware of your surroundings because you might drive right past it since there is no sign in front.  and also beware of those parking spots across the street that are so high, your passenger can't even get out.
