Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
Came here with a friend who'd been once before and enjoyed it enough to go ahead without much time in between. We ordered the brioche french toast with blackberry jam, vanilla yogurt, fresh berries &amp; bananas, as well as the breakfast quesadillas with potatoes. Thought it would be a good mix of sweet and savory. Hot DAMN, it was the perfect balance of sweet and savory! The yogurt in the french toast just added a layer of texture not common to french toast and made it one of the best french toasts I've had. The quesadilla was delicious and the sliced avocado on top made me feel SLIGHTLY less guilty about the fact that i was stuffing massive calories into my mouth since some of them were full of the good fat. :) . . Their service was great, but we were also 2 of about 8 people in the restaurant at the time. It was a random wednesday after all. Added bonus: One of those 8 customers was Jason Statham! I'm a celebrity whore so anytime I get to combine a celebrity sighting with good food, I will always give the place that elusive 5th star.
