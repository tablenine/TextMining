So dispappointed!!  I had called this my all  time favorite restaurant previously for 2 x Id been there and now my boyfriend says we should Never go back.  Valentines day disaster.  We had 9:15 reservations...Had NO IDEA we couldnt order from regular menu .  Open Table didnt denote that.  Didnt get seated till 10.  Bad Serivce and worst of all whatl ittle food they served on the $$$$ Price fixed menu.... we didnt like!!   OH MY  I  loved it before.  I found out my  butterfish is literally that.  COD fish in Butter!!  and the Mahi Mahi was utterly BLAND.  The  service was so slow we didnt get desert till 11:45.... Who eats that late when not in Europe.  Bummer.  Sorry I cant go back  Too much competition for the same $$.  :(
