This is a 3.5 rating. I liked the fact that you could get breakfast all day. I'm def. a cereal for dessert kinda girl. They also had a really yummy looking french toast w/ a cornflake crust, which my friend got. I can't even remember what I had - and we were here only a month ago..I guess that's how memorable the food was. . . I do remember being squished into a booth in the back. I prefer booths to tables, but not when there's seven of us and my left leg is rubbing against my boyfriend's buddy the entire time. Not cool.
