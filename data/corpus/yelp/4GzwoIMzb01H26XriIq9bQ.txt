Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
This is my favorite Chicago deep dish stuffed pizza place. Emphasis on the stuffed part because that way Gino's East can still be a favorite of mine too.. . The stuffed pizza was exhiliratingly good and extremely filling. The cool thing was that I went on Valentine's Day (no, not by myself) and we grabbed the heart shaped pizza. The design was good but the thing that really made the evening special was the taste. I got sausage, mushroom and spinach. It was so good I ate almost 1/2 of the pizza in that one sitting. Then the fact that I'm only one person caught up to me. . . Giordano's is the place to go for the stuffed deep dish pizza. Oh and the appetizer of cheesey bread was pretty good too. The mozzarella was gooey and warm but it more sat on the bread versus being melted into the bread if you know what I mean. . . I really like this place, but what gives it the bonus star over Gino's is that they're open MUCH later and they're not too far from Superior.
