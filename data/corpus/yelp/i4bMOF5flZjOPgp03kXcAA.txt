Aaahhh, Fred 62.. you are so convenient, so open all the time, so sounding like a good idea, so close to my house, such a cool place to sober up, the staff quite friendly most of the time, but you've poisoned me twice now! I even returned after the first time because I am drawn to your late nite snacky zen like a little hipster moth and it's so hard to resist... but I must!. . At least the manager was really nice about the first poisoning and encouraged me to return on the house, promising to clean up the kitchen. Eventually I returned, was hassled about the validity of my story, had another tasty meal, and was not poisoned again until a long time later - totally different food items, and while the second time was nothing more than a brief and violent case Â of the sweats and shakes - nothing like the nasty jerk me out of bed exploding pain and nausea of the first time.. I've retired this place. I pretty much have a stomach of steel and am a regular devourer of just about anything, danger dogs, you name it. Not a fussy one here. Eat at your own risk, I say!
