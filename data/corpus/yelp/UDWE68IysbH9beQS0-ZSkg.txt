Restaurant: Radial
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Pros: Never a wait for brunch--even on weekends. Â Food is good, not great, but good. Patio seating. . Cons: Limited menu. TERRIBLE service. . . I would always try Radial when I actually wanted to go to Flying Bicuit because it is in the neighborhood and there is never a wait to sit. However, it may be worth it to wait at Flying Biscuit because you will make up that wait time at Radial when you add the wait for your server to make it to your table with water, the wait for your server to take your order, the wait for the server to bring your food, the wait to get your check.... You get the idea. And the food is better at Flying Buscuit.. . Helpful hint: Always take cash in varying amounts so that you don't have to wait for the change.
