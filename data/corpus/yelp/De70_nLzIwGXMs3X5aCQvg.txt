Restaurant: Osteria 832
Category: Pizza
What a great neighborhood restaurant for Sunday brunch. Unpretentious, good service and tasty food. I ordered the Osteria Benedict - poached eggs, cotto ham &amp; sliced pancetta on bruschetta bread &amp; topped with hollandaise sauce. A nice twist to traditional eggs benedict. Kid friendly, lots of parking, great outdoor patio. Winner.
