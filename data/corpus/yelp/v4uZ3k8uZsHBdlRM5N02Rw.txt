Went here for lunch with coworkers last Friday.  Al is hilarious, he fed each of us Baklava after we finished our entrees.  The portions are pretty big, and the food was pretty darn good.  We shared a mezza platter and it was awesome.  I had the chicken kabob, it comes with pide bread, rice, and a greek salad.  Other people in the group had the gyros and a falafel, they all said their food was fantastic.. . The only con is parking can be hard to find in that area.
