canter's is an LA legend. it's open 24 hours a day and been around for ages. sadly i just can't get into the food that much. i suppose it you are a big jewish deli fan then it's great. but i look for more in a diner type place. they have really yummy black and white cookies though. i'll give it that. and the atmosphere takes you right back to the 70s. it's not the best looking but it's awesome in it's own kitchy way.
