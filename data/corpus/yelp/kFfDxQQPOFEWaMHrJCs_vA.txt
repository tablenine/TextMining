i was a little skeptical about the korean and puerto rican food combo, but now i'm totally a fan! i had my first kimchi ever here and it was mouth-wateringly good. i loved the flavors. i also tried the really tender lemongrass chicken sammich. the bread-to-chicken ration was a little off but the flavors were delicious. my husband had the boricua sammich and it was awesome. we finished up with the mint brownie soft serve with toppings made by mindy segal of hot chocolate. there was nothing not to like here. i thought the prices were fine for what you get. i kind of wish there were servers, etc. but i didn't mind the counter ordering. while i do miss vella, this is one of the only replacements i can imagine that makes me okay with the change.. . must try: seasonal kimchi. . good to eat: boricua sammich
