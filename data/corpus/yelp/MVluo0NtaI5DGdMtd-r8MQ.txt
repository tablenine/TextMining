I've never eaten at a vegetarian restaurant because I'm not interested in eating regular food with substitute meat, but I would certainly pay for a unique dish of amazing vegetables I can't just get at the Applebee's. With that said, this place was everything I hoped it would be and more. They used vegetables in ways I've never experienced. It was filling and oh so satisfying. The chilled pea soup was beyond incredible. Cold soup? Yes please! I had the lemon spatzle as my entree and the strawberry shortcake for dessert. The entire meal was incredible. The staff was friendly, the service was prompt, the restaurant was beautiful, the food was fresh...in my 21 years of life, this dinner was the absolute best. I can't think of a single thing they could have done better. Even the pricing was reasonable. New favorite restaurant! I can't wait to go back.
