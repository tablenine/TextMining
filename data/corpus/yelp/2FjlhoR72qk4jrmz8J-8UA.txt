I've only been for breakfast on a summer weekend morning and it was lovely. The service was pretty good and my meal was as well. They serve Intelligencia coffee that they sell by the bag as well. The prices are a bit steep in my humble opinion but ultimately worth it. . . Would like to try for dinner.
