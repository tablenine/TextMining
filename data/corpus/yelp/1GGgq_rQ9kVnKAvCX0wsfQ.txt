Seriously, for $21 we had the most unique, delicious and inspiring brunch EVER. I can't believe this place is real! We went a little late in the day, and the wait was only like 15 mins, and they had fresh coffee for everyone waiting. Great start.. . I ordered the Polenta Hash. It was really like a completely new take on Eggs benedict (I know it wasn't mean to be, but that's what I thought). The fluffiest prettiest poached eggs laid on top of blocks of delicious, fluffy polenta, surrounded with sauteed veggies (squash, mushrooms, peppers), and a delicious green salsa-adobe-sauce thing. It was sooo interesting and everything was beautiful and well seasoned. It was totally not your typical eggs and pancakes and I think it was like $8 or something silly.. . My friend ordered the most gigantic, delicious plate of Chilaquiles. It was like $10 or something. Perfectly cooked black beans, delicious sauce, fluffy eggs. YUM.. . (Skip on the Bloody Marias. They are funky and smell like feet. But they let me send it back, so no harm there.). . Our server was this awesome Hispanic older man with a thick accent. He was very eager to please. I loved him! He forgot my side of Pico de Gallo after he told me that my order got lost, but I didn't mind. The charm was totally worth it.. . I can not recommend this place enough. I will definitely be back for more.
