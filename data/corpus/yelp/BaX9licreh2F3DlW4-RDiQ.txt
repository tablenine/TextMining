best burger i've ever had! the no substitutions is different but why would you want to change perfection? the beer selection is spectacular and the people there are all nice. great service and speedy. my friends and i love to have our thursday nights there! this place can't be beat if you want a great burger, great beer and a great relaxing time. also, try the mushrooms!
