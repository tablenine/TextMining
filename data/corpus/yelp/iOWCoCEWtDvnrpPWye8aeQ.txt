DELICIOUS AND WELL WORTH IT!. . BOMB MEAT, I tried EVERYTHING at the salad bar, and loved that the service was so nice! Came here for mine and my boyfriend's anniversary and I loved everything. Ate so much I was almost food-comatose when we left. Valet parker was even nice too to take our pic in front of the place, and made sure he got it centered and everything. Great place.
