Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Veggie Grill is amazing.  Anything that can attract vegans and non-vegans alike and leave everyone feeling satisfied is a triumph in my book.  The non-vegan idea of vegan food tends to be dirty hippies serving tofu which thankfully isn't the case here.  Veggie Grill looks modern and inviting with a bright green, orange and red interior.  The service is fast and ultra friendly.  The owners actually care about what their customers want and are very approachable.  The food is healthy but looks like fast food that most people are used to.  The Baja Fiesta salad (add Blackened Chickin) deliciously ended my lifelong hatred of salad.  And now they're testing out mac and cheese and nachos to make every vegan's life complete.  This place is as good as it gets for everybody, no matter what your food preference.. . ***Note to awesome Veggie Grill owners: open locations in Studio City and Los Feliz PUH-LEASE!  I ate at your West Hollywood location twice yesterday.  I take all my non-vegan friends there and they love it!
