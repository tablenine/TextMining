Perhaps my expectations were too high or I should have gone for dinner instead of brunch, but I wasn't that thrilled about this place.  It was a teeny tiny space and there was not much selection for brunch. I had the tortilla with a watercress salad, and shared the churros.  The tortilla was very salty (which seemed to be the trend in NY on that particular weekend), the salad was quite good, but a bit heavy on the dressing for my taste.  The churros were very nice and light, but the chocolate couldn't compare to the stuff I had in Spain.  All in all, a relatively mediocre experience.  I should note, however, that service was very lovely.
