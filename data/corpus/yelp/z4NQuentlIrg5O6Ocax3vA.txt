Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (New)
I moved into the neighborhood and I've been slowly making my way through all the restaurants in the area.  I've been to Houston's before, but in Manhattan Beach and a long time ago.. . Anyway, I really like this place.  The artichoke appetizer is rockin' and the steaks are quite good.  Oh, and any place that serves real bacon in their baked potato is going to go over well in my book.. . It's a chain and tends to be kinda busy on the weekends, but you can bet on a satisfying meal, good service and an end to the 'shitastic' day you may have had.
