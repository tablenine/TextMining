So, my review of this place was apparently flagged by 'someone', consequently removed and was given an excuse that, and, I quote "because it lacks a legitimate first-hand experience as a consumer.". . Yeah, whatever.. . If you must insist, here's my first-hand experience:. . First, plan on parking along Sunset. The strip mall it's in has limited parking all day.  Best to go on a Sunday to avoid paying for street parking. Why add an extra dollar or two on your bill? In this recession, yes, every fucking penny counts.. . Second, it has no store sign and only accepts cash (I wonder why). . Third, the place is long and narrow. Concrete floors, and, I must admit, it has a good interior. I won't actually mind stealing a couple of their clear glass globe  lighting fixture. It'll be perfect for my kitchen.. . Fourth, the menu is limited and occupies a half an A4, or is it A3, paper.  They do have, at the time of questioned first-hand experience, Taiwan Beer. . . Fifth, the place has a high turnover. You'll finish your food in 5 minutes flat and you won't even know it. Well, they gotta make money, you know?. . So, in the end, I'll say this again:. . I don't know about you, but eating in an Asian restaurant and noticing that you're the only paying Asian customer is a sign that it's a really bad Asian restaurant, then, I don't know what is. . . And yes, I'm Asian. Do you get it now?. . Once last thing.  Can everyone just lighten up? . . Here, have some bland, boring pho. I think you need it. . . Yes, 'you.'
