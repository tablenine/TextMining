My fiance and I took a ride up to Tank for dinner tonight. Most of our dining and going out takes place downtown, but we decided to switch it up after hearing great things about this spot and as we really enjoy Sushi Wabi, we were happy to hear it was affiliated with the same owners.. . We arrived at about 7:30 and were seated immediately. The dining room was sleek - kind of a larger version of Wabi, the crowd was pretty chill as well, which in our sometimes bubble of a world downtown, we forget there are some great neighborhoods in Chicago. . . We started with the shrimp and veggie tempura which was phenomenal, especially the two dipping sauces, the house salad which had a great spicy dressing (not the ginger dressing on most traditional Japanese salads) and some edamame which was to die for. We were stuffed before the sushi came out, but definitely powered through and housed it. We had a spicy tuna roll (standard fare, get one wherever I go) - it was tasty, but typical and COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED by the amazing Ocean Sundae roll which to be honest I dont even remember what was in it, but it had a phenomenal flavor and I wished I had an extra of those. We also had two pieces of Yellowtail sashimi which were very fresh and flavorful. My fiance isnt a very adventurous sushi eater, so she had a California roll which she said was up there with the best she's had. (Don't tell her I'm saying this, but I had no idea they could really be different from one place to the next). . Overall, the experience was great (save the service which was a bit slower than we would have liked, especially when trying to pay and leave) - but it was worth the drive up to Lincoln Square and I would definitely go back if I was in the area again.
