I was just at Agave about two weeks ago. I had the Peachtree Margarita. I am not usually a margarita drinker, but this has to be the best Margarita I have ever had. . . I had the Ranch Pork Shops, with the honey cidar greens. Delicious. Everyone enjoyed their meal. If it's a friday or saturday, make reservations. I saw friends there who had been waiting for 45 minutes when we arrived.
