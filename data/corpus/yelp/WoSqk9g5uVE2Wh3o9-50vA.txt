Aaaggggggggghhhhhhh ----- suggests drooling sound affect? Yes. I absolutely love breakfast... therefore, I absolutely love this place. . . Went here on a Sunday around 12:00 and of course we were in for a wait. A wait well worth what we were about to experience. The host was friendly and had no problem remembering our name when our seats were available. We took the option of sitting at the bar. I loved the set up! The old school diner style bars are great for conversing with people around you that you don't even know. Well at least that is how my mom sees it because our neighbors at the bar were her friends by the end of our meal. Gotta love we friendly Texans!. . Our server was not only handsome, but very accommodating. The guy didn't miss a beat. I freaking love great service! It just makes the experience go from good to over the top. . . I love that the coffee is french press. You get your own personal pot right next to you on the table. I will say that I didn't enjoy spending $5 for a small cup of OJ, but lesson learned. I always forget that restaurants charge so much for that stuff. My mom and I ordered our own items and then split them. I love having a variety and getting to try more than one thing in a visit. . . We had the Creme de la Creme French Toast. Graham cracker crusted french toast topped with creamy cheesecake drizzle and powdered sugar. Ahmmmmazing! Really sweet, of course! To balance out the meal we also had the My Soul Omelet. Steak, green chilies, jack cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guac on the side. The portion sizes were insanely huge! An order of cakes could seriously feed 2 people! The food was really, really good. The prices are high for breakfast food, but portion size makes up for it. . . I am so freaking excited about this place and returning soon. You have won my breakfast loving heart.
