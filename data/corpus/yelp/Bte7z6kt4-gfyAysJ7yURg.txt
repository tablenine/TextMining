The burger does taste great the way it is, but holy shit, is this place overpriced.  I went there with my girlfriend, we each got a burger, SHARED an order of fries, and we each got a root beer, and we walked out having dropped $50.  The burger is good, but not for that much dough.  Oh, and the douchebag quotient at this place is way too high for my blood--too many bros in their 30's wishing they were still in their 20's.  Way to loosen that tie, brah.
