Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
We met a couple of friends there last night.  Service was bright, smiley, and twinkley - very helpful.  . . The mixological cocktails were different and well made.  (I had a cucumber/minty gin chill with Hendricks, my wife had a fig newton creation with vanilla vodka.  Our friends' pear vodka/riesling vinegar/pineapple juice creation and white russian were also delicious, with a light touch.). . The noise level was enormous.. . The sliced meats weren't as tasty as I remember them from before.  I dunno.  Maybe it's on the pigs, maybe it's on Ford's, maybe it's on me.  The Humboldt Fog cheese was, of course, great.  (How can you mess up cheese?  I guess you could store it wrong.  But it's hard to mess up great cheese.). . Get the brussel sprouts cooked with little chunks of bacon.  Outstanding!  And wife's whitefish entree and my pub burger (with carmelized onions and blue (?) cheese) were nicely done.  The burger paired nicely with my second drink - a glass of Dolcetto d'Alba.. . I'm walking you through the food because it's the main attraction there.  Everything on the menu sounded great - everything.  It was really hard to choose.  That's how it's supposed to be at a restaurant.  (Some others have forgotten.). . Walking back to the car through the cute Culver City neighborhood was the final treat.  Lots of twenty-somethings sitting outside and congregating in wine bars.  The people looked relaxed and happy, not desperate.  Culver City has really turned around.
