This is a fun concept wine bar.  For someone who is a complete lightweight this is perfect.  You buy your card, pop it into the display, pick your wine and receive a 1oz pour.  Then do it all over again.  I saw wine pour prices ranging from $1.70 to $25.  After you taste the wine you can also buy a bottle if you would like.  The atmosphere is very chill and the staff is very helpful.
