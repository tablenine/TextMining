Came for a friends birthday relatively early (like 4pm) and I unfortunately had to work at 5, so no getting tipsy for me. That turned out to be a blessing because the drinks were pretty pricey for what we got. My rum and coke was alright, not worth the price though. Also got a beer that was on special (I forget what it was, but it came with an orange slice. Shows how classy I am). I got the crab cakes which were decent, I wasn't a fan of the tartar sauce they were served with.. . One interesting note is the insane amounts of hot sauce they have. I love spicy food, but I like it spicy with flavor, not just pure heat. A lot of their hot sauces were so hot it I didn't want to finish the piece of crabcake I dipped in it.. . Decent place, I'll skip on most of the hot sauce and the drinks, but the food is pretty nice.
