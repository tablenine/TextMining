Yummy! This place is great. The bread is awesome, so good and chewy that it always makes deciding between a sandwich and soup hard. The best part of doughboys however is the Red Velvet Cake, do not leave without tasting!. Everything I've had here is good, but the weird raisin apple flax seed pancakes (I don't know what I was thinking). Be aware that the salad portions on thier own are a bit small. So I think the best bet is the soup and salad deal which is very filling due to dough boys hearty soups. This place is def a winner.
