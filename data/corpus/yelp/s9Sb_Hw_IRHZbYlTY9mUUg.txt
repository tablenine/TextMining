I gotta echo what everyone else has said--I had the best french dip EVER here last night.  After everyone else's raves I knew it was what I was going to order and it didn't disappoint.  The roast beef was perfect--tenderly cooked and on a great roll with a horseradish sauce that actually had kick.  It was so good.   And totally improved my cranky, rain/snow induced funk.  The fries were tasty too, but I skipped most of those in favor of the salad.  Yes, the salad.  I live in a cold climate, and the lettuce here is southern california is enough to make me want to pack my bags and go west.  . Had a decent wine list, and enjoyed my bar tender suggested red.  I can't remember the name of it, but it was good.  . Definitely a nice atmosphere--the bar tenders knew everyone by name.  A good place if you are stranded in your hotel due to the weather.
