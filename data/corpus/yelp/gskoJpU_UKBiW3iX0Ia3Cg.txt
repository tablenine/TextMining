Good food but I'm afraid I have to give a 2 stars based on the poor valet service. It's a mandatory valet parking once you entered the parking lot and the rate increases hourly even the sign said $2.50 only. Do not park there. I'd rather pay more at a different parking lot without having to deal with their attitude.
