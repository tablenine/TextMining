Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
I was super excited to see that the grilled cheese truck was FINALLY coming to Mid-City and figured I'd take a nice study break for some delicious grilled cheese and tomato soup.. . I wouldn't, however, know what that tastes like. After waiting for 45 minutes, my friend and  I were told that they were cutting the line off at the person before us. There was no apology, no nothing. . . The truck had advertised on twitter that they'd be at their location from 12-2 so we showed up around 1:15, figuring that would give us plenty of time. At least if you're going to cut the line, tell people before they wait for 45 minutes.  I'll never go to the grilled cheese truck again.
