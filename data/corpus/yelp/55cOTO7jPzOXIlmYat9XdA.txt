Restaurant: Twisted Taco
Category: Mexican
No kids allowed; the best reason for parents and singles to go to Twisted Taco. Mixed between the Coyote Ugly bar and a restaurant from an old fashioned cowboy flick, this delicious Mexican inspired cantina serves burritos, tacos, chips, quesadillas, margaritas, beer, etc. Twisted Taco is open daily for lunch and dinner.  If you go around dinner time there is also entertainment including comedy, trivia, karaoke and HDTV for Sunday football.  Thursday through Saturday its party central with DJs spinning and just when you thought it couldn't get any better, there is actually a pudding wrestling competition coming up that men will definitely enjoy.         . . Check out Twisted Taco and try "The Mexican" nachos, "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" chicken taco and "The Alamo" fish taco.  The service has always been great.
