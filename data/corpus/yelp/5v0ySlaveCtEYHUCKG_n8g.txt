After helping my sister move to West Hollywood this weekend, she took us here as a thank you.  She raved about the beer selection, so I thought SUPER.  I must say it is great people watching!  There was a broad cast of characters in this place - lots of USC fans (for USC v UVA game - WAHOO...too bad we lost, but am I surprised...no), some dude who was smelling his shoe - it was a nice shoe, but not sure why he was smelling it and not sure what he was on, and of course, trendy hollywood peeps.  I felt totally comfortable walking in, sweaty from the move.  . . We sat in a cozy booth and I ordered the chili, sour cream, cheese and guac.  It was really good!  I also ordered a Delerium Tremens and unfortunately it wasn't cold enough to my liking and came in a bottle and didn't have the matching goblet.  Honestly, I wasn't that impressed by the beer selection.  . . I would definitely come back to this place if I was in the area and a good game or fight was on...hmmm...wonder if they show any of the good MMA fights...Kimbo!  Fedor!
