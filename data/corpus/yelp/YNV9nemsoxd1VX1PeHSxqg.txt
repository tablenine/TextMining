We went to Crustacean for my friend's Birthday. I booked ahead of time to get the main floor as there are 3 different areas. The hostess sat us in the noisy, cold, annoying live singer, lounge area instead because the birthday boy was wearing what she thought were shorts though they went far below the knee. When asked she said there is a dress code. But when I made my reservation they did not mention it. It started out as a disaster but the manager gave us a table on the top floor which was fine. We saw women in short skirts and children in shorts and Â men in t-shirts and sweats but my friend was targeted even trough he is a native of Vietnam and very stylish. Well we learned out lesson and next time will ask about dress codes.. . The service was great, the waiter and busboy were were very attentive. I was prepared for non authentic Vietnamese food and a high bill so it was no shock. Three of us split eggplant ragout, tofu springrolls, brown rice seafood dumplings, lobster and garlic noodles, rack of lamb, and angel hair pasta. It came to 200 dollars including tip (no alcohol, just sparkling water). We enjoyed all of the dishes (rich, tasty, sort of yummy average, small portioned and not especially healthy) and the atmosphere including floor coy pond but will never return because there are too many other restaurants that we like which charge less and are less pretentious.. . 5 stars for service. 3 stars for food
