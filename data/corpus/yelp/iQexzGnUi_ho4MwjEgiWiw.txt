I've been here on all types of nights. They have variety during the week, different nights for different tastes, even though it doesn't really get crowded until the weekend, where its a madhouse once midnight/1am comes around. Its nice during the day or weekday after work or whatever, its a really nice space to take in when its not shoulder to shoulder. I've been here with a class for grub and drinks, its a good place to bring a group and chit chat over sangria specials. The food is okay, not too much bang for buck but I do'nt really go for the food. Its a huge space, I'm sure people have mapped out the place, but its got 3 bars: one by the outdoor tables (which are still okay in the winter because of the gigantic space heaters), one by the main entrance that wraps around, and one in the more pubby looking dance space in the back. They can really pack it in, I've never had a problem getting in because truthfully, they turn down so many NYU underclassmen its not that long of a wait. But its almost not worth it because when you get in, its seriously packed around the bars and if you're at a table you're lucky because its the only place to get space. lots of brosephs that get heated over spilled drinks, shoulder bumping, and cat calling, its a very young crowd. . I just don't know, when I was in college it was fine, but going here can be underwhelming because its like a place you go to just because there's tons of people and you do'nt exactly know what you want to do. So you go to where the action is supposedly, and its a lot of stuck up kids basically.. There are plenty of places that cater to a better crowd on peak hours on the weekends.
