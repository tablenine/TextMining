I expected so much more.  We arrived at 8:30 for our 8:45 reservation and were advised to "have a seat at the bar."  45 minutes later we were finally seated.  The waiter introduced himself, went over the specials, saw that we had cocktails from the bar, and then disappeared for THIRTY MINUTES.  We finally had to grab him as he breezed by just so we could order (it was now approaching 10:00!)  He also had the gall to suggest that it was my fault that he hadn't come by as my menu was open on the table.  Did it occur to you that I might have a question about a menu item??  We ordered the dry aged steak for 2 ($64), and when it arrived it was not only undercooked, but also cold!  Med. Rare = warm red center (their definition); ours had a cold purple center.  I would think that a "steakhouse" would be able to properly prepare their signature dish and get it to your table hot.  As it was now 10:20pm, we elected to just eat it cold rather than send it back. The jalapeno creamed corn was quite good, though. We found the service to be rather snooty, from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter... Like we were fortunate to be graced with their presence!  The bill for 4 was over $400 (no bottle of wine, either!)  For great steaks, I'll stick with NY Prime, Bone's or Pampas.  If I want to be treated like crap and eat an undercooked meal, I'll go to my sisters house :-)
