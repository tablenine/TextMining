Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I didn't grow up on any of the following: waffles, fried chicken or gravy. So for me "comfort food" isn't really comforting to me. In fact it usually makes me want to take a really long nap. . . I've had Roscoe's a few times (How can you live in L.A. for 27 years and not meet someone who wants to try it?). . What I ordered: Jeanne Jones omelet with a waffle.. . What I thought: The waffle was good. Thin, cripsy, and golden with a big glob of butter on top (which I removed). Â I dipped pieces of my waffle in to the small cup of syrup. Yum, it was good, but how good can a waffle be? after all it's just a waffle! . . Now on to the omelette... Chicken in my omelette? it was weird at first, but it actually tasted pretty good. Eggs, melted cheese and chicken, not a bad combo. . . I also ate: I also tried a little of the potatoes drenched in a gray coloured gravy substance. It was interesting, mushy warm potatoes and gravy. It was also good. . . In the end: My stomach was stuffed and I wanted a pillow and a blanket. . . Not really my kind of eats, but if you love yourself some chicken n' waffoes, hit up Roscoe's. . . Plus 2 stars for the food, . Plus 2 stars for the service and ambiance.... Minus 1 star for forcing me to nap away my Sunday afternoon.
