Great Bar, Great Servers, Great Darts!. . This was our fifth stop on our quest to visit places besides our usual haunts. The other stops consisting of wtf? What is the fastest way out of here? Walked in bartender poured me a perfect black velvet delicious Guinness and cider. . . The staff here was so friendly and nice. Thought they would have shades of the vortex attitude here but from the moment we walked in was nothing but good times.. . Drinks - delicious and perfectly poured.. Atmosphere - awesome. Darts - hell yes - and I won! Again! The bulls-eyes were totally putting out. . Service - the best. . Food - Tasty and fast - huge portions that don't skimp on the fixins. . . Give this place a try. Much better than the Yacht Club and the Porter - and I have been a Yacht Club lover for 9 years.
