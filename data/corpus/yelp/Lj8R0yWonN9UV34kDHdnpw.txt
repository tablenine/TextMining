Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
One of my friends kept swearing up and down that this place was amazing. I finally went to go try it out today. I'm gonna be honest. It wasn't terrible, but it's by no means comparable to, say, Tacos Baja Ensenada or El Taco Nazo.. . In their defense, their fish and shrimp are very fresh, and everything is cooked right before your very eyes, and the three ladies who were working were really fun and very sharp. They offer a salsa bar or four or five exotic sounding salsas like mango, pineapple, and avocado, but sadly, I did not find any of the salsas to be particularly flavorful. They have the place set up so that everything is pretty DIY. They put the fish or shrimp in the single corn tortilla, and then you add your own cream, salsa, and shredded cabbage. I couldn't help but notice that they do not give you limes.. . Yes, their tacos are not "too greasy," but I can't help it. I like them a little more traditional, with two tortillas, good grease, a crunchier batter, a thick squirt of cream, spicy salsa, chopped onions and tomatoes, and lime. Don't get me wrong - these are good and they'll do in a pinch, but they just made me long for a trip to East L.A.
