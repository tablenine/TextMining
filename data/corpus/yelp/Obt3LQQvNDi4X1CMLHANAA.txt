Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
It's a buffet style Korean BBQ restaurant.  The wait staff totally ignores you and just plops things on to the table and rudely walk away.  Considering that they give a fairly large portion, you would think that there would be more table room for everything, but there isn't and you feel all boxed in! We came in as a group of 5 and there was barely any room to do anything.  We were so squished in! And the wait staff was horrible about bringing anything that we requested.  The food comes slightly frozen for you to cook.  It just feels like there's no effort in preparation and there's a lack of flavor in the food! I've only gone once and refuse to go back! If you want a better place, go across the street or try out Cornerplace on James Woods Blvd.!
