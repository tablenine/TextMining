Ok so I have heard about this place for about 6 months as it's near work and everyone talks about it and occasionally brings in pastries - yum! I wanted to try it's to die for potato balls. Went with a guy from work and picked up an assortment of stuff to try - said potato ball (interesting but not to die for) Chicken empanada (good but not as good as the beef ones my roommate makes), meat pie (it was sweet!?) and chicken croquet (ok). The desserts, a whole display case, looked amazing... Apparently the sandwiches are great but until I try anything more than a few hot items I will have to say its just ok but prices are VERY reasonable - and SO BUSY you really have to be committed to lining up to order your food, let alone finding a place to park! We took it to go to save time. I ate my potato ball while waiting for his sandwich to be made!
