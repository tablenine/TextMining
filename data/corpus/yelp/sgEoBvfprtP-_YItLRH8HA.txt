I haven't been to La Creperie in years, I forgot how cute it is!  I visited with a large group (12 people, I believe), and we were seated in the back room and the service kept up with us quite nicely.  The wine list is a good size.  The beer list a bit small, but has some quality selections.  I shared some escargots and the cheese plate for an appetizer.  The escargot were good and buttery.  The cheese plate was just eh.  There were three small portions of cheese - brie, cheddar of some sort, and one that I thought would be a strong blue cheese, but turned out to be really mild.  The cheese is served with grapes (not a fan) and bread slices.  The cheese didn't have a ton of flavor, and as a personal preference, I like apples or pears and thin crackers with my cheese.  I ordered the mushroom crepe and added goat cheese.  It was pretty good, and a nice portion size.  I couldn't even finish all of mine, but that's because I knew that dessert was coming.  We ordered the banana sara dessert crepe, which had bananas, brown sugar, rum, and topped with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream.  That was pretty good too, but I think I would have liked it a bit better without the ice cream.  It made things a bit soggy and took away from the delicate banana-rum flavors.. . It's a fun place to go as a group or on a date or a couple of friends.  The servers are all very friendly, and I like the atmosphere.  There's a cute patio out back that had Christmas decorations, but obviously is used for seating in the warmer weather.
