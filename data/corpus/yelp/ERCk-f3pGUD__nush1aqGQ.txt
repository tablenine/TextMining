Went here for a bday dinner.  Appetizers, Main Dish, Side Dishes, Desserts, 2 bottles of wine, coffees &amp; drinks for 6 people = $650.. . For the price, the meat was OK.  It was the biggest prime rib I've ever had...28 oz!  The only thing that sticks in my mind is the crab gnocchi...YUM.  The waitress was good in the beginning, but towards the middle...she almost never came by.  The busers were much better...my water glass never went empty.. . The interior is nice...but very dark.  We sat downstairs.  Around 9pm...the upstairs got quite lively and very loud...we could hear it all downstairs too.. . Valet parking was $7!
