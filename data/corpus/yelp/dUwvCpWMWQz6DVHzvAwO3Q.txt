Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I made the mistake of not popping the whole dumpling in my mouth when I took my first bite of a Din Tai Fung dumpling, and juice came shooting out, nearly squirting my friend right on her glasses.  I guess I'm vouching for the freshness of the dumplings.  As far as the taste, I've had friends who thought the dumplings were overrated, though for the record, I thought they were pretty great.. . There are two sections to this restaurant: the front, older room, and the newer, back section.  We came through the front, and were asked by a woman to sit in the back.  I'd never been there, so I had no idea what she meant.  Was that like sitting in the back of the bus?  No, the "back" is Din Tai Fung 2.0, and is clean, modern and pretty big... a sign of how successful they've been to be able to expand like that.  It's about as good-looking a place as I've ever been to in the SGV.  And however ridiculous this sounds, the restrooms were really nice.  If there's any place it's appropriate to mention that, I guess it's Yelp.
