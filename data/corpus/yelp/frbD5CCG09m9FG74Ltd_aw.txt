Restaurant: Noodle
Category: Asian Fusion
Adorable slightly Americanized tasty Asian fusion.  That's what you get at Noodle.  The interior is straight out of a Pier 1 commercial, complete with black granite tables and kooky light fixtures.  The food is not the best Asian I've had or anything, but I've very much enjoyed everything I've tried.. except for the Spicy Basil Noodles... but more on that later.    The generally tasty food combined with being conveniently right next to the Midtown MARTA station has made Noodle one of my new favorite spots for weekday lunches.  Also, I appreciate that the food comes fast and the servers are attentive.. Now for the food.  Probably the main reason that I haven't been to Noodle more is that I ordered the Spicy Basil Noodle Bowl on my first visit.  Now, you must understand that Spicy + Basil + Noodle sounds like *heaven* to me.  I love Thai food and I love basil.  And I've never had a spicy basil anything that wasn't awesome.  Now this one didn't suck, but it came close.  The sauce was way too sweet and just.. not right..  But lucky for Noodle, I also tried the fried wontons on this visit.  And those *were* awesome.  Fried wontons filled with curried cream cheese.  Yeah, I actually crave those now.  The curry beef egg rolls are similarly good.. Also of note, the soups are pretty good too.  I've had a curry noodle soup and a pho so far and I thought both had delicious broths.  Not too shabby, Noodle; I like you better than Tin Drum!
