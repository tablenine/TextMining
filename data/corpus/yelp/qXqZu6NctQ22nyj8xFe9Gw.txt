I'm surprised that others weren't as impressed with this place as I was!  The experience that I had here was wonderful.  I had the coconut soup with tofu, which was absolutely outstanding.  Then, I had the wasabi maki, and this was one of the best sushi experiences I have had in a long time.. . This place was great, and I look forward to making it a frequent lunch stop.  The lunch menu is awesome because it's not too pricey for the portions.  I'd say that the quality was pretty good as well.  I'm very picky, but I don't have anything negative to say about this place.. . My experience here was excellent, and I am excited about going back!
