I think I'd be pissed if I'd had to wait in the lines these other folks wrote about. However, both times I've eaten at Kogi, the wait was maybe 20 minutes? Just as long as I'd wait at any sit-down joint, only I got to have my puppy with me and make friends in line. The experience made those 20 minutes fly by. . . My girl CJ and I tried the short rib tacos, the pork tacos, the sliders, and the short rib quesadilla, which was the chef's special for the night. . . Short rib Tacos: . Bite 1: mmmmmm good. a little too much cabbage, but good. . Bite 2: removed some cabbage. better. good flavor. . . Pork Tacos: . Bite 1: mmmm. also good. crispier than short-rib meat. . Bite 2: wait, doesn't this taste just like short ribs only crispy? Let's see if the slider has something new to offer.. . Sliders: . Bite 1: nope. nothing new. I feel like I've just tasted the same flavors twice. . Bite 2: the bun is soft, which is nice, but I'm still not getting anything I was missing in the first taco.. . Quesadilla: . All bites: yum. Cheese switches these flavors up just enough, plus the chili twist was good, if a little papery. . . So I went back again, since it was next to CoolHaus which I wanted to try badly, and had the Kogi Dog. This was delicious and I'm glad it was the only meat product I bought, since I didn't need to have repeats again. Also had the ginger cookie and cream cheese frosting sammie, which was yummy but so rich that I'd recommend sharing. . . LESSON LEARNED: Only one meat necessary. Maybe next time a burrito will be best. And yes, even though it was a little monotonous, I will be back.
