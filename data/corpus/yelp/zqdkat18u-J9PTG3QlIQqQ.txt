Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I looooooove Shin Sen Gumi! The price range for a bowl of Hakata ramen is around $10, but depending on what toppings you choose, it'll be more or less a few dollars over $10. . . When you walk in, be prepared. The waiters and waitresses (although most are usually male) would shout out 'Welcome!' The first time I ate there I was quite surprised. It was definitely a different atmosphere. Gosh, sometimes I think they took a bit too many happy pills in order to be that bubbly, but you realize that it's actually pretty nice being welcomed like that. Hahaha.. . The ramen does come pretty quickly after you order. When I first saw the bowl of noodles, I thought, 'Boy, I think I gotta get the extra noodles later on.' I do admit that I can eat more than most girls my age can. But it's actually pretty filling. If you have a medium appetite, you might end up deciding to skip on the extra noodles.
