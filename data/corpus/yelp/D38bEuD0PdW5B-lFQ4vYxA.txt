After a recent visit, it has been determined that the issue with the taps has been resolved. The fiance decided to give it a shot since they completely remodeled the bar, and he was pleased with both of his drafts.  I stuck to a bottle, because I am extremely unforgiving. . . Don't listen to anyone who says the food isn't good- the food is great, you know, for bar food. Good burgers, Good chicken ceasar sandwich, good chicken tacos.  When we were there last Friday, they were actually featured on the Hungry Hound for their shrimp po'boys, and I gotta tell you, it looked every bit as good as the one I recently had in NOLA.  Also the fried egg sandwich is probably the best hangover cure ever. Don't expect 5 star dining, and you won't be disappointed.
