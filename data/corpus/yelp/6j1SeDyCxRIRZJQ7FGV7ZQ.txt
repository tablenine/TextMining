Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Went back here two weeks ago when Mitch (the owner) had said they were getting an order of toro in. Obviously toro is an expensive fish, but definitely worth the money, was amazing. . . The rest of the food is amazing as usual and I love the people there. I'd say I've been there about six times since and am planning to go again next week!. . Best sushi in Chicago!
