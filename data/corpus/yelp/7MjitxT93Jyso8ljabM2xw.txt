Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
I got The Stack...tasty and huge...kinda like a clean and healthy version of Carl's Jr.'s Six Dollar Burger.. I opted for the salad instead of the fries...YES...good choice.. The Strawberry Lemonade was very refreshing and a great complement to my meal...the Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie for dessert was perfect.  . . I'm NOT vegetarian, but I like to "VEGE" it up every now and then, especially if it tastes good! The Veggie Grill is the perfect outlet for anyone who's craving a great tasting burger, but doesn't want to have all that meat clogging them up!  . . It's gonna cost you here, though...at least $15...but it's worth it!
