Mmm! Still sitting next to the cold remains of the fried chicken, gravy &amp; onion drenched potatoes and remnants of the butter biscuit that I loaded up with butter and honey.. . Can't wait to go to sleep tonight and dream. I aways sleep well when I feed the soul this way.. . Perfect end to a Perfect day.
