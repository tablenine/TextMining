Restaurant: Manny&#39;s Coffee Shop &amp; Deli
Category: Delis
Even though Manny's is a buffet style, cafeteria like restaurant, the food is simply AWESOME.  The Corn beef is one of the best, if not the best, in the entire Chicago land area. The Sandwiches are HUGE!!  The best potato pancake I have ever had the pleasure to eat!!!!!!!   I can't decide what else to get when I go there.   The Matzo Ball soup and Kishke are so, so, so  good!  Manny's is truly one of my favorites!  Parking can be tuff, especially during lunch, But Manny's always has a place to sit in it's huge dinning area. the prices are reasonable for amount of food served. Once you get the craving for Manny's nothing else will do!
