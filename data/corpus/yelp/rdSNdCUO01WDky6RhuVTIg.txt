Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
The Boundary is my ultimate favorite place in Wicker Park, it is a great place to watch a game or have a sit down meal. . This is always my first pick of place to go. . The food is awesome too- not just the typical bar food. They also have all kinds of beers, domestic and international, in bottles to try. It gets busy on Sat nights, but I usually go when its not crowded. Nate and Jason are so awesome I love them!
