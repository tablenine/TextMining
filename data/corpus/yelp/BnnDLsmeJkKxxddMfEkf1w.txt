Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Dude, this place is good, but I wouldn't wait for it like I would for other places (I realized i can't put other restaurant names in here, it auto replaces the name with "it"). . When we were in high school, the first ding tai fung was savagely packed; the point where life plaza was actually busy from ding tai fung leftover customers who couldn't wait.  But sadly, after we discovered that life plaza was spitting in your food, it was pretty much iabos (it's all but over status). . I can't stress enough, parking sucks, the wait sucks, but the food is good.. . The service is ridiculously fast, it's like you go in and to your left or right, you see tons of hispanics prepping your food in a manic state, pretty savage.  . . I only go every now and then, but only to the backside one, near wells fargo.  Parking is easier to find and there's 2 floors to serve your dumpling needs. . . Pretty good place to take your date if she doesn't mind waiting, you could always go to 1020 afterwords to hang out. I remember an experience where I was eating with my friend, and once he took a bite of the shao long bao, he said "damn that thing exploded sick in my mouth." I had to laugh, well I had no choice because one exploded in mine too, just an outrageous amount of juice blastage straight into your gums.
