This is one of my favorite vegan places. I used to go to the location on S. Beverly Blvd. once a week, but do my disappointment they closed. I love their tacos, and their soups are always amazing. If you can go for their brunch, I highly recommend it. The Caesar salad is another of my favorites along with the club sandwich.
