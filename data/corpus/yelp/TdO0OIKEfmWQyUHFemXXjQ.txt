It's a very cute brunch place! It is a little expensive, but not unreasonable given the location, the ambiance, and the quality of food. I had a benedict, and they did a little spin to it, substituting english muffin with foccacia bread. I personally liked the former, but I thought it was good that they experimented with different things on the menu. I didn't eat a dessert this time, but they all looked very good. I plan to go back again to try some desserts. :)
