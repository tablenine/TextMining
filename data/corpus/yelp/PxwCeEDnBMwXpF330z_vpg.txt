I love shabu shabu ...which would mean i love this place!. . I guess i've gotten lucky everytime i went b/c instead of the 2 hour waits that everybody keeps mentioning...we usually wait an hour.  the old man who i assume to be the owner adds to the experience.  He's so cute running around with his clipboard calling out the next patrons.   You would think  that the long wait would drive some people to leave...but EVERYONE waits.. . simple menu= good food.. . Shabu Shabu house only has two items on their menu...Medium or Large.  But the quality of the food is so good they don't need anything else.  Like the old saying goes...if it ain't broke don't fix it. They've been successful with just that ...so i'm not i complaining.  The slices of rib eye meat simply melt in your mouth.  The sauces are so goood too!  Here's my recipe to best shabu shabu sauces.  . . 1. Goma(seasame sauce... i know it tastes like peanut sauce).  *Lots of chili oil.  *Lots of chili powder.  *Lots of garlic.  *Lots of green onion. . 2. Ponzu.  *Lots of daikon.  *Lots of green onion.  * Little bit of garlic.  *Lots of chili powder. . I usually drench meat in the Goma sauce and leave the veggies and noodles sitting in the Ponzu before i start inhaling it.   Happy shabu shabu everyone.
