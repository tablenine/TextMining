TRU.....an experience it was. Food was great, no arguments there. Service was interesting if a bit annoying. Following me to the bathroom was a bit odd and then sneaking up on me when I got back to slide my chair in was a bit much. The wine list was absolutely amazing and we took full advantage of it.. . The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is b/c I almost feel as if TRU is trying to hard. It was almost clinical and the patrons were on pins and needles b/c the atmosphere was so cold. It was like nobody wanted to make a mistake or something and everyone was on their tiptoes. Just a wierd vibe. Â For those wondering about price, We had 4 people, a drink before, a bottle of wine, and dessert and it was $1000, so prepare to spend some moola.
