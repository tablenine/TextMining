I'll get me some Kogi, only if the line is short. . . So the hype killed it for me. After waiting over an hour in line for some Kogi, I ordered a sampler of tacos and a kimchi quesadilla. The tacos were really tasty and lived up to the hype. . . What killed it for me were the "famous" kimchi quesadilla. Blech! I love kimchi and quesadillas but the combination was not to my liking. The sauce on top seemed to cover up the bad taste but it wasn't working. Maybe it was a bad night but it was disgusting. . . Good: Tasty tacos.. . Bad: It always has a long line and the kimchi quesadillas need to be worked on.. . Final: Go get some great tacos...if the line is short enough.
