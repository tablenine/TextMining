Damn!! This place has 110+ reviews!! I figure I'd help this small quaint and inconspicuous spot out by writing a good review, but I see several people have beat me to it.. . I've only been here about 5 times, but the food has been consistently good. I only get the pork chops. I highly recommend it. In fact, if you know the recipe, please email it to me.. . The only bad thing is the service can be slow at times. The staff is friendly, but sometimes just doesn't get around to your table when you need something.. . Overall, A-
