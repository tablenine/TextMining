Cheap but SUPER DELICIOUS sandwiches!!!! Every time I visit my cousins in Glendale, we gotta go to Portos for Sunday brunch. . Heres what I have eaten: . Medianoche (Midnight Sandwich)($3.65)-slow roasted pork, ham, swiss cheese, butter, mayo/mustard, pickles on sweet roll.. Cubano (Cuban Sandwich)($4.25)- same as above but with Cuban bread.. Ham &amp; Cheese Croissant ($3.80)-ham, swiss cheese, mayonnaise, lettuce,  and tomatoes on a butter croissant.. All fantastic sandwiches!!! Don't forget to buy some cheese  rolls. Oh my god, my mouth is watering right now.
