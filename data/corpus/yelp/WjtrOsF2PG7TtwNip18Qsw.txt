Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Dumplings! Ordered Pork, Shrimp and Pork, and Vegetable and Pork - level of tastiness from high to low in that order, where Vegetable and Pork was still pretty good :). . The Sour and Spicy soup is a must-try! Don't let the name intimidate you - it's not really that sour nor spicy, so no worries.  The  (small side dish?) is pretty good too, with a hint of spiciness to it.. . The food wasn't amazingly good though since I've had better.... in the Din Tai Fung in Taiwan! Original is always best, hands-down.
