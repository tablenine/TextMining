best burger and pie in town.. . I adore the community, and how it polices the seating... and how everyone knows everyone.. . And I miss it.  And I just thought of it.. and I want it.. . Man.. LA didn't completely suck, when you weren't aware of the roads, and people and.. well... okay it basically did.  Some good restaurants and diners from yesteryear tho.
