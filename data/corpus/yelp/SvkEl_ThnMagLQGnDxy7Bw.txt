Looking for a mediterranean style meat fix?. . The Doner wrap with zesty feta is very good.. . I've heard the veggie wrap is good as well.. . All the ingredients appear fresh, but hey, I can't tell one jumbo bag of lettuce from another.. . The parking sucks. There are two regular spaces and a super-mega wide handicapped spot that is always open (and tempting). Â Damn Steven Hawking's stretch Hummer!
