Consistently good, fast, yummy mexican food!  I had to update because everytime we are all thinking "hmm where shoudl we go to dinner?".. El Tapatio has become our back up!  It's a great place to take our friends in town from the burbs to, and their guacamole is nothing short of amazing.  Haven't had drinks there, though, so I can't comment on that!
