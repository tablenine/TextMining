Maybe I was too weird, but I had order Pastrami French Dip in this place.  It was a pretty good meal I had.  My boss, the clownish one in West LA ordered a Tenderloin steak.  Ay Caramba!  . . This place reminded me alot about Roman Polanski's Chinatown when I saw this deli. I knew they would be popular with pastrami, but I just didn't know how popular it really was.  The menu was pretty unique where nothing but Pastrami was mentioned.  Maybe I'll go next time to try #19, which seemed to be the most famous selection.
