Great brunch place with friends. Their omelet - "The Favorite" - was made of fresh ingredients and very quickly. It's busy, but the hosts work fast to get you seated. I was tempted to order the carrot cake cup cake behind the glass window full of their desserts, but withheld myself from doing so. I need to lose weight - I have been eating wayyyyyy too much sweets lately. I can't help it. There's no way a sweet girl can stay sweet without her sweets. ;) Anyway, Toast is a great place to quickly grab some breakfast/brunch food and a cup of coffee before heading to the Beverly Center, which is only three blocks away.
