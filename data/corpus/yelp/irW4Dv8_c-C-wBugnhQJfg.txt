Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Is it enough to say that The Hungry Cat is one of my favorite restaurants in L.A.?. . It's a couple of years overdue, but thank you very much David Lentz for the amazing Cat, the most Excellent Cocktails in the city, the stone's throw location from the ArcLight, and the wonderful fish-centricity of it all. . . I tried the lobster roll for the first time just recently (the servers are very skilled at derailing one's best plans with the specials shpiel), and it lived up to its reputation. One day I'd like to travel to Maine to see if the originals live up to the buttery perfected roll of Hollywood! . . Yeay for cats, Yeay for Hungry Cat!
