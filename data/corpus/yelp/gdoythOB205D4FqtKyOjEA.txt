Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I don't want to hate on this place because I get why poeple want to come here. It's not as though I don't like Gingergrass, it's just that I don't get why you would come here if you can get more authentic Vietnamese food 5 minutes (or so) from here in Chinatown (there are Vietnamese places there). I know it's cool and there are times when you are willing to pay for a cleaner, fancy place, but for the rest of the time, this place just isn't worth it. Go to Pho 87 ( don't get discourage by the Pho name...they have a million other dishes) instead. Your food may not come in matching dishes and your server are not color-coordinated, but your food will be awesome, and your wallet will still be fat.
