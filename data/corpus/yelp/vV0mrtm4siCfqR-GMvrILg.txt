If you're not a fan of waiting. Don't Go.. . If you don't want to cook your own food. Don't Go. . . If you're going to eat at this spot then tell me "I don't see what the big deal is!". Please. Don't Go.. . Hopefully I've deterred you enough to ease the line a tiny bit so I can get to my meat sooner. ;) I've been going to this place for 10 years now, and have seen how much the crowd has changed, the line has grown.. and YES I still love the old man! Bless him. . . Go around the corner to Yamazaki bakery and get yourself some imagawayaki to ease your hunger pangs while you wait.
