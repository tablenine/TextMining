The sandwiches are too expensive here.  Most of them don't even come with fries or anything for that matter.  I've been here twice, and both times I felt my eyes pop out of my head when I got the bill.  The first time, I got the pastrami reuben, which was pretty tasty.  This second time I got the turkey melt, which was dry, dry, dry.  I overheard someone order chicken soup, and they charge you extra if you want rice or noodles in your soup!!  Are you kidding me?  Like previous yelpers, I think I need to be drunk in order to enjoy this establishment more.. . I'll probably eat here at least one more time to break the tie because I enjoyed my sandwich the first time, not so much this second time.  For now two stars because I really feel like you don't get what you pay for.
