Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but I've only eaten there twice (although I've had their cheesecake tons of times). As for this Chicago location, it has relatively good service, very good food, good location and ambiance. . . If you're not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, expect to spend over $10 for your meal (more if you're there for dinner and even more if you want dessert). Dessert runs around $6-8 for a slice of cheesecake (but if you like heavy cheesecake, it's well worth it!).. . If you go on a weekend or during peak meal hours, you're going to have to wait to eat. If you're not really that hungry and are willing to eat around mid-afternoon, then Â I suggest that as the prime time that you can just walk in and eat.. . If you just want cheesecake, you can just order it from their front counter. Tell them what you want and wait for them to call for you to pick it up. :) If you're sharing, make sure to ask for extra forks and napkins!. . Oh and their bathrooms are amazing. I just love going in there!!!
