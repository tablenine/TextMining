I love this place however, it is a little too expensive to go everyday for your morning cup of joe. I'm a big fan of the Cafe Aulait, which is so good you don't even need sugar, and the Vanilla Latte (hot). I would also recommend one of their chocolate chip cookies which are quite sinful. I like to go here about once a week to splurge, and its a great place to sit and chat with friends and family. Enjoy!
