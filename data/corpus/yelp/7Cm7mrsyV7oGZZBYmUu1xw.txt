This place needs another review like Lindsay needs another rum and coke.  But I digress.. . The setting is absolute gorgeous--all white lights and gothic fountainness.  Imagine heaven.  Now imagine heaven with servers from hell.. . It's true.  The service is competing with the horny toed sloth for slowest organic creature.  Hey, a few servers tried to bring me wine, brie, and even a rather tasty looking slather of cake.  Granted, I didn't order any of those things.. . A simple request for two black coffees took longer than Lost's fall hiatus.  Lost fans this month!!  And the coffee tasted somewhere between old grinds of tobacco, and expired chocolate.. . Blech.. . But I'm a Libra.  Ambience.  Ambience.  Ambience.  And this place has it in spades.
