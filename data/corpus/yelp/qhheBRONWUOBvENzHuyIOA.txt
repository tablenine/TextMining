Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The all mighty boiling crab! the crawfish is ok i usually opt for the shrimp and king crab legs in buttery garlic juiceyness. Now thats what you call a meal! it kinda sad they dont serve rice, but they say you can bring your own! the seasoned fries goes with everything and if you dont like to get your hands dirty, well... tuff sh*t. The waitresses are cute... oh... wait they are good and on point. If you have  larger parties you have to make sure everyone is there otherwise they will not seat you. Parking is good on the street, i dont know why you would park in their private parking lot. its sooooo small! if you want a  crustacean high  cholesterol meal, this place is for you.
