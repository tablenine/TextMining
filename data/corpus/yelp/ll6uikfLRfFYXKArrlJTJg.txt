I have been here a few times and like the atmosphere. It's in a convenient location and there is plenty of free covered parking available, which is a rarity in the city. . . On my last visit I had the California Steak Wrap. The steak pieces were medium rare, just the way I like although there was gristle on a couple of pieces which I tossed aside. The fresh avocado and chipotle vinaigrette were a nice blend with the steak, tomato, onion and lettuce. I ordered handcut fries as my side and received a generous portion. They were served hot, as they should be. The service was excellent, and the food was good but nothing to rave about. . . The location, atmosphere and service of this location earns Marlows four stars, but the food, in my opinion, brings it down to three.
