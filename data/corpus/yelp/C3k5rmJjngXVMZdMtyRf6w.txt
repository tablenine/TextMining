Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
What can I say, these guys do everything right!. . Went once when it was parked at the CNN building after wanting to go for a long time and I must say, was not disappointed at all!. . I got their famous cheddar mac'n'cheese/bbq pulled pork grilled cheese and it was out of this world! Served with a side of tomato soup and perfectly fried tater tots, it was a delicious lunch that truly lived up to all the hype. The service was fast and line moved swiftly. The guy that took my order was super nice even though they were busy and really made the experience a pleasant one (sometime food trucks can be unorganized and hectic).. . Its hard to find a time to go because I work so far away from Hwood/DTLA, but I look at the website and twitter daily to see if theres a chance that I can get another fix. Bravo guys, some of the best grilled cheese in LA!
