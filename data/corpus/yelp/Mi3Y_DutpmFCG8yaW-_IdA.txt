I LOVE their 1/2 lb burger!. Does not feel like I'm eating greasy, fattening food... omg! My bf ordered Media Noche (pulled pork), and he liked it too--and he's very picky about pulled pork sandwiches.. . A couple of our friends ordered Herb Roasted chicken--delicious!. and Spicy Italian pasta--it was okay (from their verdicts).. . We all shared their red velvet cupcake and blue velvet cake. The cupcake was okay. Not too sweet and it was that moist. The icing is a must to be eaten with the cupcake. The cake was alright. Again, you need to eat it with icing to add that sweetness.. . Would definitely come back!
