The rising tide of coffee couture has reached its inevitable high water mark at the recently opened Lamill on Silverlake Blvd. I enjoy seeking out the newest and supposed best brews on the East side, from Intelligentia to Choke, as much as the next pseudo gourmand, but now we have gone too far. LAMill is asking us to treat coffee as something akin to a rare wine or succulent truffle, the only difference being that I can make coffee at home!! And just as well! Why would I want to pay $12 dollars for a table side french press? Maybe if I was paying euros, Maybe. The clover coffee I had was fine, a bit acrid and sharp, but decent. To those in the neighborhood I would say that the success of this place could be the death knell for the quaint little valley you call home. After living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for many years and watching the same exact same thing happen as little locally owned cafes and bars were displaced by mega-Thai restaurants and yuppified , gorgonzola-drizzled eateries, I feel your pain. Please buy a pound of beans somewhere else, a $10 french press, and do yourself a favor by NEVER GOING TO LAMILL!!
