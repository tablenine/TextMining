Restaurant: Perennial
Category: American (New)
An old flame and I were wandering the streets of the Gold Coast looking for a place to have a Saturday afternoon brunch where we would be able to talk for hours and catch up a bit.  We stumbled onto Perennial after other places were crowded and noisy.  Not that Perennial wasn't noisy when we first entered, the bar area was blaring 70's rock. But there was a quieter room in which to dine on the east side of the restaurant with a nice view of Lincoln Park.  We started with coffee, and then waited, and waited and waited for the server to come back for our order.  Of course, we were talking pretty intensely, so maybe the server didn't think we were there for the food, but finally he came and about fifteen minutes later, brunch arrived.  I had the eggs benedict with mushrooms and truffle oil for $10 and my friend had french toast with cinnamon apples and creme fraiche for, I think $9.  I don't think that's that expensive for a brunch in the city of Chicago, and both meals were DELICIOUS!  After the initial wait for the order, the staff was very attentive and they let us stay and talk for, I think almost an hour and a half (no, the restaurant was not crowded; otherwise we would have cleared out to let others have a seat).  Anyway, I recommend Perennial for a great, lazy Saturday brunch/lunch after you stroll through the Farmer's Market directly across the street.  Great ambience.  Good food.  They could have cranked up the service a bit, but, really, maybe they just didn't want to interrupt our conversation.  So, four stars.
