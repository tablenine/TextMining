Been to orochon twice; both times the wait was at least 15 minutes for a table. Tried the special 1 on my first visit. IMO it packed a lot of heat flavor and temperature wise. I had to wait for my ginourmous bowl of food to cool off. I like my food really warm. It's a great place to bring your friends that enjoy spicy foods or hot sauce.
