Started going here back in 2007.  Portions were bigger and prices were cheaper.  However, the quality has not gone down.  I typically get their hot plate which is plenty of food for me but not for some of my friends.  Mashed potatoes are awesome...fluffy and buttery.  Probably not a good thing but they do taste good.  Have had some inconsistent reviews on their chicken sometimes a bit dry and other times cooked perfectly.  For this reason I tend to only order their flat iron steak.
