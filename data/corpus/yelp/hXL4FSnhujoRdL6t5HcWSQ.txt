Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
We arrived around 6pm on a Friday expecting to be turned away by the long lines but we waited like 7 minutes. Which was totally awesome because the first time I went there, we waited more than 45 minutes. Anyways I wasn't too hungry as I had a large lunch. But I ended up getting the Rosie O'Donnell hot dog, which was chili, onions, and sauerkraut. I don't usually like sauerkraut so I got it on the side so it didn't really feel like anything special - just a chili dog. I admit I like that they have unique hot dog combos, their sides (only tried the fries) are decent, and they carry little-known sodas (strawberry crush in a glass bottle!). But really, it's such a tourist trap. I like all the celebrity pictures and autographs that line the walls. But their hot dogs are really not worth an hour's wait. Parking along any of the nearby streets isn't too bad. And the atmosphere always seem lively. Price is decent - you can get a meal for under $10.
