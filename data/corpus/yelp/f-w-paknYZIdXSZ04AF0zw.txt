Pretty good.  My own experience at Shaun's was quite good, but another member of our party got at least one dish that was way off.  . . First, my own dinner -- I started with the Jerusalem artichoke soup which was very nice: sweet and creamy.  My entree of venison with cranberries and perogis was delicious.  The venison was tender and medium rare, and complemented nicely by the cranberries.  I'd want to have that again in a heart beat.  I finished with banoffee pie, which was also good.  From my perspective, it was a solid meal.. . The others ordered the chopped liver and the chinese pork buns.  The former was liked, but the latter was not done well.  I've noticed a fair number of other reviewers have liked the Chinese pork buns, so I think someone prepared them improperly this time.  It tasted like someone went way too heavy on wasabi.  This definitely wasn't just jalapeno, because it had a quick, sharp burn typical of horseradish that goes right up your nose and doesn't stay on your tongue.  Anyway, they were completely unbalanced and nearly inedible;  I like spicy food but this was just unpleasant because you couldn't taste anything else. . . The other entrees were the yellowfin tuna, which was enjoyed, and a steak, which was purportedly overcooked.  The coffee ice cream dessert dusted with crushed coffee beans got raves, however.  . . So, overall, it was a mixed bag: the dinner was quite solid for me, but some of the other members of my party were less satisfied with their experience.  If I'd gotten those pork buns and an improperly cooked steak, I'd probably have given this visit a 3.  Given the reputation of this place, however, and the fact that most of the dinner was quite good, it was probably just bad luck.
