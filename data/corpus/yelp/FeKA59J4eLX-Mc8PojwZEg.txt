Wow, I didn't realize how many reviews this has gotten. So that probably makes this review hugely insignificant, but whatever.. The kogi truck has great tacos, but they could be a little cheaper (after all, it is just a food truck).. The line usually sucks, though. But you can't beat the convenience of Â a food truck that comes right to your work
