Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
Diane D. totally summed up how I feel about Doc Chey's.  I used to like it back in the day when I didn't know better.  I ate there recently and couldn't pour enough of the srirachi sauce on my pad thai due to complete lack of flavor.  Not only did it lack flavor, it lacked pretty much everything besides noodles.  Vegetables were nearly non-existent in the dish.  It did seem very "industrial" with no love in the food.. . I will say that in the past I have really enjoyed the coconut chicken soup (not sure how it is now that I have eaten at much better Asian/Thai restaurants, though).  Also, the patio and location of this Doc Chey's is pretty cool so I'm giving them 2 stars.
