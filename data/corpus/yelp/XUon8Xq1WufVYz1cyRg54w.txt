Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This place was packed when I got here on a Sunday night for our 8pm reservations.  I'm definitely glad we made our reservations.  We were seated a few minutes before 8pm and there were people still just coming in around 9pm when we were leaving! =0  . The food was excellant.  I have been to other steakhouses (Alexanders, Mastros, House of Prime Rib, Ruth Chris, etc), but I have always been encouraged by family member to try Lawry's for their decent prices and great quality prime rib.  I finally did, and no regrets at all.  I ordered the English cut (three thin slices) with mashed potatos and creme of corn for sides.  The only negative item for the night was I WISH they would serve their food on hot plates so that it would be hotter, compared to other steakhouses I felt their food was a little on the luke warm side.  Other than that, decent prices and yummy prime rib.  I will need to go check out House of Prime Rib in the Bay Area again to see which one I think is better! . Oh, yeah another down side was vallet was $5.50, but what do you expect from Beverly Hills, right?
