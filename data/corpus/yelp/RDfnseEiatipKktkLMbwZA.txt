based on the Long Beach location only.. it's packed nearly all the time. I make great fried chicken (old family recipe and long cooking).. and their's is equal in taste and perhaps better because it's hotter. LOVE the waffles.. but unless you are dying for waffles.. skip them and head right into the chicken.  There is so much food that unless you are a jock, you can't consume it all. .  the LB place is friendly, tons of parking and in the downtown  getting more gentrified area.
