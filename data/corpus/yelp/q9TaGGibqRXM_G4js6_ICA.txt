I was lucky enough to be treated to some tasty MF Sushi when I lived in Atlanta and a friend came down to see RESPECT.  What a cool place!. . The decor was very classy, clean lines and linens, hot towels to wash your hands with, etc.  Our server was on top of everything the entire evening and her recommendations turned out to be perfect: the edamame and miso soup were delicious, as was the spicy tuna, california roll, and eel we ordered.  I LOVED the iced green tea, and everything came very quickly and was presented beautifully.. . Unfortunately, MF is pretty expensive for what they provide.  I could go to Shout or Ru Sans and get comparable sushi for less.. . All in all, I enjoyed myself, partly because I didn't have to pay, but mostly because I enjoyed the sushi.  For me, though, classy is nice, but I'd rather be at Ru Sans in blue jeans with a bottle of Kirin Ichiban in my hand.
