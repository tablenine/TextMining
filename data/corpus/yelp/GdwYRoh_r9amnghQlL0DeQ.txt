Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The ramen is 4 stars.  Very good here and I do enjoy the flavor and the spice.  I order the miso broth, level 4 spice with chashu topping and I enjoy it every time.  I give the overall experience 3 stars because there always seems to be a wait to get seated and the service is sub-par. Always having to remind the servers and asking them for something over and over can get a little irritating.  Aside from that, this place is a must try.
