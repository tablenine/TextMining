wait is loooong...consider hitting up the bar for $2-3 beers and some oysters.  the staff is friendly and fast. if you like: . . 1. seafood. 2. spicy. 3. eat with your hands. 4. garlic. . then this is the place for you.  the fried catfish is mighty yummy too...not greasy at all.  and the fries...by the end of the night, you will reek of garlic.  actually, reek of garlic for the next few days.
