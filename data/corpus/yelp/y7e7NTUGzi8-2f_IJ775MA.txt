Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Best burger in L.A.? Very possible! I've heard a lot about Father's Office and their delectable burgers from sooo many friends and food blogs, so while I was in town one week I had to try it. Medium-rare for juiciness, but also because i'm always worried the cooks will overcook the meat. Though I'm sure the folks over at F.O. would never over-cook their special burger. I'm also a big lover of cheeses, so if you hate strong cheese, you might want to steer clear. Beet salad was just as good as the burger. Those strings of beets on top were a little strange. They looked crispy but ended up being dry and a kind of spongy :(. . 4.5 stars! There really should be an option to have it with other cheeses for people who don't like the strong flavor.
