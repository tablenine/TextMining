Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
This is some of the best Chinese food I know of. I've been here three times, and ordered nearly the same thing each time. . This is one of those restaurants that has a wall lined with giant tanks of live seafood, all awaiting their eventual death and consumption by hungry patrons. It's almost PETA's worst nightmare, which is awesome. Notable among the inmates are the huge tanks of crab, lobsters and, oddly, elephant clams (yeah, weird).. I've ordered the House Special Crab from here and it's pretty good. Lots of chili, lime, and ginger. However, it's really difficult to eat and there isn't much meat- next time I will definitely try the House Special Lobster.. I also have ordered both the House Special Fish (not my favorite) and whole fish in black been sauce (AWESOME). I highly recommend the latter.. One thing that I will say stands out above many seafood dishes I've had, anywhere, is their Salt and Pepper Squid. YOU NEED TO ORDER THIS. It is by far one of the crispiest, lightest, most flavorful, most pleasing calamari dishes to be had ANYWHERE. . Things to note: The staff has Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and English speakers, in case you have relatives in from out of town. The restaurant itself also only takes cash.
