I took a friend out for a belated birthday lunch here, we were both excited to come here, we're both huge fans of organic food. We came in massively hungry and since it was a pretty chilly day, we started off with soup. I went for the cheesy beer soup.... how could you go wrong with that combo? I'm sorry I got a cup, I wanted the full pot! Plus it came with a thinly sliced toasted multigrain bread and it was so freakin' good when dipped in the soup. She had the minestrone that was good... but she was jealous of mine... I could just tell. Then we both went with flat breads. I had my Bufalina with mushrooms and she went with the Tuna Nicose. She loved hers I loved mine yet we couldn't finish either one of ours. Great meal, although I will hold off on five for just the mere fact I need to come back for some of the vodka infused drinks, cause the looked awesome. Our server Elizabeth was very friendly and was great checking up on us and making sure we had everything we needed. Oh I'll be back.
