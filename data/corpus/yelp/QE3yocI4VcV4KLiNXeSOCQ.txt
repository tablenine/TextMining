With entrees in the $9-15 range and cocktails at $9, brunch is a somewhat more affordable option than dinner at sola.  With the reduced prices come no compromise in quality or creativity.  I pondered over three tantalizing options before settling on the kalua pork hash.  I've had a barbecue pulled pork eggs benedict before, but I never would have thought of pork for a breakfast hash.  It worked beautifully, from the foundation combination of kalua pork, perfect hash browns, and scrambled eggs (which could have stood on their own in tasty simplicity), to the dish-making accents of guacamole and pico de gallo.  It was an effective and delicious composition.  I even loved the plain white toast on the side.. . I wish that I had caught the name of our server, because her smiley interactions added a pleasant touch to the experience.. . We made a reservation, but it looked as if we didn't need one:  there were plenty of tables available when we walked in.  Unlike my last experience, for dinner, there were several tables occupied, which raised the atmosphere from uncomfortably hushed to warmly alive.
