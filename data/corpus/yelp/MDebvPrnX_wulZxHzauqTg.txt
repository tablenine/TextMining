This is the kinda place that you wanna love, because they have good for you food, coffee, is open late and is decorated in such an eclectic way that as soon as you walk in, you're happy. I dragged my friend here a while back and got the veggie scramble over an english muffin. The food was good, not amazing, but good.. and I also ordered a zombie which was described as a huge cup of coffee deliciousness. However, what came to the table was a HUGE, i mean MASSIVE cup of bitter coffee, that I had to force myself to take maybe 5-6 sips outta before I could take no more. I would come back here for the ambiance, the food and maybe try my luck at some coffee drink that seemed a little more tame, something pick me up could actually deliver on. . All in all a good experience at a place that was definitely different.
