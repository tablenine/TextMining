Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Having just moved to Los angeles from the east coast I heard from a lot of people that I just HAD to try pinks, and everytime I passed by the line would be wrapped around the building. . . Unfortunately, I feel as though the hype might be this place's downfall in my eyes. It is certainly not worth the hour long wait you might find yourself in due to the huge following this place is fortunate to have. The menu is pretty large and has a good ammount of choices, but that's it's best trait. . . So I got the polish sausage borrito dog... I was expecting it to be hot, but I didn't even taste any spice in it. I wasn't impressed with their regular hotdog, either, and except for the bun, I feel like I get a better hotdog on the streets of NYC for a better price. . . In my opinion, it's not worth the hype or the long wait. You MIGHT catch me there on rare occasions when there is no wait because I can't say the food was horrible, but if the line is even going through the snake form it's not worth it. I managed to go at 2:15pm on a wed and there was no wait. . . Parking is manageable and it's free... Even if the lot is full, the residential street behind it has free parking up to 2 hours.
