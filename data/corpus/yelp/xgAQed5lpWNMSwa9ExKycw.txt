Ok, I was giving this place one more chance because they royally "messed" up last time and the owner actually sent me a gift certificate.  Hate to say, won't be going back after the second bad experience!!!   I was told an hour for delivery first off......... it took a whopping 90 min................ seriously??????  I questioned the cost-  it says on their website "free delivery" after 5.............. hmmmm, but there was a dollar delivery charge hidden in there (FALSE ADVERTISING).  The pizza was "warm" upon arrival.  They charge $1.95 per topping on a large, so I paid $6 for a small very small sprinkle of jalapenos, mushrooms, and pineapple........... so skimpy on the toppings.  Just very disappointed in this place....... only thing they got right is the extra sauce I requested.  SERVICE AND DELIVERY STINKS!!!!!   DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!!
