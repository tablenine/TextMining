I honestly have not one bad thing to say about this place!  Granted, I have not eaten here in person yet, every meal I have had delivered was phenomenal!. . Every time I order a new dish, I swear to my friends it is my favorite on the menu.  Here are some of them:. . Potato Curry. Asian Salad. Everything Fried Rice. Crab Rangoons
