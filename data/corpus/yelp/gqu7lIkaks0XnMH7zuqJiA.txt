Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I hate to admit it but I first heard about The Griddle Cafe from Rachel Ray's Tasty Travels: Los Angeles. At that time I was still living in Washington, DC and was dying to go to a real breakfast/brunch place my current home town was definitely lacking. My husband and I liked the Griddle but we tend to order the same things once we've figured out what's good in a place. We've never had any of their salads, sandwiches, soups, chili, or appetizers but here's my quick assessment of what you should order, what you should avoid, what you should be aware of, etc.. . Pros:. Omelet Pomodoro. Egg dish called "Gone Shrimpin'" (only if you like garlic and shrimp and egg cooked together). Mom's French Toast. Wholey-Moley Pancakes. Egg specialty called "Tequila Sunrise" (v. spicy). Free pancakes if it's your birthday. . Cons:. Long wait. Parking. Annoying wannabe hipsters as their main clientele. Cramped quarters. Not so good coffee (even with the french press)
