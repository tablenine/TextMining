Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I have dine at Uncle Julios for about 7 years now and never went out the door disappointed. . . The service is very good even on night where it's extremely busy. Never had any problem with any of the staffs there. They are very friendly.. . To make this short:. Stay away from taco and the cold dishes. (left side of the menu). Stick with the middle of the menu and you won't be disappointed.. . I do not recommend coming here if you are on your 1st or 2nd Â date since there is a bar there and it could get really loud. Also, some night you would have family dining in there with 3yr old running around and shouting.
