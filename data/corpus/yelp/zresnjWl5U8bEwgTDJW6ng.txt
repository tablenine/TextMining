rating:  4.5 (out of 10). . Wow, it looks like a lot of people have already written this place off.  I guess I can't really say anything to change that.  I'll share my insights into the place. . . The overall experience was nice.  As plain and unexciting as that adjective is, it's very fitting. We had an attentive waiter who saw to our needs, never letting the cups get too dry, or the food waiting too long.  . . The food was good.  We started with some cured meats, an organic speck and a coppa, matched with a basque cheese.  The meats were satisfactory, though the coppa seemed a bit over seasoned, and the speck was no where near the quality versus Mozza Pizzeria.  The olives were surprising good, sitting in a light vinaigrette, but what does that say when the most outstanding part are the olives?. . For our main course, I had the braised rabbit.  It was presented well with brussel sprouts, served over bulgur in a mustard sauce.  The rabbit was not gamey at all, but had a rich earthly taste, complimented well with the distinct brussel sprout accent.  . . Overall, the atmosphere was nice, and unlike many of the patrons who have written before me, we were seated almost immediately as we came in, even without a reservation.  Of course, we came on a Wednesday night and sat outside (this was a pleasant evening).  Would I go there again, I don't know.  There are so many other fine establishments to try, I don't know if Ford's made enough of a splash to warrant a second look.  Bon Appetit?
