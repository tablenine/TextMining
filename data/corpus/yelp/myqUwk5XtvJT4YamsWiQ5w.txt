Oinkster is reason #2 Eagle Rock rocks.. #1 is Casa Bianca. . Eagle Rock has gotten so developed, esp. in recent years with amazing culinary landmarks. . . Fast food done slow. Most everything is made in-house, which in itself, wows me. . The pastrami is succulent and delicious. Next time though, I will have to ask for more veggies since I can't handle that much meat at once. . The burgers use good quality meat and great arrangement of veggies and bread to complete its burgerness. . While not a fan of pulled pork usually, I have heard legends of the place's moist and melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork. . . THE FRIES.. The fries are really the best I have tasted. These Belgian fries are given a good "triple-fry." First, in beef shortening. Then twice in oily oil. The result, happiness in fried potato form. It is accompanied by house aioli. Their other sauces(ketchup and mustards) are also housemade. They are distinct and tangy and balanced and delicioso. . . The taro shake also rocks my pants.. . The thing about oinkster is that it is so unpretentious. It is casual yet refined. And all types of people congregate here-- Asians, whites, Mexicans, women, men, kids, hipsters, nerds, richies, etc.... It really embodies the spirit of LA in this sense--its diversity. . Its integration and acceptance of the diversity and classes, well, that's another story, but stil I like Oinkster for this. . . The food is very affordable. This is very nice. . . love ezra. . They now have a beer menu. This too makes me happy.
