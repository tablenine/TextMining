Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
WARNING: INDIFFERENT SERVICE. . Three times, I'll never go back. Every time started out ok, with service degrading as the meal went on. . The apps are good, but the main courses just ok. . But no food is worth waiting 25 minutes in between courses for. . Oh, and bad music too. You'll love it if you're a Bon Jovi fan. . So many good restaurants...kind of a shame.. . UPDATE: my friends went there for their 10th anniversary and had pretty much the same experience as I have THREE times here. Great food, with the service diminishing into indifference. What's the deal with these high-end places and service? Don't get it. Ugh.
