My Lovely Lola's!!!!!!. . This review has to be extremely positive from a non-martini drinker who loved all the martinis made at LOLA's. ( don't take the "all" part literally). Here, KNOW HOW TO MAKE A MARTINI. I got the What A Pear martini, my friend got the The Star F*cker Martini, my other friend got the Strawberry Fields Martini, and the other one got the Flaming Colossus Martini. we switched to try the flavors, each of them was great. I loved the fact that it wasn't sugar loaded, but it had the sweet touch (not the sugar overdose) along with the fruit flavor. It's a great place to go with friends and your long time certain someone. The crowd was nice and not pretentious an overall had good atmosphere. . . Enjoy your martinis!!!!
