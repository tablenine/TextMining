I'm absolutely in love.  Not only does this place have delicious food at student-foodie prices, the decor and design are absolutely charming.  I've been here twice now and the first time I had the Louie Salad.  My friends ordered the meatball sandwich, turkey club, and chicken parmesan sandwich.  Although I was very happy with my choice, seeing how it was such a hot day, once I looked across the table at my friend's meatball sandwich (where each meatball comes with its own bun) I needed to come back and try it.   Unfortunately, my second visit was a Sunday where brunch, salads and pizza are only served.  No worries though, I was very happy with my eggs benedict and potato pancake.   Lastly, the service is friendly and their pastry case looks absolutely amazing.  Warning: the place can get busy so if you are in a rush, head over to the take out counter--most of the menu is available there.  Bottega Louie is a true gem in the roughness of Downtown.
