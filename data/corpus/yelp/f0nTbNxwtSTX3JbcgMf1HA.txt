Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Fried chicken and waffles go together like peas and carrots! Who knew? . . I liked Roscoe's from the start. Before I even crossed the threshold, I was sold. This place is authentic from head to toe. When we were seated we discovered that Bartles &amp; Jaymes was a beverage option. Ummm... lemme see... yeah, we'll take 2 of those. I ordered the #1 with 2 waffles and 2 pieces of fried chicken.  The anticipation of waiting for my food was nearly unbearable. Thank god I had my Mojito flavored B&amp;J to pass the time.  When the food arrived, it was on.  A buddy of mine once told me that if I ever go to Roscoe's I have to put hot sauce on the chicken and then take a bite of waffles with syrup. Sounds bizarre, right? It is oh so right. Trust me.. . As we were nearing the end of our scrumptious meal I took notice that none other Vince Vaughn himself was sitting right next to us. I shit you not! It was the perfect exclamation point to the magic that was Roscoe's.
