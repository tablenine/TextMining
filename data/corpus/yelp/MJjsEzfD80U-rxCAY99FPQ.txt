Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've been here twice and I'm still not sure what all the hype is about their hot dogs. I didn't think it was that outstanding. To me, it was a bit on the salty side. But I do like all the framed pictures in the seating area. It's kind of cool to know that you're eatting at a place that a lot of celebrities have tried. I guess you should just go to say you've eaten a pink's hot dog before.
