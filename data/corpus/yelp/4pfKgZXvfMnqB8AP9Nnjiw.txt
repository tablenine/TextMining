Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This place was recommended by my sister and I took my ex here many years ago to celebrate his birthday. We failed to make reservation and was told that we had about 2-hour wait. We were horrified but could not drive back home as it was a long drive from Orange County. . . The waiting room was huge so I guessed that this happened often with a lot of people. Still, we couldn't find a seat. And, we were extremely hungry. The idea of a 2-hour wait was left to be desired. And, about 30 minutes into the wait they took out free hors d'oeuvre. So, we both munched as much as we can as it was quite a fight with a roomful of people. Coincidentally, 10 minutes later after we were both full... we were called to the table. (roll eyes). . The meal came in a cart and the chef cut it in front of us so it was fresh. We both had the lawry's cut prime rib and I had a martini. The martini was so delicious that I had a refill and gotten a bit tipsy. My ex loved the food and we were both acting the whole Olde English character.... it was so much fun. It was the first prime rib I had ever eaten. I was not a fan of this "raw" and tasteless meat but I enjoyed the atmosphere.. . My ex told me bad news that he did not see a future with us and left me with the bill (his birthday). We dated for 4 more years and cohabitated but nevertheless... the place left a bad taste in my mouth. Good thing I had the 2 martinis. ;)
