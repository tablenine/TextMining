I can definately see the appeal this place might offer to some people. It is normally crowded with fashionable, well-to-do types and one of those River North joints you commonly hear name-dropped by trendy and pretentious individuals. My particular experience just turned out to be a series of awkward moments and stale dessert. . . I came in here to get some post-dinner drinks and dessert with my twin sis and beautiful Mom. After a few minutes of being seated, our waitress springs to our table with a bottle of champagne and tells us it is compliments of the table behind us. A little bashful and flattered, we turn around and see a group of portly, older males. Although we were a little flattered, this set an awkward tone for our dining experience especially after they toasted to "three beautiful ladies!" We snapped our heads back after mustering out a brief "Thanks" Â and tried not to make eye contact the rest of the night. I actually felt guilty drinking the champagne and it seemed they were watching us the whole time. It's not like we could have turned it down but since we never asked for it, we knew we didn't owe this group of males anything. . . Onto dessert. We ordered a brownie, which was cold and hard. I would expect an apparently high caliber place like this to nail something as foolproof as a brownie. Bring on the warm, gooey, fudginess next time please. . . I really think this place would be nice meet-up spot for cocktails, but unfortunately I think I stumbled in at an inopportune time when we were unlucky enough to catch the eyes of some older, unhealthy looking male tourists that must have wandered over from Rainforest Cafe. Watch out ladies dining at Hub 51, you could be next. Also, thumbs down for a rock hard brownie.
