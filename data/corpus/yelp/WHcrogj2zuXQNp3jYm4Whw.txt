Restaurant: Toast Bakery Cafe
Category: American (New)
Ever since Doughboys on 3rd was shut down (again!) for vermin, I've been an even bigger fan of Toast ;-). . Pros: easy seating at off-hours + dinnertime; great bakery selection and killer banana pudding; decent food with large portions and nice breakfast options. . Cons: not gourmet (but not bad by any stretch); seating is a total nightmare during weekend brunch, breakfast time etc.; parking is rough
