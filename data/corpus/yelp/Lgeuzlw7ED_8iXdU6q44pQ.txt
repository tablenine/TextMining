Love The Veggie Grill! Great "burgers", amazing sweet potato fries, and decent prices. I would give 5 stars if they had diet soda. I know this place is healthy and organic, but I don't really care about that. I'd like a chemical filled Diet Coke with my vegan portabella mushroom sandwich, please. ;)
