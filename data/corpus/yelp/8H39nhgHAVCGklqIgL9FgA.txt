Went today (Sunday ) for lunch. I wasn't too impressed. . The Bloody Mary's were overpriced and weren't good, they tasted like diluted cocktail sauce, very spicy (if you get heartburn, steer clear). The food was good, portions were small. I had the Eggs/Corn beef Hash scramble, my girlfriends had burgers...they looked good but they were charred, the bun was burnt too. French Fries were really good.. I won't be back here to eat, the outdoor seating looked inviting though.. Oh the best part of the trip...the bathrooms.
