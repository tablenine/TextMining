Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  Housing one of Atlanta's finest southern-style chefs, Scott Peacock, the decor is unobtrusive, albeit lends itself to a rather inflated noise level.  Tolerating that noise level, though is more than worth it.  The Shrimp and Grits are outstanding.  The bread it is served with is a meal unto itself.  Although previous reviewers have remarked about the salads, I usually opt for their hearty soups, which are simply delicious.  This weekend I had a puree of cauliflower soup.. . Although I have had and enjoyed their fried chicken which is only available early on Tuesday evenings, my FAVORITE dish by far is their beef stroganoff.  This is one of their seasonal items that is only available in the fall and winter, but it easily one of the tastiest I have EVER had.  Every time I go I order a second order to go.. . Their "Very Good Chocolate Cake" is second to none and served with fresh whipped cream.. . Ask for Christian if you go...He is wonderful and has been taking care of us for years!  Sometimes he has hair, sometimes he doesn't...but he is just the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet!. . Go try it!  Avoid the salad...enjoy everything else!
