The pastries are soooo amazing &amp; the food's quite all right too.. . Hate the line.  Hate the struggle of getting a table, then weaving back there with my coffee cup wobbling.  Hate the prices.  Anyplace that charges what they do shouldn't make you wait in line to order.. . Ahhh, but the pastries.   Did I mention how expensive they are?  Good.  That's what keeps me from camping out and stuffing my face all day.
