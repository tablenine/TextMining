Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I returned to David Burke with three friends, to enjoy a dinner.  Our experience was simply awful.  The service was spotty.  That could be forgiven if the food weren't simply awful.  Our party literally laughed at how bad the food was.  The blue cheese iceberg wedge salad was the smallest I've ever seen - literally a few inches of lettuce, with a sprinkling of blue cheese dressing.  The steaks were very poorly cooked.  The prices were just obscene for the value delivered.  I eat out often, and do not mind paying the high prices charged at such establishments, but at the prices charged by David Burke, we all expected better.  Chicago has plenty of options for fine dining, for steaks.  Regretably, this is no longer one of those establishments.  I will not be returning.
