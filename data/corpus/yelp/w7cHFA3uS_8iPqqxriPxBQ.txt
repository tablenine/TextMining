Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
I don't know what all the fuss is about...the food is spotty at best. I went once during restaurant week last year, and had an amazing meal (mmm scallops). I went back a couple months ago and had the worst calamari and worst chicken parmesan in my life. The decor is really cool, and yes there is black toilet paper in the bathroom. But other than that, it's really expensive and only worth it on Mondays when the food is 50% off.
