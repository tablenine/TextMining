Wow, I can't believe all the negative Market reviews.  You Yelpers sure are harsh!  Well I agree to a point with you because when your website states "Mondays: 50% off everything," you expect it to be true. The waiter my partner and I that they changed the deal to be only for those who are industry workers.  Bullocks!  . . As for everything the rest of the evening: . ~Ambiance: Ultra Modern (loved the bamboo booth, rectangular cut ceilings and X-Ray light fixtures on the lower level).. ~Food: Chic American (HUGE Turkey burger with turkey bacon and a side of truffle fries, mmm mmm good).  The popcorn chicken and cotton candy dessert have adorable presentation.. ~Service: Fair and square; nada especial.. ~Seating: Super spacious and comfortable with a great outdoor patio for those few nice days of the year.  All have TV views.. . For future patron's reference: The WiFi password is "market1113" and the bathrooms have those awkward attendents (so have a tip ready in hand--they even have everything from candy, gum, cigs and much more up their sleeves).
