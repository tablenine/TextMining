Restaurant: Porchetta
Category: Sandwiches
pork, pork, pork. I am always impressed by the different ways it can be prepared. 'Porchetta' is cute, small and serves a mean sandwich, I will agree it is over-priced and maybe even a bit too fatty. $7 would be a perfect lunch price, seeing as they only serve the sandwich. Â If you want to brush up on your Italian I think this is a great place to go. Although 2 other pork preferences I might take over Porchetta; one being the braised pork at Da Silvano and another most recent find on a great site called Behind the Burner is the porcelet at South Gate. Pork's coming back so it's good to know what's the best!
