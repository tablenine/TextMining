Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
When walking up and seeing Pizza and Pasta on the building I wasn't sure what to expect from Bossa Nova.. . First the menu is big, lots of choices from the sandwiches, salads, pasta, and pizza. . . They start you off with a basket of garlic bread that wasn't too bad. I had the Copacabana sandwich, is suppose to be a version of the Philly Cheesesteak, Â which comes with a side of plantains or I believe it you can also order mashpotatoes and my friend had the Chicken Stroganoff. Both of them were pretty tasty but something was still missing.. . The Place itself is pretty small. They have a slim patio if front of the building with about 6 tables, three when you walk in, and then the rest on the side of the building.. . All and all I had a good experience but not great. I suggest you go to Cafe Brasil on Venice Blvd. which is more authentic and no pizza and pasta =)
