Gross!  The taste, the place, the service and specially the kitchen.  The server was smoking outside while I was entering, he asked me what I wanted, how the hell should I know he is the server when he is standing on the side walk.  Whatever, I go in.  It is dirty as it had been the past 3 times I visited.  Whatever again, I sit with my friends, who for some reason frequent this place.  The server kept grabbing my coffee cup by the rim while refilling.  When I asked him to hold it by the handle he looks at me like I am a bitch.  Wait a minute, he should thank me for teaching him how to fill coffee properly.  The filthy stench from the bathroom the dirty ass kitchen with sweat and snot dropping on the food, the food tasting like cardboard I was done with my food in a couple bites.  Never again am I subjecting myself to humiliation, degradation and sickening food.  Yuck!
