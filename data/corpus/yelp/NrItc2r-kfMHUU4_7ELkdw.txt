Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I don't even really like sandwiches. I know that's a ridiculous declaration but it's true. However, I'd 100% definitely come back to try more of Jerry's tasty bread and topping based concoctions.  The beer list is admirable and long, and the sides are tasty and almost (almost) outshine the sammiches.  Great place for meat lovers, omnivores, and the angry vegans to meet and "break bread" together.
