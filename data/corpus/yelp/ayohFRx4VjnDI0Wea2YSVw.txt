like Ivan says reviewing this place is like pissing in the ocean. So I wont. However I will share the secret to enjoying this place without the hassle of waiting in line. You will never see me waiting in line for food. I refuse. Â Order ahead and take your food to go. Always ask for extra salsa. And take your ass over to the Crestlawn Cemetery up the block. It's nice and quite. I like dining with the dead much better than the living. They say fewer stupid things. . I will say in my opinion the food here is nothing like the food served in the town for which it is named. But for us Atlanta's who like our Mexican food numbered for us, it's pretty ok.
