Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
This past Friday night my boy Piff Herrera &amp; I decided to hit Roscoe's at 9pm, We arrived around 11:30p-(We had to hit up CVS real quick to buy some alcohol). It was pretty lovely. My Waffles &amp; Mac 'N Cheese were so MACKIN'. The Cheese from the Macaroni practically melted in my mouth. (Totally turned me on). Roscoe's isn't as ghetto as people make it out to be. There's nothing but white people trying to be "ghetto", NOT COOL !. . Like, seriously. Just because you're wearing a BANDANA w/ a RVCA shirt &amp; sagging VOLCOM jeans doesn't make you ghetto. You look silly. I'm surprised they didn't bust out the C-WALK while sitting in their chair(s).. . People do the dumbest shit sometimes Â =). . Peace to the Sunset &amp; my parking ticket.
