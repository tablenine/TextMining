Does this go under "local flavor" or a "restaurant"?. . This is not really a restaurant, it's more of a joint where you go in, order a falafel and go. . They had only 4 seats in this joint which have you facing the passerby as you stuff your face with an over-stuffed falafel (okay I made it a point to stuff some extra fixins into mine and I was pretty much making a huge mess on myself). I went around 11pm and it was empty so I had my picks of where to seat without being disturbed or rushed. . . I'm not a falafel connoisseur by any means; I eaten less than 10 in my life. So what's so interesting about this place? Well a falafel is just a falafel in my opinion...but the many options of fixins offered won me over.  . The price was also cheap(fits right into my student budget). . I received a nice falafel (which I got to stuff to my hearts content at the salad bar), a nice side of fries (my guilty pleasure), and a nice size drink (I got the carrot juice) all for less than $9.  I ordered the "Small" meal but I was really stuffed. You can get hummus or eggplant for an extra fee of $0.70.. . If you are in the area and just want to grab something quick without thinking about it, this is a nice cheap place to visit and get your grub on. . . I left feeling satisfied and really full, but not in the greasy "oh-man-I-have-to-run-10miles-to-burn-this-off" kinda way.
