Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I don't understand the hype about this place. OK, I admit, staying up watching late night tv, their commercials are a little amusing because they're so corny, but the food isn't all that great. Cheap, yes it is, but it's hard to sell me on hardshell -gringoized tacos that taste bland compared to tacos you can get at jack in the box, on top of that, when the cheese you use looks like it came pre-shredded in a bag that says KRAFT on it, the ratings go even lower. BTW I hate watery salsa, the salsa here is more like tomato puree. But hey if you're in a bind on cash and you need food... Tito's it is.
