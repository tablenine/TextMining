This place is one of my FAVS!!!!  I used to go there once a week.  (It never got old, I just moved away.)  I am a big fan of good chicken and sides.  Their pulled chicken is very juicy and tasty.  Their chicken fingers are the best since Houston's.  They get your food out soooooo quick, but not too quick to enjoy their AWESOME cornbread and TASTY rolls.  Sometimes I make a meal off the bread and 2 sides and take the rest home.  : )  And the servers are always so nice!!!
