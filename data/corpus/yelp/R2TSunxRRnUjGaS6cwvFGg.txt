Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Your not going to get the same experience if you in say, Taiwan with Din Tai Fung (which I have been to), but it will be close!. You should only be getting dumplings because you have a limited amount of space in your belly.. imagine little bubbles of deliciousness bursting with broth and meat inside your mouth. Its better than that.. The store hours are a little weak. They close inbetween lunch and dinner. The nice thing about it is, even though they close pretty early and usually have a line you have to wait in, as long as your on the waiting list you can still put in an order and eat, past the closing time if you were waiting for a table.
