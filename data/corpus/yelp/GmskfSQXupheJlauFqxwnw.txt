I went here last night after a year absence, excited for their delicious apple cider and buffalo tofu bites that I used to get... The cider was lukewarm* and didn't have the usual whipped cream and caramel on it; Â the tofu bites were soggy. What is going on here? . . The waitress added whipped cream and caramel to our ciders but by then they were pretty cold. I still ate most of the tofu bites. I probably won't be back for a while. . . *If you come here and order a cider, I suggest asking them to make it 'extra hot'
