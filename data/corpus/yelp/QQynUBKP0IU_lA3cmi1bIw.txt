I was starving after I got off the plane so my friend and I wanted some sushi-we checked into our hotel and set off for some hopefully yummy sushi! I come to LA a lot (my company is based out of LA) and surprised I missed this place! I also must have went on a good night-we came in a little early for the dinner rush because it was a little empty when we first came in but the place was packed by the time we left. . . We also went on 50% off Monday (from what our waiter said it happens every Monday-so if you want to try out a lot of the menu for a little cheaper than usual-try it out on Monday!) Almost everything is 50% off except for things like Kobe beef and such. Our waiter, hostess and servers were the best and the service was excellent! Food came out quick and tasted really great. The waiter said if we wanted anything special because I am a picky eater and allergic to a lot of items that they would be more than happy to do that...many sushi places in Chicago that I have been to are very strict on substitutions-so having this offered straight up was awesome before I even asked. . . They had a lot of options on the menu as well-which I liked, sushi, noodles, hot dishes and cold dishes....I would go back if I was staying longer. . . Go take a sushi loving friend and try it out...I'll be back again...
