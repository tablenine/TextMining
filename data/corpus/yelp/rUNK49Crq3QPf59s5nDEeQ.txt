Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I went here one morning when there was no line just to see why there is always a huge crowd for a hot dog. The hot dog was ok. I think people go here to waste time when they are bored. There's no food worth standing in a hour line for especially a damn hot dog. You can't go here hungry you have to go when you THINK you may be hungry in an hour or so. lol.. . Check out Earl's on Crenshaw and Rodeo. Great dogs, short line.
