I joined Yelp just so I could review my favorite place to eat, Katsuya Studio City. The sushi here is mouth watering. It is like your mouth having an orgasm. I dream of it at night. I annoy people during the day by talking about it constantly. A list of my favorite things.... . -Baked Crab Hand Roll. -Yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos. -Albacore sashimi with crispy onions. -Creamy rock shrimp tempura. -Spicy tuna on crispy rice. -Spanish mackerel sashimi. -Lobster dynamite. -EVERYTHING ELSE. . Oh god, I want it right now. It should be illegal it's so damn good! Good luck getting through to their constantly off the hook phone, but other than that, you are in for a treat! Also, this location has better food than the rest of them (not to mention-no struggling actors serving your food), so it is worth a drive to the Valley.
