My goodness I was stuffed.  I think this is the best diner in the metro area.  I love the fact that they give you a piece of Spinach Pie aka Spanicopita with your entree.  I've been in Atlanta for many years and had never dined at this place until the featured it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food TV
