Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Soowon Galbi...great place to hang your hat and dine. . . In the tradition of Korean BBQ restaurants, Soowon Galbi does not disappoint. We ordered the house marinaded spare rib with ribeye steak. I figured it was too much for the two of us, but better safe than sorry :) It was a long day volunteering for RAM (Remote Air Medical). The ribeye was tender and O so savory. The marinaded spare rib was adequate, but not bad relative to other K BBQ's. . . What won me over however, was their banchan. Light flavors, excellent variety, and plenty of helpings, what more could you ask for...Well maybe a better location for the restaurant. . . 4 out of 5 stars. One less star due to the terrible location, and smokey grill. I did smell of Korean BBQ when I left, but that was a small price to pay for the experience. . . Date of visit: 04/30/3010 . Party size: 2 . Bill: ~ $62.00 before tip
