I have been to other Boilng Crab locations, this one is still my favorite.  Yes, even on a weekday night, the wait can be about 30 minutes and i always ended up parking on the street.  Everytime I was here, I got King Crab legs, cat-fish basket, corn and sometimes the Chicken Wing.  All Sha-Bang is the best flavor to order, it contains all the possible flavors you can get, love the celery powder smell.  The cat-fish basket includes the cajun fries, my favorite fries so far...the king crab legs are fresh and sweet..the corn are so delicious, they usually put it with the shrimp or king crab legs you order.  Even mild is pretty spicy already...so be prepared...Tried the crawfish, maybe the season is not right when I ordered they tasted like they have been sitting in the freezer for too long.  The shrimp tasted fine...but still king crab legs are the best.
