Was here on a Friday morning around 11:30...more for brunch really.  The place was packed but we found rock star parking in front - it was a metered parking but whoever was there last still had a little less than an hour of time left - score!  We walked in and asked for a table for two - we were seated right away.  I ordered two banana nana flap jacks and we also ordered a spinach tomato something omelet (we were sharing).  The order arrived after about 10 minutes - surprising since the place was soo busy.  The pancakes were bigger than the plate they were served on!  The omelet was delish and flavorful and the serving size was perfect for two.  Overall I was very happy with the meal and I would definitely return with a bigger appetite.
