Very pretty upscale-ish eatery in a hip hood. . . Yes, I liked the food. It's a California take on Vietnamese. We shared yam and shrimp fritters, which came with lettuce to roll them up in; banana leaf fish - sweet smoky flavors and a delicious slaw-like salad side; tofu summer rolls Â - light and fresh. . . The veggie sides of sauteed bok choy and seared long beans were very yummy. The long beans were especially tasty, with a flavor so hearty I almost thought it was meat. Even the brown rice and broken jasmine rice were good. . . Fried banana spring rolls were the dessert hit of the evening. The coconut lime bars were far too intense to be eaten. They were left on the plate. White sangria was a perfect beverage with the meal.. . Service was rather sloppy, there was no serving ware brought with the dishes. The kitchen is open to view, which is fine except that the view was of the dirty floor and the stacks of dishes. The ordering counter hides the view of the kitchen floor on the cooks side of the kitchen. Kitchen view of cooking is nice; kitchen floor, not so nice.
