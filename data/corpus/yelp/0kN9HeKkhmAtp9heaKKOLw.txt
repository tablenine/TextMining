I live in Silverlake and I have a rotation of about three restaurants that I usually go for brunch, and this is one of them.  But I'm not totally sure why...  The food is pretty standard LA, breakfast being their best meal of the day.  The prices are pretty standard LA as well, not really cheap but not expensive either.  The staff isn't particularly nice and while it has an interesting atmosphere, the decor isn't anything to write home about.  (If it's a nice day, you should definitely sit outside.)  And yet... I find myself coming back here.. . Maybe it's that it's open 24 hours, which gets serious points even though I'm usually going there for breakfast.  Maybe it's because it's so convenient and simple.  Maybe it's because the food is comforting and homey (try one of the great egg sandwiches for breakfast, or try the chicken noodle soup if you're there for lunch, it has cilantro in it).  I can't say for sure, but I will keep coming back, so they must be doing something right.. . P.S.  I forced myself to go out to dinner alone one night after some friends had to cancel on me, and I thought this would be a casual place where no one would pay me much attention and I wouldn't feel embarrassed.  I was wrong.  I tried to sit in a booth but they told me that if I was eating alone I'd have to sit at the bar, like a leper.  Okay, maybe I'm being too sensitive about this, but I would strike this from your list of restaurants to eat alone at without feeling like a loser.
