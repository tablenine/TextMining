A wonderful local breakfast/brunch cafe!  My friend took my bf and me here for our last meal in Chicago before leaving town.  . . I got the Banana Spiked French Toast and my bf the Sassy Eggs.  Everything looked so decadent and yummy!!. . My french toast was definitely more like a dessert, with bananas and custard sandwiched between two slices of french toast and all drizzled with caramel sauce.  So awesome!  . . My bf's sassy eggs was seriously a work of art, with two eggs served over chorizo-potato hash with cheddar cheese, red peppers, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, &amp; ancho ketchup.  His breakfast looked good, and he confirmed that it went down just as good too.. . Service was very good, with servers frequently coming back to check up on us and offer us more coffee.  We were actually a group of 3 squished into a small table against the wall at first.  The waiters had kindly offered to move us to a center table once something had opened up.  They probably did it because we were a fire hazard, but it was still nice that they offered to move us and even moved all of our coffee and drinks over for us as well.
