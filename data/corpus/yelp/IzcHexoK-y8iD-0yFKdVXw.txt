Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
I'm going to CUT to the chase...BRILLIANT! . . Hands down the BEST. . . Sidebar is a great place to hang out before dinner...so arrive early...your table may be a bit late anyway...try some snacks off the bar menu. . . As for CUT itself all I can say is the place ROCKS. . . You cannot go wrong with any menu choice. EVERYTHING is amazing. . . Service is OUTSTANDING and FRIENDLY! Really. If you're thinking you're going to come here as a "nobody" (and 99.5% of us are) don't fret...it's COMPLETELY the opposite! . . ALBERT (who appears to be the manager, he didn't exactly identify his position) is the BOMB. I did not know the guy...he did not know me...yet he treated me and my group like a bunch of celebrities...not sure why...but he was INCREDIBLE and NICE. . . Yeah, I know this is in the Beverly Wilshire...blah blah blah...and it's very likely a celeb or two may be in the room...but the place is very relaxed and fun (as is dress...but hey, Earl from Missouri...don't wear shorts and your cream puff eating contest t-shirt and flip flops!) and just quite chill! . . Check out the lobby bar...of the hotel...wind your way through...you'll find it...coooool.
