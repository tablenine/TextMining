I really enjoyed this place. Great atmosphere, great food, great service!. I ordered the Seared Tuna and it had a combination of ingredients that I would've never think of combining and it was the best way I have tried seared tuna. The combination of the tomatillo sauce with the sweet mash and the perfectly cooked tuna were amazing.. The dessert was delicious! Perfect combination of Kahlua ice cream, Chocolate and Peanut Butter...really enjoyed it!. Appetizers are really good as well, we tried two types of tacos (pork and fish) very yummy. And of course a cold Dos Equis beer! . Would definitely go back!
