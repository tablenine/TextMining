Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Famous for all the wrong reasons.  Kind of like a celebrity that went downhill.  You know who I'm referring to.  . . There's a lot of hype around this spot for no apparent reason - let me break it down for you.. . It's a hot dog.  Piled on with stuff.  Like beans, or cheese, or sour cream.  Talk about ridiculous...  If you like a hodge podge of heavy american flavors with loads of calories, this might be for you.. . My eating experience here reminds me of this video I saw on SNL....  . http://www.hulu.com/wa....
