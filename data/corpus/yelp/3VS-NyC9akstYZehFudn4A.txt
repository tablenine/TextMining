Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
To begin, Reza's gets four stars because my dad's name is Reza.. Next, I have only ordered the Koobideh and it was much better than anything I could get in Denver so that also moves it to the four star range.  . The rice was fine, but I always want more grilled tomato than any persian place will give me.  . The space is quite large and I am going to see if they have persian dancing any nights of the week because I miss my people.  I am going to definitely come back for that and more Kabob....yumm yumm
