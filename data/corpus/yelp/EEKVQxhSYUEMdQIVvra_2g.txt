I had to see what the big fuss was about this store that has milk bottles as their sign (which i think is so adorable I want to give it a big hug~!). . . So my girls and I drove over to get some MILK lovin'. Parking was NOT pleasant as the store is located on a street corner. We had to turn into the resident area and park there. . . The store offered many delights from sweet libations of shakes, soda, coffee, tea to baked goods and ice-cream. But we girls had one thing in mind...the BLUE VELVET CAKE and for me, the grasshopper due to the much appraisal of fellow yelpers. . . But sadly, there were no more grasshopper, so I decided to get the ladybug which was strawberry ice-cream with mini chocolate chips mixed in, sandwiched between two pink cookies, and half dipped in chocolate. The ice-cream I have to say was pretty good as I could taste it was handmade. But the cookie was so hard and the sandwich was so big, it was kind of messy and hard to eat. The blue velvet cake was interesting since it was so bright blue. The cake was moist and the creamy frosting was sweet. . . Later that night after resting off our sugar rush, one of my friends decided to leave on my wall, "I hope you enjoyed the cake. I also heard that this cake makes your poop turn blue". Ummmm....blue poo? I forgot to check this time, but maybe this will be a good excuse to eat the cake again. Sorry about the TMI. . . Happy Eating~!
