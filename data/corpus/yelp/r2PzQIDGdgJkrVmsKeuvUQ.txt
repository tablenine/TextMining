I love this place.  My favorite Korean restaurant in Atlanta.  I love the little fried fish they give you along with the other little appetizers before your main course, and I love their sundubu.  The seafood pancakes are great too.  In fact, I've never had a bad dish here.  One thing I've noticed is that when I come here with other non-asians, they sometimes don't give me the fish, so I have to ask for it.  Same goes for the bodi-cha (barley tea) - good stuff, but sometimes they assume non-Koreans won't want it, so you have to specifically ask for it.. . Anyway, great food.  I highly recommend this place.
