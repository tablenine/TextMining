Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I live close by and always see the place packed, so I thought I'd give it a shot.. . My wife and I ate the following:. . Umami Burger. Hatch Burger. Onion Rings. Fries. . Thoughts on Food: as the rating states... "Meh, I've experienced better."  Everything was unnecessarily greasy and the Hatch Burger's chili's weren't spicy nor flavorful.  The Umami burger and catchup both tasted of "umami", but did it taste like a $9 burger?  Definitely not.. . Fries were good, but inconsistently so.  I'd say about 1/3 of them were undercooked.. . Onion rings were fair to good.. . 2 burgers, 2 sides, a couple sodas, tax, tip = $40.. . In this economy, not a good value.  Even in a good economy, not worth splurging for.. . Side note: ambiance was just okay.  A little too pretentious for a burger joint.   . . My advice: give bigger portions and try turning down the music
