Restaurant: Grand Lux Cafe
Category: American (New)
This restaurant is so garishly decorated that I swear Liberace was commissioned to design the joint and I was ready to go searching for his diamond encrusted grand piano that I'm sure they stowed away somewhere safe.. . Our waiter told us that Grand Lux is owned by Cheesecake Factory and to expect large portions. Does this give you the indication that everything is over the top? Nevertheless the Cobb salad I ordered was excellent. I was really surprised! Imagine that. What made it so great was the thick cut bacon. Yeah, everything goes better with bacon..... . My companion order the goat cheese appetizer salad and that looked good too. Â Hmmm, alrighty then. I must stop myself from downing the star rating. Must be the wait staff combined with the decor. For some reason the wait staff seemed very inexperienced. Plus the food is another version of the Cheesecake Factory.. . On the plus side parking is only $1 for the first two hours and Loehmann's is right there. . . Gotta love that right?
