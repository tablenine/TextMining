This has been my all time favorite Thaifood for about 7 years!!!! Super authentic, great for late night (I think they are open til 4am still), friendly staff, reasonable price and the best food ever!!! Dishes that are notable would be the papaya salad, fried morning glory, tom young gong, coconut chicken soup, pad ka prow, pad key mau, pad see eww, larb (I like it with fried tofu for my vegi friends), spicy catfish, whole pampano fish, pork jerky, shrimp cake, garlic shrimp, kai jao, egg w/ salty turnup, spicy beef salad, ok so almost everything there is awesome....Love the thai coffee too. Go here and you won't be disapointed just make sure to order alot family style...I used to drag 5-10 people with just so we could order more and all get a taste.
