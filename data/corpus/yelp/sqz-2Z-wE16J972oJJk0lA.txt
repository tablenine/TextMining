I came her probably around 2am. I seem to only come here at such hours. Late night munchies... can't do anything about it except eat and fulfill that need for something delicious, cheap, and delightful. . . I don't ever order when I come. There is always someone who will take control and go crazy with the menu. I just inhale the food, but what I remember CLEARLY is that papaya salad. Mmmm mmm goood. Never have I eaten something that was ordered at a MEDIUM spicy level and had my mouth on fiyahhh. I don't know how people eat that if its SPICY. But damn, that's a good refreshing papaya salad. I wasn't even in the mood for something cold, but that spicay flavaa turns up the heat. The other thing that stood out on its own was the coconut soup with chicken. I don't know why, but it was hot, sour, &amp; sweet all at once. Over rice is the best. The other items were good, but a lot of things are good, &amp; these two dishes are what I would come back for in a heartbeat knowing that I will be completely satisfied at 2am.
