I was quiet impressed with this place. There were some bad reviews on the food of the restaurant, but overall I like the items I ordered:. . *baked lobster rolls. *salmon skin salad. *chicken wings. *dynamite. . I wish I had more room in my stomach to try the tempera ice cream. . . I would go back again - for a trendy nice environment, close distance to where I live, creative
