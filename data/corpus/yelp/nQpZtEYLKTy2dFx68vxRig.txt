So we popped into Baraonda after sneaking out of a horrible presentation of Grease at the Fox. After such disappointment at the theater, we were really hoping to turn around the evening with some good food. We weren't disappointed.. . We started with a Caprese salad that was a great way to start the meal. For my main dish I ordered a wood-fired pizza since that seemed to be what many other folks were ordering. Â Not sure the name of the pizza but it had broccoli, zucchini, onions, roasted red peppers, and very little cheese (if any). The crust was thin and crispy, and the toppings were light a very tasty. It certainly wasn't the kind of pizza that I would go back to if I had a real hankering for pizza, but as an off-the-beaten-path kind of pizza, I couldn't have been happier.. . Service was good, the place was maybe a little loud, but other than that, it was a solid dining experience.
