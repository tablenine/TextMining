I will have to say that this place deserves a definite A+ for the idea, interior, and outstanding service. . . However, the quality and taste of food really has room for improvement. My soup tasted plain, and my friend's food was flavorless and tasted old to her. I am not sure if this is due to the time of our visit (a very early dinner at 5:30pm on a Monday, and we were almost the only ones there) but it definitely won't be on my top 20 list to go back... ever.
