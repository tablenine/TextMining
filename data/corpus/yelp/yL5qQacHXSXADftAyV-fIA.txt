Super hip sausage joint.  Many options ranging from your traditional brats to your more exciting rattlesnake and rabbit varieties.  Pick your flavor and your toppings and type of mustard.  The only downside is the long line, so if you want another you have to get back in line, while your friends chill at the table in the other room, so be sure to get your order right from the start.  Be sure to get a brew to go along with the meal.. . ---. Union Station and all the transit that serves it is just a short walk away.
