Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
The Veggie Grill is one of the best places to eat in the South Bay.  I recommend the Santa Fe Chicken sandwitch, upgrade to the sweet potatoe french fries, a fresh lemonade, and if you have room, their carrot cake.  Hard to believe this food is vegan...it is simply amazing.. . Great value for the price. It is not cheap, but not expensive - right in the middle.  The quality is amazing.. . The food is very kid-friendly. They give out wiki-sticks for the kids to play with while they wait for their food. They're fun for adults, too!. . You can eat a lot of food here and still feel good about yourself knowing everything is healthy!. . The only reason for the 4 stars is the seating. There is a lot of seating, both indoor and outdoor, but the chairs are all hard plastic, and the bench seats are solid wood.  Has a very eco-friendly feel to the whole place, but some padding on the bench seats would be nice.. . When it first opened, it seemed like a ghost town in there.  Through word of mouth, the news has spread, and this place can get crowded both at lunch and dinner time. The good part is that the food comes relatively quickly (I've never waited more than 5 minutes). You can always sip on your drink while you wait for your food.  When dining in, you get a number, and they bring your food to your table...a nice touch!
