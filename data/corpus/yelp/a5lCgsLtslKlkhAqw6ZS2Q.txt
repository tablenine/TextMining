Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
First, the food was excellent, the service was superb. My dinner companions and I enjoyed the variety of bread served at the beginning and they never pushed the wine on us. However, Wolfgang what is the deal with the 80's music blaring into the dining room. . . "Could it be Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' playing in the background?" It totally transformed my experience at Spago. Killing the vibe. I thought this place was more sophisticated. Shout out to 'Lowrider Magazine," they played the song before the entree arrived, yo.. . This is still one of those landmark places you tell your friends about from out of state. Â So when they ask me about Spago's I will tell them, "It felt like being in someone's house, rather than a restaurant." If that is the ambiance you want, then Spago's is the place. Make sure you wear your "Members Only" jacket so you can rock out to the 80's.. . If you would rather stay home and listen to XM radio, just order in for the same effect.
