Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Both Philippe the Original and Cole's Pacific Electic Buffet claim to have invented the French Dip sandwich, and I guess I don't blame them for fighting over it: it's a delicious treat!  Philippe offers a number of different sandwiches, including turkey, pork, cheese, and, of course, roast beef.  You've gotta try the classic once, but my preference is the turkey French Dip sandwich.  With cheese.  You've gotta have cheese with it.. . Anyway, Phillipe is a must see experience in LA.  At lunch on weekdays, the lines are insanely long, filled with a wide variety of clientele, though mostly politicians, lawyers, and businessmen from the Civic Center area.  And although there are some places where the lines move quickly (see, e.g., Mendocino Farms at the Water Court), they move VERY SLOWLY at Philippe.  I suppose it is pretty amazing that they make your food right as you order it, though, so there's no additional waiting once it's your turn at the front of the line.. . Ultimately, the food is amazing and the prices are equally great, so when you're eating in one of the self-serve booths, surrounded by sawdust on the floor, you quickly forget about the 20 minutes you just spent in line to get that sandwich.  And if you're eating in, the lemonade and coffee is so cheap it's basically free, which is a nice bonus.
