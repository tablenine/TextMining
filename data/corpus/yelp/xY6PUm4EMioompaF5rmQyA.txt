Restaurant: Oinkster
Category: Burgers
The Belgian fries are good. Especially good with Oinkster's garlic aioli. In fact, the only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because of their fries and garlic aioli. Otherwise, I would give it only one star.. . The pastrami sandwich and cheeseburger were very disappointing. My local Italian deli makes a better pastrami sandwich and I dare say my homemade burger is better than Oinkster's. . . I expected the food to take a while, but it was extremely slow. I can't recommend this place to anyone, but I know people will go because of all the hype. I won't be back.
