Don't go in here expecting it to be a Mexican restaurant, it isn't even close.  It's a cool bar that happens to serve southwestern-ish cuisine.  Everything I've had on the menu has been great, I definitely recommend the Philly Taco and the Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla.  Their Buffalo sauce is magnificent, I wish they had wings as well.  . . The staff is very friendly and if you hang out long enough, you will almost certainly be served a free kamikaze.
