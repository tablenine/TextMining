Went there for lunch on a monday afternoon.  My friend was visiting from NY and somehow he found himself in San Pedro.  I blame his gps for leading him astray, and i laud my impeccable direction giving skills for getting him to this dining establishment so we both didn't have to starve.. . Mebe cuz it was monday, it wasn't too busy.  We were promptly seated.  Well, it was more like i was promptly seated and then joined by my hapless friend 30 mins later.  but regardless the hostess and the waiter were very nice.  we ordered a few dishes, a tomato salad - caprese  (tomato felt a bit too cold and hard as if it was frozen), a pasta - tagliatelle bolognese (i liked how the pasta was cooked - al dente - but the sauce wasn't all that great...kinda watery), an eggplant caponata (good, but a wee bit too sweet), and jambon serrano (prolly the best dish).  actually the best dish was prolly the macaroons that the manager gave us on the house (she's a sis-in-law of my friend).. . anyways, i liked the decor - it's very open and airy.  kinda reminded me of dean and deluca stores from ny, except a lot nicer.  i should prolly try  their pizzas and other main dishes...
