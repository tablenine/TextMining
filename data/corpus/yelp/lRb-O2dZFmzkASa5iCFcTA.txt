I agree with other reviewers......not really sure what all the hype is about.  I would give them 2 1/2 stars if I could.. . I remembered this place from back in the day, when a big group of us would come for the pizza after sports events.  Now, after several years of employment at different restaurants and pizza joints, I finally returned.  We were quoted 25 minutes for the wait, but it took about 40. Although.......they allowed us to drink our beers on the sidewalk while we waited - which was a plus.. . Service was good, but the food was just ok.   We ordered the Sausage sandwich, cheese pizza, and pesto pasta.  The sausage was recommended to me because "they make it there", but I was just unimpressed.  Even though the pesto pasta was very good, the sandwich was just bland and boring.  So was the pizza - kinda like a cracker with seasonings, marinara and a light dusting of  mozzarella.  I will definitely try a few more menu items before I write this place off..........parking also SUX :(
