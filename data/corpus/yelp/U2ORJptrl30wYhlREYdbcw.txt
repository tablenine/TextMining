Yummy and lively fun atmosphere.  I usually like to just drop by late to early evening and get a seat at the bar.  Chatter away over a good glass of vino or two.  The servers and bartenders are friendly.  Recommend the Oven Roasted Olives, Nancy's chopped salad, any of the pizzas, butterscotch budino or sorbetti/gelato.  All adds up to a great time.
