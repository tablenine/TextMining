Mmmm.  I loved the butter dripping down my arm as I was eating my wonderfully juicy chicken.  The rice was very flavorful and the onions that accompanied the chicken was terrific.  Oh and the sangria was delish too.  I wish it wasn't so far away, but I'll be back for sure.  The prices were great and the service was very friendly.  If anyone is in the area, I hope they bring me some chicken with some extra butter.
