I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. I love it so much it hurts.  I don't care what anyone else says. Their breakfast burrito is a must have and needs to be definitely seasoned with tapatio. Bossanova waffle? hhm hhm heaven. Its a 24  hour diner with slghtly attractive staff. It attracts hipsters and if you end up here at around midnight by the bar, you'll come across some pretty interesting intoxicated midnight marauders. Don't worry when I say intoxicated, I mean they're pretty numb to life.... (I'm really selling this place now am I?)
