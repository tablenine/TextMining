My burger was without the advertised harissa aioli and mushroom but did come wrapped in a decades old layer of a cinder and soot. Barely edible. My friends fish and (four) chips were excellent except for the mashed peas which I initially thought was bat shit and proved to taste little better. Other than that it seemed like a nice place to go for a beer.
