This is def a staple of mine when I have something to celebrate &amp; someone special to appreciate. Always a new twist on the menu, you can trust that everything is great...not just good. I have had duck, pork, chicken, steak, pasta, &amp; seafood and all of it has been exceptional. Lots of flavor in every dish.. . Ambiance - Â Outdoors is great, make sure you take a walk around the grounds. Inside - classic elegance. . . Staff - always had great service, never any complaints on this front except for the fact that I was on a date once and they once said "Hi Mr and Mrs _ _ _ _" - Whoa there tiger you just jinxed us!. . *Canoe also did the Yelp eats menu which I appreciated and it was a great value.
