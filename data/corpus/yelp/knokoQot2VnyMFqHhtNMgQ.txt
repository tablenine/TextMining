Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Tried bottega louie for the first time and it was very very good.   Had the napoli pizza and burrata as a side dish and both were delicious!  Everything is really fresh, you can definitely taste it in the food.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Will definitely be frequenting this place to try all the delicious looking things on the menu.
