I have been here on a few occasions, mostly to grab a coffee or some little bun-bun.  Saturday was the first time I was here to eat in-house.  . . The service was great, and the coffee was great - heck even my side of toast was great.  But my bowl of chicken tortilla soup was intensely disappointing.  It was loaded with big pieces of chicken and hominy, but yet it was just so bland.  I was debating whether or not to dump hot sauce into it a few times.  Also, for a dish called "Chicken TORTILLA" soup, I don't think one tiny, limp shred of tortilla hidden at the bottom of the bowl counts.  . . Andy M's entree looked like the better dish, with a big fluffy eggy omelet, a nice green side salad, and some toast.  . . I cant be too hard on the Cafe since like I said, most of the little things I have had in the past were great.  I guess I need to come back and try something different next time.
