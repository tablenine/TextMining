I've got to agree with ArtLuvinChic C. this place is Uber crowded on the weekends, and I love it! It's some of the best people watching in my neighborhood, I just head over to Caribou Coffee and watch the action. You can always count on at least one seriously hungover person trying to maintain while waiting for a table. The chow is fine, nothing that blows my socks off. The best thing on the menu are the omelettes but nothing can make up for the lack of real breakfast meats, seriously, who really enjoys turkey bacon? I want PORK! The only other thing would be the biscuits, there good, but not GREAT and with biscuit in the name I think they need to step it up. I'll give them another star when they serve real sausage.
