Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
The Joy Yee's experience is the first Asian fusion restaurant I have visited that actually has fabulousness food. Every Asian fusion restaurant I have been to are always very disappointing. . . The atmosphere is awesome, the food is awesome, but the most important thing, have a Joy Yee's bubble tea before you leave! There bubble tea is unlike any other restaurant, filled with fresh fruit, and bubbles!
