Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
Good cooks, bad chef's.. . My girlfriend took me to Dolce last ngiht for my birthday right before we went to Cirque Du Soleil (I know - good night!).  . . The first thing we noticed when we walked through the drapes shielding the dining room from the host stand was the decor.  The restaurant is georgeous.  I believe is walks the fine line where tasteful meets gaudy.  Its contemporary, bold, and accurately reflects the image of the group that owns it..... . The food was good, not great.  The gnocchi was perfectly cooked, but lacked the accompaniment one would expect from a good chef.  The saices were soupy.  The portion size of the chicken parm more closely resembled olive garden than an upscale restaurant.   It was massive and again over sauced.  . . My girlfriend had the scallops.  They were again perfectly cooked and rather tasty.  The squash mash(?) was good(ish).  Then there was some sort of green salad with nuts, candied oranges, and sugar clumps?  Someone thought long and hard about needing to be fancy before they came up with this.  If you want the scallops, make sure they hold the green creation.  . . The servers were just cheesy.   . . We had a great night, the food was good.  There are definatley better italian restaurants to go to, but if you have to be in Atlintic Station there are worse places to go.  If you have high expectations you will leave disappointed.  If you set the bar low, you may be surprised....
