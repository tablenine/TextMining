Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Really great pizza, awesome salads, good wine selection, and nice atmosphere, but a little cramped. Usually there is a wait, but speedy and friendly service makes up for it. The pizza is awesome- super thin, coal fired. It's hard to beat, but you have to be in the mood for that kind of thin. the margherita pizza is probably my favorite, or the fiorentino (add sausage and garlic!) with a bottle of valpolicella... perfect.
