Good food and a nice atmosphere. Went here once with just the BF and then again with my parents and aunt and uncle. Really good both times. I love the no corkage fee and we got wine from the place next door which was really good too. The skirt steak is my favorite, but the bacon wrapped dates? (I think that's what they were, maybe figs?) were the crowd faves. . . Good service too.
