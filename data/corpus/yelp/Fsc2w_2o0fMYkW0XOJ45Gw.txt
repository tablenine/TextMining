Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Ate dinner at Pizzeria Mozza last night and imagine our shock and horror when my mother-in-law found a broken piece of glass in one of our appetizers (the eggplant capponata, if you are wondering which one!). Luckily my mother-in-law was not injured. The staff was properly concerned and apologized profusely, but not exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant of this quality. Service was less than good. Bus boys serving coffee and dessert are gruff and messy. We had one nice waitress and one with a bad attitude. Pizza was good, but be careful before biting down!
