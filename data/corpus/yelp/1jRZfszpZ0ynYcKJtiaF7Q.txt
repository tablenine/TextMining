Wow, I dont even know where to start! Ok, first of all I am married to an Israeli Jew. You really can't get any more Jewish than that. Second, let me say that I went here expecting to eat some yummy food, the kind my husband makes. YUCK! How can this place call it a Jewish deli Â and cafe? This place first of all isn't Kosher ( not that I really care, I'm not Jewish myself and we don't eat Kosher, but c'mon your exploiting a Jewish theme here!). Also, there wasn't really any Israeli food. The food is overpriced ( $7 for 2 stuffed cabbages, my husband makes a pot of 20 for that amount.) I had a pastrami sandwinch, the pastrami wasn't flavorful and the bread was dry and nasty. My friends food was bland and tasteless. My friend from LA brought me here because she knew my husband was Jewish and wanted to show me "The best Jewish food in LA) HA! my husband lived in LA for 7 years and never heard of the place and goes to the valley for the real authentic stuff. If your coming here because your expecting Jewish Cuisine, BEWARE! This is NOT what you want to sign up for!
