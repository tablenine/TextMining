Restaurant: The Little Door

I'm going to have to agree with Sophrosyne Y. Perhaps my expecations were too high but I was quite dissapointed with The Little Door. The place is of course gorgeous and has a lovely ambiance but I was expecting a memorable meal and just left feeling underwhelmed. The bf and I were excited to see lobster bisque on the menu but found it to be a rather bland tomato based bisque that had the sweetness of lobster but was not satisfying. I had the spicy tuna tartar which was not in the least bit spicy or even very flavorful. I held out hope that my entree, the duo of duck, would be more exciting. The duck was cooked well, at least the medallions were, but the orange sauce it comes with was much too sweet and the duck breast was much too dry. The pureed carrots that accompanied it were also too sweet and somewhat odd tasting, why would you pair a sweet vegetable with a sweet entree? It also came with a wild rice flan which was as unappealing as it sounds. The bf had the lamb which was better than my dish but I felt like I had tasted the same lamb at many other restaurants for $10 less. . We passed on the dessert after our server slammed a large menu board on our table assuming we wanted some instead of just asking. Â Perhaps this offended our waitress because she then proceded to ignore us for half an hour when we just wanted our check. . Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but based on my experience I would only recommend this place for some drinks and desert, the meal just wasn't worth it.
