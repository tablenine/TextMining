Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If I could give this place no stars, I would.  What saddens me about Flo is that it had the potential to be an ok West Town hangover spot, serving up decent brunch and lunch items; however the service and management is horrendous.. . I opted for the chicken enchiladas served with rice, poblano sauce, black beans and cheese.  This was good, but nothing to rave about.  Bigs had the borracho which he liked, but was nothing special.  They did cook the burger perfectly rare as he specified, which is a plus at busy brunch spots.. . Bigs also ordered the coffee which is where Flo went wrong.  As he finished his coffee and tilted the last few sips into his mouth, what revealed itself in the bottom of the cup was a used BUTTER PACKET.  This was absolutely disgusting, and we had made our server aware immediately.  He then came back and offered to take the $2 off of our bill, which is completely absurd.  Naturally, we went to the front to speak to the manager who surprisingly had a very nasty attitude towards us and insisted that the cup was clean and just so happened to have a butter packet in it because "things get caught in the wash" and it doesn't mean anything.  It took about 5 more minutes of reasoning with this woman, until she angrily grabbed our bill, entered some keys into the register, and THREW IT in my boyfriend's face.   . . This is by far the most unbelievably horrible treatment I've received from a restaurant and a manager who goes by the motto "The Customer is always Wrong."  I really hope the owner gets new management, because bad service is bad business.  WILL NEVER COME BACK.
