I love Moody's burgers.  And there is nothing quite like Moody's outdoor patio on a beautiful day.  That being said, the inside of Moody's is the yick, and if you eat in there, you will smell gross.  Like grease.  You MUST eat outside.  The service isn't that hot, but hey, if you are outside on a beautiful day, you usually don't care all that much.
