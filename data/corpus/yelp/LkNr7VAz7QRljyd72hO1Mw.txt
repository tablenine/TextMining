I don't get it. What exactly IS this place supposed to be? An upscale pizza place? Gourmet organic? Grunge? I have no idea what kind of restaurant it is and for the West Loop, that is a problem. SO many choices, when exactly woudl one choose to go to Market? Â . . Pizza and salad for lunch. Both were pretty good but I must admit I had thoughts of so many other restaurants I wished we had gone for lunch. For pizza and burgers, just down the street at Third Rail or Beer Bistro you can get cheaper and better, with a livelier crowd.. . Would not recommend for lunch or dinner, but it might be a great place for a party, given the space is kind of akward but nice. Not writing it off just yet, as I suspect, hope, imagine, the owner will read the crappy reviews and hire someone to help out. If nothing changes, I would give the restaurant about 1 year max.
