I came for the pizza becuase I heard it was good (I think J. Gold raved about it in his review). I had a buffala, anchovy and caper pie. It was OK but not great. . . Crust: Thin, nicely charred but lacked chewiness and flavor (more fermentation guys!). . Sauce: OK, nothing memorable. . Cheese: Tasty, but not much of it and inconsistently applied (as many bares spots as cheesy ones). . Toppings: MIA. C'mon guys!. . Dessert: We had a chocolate flourless cake that the waitress raved about. It was very disappointing. Not so much a cake as a large dumpling-shaped cookie. It was dry and not very tasty. . . Bread: They bring you a bread basket with excellent bread and olive oil to start. It sounds like a small thing, but most restaurants fail miserably when it comes to this.. . The service was OK. The wine was OK.
