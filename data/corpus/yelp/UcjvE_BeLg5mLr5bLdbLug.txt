I like this place a lot more now that they have expanded and the wait is no longer unbelievable. . . Have been here a number of times and most recently with some friends from norcal who really seemed to enjoy the food. . . Everyone else speaks about the various dishes, which I agree are all taste good, presented well, fresh ingredients, and come to you relatively quickly. . . My wife is obsessed with the chicken soup, I don't really get it but she always has to get it, so that's my contribution from the food area. Â My friend's son drank like 2 cups of the soup himself, so apparently he is a fan as well.. . This place is clean and well decorated, which is a big plus compared to some of the other chinese joints in the area and as I mentioned, it's an impressive place that you would tell your friends or take them to.
