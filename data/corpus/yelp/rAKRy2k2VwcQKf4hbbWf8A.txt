Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Oh yeah. the hungry cat is all that. The first indication this place is on point was the quality and head peeling (in a good way) strength of their superb cocktail's. The Cat's take on a grownup lemonade called 'Lukes Lemonade' is pure evil genius. Vitamin V (vodka) mixed with mint and house lemonade hit this jet lagged dude right in the kisser... . . The raw bar offerings all looked delish..esp the 'you peel em' shrimp..then split a Maine lobster and finished with a big eye (damn those small eye varieties) tuna and i was totally sated. This place molto legit....A grade
