One of my favorites.  A little more expensive than a lot of cafe/diner type places, but so delicious.  I get the c.a.b. omelet often(cheddar, avocado and bacon, mmmm-mmmm!).  . . Add: I've recently started reducing how much meat I consume and I've fallen in love with their vegan mac-n-cheese.  It's really delicious.  There's a bit of a slightly funky after taste but it's completely worth it.. . I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone, the place is a little eclectic, but it's the best when you want something late-night.
