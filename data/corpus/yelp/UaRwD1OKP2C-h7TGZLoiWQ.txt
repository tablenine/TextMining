Everything was great about this place.  I love the location (downtown Culver City) and the simple design of the restaurant.  . . I love the easy to read menu...not complicated at all.  I also like it when restaurants displays fresh ingredients while you line up to get your food or to pay.  . . There are seating available inside and outside.  . . Parking is available on the streets or parking garages.. . The salad I had was the chicken cobb salad...the bacon were thick cut and sliced, not crumbled.  Plenty of chicken, egg, and bacon in the salad.  The slice of bread with the salad was CRUNCHY!!!  I had to be careful when I bite into it because I might chip my front tooth!  But it was delicious!
