Went for brunch with friends after a night of drinks and dancing. I was hoping to get some good food to assist me with the day of shopping ahead. . . Ugh.. How can you get chicken pot pie wrong? HOW?!?! Flavorless, soupy, filled with non-comforting things. Service was good and beautiful people seem to gravitate towards this place. . . - ok food. - ok service. +cool atmosphere ( it's a converted old gas station). +good looking folks
