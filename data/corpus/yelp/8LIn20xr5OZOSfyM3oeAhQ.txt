Restaurant: Bob San Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
I have eaten a lot of sushi and sashimi. I mean I grew up in Hawaii, an island in the middle of the Pacific so it wasn't a big thing. So after being told Bob San is a great sushi restaurant by multiple people I had high expectations. The rolls are average, and the nigiri sushi is not as fresh as it should be. Stringy  tasting tuna is usually a sign it's gone bad. Plus in terms of service...it's not great. They seated us and forgot about us for 30 mins, that's when we got our water. Then it took us another 20 mins for them to take our order which by then we were starving. And this was on a weeknight. The food came out in a timely fashion- I will give them that but really.  Bob San, you failed to impress me.
