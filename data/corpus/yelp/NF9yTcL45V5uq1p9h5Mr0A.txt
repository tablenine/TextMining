Valet worthwhile. Crowded during NFL. Playoffs. Casual. Loud but you can hear the game and lots of tv's and booths. Service slow. Menu huge. Large beer selection. I got the Chili its meaty and i wanted it in a bowl with spaghetti included is French onion soup they were both surprisingly very good. Black and tan beer only $3.
