Like other reviewers, I would say that they know how to kick in the spice at this place.  Unlike Royal Thai, the portions are large and filling.  I think it is strange to have Thai and sushi in the same restaurant, but who am I to judge?. Delivery is a bit slow, but free California Maki roll for over $25 spent.  Bonus.
