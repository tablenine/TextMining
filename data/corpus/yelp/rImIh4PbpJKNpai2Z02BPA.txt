I would really love to love this place, but I've gone twice now and ordered the same thing (a fish dish with red quinoa).  Both times, the fish has been a big disappointment.  The first time, it was way too salty.  I was having dinner on a Sunday night and figured maybe it was the jr chef who had salted the fish, so I went back another day to have the fish again (I really love the quinoa it comes with).   Yet again, the fish was incredibly salty, and it actually tasted old.  For the price, it just wasn't worth it.
