Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I saw this place when i was watching Man vs. Food and it totally drew me in! Was in LA this weekend and since our original lunch plans didn't work out we decided to give this place to find. It was funny because our gps didn't even acknowledge that the street it was located on existed. (Btw Orochon is on the 3rd floor of the shopping center). . . We tried to call ahead to put our name on the list but we were denied! Doh! It was okay because there was only one group ahead of us. The place was totally packed and it was 330pm!! We were all starving and wanted like a soda to drink while we were waiting so one of my friends went inside to ask and of course, we were denied again!! Ugh... so finally our table is ready inside and you order by the broth and the level of spicyness and of course add in your sides that you want. I got the #5 miso with corn. I think if I wasn't super-starving-about-to-pass-out-and-dry-heaving-h ungry i would have gotten a #3 or something because if you know me i liiiiikkkee spicy. Our ramens came out pretty quickly and then complete silence at the table. Everything was devoured! I DEFINITELY enjoyed the broth here and I like that I could taste the spicy, the noodles however were just okay to me. Could have been a little better...but the broth...ooooh the broth..i had dreams about Orochon ramen that night...yummm.....
