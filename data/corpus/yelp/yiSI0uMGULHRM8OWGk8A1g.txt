My first pastrami experience was here at Langers, and now this is the ONLY place I'll ever go to for Pastrami...it's become an office routine. We'll pass around the menu, phone in the orders (I get the #10: Pastrami with Coleslaw &amp; Russian Dressing on Rye or the #19 which is the same but with swiss cheese), pull up to the curb with a $100 bill and someone will be ready with our orders with exact change, as we make a quick trade through the passenger side window. Love it...better than a drive thru and totally worth the horrific calories and mega fatty pounds.. . They grill the rye bread to perfection, with a slight crispy crunch in every bite (esp. the crust, yum!). I hate coleslaw, but somehow it really meshes well with the pastrami, and I seriously savor every bite. Oh, don't forget the pickles! Nothing special about the pickles, but they just go together! The meat as most reviewers have already described is quite tender and thickly cut, so this ain't no weaksauce, ghetto version of pastrami, it's the real deal, the perfect meal to fix a sandwich craving. Long live Langers (por favor)!!!
