Restaurant: Bocado
Category: American (New)
I really wanted to love Bocado because it's super close to work and it was designed by my favorite local interior design firm Ai3.  But, the food let me down a bit.  I met a friend for lunch and I had the burger on the recommendation from the Blissful Glutton blog: . . . http://blissfulglutton.... . . Honestly, I was disappointed.  It wasn't nearly as good at Holeman &amp; Finch (which loses some points for its after 10 only hours) or Grindhouse.  Also, it was pricey and comes with no sides for the price!  My friend had a turkey club-like sandwich on bread that was supposed to be crispy and tough, but it was sooo hard it actually but the roof of her mouth.  Not so pleasant.. . I would probably try Bocado again because of the close to work factor and when it warms up it seems like the patio should be nice.  We'll see if the next time impresses...
