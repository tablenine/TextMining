I've only been here once and I didn't eat but it was still one of the best, most unique experiences during my time in LA.  The atmosphere is the best part, with secret rooms and staircases, and so much mood lighting and dark wood paneling you'll think you're in the Haunted Mansion.  I really liked all of the vintage magician posters and portraits all over the walls.. . Tips:. -Dress up very formally.  I wore a tie but not a suit and I felt underdressed.  Most of the patrons are kind of old so it's bad enough to be a young punk, you don't want to look like one too.. -Identify the shows you want to hit up and then get in line for them.  You can't get into the biggest theatre if you don't eat dinner (bummer) but everything else is open to the public.  We saw a great guy in one of the smallest rooms, a good one in one of the bars, an average one in the medium-sized theatre, and a bad one in a small room.  It's a roll of the dice.  Ask one of the many bar tenders what shows they'd recommend, the staff tend to be very helpful and nice.. -Get drunk!  The drinks aren't cheap, but they're not outrageous for LA and they make the magic so much better.  Plus, it's cool to drink cocktails in a suit while standing next to a guy that looks like your grandpa.  It makes you feel all growns up.
