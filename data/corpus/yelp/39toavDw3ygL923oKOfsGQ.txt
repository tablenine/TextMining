Restaurant: LottaFrutta
Category: Fruits & Veggies
I was a bit skeptical about going to LottaFrutta.  I had heard great things about it BUT I'm not a huge fruit person and definitely not an exotic fruits person.. . But, the fruit there is so flavorful and fresh it is hard not to like it.  And, the soups are unbelievable.  I had a bowl of the chicken, potato, and corn soup.  It was amazing.  Simple yet flavorful and hearty.  I also sampled the yucca soup- again amazing.. . But, the best thing about the shop is the owner Myrna.  She was very helpful.  I explained to her that I am pregnant right now and experience a lot of heartburn so fruit can be difficult to eat.  She suggested the WannaGuana smoothie and she couldn't have picked a better smoothie for me to try.  It was actually very soothing and tasted great - not heavy or overly sweet.  She clearly cares about her product and cares about her customers.  She couldn't be more helpful.  I also tried the cremalotta fruit cup with some substitutions to take into account my heartburn.  The cream and fruit are both so refreshing and light.  It is amazing.. . I look forward to trying more of the menu soon- especially the soups.  This has become a favorite place already after just two visits.
