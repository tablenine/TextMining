My favorite restaurant in Southern California.  I usually get the sashimi platter with tempura.  The array of tuna is great.  Yes, not every piece is melt-in-your-mouth goodness, but for the price, the portion is HUGE, and there is usually one super-high-grade tuna on the plate.  the tempura is cooked perfectly!  Big bowls of rice are given as well.
