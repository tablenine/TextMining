I've been twice--but to the bar only.  The first time was because my dad was here on business and he was staying at the Westin.  Well, he told me and my husband, then boyfriend (I know, cool dad), that we could stay there and we was going to stay at my grandmother's house.  Awesome!  I absolutely hate elevators AND heights, so I only experienced half of the elevator ride...(I was literally holding on for dear life and only peaked out a couple  times.)  Once up in the bar I was ok. The view was AMAZING!  Expensive drinks, but they were pretty good.  Well, I guess...I was just so excited to be there I could've been drinking toilet water!  That was about 4 years ago.. . My second time was early last Spring--actually right before the tornado.  Again, we just had drinks and some appetizers, but it was still good.  It was mid-week, and still pretty crowded. Good service and again, the view was fantastic.  We weren't staying at the hotel and weren't charged to ride up there.
