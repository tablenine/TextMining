Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
you'll find this place very easily...just look for that long line of people outside of a food stand with that great aroma smell and you'll know it's pink's lol. . the wait is always an hour long or more...but stopping by pinkberry nearby helps the wait =)...that reminds me, while waiting in line with my cup of pinkberry, people were staring at me eating the yogurt with their hungry eyes lol. one person actually asked where the place was and i told him =). . pink's has very unique hotdogs.... i tried their planet hollywood dog which was pretty good...the french fries were good as well. . be warned...alot of the hotdogs here are like heart-attacks-in-a-bun lol...you'll lose a day off your life eating these =X. . btw pinks has it's own valet parking...even though it's kinda small.
