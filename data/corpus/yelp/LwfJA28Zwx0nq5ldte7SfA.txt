Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
Yeah Burger is getting all the buzz right now, but in the battle of burgers Grindhouse is the winner.  . . Look, I don't care if the burger I'm eating is from a grass fed cow, a caviar fed cow, or a double stuff oreo cookie fed cow.  I don't care if the cow was allowed to roam free or if he was crammed in a studio apartment.. . All I want is a burger that tastes good.  This is a good burger.  Juicy, greasy, all those good things.  Nice thick sliced bacon (and plenty of it) and sauteed onions were my choice this time.. . The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is the Sysco fries topped with Lawrys.  Too bad.  However, I'll give them credit for cooking them properly, crisp outside, mush inside.  If you are afraid of grease, this won't be the burger for you....I say bring it on!
