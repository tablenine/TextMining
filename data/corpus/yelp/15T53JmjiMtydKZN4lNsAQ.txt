Restaurant: Serpas
Category: American (New)
I wish I had better things to say about Serpas. I love the neighborhood and as someone who lived in New Orleans for years I'm a HUGE fan of its local cuisine --and always looking for somewhere in Atlanta that does New Orleans food well. . . We met another couple at Serpas on a Friday night. There was apparently a birthday party celebration in the bar that night. So perhaps that explains why our service was so...odd. Okay, it was disastrous. For example, my husband and one of our dining companions ordered vodka gimlets, while another order wine. The wine came right out. It was literally 10-15 minutes before the gimlets arrived. Two in our party ordered the roasted beet salad. One came out. Then, over 15 minutes later, the other one did. We were half way through our entrees when our server brought us bread. (...huh?) The chairs were extremely uncomfortable. And other than the fried oyster appetizer, the food was totally unmemorable. I'm sorry to say, but this dining experience was a great disappointment.
