I would have given this place 4 stars purely for the crazy long ass waits.  BUTTT when i went 2 days ago I discovered they opened up a new area directly adjacent to the original location.  The hostess told us the new area is nicer and assured us that everything was identical (menu, chefs, etc) so we decided to check it out.  She even personally walked us there.  We were the only ones there when we first arrived.  But when we left around 7pm, it was already getting crowded.. . Everything I've had here is at least decent, but their specialty is the dumplings.  The pork and crab xiao long baos are sooooooo good!  So flavorful and full of juicy goodness :)  I wouldn't recomment the vegetable dumplings or the pork&amp;vege buns.  Those were just average and kinda bland for my taste.
