fantastic! i was lucky enough to get to the truck quickly and not have to wait more than 15 minutes. it was a block from my house so it was damn near perfect. the food is quite tasty except for the tofu tacos which i found to be bland. it's an interesting mix of mexican and korean food. kimchi in a taco is just odd but damn tasty. i'd recommend it if you don't find yourself having to wait super long. i'm not sure i'd wait an hour for this food but i'd gladly wait 15-20 for it.
