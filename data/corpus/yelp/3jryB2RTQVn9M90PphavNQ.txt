Had the lamb chops as an appetizer and the porterhouse steak for two, with sides of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  I thought the lamb chops were pretty good, as they were glazed with a balsamic vinegar and cooked to a medium rare temperature.. . I enjoyed the porterhouse for two, although it is not the best steak I've had.  However, for $52 dollars and with two sides, I can't complain -- the price makes it well worth it.  I would have liked my steak a bit hotter though, and if they would make sure the plates are heated, that would have made this much better.  Still, would likely come back here again if I don't want to break the bank on a decent steak.  . . Mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were eh, probably would not get these sides again.. . Public parking in the back in a garage structure -- they validate!
