Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Uncle Julios, but it is a good spot to grab a bite if you happen to be in the neighborhood. Portions are huge here; I always end up eating half of my entree and bringing the rest home to eat the next day. I'm a big fan of the veggie fajitas, which come with a side of beans and rice. The service is very friendly. Our sneaky waiter asked me if I wanted cheese and sour cream with my fajitas, to which I replied "yes," without first alerting me that it is extra. It was $1 more or something like that, which isn't a big deal. But sneaky, nonetheless.. . I don't know if this place takes reservations, but it gets fairly busy at night. So be prepared to wait at least a little bit if you're walking in. Enjoy a drink at the bar while you wait - time flies a lot faster that way.
