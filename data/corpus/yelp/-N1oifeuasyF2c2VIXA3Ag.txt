This place is the definition of consistent.  It is a meat and three place with primarily one type of meat...chicken.  They give you yeast rolls and cornbread with the meal.  The "princess platter" is perfect: they will take the breast of chicken off of the bone and take the skin off.  Also, the white chicken chili is great.  On a cold day, this is my good old friend who will always warm me up.  They have plenty of sides to choose from and my vegetarian friends love it because there is always something on the menu for them.   Again, don't expect fine dining but this is a good everyday dinner type of restaurant.
