By far my most favorite restaurant in Atlanta.  The ambiance is warm and cozy, perfect for a date night or catching up with old friends.. . I highly recommend the molasses-rubbed pork tenderloin.  I go there with the intention of trying something new every time but never can resist that piece of heavenly pork tenderloin.  I'm also a fan of the wasabi creme fraiche that comes with the calamari appetizer.  It gives the calamari an extra hint of flavor... or as Iike to say: pizzazz.. . Very friendly wait staff also!
