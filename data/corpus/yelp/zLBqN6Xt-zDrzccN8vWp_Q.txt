Pretty much the best old-school Jewish fare outside of Katz's or Second Ave Deli in NYC.  An institution, about as "real Chicago" as you can get.  One of my true favorites in the city.. . It's not super cheap, but you have to get the standard fare of corned beef on rye, potato pancakes, and matzo ball soup.  You can just feel the history in this cafeteria-like setting, with every ethnicity in the city represented.  Only downside is that it's a tad expensive to get all your Jewish faves (matzo ball, potato pancakes, and a rueben/pastrami sandwich).. . Don't forget to buy a Halvah bar as you leave!
