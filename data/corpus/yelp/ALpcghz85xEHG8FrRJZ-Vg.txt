Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Really 3.5 stars -  Everyone always has good things to say about this place so that is what originally got me to go to this restaurant but then I encountered "the wait." I hesitate to give them 4 stars because  of the handful of times that I have been here I have to wait forever to be seated. I have to wait forever to be served and I have to wait forever to get my pizza. Don't go here if you are starving because it will be a while before you eat. Casa Bianca has a pretty good thin crust NY style pizza with a good flavor although the pizza for me, is a bit on the oily side. Prices are on the expensive end for what you get. Eating out is about the experience and not just the food so that is why for me this is 3.5 stars because half of the experience is waiting a long time.
