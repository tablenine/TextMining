Category: Thai
Palms Thai will always have a special place in my Thai heart.  The first time I went here everyone told me to lookout for Thai Elvis.  Well, I never found Thai Elvis, but I did find Thai Neil Young!!!  That's right, Thai Neil Young!! Are you kidding me?!  I still can't believe it.  It was awesome and hysterical at the same time.  He sang all the hits too!  I really hope they bring that guy back.  He made my week.. . Good food too.  Authentic.
