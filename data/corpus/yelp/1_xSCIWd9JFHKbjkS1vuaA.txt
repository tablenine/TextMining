I went to check this place out on a Friday night with some friends after work. Wow! It was not what I was expecting. I was hoping to get a drink and maybe dance it up a bit. Instead, it was way too crowded in there and it took 25 minutes and $7 plus tip (10 bucks) to get a small rum and coke minus the rum. I swear there was probably half an ounce of rum in there! There was no way to ask for another drink without waiting forever and there was no where to stand. I never even found my friends because I couldn't get through the woman with giant heals and guys with way too much aftershave on. Not what I call a fun scene. If I go back it will be to eat (their food looked really good), not stand and crowd up against some 48 year old creep.
