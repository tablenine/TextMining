Um, if this place sucked so bad then why are the lines so freakin long??!. . This place is effin deeeeeee-lish! When you are drunk, the wait helps to sober you up some. And a SNAPPY dog piled high with gobs &amp; gobs of the delicious toppings available here will surely put you in driving condition. I have met so many interesting people - from all over LA and the world - just waiting in line here. So stop being so pissy (hehehe) and strike up a convo - it's going to be at least 45 so why not enjoy it? . . Eff those nasty bacon wrapped dicks and come join us for a dog!
