Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Everyone can be an "insider" at Bottega Louie, if they so choose.  The staff is clearly trying to start a sort of neighborhood-feel.  If you go more than once, they will most likely take the time to learn your name and your preferences.  Talking to some of the staff members it's clear that they are looking to build the business on personal relationships and word of mouth advertising, and from the service I'm received, I'm more than happy to pass along a good word or two (or a MILLION!). . The food is great - I've sampled the pastries (many a time) and the sandwiches in the front cases.  Someday, I am going to go and eat the entire giant bowl of calamari.  . . We also had a work luncheon in the main restaurant.  The staff couldn't be nicer in trying to make sure that we had a great meal and a good time, and that the birthday person was properly greeted and celebrated.  I had the torpedo sandwich, which was good, but not as great as my boss's pizza (next time!)  I had the peanut butter/chocolate/carmel dessert thingie (I believe that's the technical term) and it was for to die.
