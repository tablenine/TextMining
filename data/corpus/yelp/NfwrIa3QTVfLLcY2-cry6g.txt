Stopped by Metro fresh today while waiting to see a movie at Midtown cinema. They were just about to close I'd been looking forward to going there. We ordered the Cajun chicken and shrimp soup. The chicken sandwich with havarti cheese and the mango shrimp ceviche. First the sandwiches are premade. It was almost tastely. the soup tasted like vegetable soup from a can. the mango shrimp ceviche had calamri, shrimp and some kind of fish. it was pretty good. . while we were eating another couple came in and were told they were closed. I wished we had been so lucky. We then walked to Apres Diem for some dessert.
