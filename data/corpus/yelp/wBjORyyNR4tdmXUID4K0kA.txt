THIS APPLE FELL FAR FROM THE TREE . . I don't know how else to explain why I loathe Webster Wine Bar, but love its offspring, The Bluebird. . . I thought this venue would be great for a first date and indeed it was. It's casual yet sophisticated, friendly and unpretentious (*ahem* Webster Wine Bar), and the menu is perfectly suited for drinks and apps or, if it's going well, for a full dinner. . . We started off with perfectly spiced merguez sausage, briny jamon iberico, and luscious bufala mozzarella with a wonderful accoutrement (I just wanted to say accoutrement) of olives, apricots, and other delights. We then moved on to the Serrano, machego, and egg flat bread which we quickly devoured. All of this paired perfectly with our bottles of malbec and sangiovese, which were priced reasonably. . . To top it all off, our service was great; attentive and informative about the wine without being a total asshat. Truly, a rare find.
