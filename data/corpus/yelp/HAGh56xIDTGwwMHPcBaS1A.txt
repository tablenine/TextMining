Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
This is ok bbq. The food and atmosphere have a definite chain restaurant feel. Nothing is fabulous, but it can fill the bbq void that one gets living in the city.. . And be careful when there is live music, sometimes its soooo loud you can't hear your dining companions.
