Went here for a Super Bowl gathering and wanted to leave as soon as I walked in.  When I told the hostess that we were 5 of 6 people she asked if we were all there.  I said that 3 were there and the other two were parking.  She bitchily said "Well when I see them in the flesh, then talk to me"  Of course I wanted to leave then but my buddies just wanted to wait until they got there.  So the other two showed up and I approached the girl again and told her that they were there.  She made me bring them all forward so she could see each of them.  I totally understand why she wanted us all there, however, didn't have to be so cunty.  Then once we were sat, I noticed 3 other tables that had like one or two people sitting while waiting for others to show up.  . I ordered a burger that was actually pretty good.  And the waitresses were pretty attentive.  I could tell the regular patrons here were douche-bags and not the type I would hang out with.
