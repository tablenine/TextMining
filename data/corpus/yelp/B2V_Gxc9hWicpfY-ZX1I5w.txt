Just not my day.... . Coming here on a Tuesday night... pretty packed.. . I had Starters of Cerveza Dos Equis XX... nice and cold with chips and spicy cold salsa. Yum! For my entree I got the: Baja Chicken; under Mexicali Specialties which consisted of Grilled chicken breast topped with a spicy orange-mango-chipotle salsa and spicy sprouts. Served with grilled vegetables and Mexicali rice which came with 3 pieces of hand-made corn tortillas. Yum!. . Dont know what was going on that specific day I had gone, but it took us a nice 45 minutes to get our food. Plus another 25 minutes for a coke we had priorly ordered before ordering our entree.. . Overall, I do recommend coming here, yet the wait would be quite long since it is a happening place.. . D+. 2 Stars
