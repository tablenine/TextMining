How has it taken me this long to write a review for Bari Foods?!  They have the best sub sandwiches.  And they are inexpensive!  I love their prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich.  They don't measure or weigh how much they put on the sub.  They just do it!  Delish!  . . I have also gotten lunch meat, homemade sausage and croissants with chocolate inside.  This is such a good place to stop and get anything Italian.  It's so close to work that I stop by every now and then to get my fix.  And stop by the bakery next door!
