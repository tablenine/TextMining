As Burno would say, "I like"! Nice looking restaurant with a HUMUNGO bar sitting right in the middle with a billzillion beers on tap. I tried there Eclipse which is a New Moon and Guinness mix, Â YUMMY! (I need to remind myself to make that at home.) So we drank and drank and finally ordered some food. I was trying to be "healthy" and ordered some good ole fashion buffalo wings and a wedge salad. Both were great.. I mean how can you go wrong? Can't really recall what everyone else had, probably because I was a little tipsy, but I do recall them liking it! Only one minor complaint, service was kinda slow and awkward at times and what I mean by awkward is our server came at the wrong times with odd conversations. all in all the food and drinks were superb.
