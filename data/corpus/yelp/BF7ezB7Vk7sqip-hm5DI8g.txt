Restaurant: Jack&#39;s Pizza &amp; Wings
Category: Pizza
So, Johnny's is now Jack's. Other than a small piece of paper we got from our waiter saying that the owner's were the same, not sure what the full-story is. . . Regardless, the menu is exactly the same. 1/2 price wings on Monday's, $1 4th Ward Brew everyday, and yummy reasonably priced pies. . The atmosphere is eclectic. The service isn't out-of-this-world but it's tolerable. . . Johnny's didn't deliver. . Jack's does.. That makes Jack's SO much better than Johnny's. . . I definitely recommend it.
