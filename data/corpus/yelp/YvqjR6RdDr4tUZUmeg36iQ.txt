I'm not much of a ramen fan, but I did really liked my bowl last night.. Portion is pretty big.. I had the miso #4 with chashu, green onion, and bamboo.. I think the ramen already comes with standard green onion and sprouts but I'm not too sure.. The chashu was really really tender and juicy~~. 1 hefty pc for $1.50.. I felt like my bowl of ramen was never ending, but in a good way.. . The dumplings sucked.. . After I heard about a freak accident at Daikokuya, I think I'm coming here from now on.. The wait isn't bad and free hour parking.
