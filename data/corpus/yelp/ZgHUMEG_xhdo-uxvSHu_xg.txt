Restaurant: Pho #1
Category: Vietnamese
Going with the masses..... . I had the Spicy beef stew and it was heavenly.  I always pictured heaven with lots of meat and really toasty french bread btw.. . I will say the meat had a few chewy and fatty parts none of which deterred me from consuming the entire bowl and trying some of the Pho as well.. . They should rename this place Spicy Beef Stew #1.  The Pho was good I guess, but the stew is the reason I'll be returning soon.  . . The restaurant itself is an eclectic mess of holidays, seasons and nationalities.  I liked it though.  At anytime I was expecting them to move the chairs out and hold a square danging lesson.. . The owners sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant prepping vegetables.  It was nice and unbelievably cheap.  . . I'll be back...
