Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Order and take out. The Pizza is excellent. Treat the dining room as if it was a viral hot-spot in some Crichton novel. . . Food aside (4-5 stars) they are not a customer-first place, and never have been. The Marquis de Sade approved their business plan. First, they literally have no parking (seats 106?!?), so you end up parking in front of some schmoe's apartment while he and Erma, his girlfriend argue about his paycheck. The wait for a table is one of the most annoying in recorded history. There are cave-drawings on their walls of actors evolving while they waited. The minimum wait is about 45 minutes, and they are notorious for underestimating the wait time. 45 minutes usually means an hour. Your annoyance may vary. Tie this to a no-reservations policy and this ultra tasty place is verboten for most dates and party-of-four events involving being somewhere else (movie or concert) at a specific time. Another customer-based "fuck you" is their cash-only policy. I have no problem with paying cash, just the fact that it's not posted somewhere in the lobby in big letters. It's a candid camera Â "gotcha" surprise at the end of your first visit. Ashton Crutcher should pop out. Undoubtedly you'll also forget about the cash policy once if you go here more than a few times and curse your existence.  . . In short, if I could steal their excellent food and avoid the wait, hassle, and paying in cash, I would be a happy man. Unfortunately, they are over-hyped by every "best 10" list in Los Angeles, and always have customers out the door waiting to be flogged and abused for their fabulous food, so they will never change the way they treat the masses. I never dine-in there anymore. . . To repeat...Order and take-out. The food is excellent, but the actual restaurant should be avoided unless you like wearing leather masks with mouth-zippers..
