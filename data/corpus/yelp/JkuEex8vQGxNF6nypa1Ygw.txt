I loveeeeeee their pastries and dessert items. They're decently priced and I always look forward to picking out a few items to bring home.. I usually stop by for lunch (my favorite sandwich is the Cubano)....I wouldn't recommend coming here during the weekends though.....or peak lunch hours (the lines can stretch out the door!) . I also enjoy their potato balls (think of a ground beef mixture inside a mashed potato ball, coated in cornmeal/bread crumbs)....not sure if they bake it or fry it.....but it's a great snack =D. . They have a huge selection of baked goods.......and I drool just staring at the glass case =D
