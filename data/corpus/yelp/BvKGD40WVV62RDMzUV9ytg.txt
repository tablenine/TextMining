Since it was Good Friday and I'm a good Catholic, Partner and I began our evening with dinner here. I had purchased the Groupon specifically to give this boit a shot. We had an early reservation so there'd be no rush to make the 8 0'clock curtain for Billy Elliot. We were seated promptly but it seamed to be relatively popular for happy hour while there was plenty of open seating in the dining room. I started with my Tanq Ten martini which was prepared competently and quickly. Bussers were plentiful and seemed to always carry around trays of fresh warm biscuits. Partner really liked these; I wasn't sold on the martini-biscuit pairing. We shared the smoked salmon flat-bread for starters. We both were very pleased I thought it was sort of a play on the classic lox and bagel. (While they have a reasonably extensive appetizer menu most of the offerings were off limits due to my shellfish allergy.) I order the macadamia encrusted Opah on the server's recommendation and Partner had the Cobia. The Opah was light yet somewhat rich tasting entree, I was happy. The Cobia was a bit "fishy" to my taste though Partner really liked it. The presentation of both was top flight, the veggies were very fresh and perfectly prepared. We shared a decadent chocolate dessert which was moussey/flourless cake like creation. I had a glass of the late-harvest zin and Partner ordered a sidecar. The sidecar was the only failure of the evening. Server asked, disappointment was registered, sidecar was removed from table and bill. Good save. . . I let our server know about the Groupon when we were seated which seemed to have no effect on her fastidious attention. We'll be back Groupon or no.
