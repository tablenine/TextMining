This restaurant does their food in "tasting plates", which means smaller portions that you can mix and match to create a meal. While this allows for a great variety in meal choices, it also can add up pretty quickly. Each tasting plate is around $10, they recommend that you use 3-4 for a meal. I eat pretty light already and had 3, probably could've had 4 and not be too full. That being said the food was AMAZING. I wish I could describe the dishes, but they are all so unique it'd be hard to do. It's mostly vegetarian, with ample vegan choices, and only one fish dish the night I was there. Definitely worth the long car ride I took to get there from downtown. I'd go again for sure, just not ravenous, or on a budget.
