Good Cantonese food, but can  also cater to the General Tso's/crab rangoon crowd.  The salt and pepper squid was way over-salted the last time we went, but it's usually pretty good.  Better than most Western renditions of calamari I've eaten.  The honey garlic spareribs are crave-worthy!  You can really taste the honey in the glaze, not some faux corn syrup BS.  They do a great job with the sauteed snow peas leaves, and if you like braised meats, with tendon-gooey connective tissue (I do! I do!), the brisket hot pot is just an all-around great dish, with veggies to boot!  (Just wish there was more meat, it was so tender!) . . The duck here isn't as good as Ming's, but satisfactory.  A good place to come with a group for some Chinese food.  Try to get here early though, it can get pretty packed on weekend nights.
