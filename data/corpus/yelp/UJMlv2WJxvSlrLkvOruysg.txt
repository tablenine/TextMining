The atmosphere is very happening.  There are so many people here all the time especially happy hour.  The food is good.  Too bad too many things are all fried.  Their shitake mushroom tofu lettuce wraps are really good.. 9/2007. After eating here more and more.  Ive decided that the food is isnt worth 4 stars.  its worth 3.  but they are good with beer.  And they have a huge selection of beer.  Some more details on food.. Beer battered onion rings - fun. Garlic noodles - yummy!. nachos - average. artichoke - average. shitake tofu wrapes - yummy!. margharita pizza - yummy!. Straweberry Beer Float - surprisingly good and fizzy and fruity..wow. try it its weird.. . Its sad they took out the yard!!!
