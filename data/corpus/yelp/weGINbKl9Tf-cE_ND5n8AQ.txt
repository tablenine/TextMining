Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
I assumed this restaurant was a chain (in a bad way) because of the lack of ambiance, not too flavorful Americanized asian dishes, and the way I felt rushed during the meal. The dishes are cheap and taste okay. So I guess you get what you pay for.. If you want good noodles please go up by Andersonville and support a small noodle shop. Â It will be worth the $7!
