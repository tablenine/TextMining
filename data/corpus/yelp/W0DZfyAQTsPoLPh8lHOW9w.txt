Food was good - nothing amazing. . . The way their communal seating was set up was very irritating for some reason... I liked the communal seating style at Avec. But hated theirs, I think b/c it felt so rushed. . . Their noodles were good, like a more Americanized version.. but good. Only worth trying if you're close to the neighborhood, otherwise don't make a special trip for it.
