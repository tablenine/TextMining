Took a friend to Craft for lunch and it was a real treat. Although it can be pricey, they have a great prix fix menu that even I can afford. But the menu constantly changes with the season so no reason to list what I ate since they probably won't have it now. Even so, their corn soup is worth mentioning. DELICIOUS! . . The service is impeccable, of course.  The décor is beautiful.  I especially love the outdoor patio and although the only view is of an office building, the bungalows make it fun. . . Lunch crowd was filled with well dress beautiful people driving fancy cars who spent more time on their iPhones than with their lunch dates. But they kept their phones on silent so it wasn't bothersome and there was still a nice buzz in the air.. . Saw they had an amazing private dining space I hope to someday utilize.  And some people say it's Dressy, it's LA Dressy - so nice jeans and a clean shirt - work well at lunch. . . Looking forward to going for dinner someday.
