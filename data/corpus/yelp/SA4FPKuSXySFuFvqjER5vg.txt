In the last 3 months I've tried to get into this place 4 times and they were packed with a waiting list! This time I went for a late lunch and the place was empty.. . Mushroom Swiss Burger Medium Well with a side of Tator Tots, the burger was fantastic, the mushrooms were perfect and plenty of them! The bun was buttered and soft just the way I like it! The meat was top quality and I believe 10oz plenty of beef!. . Service was great!. . I love the front of the menu that explains the rules, hilarious!. . I can see why this place is as popular as it is! Loved it!
