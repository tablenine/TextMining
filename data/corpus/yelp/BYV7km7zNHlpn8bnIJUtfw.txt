Lets get this out of the way, when I'm sick, i love the shrimp soup take out.. . But, for the restaurant not so great. Used to be ok, now heading somewhere not great. Last meal was cold, not exciting, cooking olives in the martini!. Table was too small upstairs (stools, tall tables). If you can't seat for dinner, don't!.. . Rest of menu same old same old, try Las Palmas for some completely different Mexican menu items!
