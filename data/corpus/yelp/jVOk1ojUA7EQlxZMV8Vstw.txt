Bit of a difficult one for me, this review.  I love independent pubs and love to support them by avoiding chains wherever possible.  But being fair to this place, it feels NOTHING like a chain pub (apart from the food menu, maybe) and, most importantly, it brews its own very tastey beers.  One of my favourites is the summer Kolsch.  It is friendly, welcoming (especially for a downtown pub) and a great place to nip in for a pint on the way back from work.  Its opposite where the missus works, so I have a good excuse too ;o). I've never yet had drink on the roof garden, but it looks like a great place to while a way a few hours.
