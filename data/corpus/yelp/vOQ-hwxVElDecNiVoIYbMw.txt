Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
This is Chicago and food, good or bad, is not cheap. That being said, I was really happy with my experience at Hamburger Mary's. I had the Blu Boy cheeseburger (I think that was the name) and it was divine! If you're a fan of bleu cheese, then this is the burger for you.. . Yeah, it was almost $12, but the beer-o-the month made up for it. A pint of Hefeweizen for $3.50 - hard to find in the city.
