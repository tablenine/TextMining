$3 for a taco is NOT that much considering you're getting Lamb and other quality braised meats.  The sheer time and energy that goes into putting so much flavor in a small taco is impressive, to say the least.  Don't expect to get a table without waiting... I have been there 5 times in 4 days.. It's close to my house and my friends and I love the place.  The service has been great each time I've been and they have been packed each time.  The security guy at the door was especially friendly, even fixing the collar on my jacket for me when I put on my coat.
