DISCLAIMER: I am not vouching for their food or their service but.... HAVE YOU SEEN THEIR BATHROOM? It's gorgeous! Something I would love to have in my nonexistent house one day.. . Came to Geisha House for a friends birthday party where I met up with them in the upstairs bar. There were the scenster and the beautiful people lounging around drinking, smoking, schmoozing and blah, blah, blah. Nothing special compared to your typical Hollywood scene.. . But do check out their bathroom before you leave!
