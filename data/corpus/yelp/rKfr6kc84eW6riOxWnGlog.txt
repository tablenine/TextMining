like i said, i love delis and old time coffee shops.  this is a combination of both.. . pastrami was decent.  service was decent.  serves beer so you can get your drink on.  i had the monte cristo and although not as large as some cristos ive had, it was still tasty and less oily than the deep fried versions at other places.. . nothing extraordinary, but the reason i love delis and coffee shops is because you feel like youre a kid again, and all is safe in the world.  you can be one here.
