After meeting up for a bit of hiking today, a large group of hungry food-lovers converged on SinBala Restaurant to fill their bellies. This place was not as stuffed-to-the-gills as I was expecting, and I'm glad for that. Yes, there was a wait. Yes, they get testy when your entire party is not there and they're already ready for you. No, they will not hold your table.. . There is no reservation-making. You walk in and put your name and the number of people on a list at the stand inside. Follow this up by grabbing a menu and waiting outside while you figure out what to order.  I am not familiar with Taiwanese food, so it took me ages to decide on something.. . Unfortunately, I have decided I am not a fan of the smoked ducked noodle dish. However, I am a big fan of the fried green onion pancake, the "chicken nuggets" and the sausage. After sampling several sausage dishes  with different accompaniments, I think I am a fan of the sausage+mango and the sausage+basil. Definitely delicious.. . People also ordered the shaved ice dessert and shared it around. I have to say that I like it quite a bit. However, I didn't have a spoon, so eating it with a fork was sort of difficult. I think I'd want to try it again, but with mango, pudding (flan/custard), mochi, grass jelly and whatever other fruit they offer.. . If I ever come back, I'll probably stick to the sausage, the green onion pancake, and maybe try one of their teas or juices, because those looked interesting!. . This place IS Cash Only, and thankfully... you're not gonna break your wallet here.
