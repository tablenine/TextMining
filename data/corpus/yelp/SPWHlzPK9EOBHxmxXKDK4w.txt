Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Don't Believe The HYPE!. . Overrated - After reading all the hype Pizzeria Mozza gets coupled with the great experiences I've had at its sister restaurant - Osteria Mozza ... I was very disappointed and will never go back.. . Service - Average, non attentive, and "snooty" are a few of the words that first come to mind. I find it interesting when people who couldn't afford the meal they're serving have the audacity to treat clients unprofessionally. If it weren't for the bus boys, there would be no service.. . Food - Average at best. Bland sauces, low quality prosciutto, and typical "wood oven" crusts. Basically the same pizza that can be bought at Wolfgang Pucks, California Pizza Kitchen, etc. My belief is that the same people who wait in line for "Sprinkles Cupcakes" and "Pink Berry" are the same people who believe that the Pizza at Mozza is the " Best in LA". The desert that gets all the attention ... Think Flan mixed with pudding. No imagination whatsoever.. . Price - Really? You'd be better off going down the street and buying a slice for $3. $18 for an average glass of wine (10x mark-up), $20 single serving Pizza's, and $17 appetizers that are small enough to be called Tapas. . . Bottom Line - Not worth the price. It's a typical 'Us Weekly" reading - West Hollywood crowd that is keeping this place in business - not the food.
