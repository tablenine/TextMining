I would advise against the chef's tasting menu; it was very starchy. For what it's worth, this is the only dining experience that has ever made me regret going with the chef's menu. . . Contrary to some people's comments that their appetite wasn't satisfied by the small portions, I left feeling incredibly full in that awful way that can only be the result of copious consumption of carbs. . . The lack of meat didn't take away from the experience, but the fact that almost everything was "heavy" and lacking in protein, did. Â Although I enjoyed everything I ate, I left feeling gross from all of the potatoes, pastas, creams and squash. . . I'd go back for a bowl of the soup, which was amazing, but I would not go back again for a full dinner. Frankly, I think the Chicago Diner has a more diverse and creative repertoire of vegetarian food than Green Zebra.
