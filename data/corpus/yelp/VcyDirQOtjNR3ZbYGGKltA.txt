I went here for Mother's Day 2009 with my family.  The reviews looked pretty good but the experience was horrible.  I understand that the place was busy but a restaurant is supposed to plan for these kind of busy dates with more staff to take care of their reservations and guests.  We were sat promptly at our reservation time but it took at least 30 minutes to even give our drink order.  We were explained that the dishes would take a lot of time so we should order as many as possible right away.  I was pretty blown away at the cost of each tapas plate; typically at a normal veggie restaurant you'll get stuffed for $15/entree but at Green Zebra you are expected to pay at least $30 to $50 a person and you won't even be fully satisfied.  It's a horrible waste of money and the food wasn't as good as I had expected.  . . They rushed taking our order but by the time we even got the tapas plates, it was at least 1 hour later.  They didn't even make up for the time we sat there starving for something to eat.  They offered each of us a glass of wine during our wait which was on the house, but they never refilled the basket of bread nor did they bring a single food item during our crazy wait.  By the time we were done with dinner which was after 10pm, our bill for 5 adults was well over $225, not including tip.  I was no impressed and will not go there again, even if someone paid for my dinner.  I'd stick to Karyn's Cooked if you need vegan fare.  At least there is more food you'll get for your dollar and you won't have to wait as long.. . One last thing about the ambiance; it's extremely loud and difficult to have an intimate conversation.  The tables are less than 14 inches away from each other.  This is not a place you want to break up with someone or a first or second date.
