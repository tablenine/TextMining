Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
This is a pretty good concept..  I don't think anyone dislikes grilled cheese sandwiches, especially when you can customize the bread or filling with such options as BBQ pork, chicken, caramelized onions, mac n cheese (that's right, a grilled mac n cheese sandwich!), and much more!. . The basic sandwich starts at $3, and their signature choices go up to around $8.  Who the heck is going to get a regular grilled cheese when all these options are available??  After reviewing the ala carte upgrade options, my friend and I felt it would be easier to just choose from a few of the pictures with silly names that they had up rather than build our own.  Also the long line put a little pressure on our decision making process.. . I got the opportunity to experience the GCT at the Paramount Studios NYC back lot in Hollywood, at Billabong's Design For Humanity event.  From what I heard, I made a good choice between this and the vegan/organic/whatever truck that was also available.. . The GCT is pretty rad.  A side of tator tots would have really rounded out my experience nicely, but beggars can't be choosers.
