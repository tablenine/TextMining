Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
I couldn't believe how good this sandwich was.  I ate this like years ago with my coworkers at a break from work.  It was a fascinating blend of sultry silky pastrami and refreshing coleslaw, topped with their special russian dressing.  I thought, well, other places must be able to make a similar pastrami since they all source it from only a few sources in LA, but Langer's has some secret process to make it awesome.  I've also tried putting coleslaw on pastrami at other places, but it was not even close.  The only thing and this is not something that is classic, but I would have preferred it not on slices of bread as it was really falling apart with all the tasty fillings.  . . Very old school restaurant, with parking across the street.
