Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Chicken and waffles... it sounds kind of suspicious doesn't it? Well fear not mon frere because the combination is truly a force to be reckoned with! It is GREAT! An especially pleasant surprise and I think that I'm hooked for life.. . I went to this location on a saturday afternoon. There was about a 20 minute wait. I will mention that hustlers have learned quickly that since there are always people waiting to get into Roscoe's they can profit enormously. It's like fishing for fish in a barrel... easy prey. So just be wary and don't feel bad to decline.. . Onto the restaurant... its nothing fancy at all. It's very humble but clean. The menu is rather simple but I guess keeping it simple means you have the ability to perfect it. Â I ordered the Lisa's Sunrise (half ice tea, half lemonade.... nothing special but then again, I like my ice tea SWEET and this didn't come close). I went on to order the #18... thigh and waffle ($6.45). Sounds like nothing much right? WRONG! It was more than filling and yummy it was! . . I had also ordered a side of mac and cheese, thinking that one piece of chicken and a waffle would never fill me up... was I ever wrong. The mac and cheese was AMAZING! My mouth still waters just thinking about it. BUT it was quite pricey for a side order... $4.20 to be exact. After one bite though, I became much more forgiving.. . Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles lives up to the hype in my opinion. Its a bit of an iconic establishment so I'd suggest that you make the effort to go there atleast once in your lifetime. I don't think that you'll be disappointed! The ONLY reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the drink wasn't all that great and the side of mac and cheese cost me $4.20!!! Sigh... a students budget doesn't leave much for splurging...
