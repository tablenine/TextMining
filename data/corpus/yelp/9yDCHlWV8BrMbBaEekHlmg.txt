Gastro, "sometimes you just gotta say WTF...If you can't say it, you can't do it.". So, I said it and I did it... I went to a resto next to Lenox Mall! Yeah, you heard me, the mall of 16 yr old guidos and O.G's. Most restos near the mall is just bad. Upscale chains with expense account price tags and mediocre food. . . Hashiguchi was a nice little surprise...even though it has been around for years, I just never thought anything of it. The food here is surprisingly accurate Japanese. Fried Octopus, grilled fishcakes, monkfish liver, raw squid, fried oysters, mackerel in vinegar and cucumber, sweet shrimp, scallop sashimi, omakase of sashimi, atsuage tofu and the wacky Natto (fermented soybean) was definitely a taste to acquire. . . Everything was pretty darn tasty. Best sushi in Atlanta, prolly not but I would definitely go back b/c of the variety. The sweet shrimp (prawn) was amazing especially the goodness inside the head. The menu is pretty extensive and it will take a few visits to explore most of it. . . Luckily the mall closes at 9pm and didn't have to worry about being chased by Guido the killer pimp.
