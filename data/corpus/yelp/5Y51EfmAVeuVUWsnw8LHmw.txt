Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Please note that I've only tried dessert here.. . While I haven't heard much about Ugo, I've walked by it many times.  It is in a prime location in Culver City--across the street from the movie theater.  Ugo usually has a decent crowd.  . . Once you walk inside the restaurant, the dining area is very small and bustling.  We ate outside.  It was a little on the cold side, but the heat lamps helped.  It is actually nice to eat outside and people watch.  You can actually preview the desserts behind the glass counter before ordering.. . Everyone in our party ordered desserts (we ate at the nearby Honey Kettle for dinner; their desserts are limited).  My dessert came very late.  The problem was that the waitress forgot to put the order in.  While I waited, i sampled the tiramisu (it was okay, nothing I would remember, but not bad).  When my gelato finally came, the flavor was fine.  It had melted quite a bit though--I wondered if it was because the waitress forgot about it again, and it sat for a while.. . Sometimes you get good service and sometimes you get bad service, that's just the way it goes.  But then something odd happened.  The woman who sat us (I think she may have been the manager) came by and said, "So...(pause)...how was your service tonight?").  The tone definitely was "I know your service was bad.  Do you have any complaints?"  I appreciated that she noticed the bad service (a lot of managers at other places don't even notice and seem shocked when you bring it up), but what are you supposed to say?  You don't want to get the person in trouble.  (And having worked at a restaurant) there can be many reasons why service is slow.  So we said everything was fine.. . Anyway, I may be back for dinner sometime to try it out.
