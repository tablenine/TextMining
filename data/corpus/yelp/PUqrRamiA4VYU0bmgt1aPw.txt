Fantastic cemitas. I had the cemita de milanesa and it was a revelation. The milanesa was perfectly seasoned and seemed to be homemade with much care. The combination of the chipotle, the queso de oaxaca, the avocado....just wonderful.. . The tacos arabes were wonderful, with the grilled onions and nicely seasoned-pork. I had not seen tacos arabes on a menu since being in playa del carmen (tacos Israel) and these were quite a nice rendition. . . I got my order to go and the staff could not have been friendlier to me.
