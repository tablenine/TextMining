This is a very cute place right in Los Feliz, helping to make this my favorite part of L.A.  Great salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees.. . Last night we had a great time sharing all of the delicious food that was brought to our table.  Veggie burger was homemade and tasty, Lamb burger was awesome.  The sliders are a mix of Kobe, Lamb and Bison with their own toppings.  These are small but so rich they would make a good dinner with a side salad.  . . They only feature 2 beers, which is a bit odd.  But my Chimey did come in the authentic glass, a rarity, which is great.. . The desserts and coffee are a stand out here.  Try the bread pudding, which is overflowing with crunch on top and chocolate in the middle.  So good!. . Great effort but a bit expensive, I guess you gotta pay rent in that neighborhood.  Great date place or stop before a show.
