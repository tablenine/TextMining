I loved my prime rib!! Sure it's $42 but it's  for a piece of juicy well flavored piece of meat that's the size of your face. it was so big that I had to give VERY generous portions to five other girls and i still only ate half of what was left.  ...and for all of who think i have a girly appetite,  i don't (i'll eat 18 oz w/ no prob).. . The bachelorette ate the WHOLE prime rib all by herself  (it's that good). . The sides we had were creamed spinach (okay), mashed potatoes (pretty good) and spinach w/ mushroom (really good).. . And to boot, our waiter gave us a recommendation of a wine of great value that wasn't in the $80 range. I appreciate that.
