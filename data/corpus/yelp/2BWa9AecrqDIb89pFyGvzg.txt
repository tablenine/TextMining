Easily one of my fav Thai places in town.  I used to frequent this spot when I lived in the neighborhood, and I often took people from out of town here.. . In the summer the back patio is an amazing spot on a hot day.  A great get away from the busy Broadway traffic.  . . Get the Spring Rolls.  They are the best I've had in Chicago.
