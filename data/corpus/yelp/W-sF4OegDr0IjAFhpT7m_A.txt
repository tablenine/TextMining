This place is def worth 4 stars.  The burgers can be pricey, but you can get it any way you want and the ingedients are fresh and tasty.  You can get a beef or turkey burger, grilled chicken breast, or veggie patty (though I can't understand why you would go to a burger joint to get a veggie burger) and a vast array of different toppings.  . . I personally prefer the burger on lettuce rather than on a bun, since they can get quite big and hard to eat on said bun.  But I've had them both ways, and they're both good.
