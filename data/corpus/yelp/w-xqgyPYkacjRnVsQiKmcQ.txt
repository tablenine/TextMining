Ok, so this update is strictly for the brunch we had this past Sunday. . . On recommendation from fellow yelpers Pam and Taylor, Laura and I decided to meet them, along with some other friends here for brunch on Sunday. . Of course the patio here is awesome so it makes for eating outside even better. The staff is still incredibly friendly and it's good to see some familiar faces that I haven't seen in a while. . The food was spot on. I had an omelet with grits and a biscuit; while Laura had the veggie scramble, potatoes and grits. The grits get voted second best I have ever had for me as they were oh so good. The biscuits are HUGE!!! and you could make a meal out of just one. . . But what really stole the show for me here was the price. It's so cheap which makes this place such a great value. Sunday brunch is just one more thing Cypress Street is doing extremely well!
