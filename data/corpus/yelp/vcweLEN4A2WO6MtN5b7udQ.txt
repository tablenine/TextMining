The negative reviews are totally clueless.  First, the chili dogs are the benchmark for all chili dogs.  "Bad  chili," some yokel says.  OF COURSE, on it's own, but it's not supposed to be chili ON ITS OWN.  Most chili dogs are a competition between the hot dog and the chili, with the chili (usually with stupid beans) drowning the dog so you can't eat it without knife and fork.  The Varsity chili dog is a perfect balance between the bun, the dog, the chili and the mustard (and the optional fresh onions) -- and easy to fondle.  The rings and the fried pies are best-in-class.  But by nature they don't travel well.  If you order them to go, they WILL go limp or the crust soft by the time you get home.. . And that brings me to freshness.  EVERYTHING is fresh.  The Varsity invented "just-in-time" long before McDonald's.. . Also, the other sandwiches....  Grow up and try the "chili steak" (chili burger to the newbies).  The others -- ham and swiss on rye, pimento, or house chicken salad -- are unique and delicious.. . The frosted orange (NOT "frozen" orange) is a trademark milkshake.  The basis was an old non-carbonated soft drink called Bireley's and vanilla ice cream.  They used to make it from scratch but it now comes out like a hard slush.  Not as good today, but still a must for a Varsity pig-out.. . As for prices, don't be ridiculous!  First, they sit on prime downtown real estate; second, business taxes in Atlanta are SKY-HIGH to cover the asses of the corrupt and incompetent city government.  Believe me, they don't wanna charge so much, but they have to.  So, think before you rant.. . Sorry, Varsity trashers -- the problem isn't the Big V, it's you.  If you don't like The Varsity, then you're not an Atlantan.  Go away.
