Had a really nice and casual dinner with him on a Monday.  Unlike a Friday/Sat night, the place was loosely populated with patrons, enabling us to park right outside the door and to be seated in the plush chairs by the fireplace.. . Soon after placing the order, our appetizer Korean chili fried calamari came out and it was delicious!  It was almost like a marriage of Italian fried calamari and Korean fried chicken (just the seasoning part).  The bacon chicken entree was equally delicious, but I must say I would've gone for another round of the calamari if it weren't for caloric concerns. . . Very friendly service and comfortable atmosphere.  I'm sure we'll be back for a night of live music, good java, and munches.
