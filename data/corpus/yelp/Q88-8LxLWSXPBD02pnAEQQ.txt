Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This has got to be the best prime rib experience I've ever had.  Besides waiting for a bit even though we had reservations, once we sat down, the service and food was amazing.  The spinning salad was surprisingly good, and I usually don't like eating salad.  Plus the waitress pouring the salad dressing way above her head is always a good show.  I had the "Diamond Jim Brady" cut of prime rib and it was very juicy and arrived cooked medium rare, just as I ordered.  My bf and I signed up on . http://opentable.com.  and we commented that it was our anniversary, so we got free strawberry cake!  Yum!  This is a great place for special occasions and I will be back for more.
