Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Eat It OR Beat It?. **EAT IT!!**. . Went here for brunch and realized we couldn't order the pastas and such. The decor was very nice and sheek inside. A place like this you'd never expect to have SUPER reasonable prices! If you're going on a date, this place is a great one to go to! However, it can tend to get a little bit noisy.. . Sausage Pizza ($16):. Fair, nothing special but edible nonetheless. Good size for extra guests you may have.. . Modena Salad ($12):. VERY tasty and very fresh. I was impressed and each flavor from the ingredients of walnuts, goat cheese, herbs, and balsamic vinaigrette.. . CONCLUSION:. Bottega Louie is tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. If I had a dinner or guest, I would consider it as one of my options in the downtown area, but nothing I would crave or recommend right off the top of my head. Try it nonetheless. Prices are great and ambiance is Â nice.
