I don't frequent coffee shops. Not because I don't like them, and not because I don't like coffee. I love coffee. Espresso specifically. I just get bored if I don't have a real reason to hang out there. But this place is in my neighborhood so it was inevitable that I would stop in at some point. The coffee I did have here was damn good. Real damn good. . And the place itself is very cool and comfortable if you are inclined to hang out all day or meet up with someone.
