Being from PA Dutch country chicken and waffles ain't nothing new to me.  There they are served savory with mounds of smothered chicken.  Having said that RHCW is O.K.  I've never left this place full and neither has my wallet. . I'm a wing man I got the wing special.  3 scrawny wings and 1 side???  For shame.  You call your self a soul food place?  The wings were good and greens were mean but I don't like leaving a soul food place hungry.  Just not right is all.
