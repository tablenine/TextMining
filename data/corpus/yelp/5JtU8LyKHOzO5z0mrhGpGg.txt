Cute little sushi place in my old neighborhood of Ravenswood (so trendy now!)  It's about a block away from the library and baseball park.  Went here for Sunday lunch around 1:30 and lucky for us they have a whole menu of half price maki's from 1:30-6pm (Saturday-Sunday).  Sushi was OK.  Just bothered me that it was a gorgeous sunny spring day outside but inside it was completely dark...like they were trying to set the mood at 1 in the afternoon!  Geez!  Would definitely go back for the great sushi deal!
