Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
This is a great noodle shop at great prices. It recently went through a renovation, and is now double the size (although they have yet to open up the entire space). They have lunch specials during the weekdays which are a steal. Joy's is also BYOB.
