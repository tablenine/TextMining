Restaurant: Terroni
Category: Italian
Terroni is my favorite spot for moderately priced Italian in LA.  The pasta is all freshly made in-house, and it's usually very well prepared.  For a first visit I recommend ordering the tagliatelli bolognese, it's a good test-dish to see whether you will like the rest of the menu.  The wine list offers numerous italian wines.  I only order reds (so have no clue about the white wines) but the reds range from $40 to $80, very reasonable.  The only downside to this place is that they do not take reservations.
