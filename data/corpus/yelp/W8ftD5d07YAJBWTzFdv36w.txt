I know that everyone always raves about their pizza, but I think it's greasy and I always feel sick when I'm done eating. Maybe it's because I eat too much, but it is WAY too greasy. I do, however, enjoy their cookie pizza. It comes out baked fresh with ice cream and whipped cream on top. Yum. Save room for dessert.
