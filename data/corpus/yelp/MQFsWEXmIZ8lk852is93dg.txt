I zeroed in on this place via the Z. Guide and was pleasantly surprised, by the New York Times review on the wall, too. This isn't the time or place to chime about alternative critics, though. I felt a bit down dressed, but that's LA. for you, the patio was comfortable.  . .  I liked my breakfast and the fruit bowl, with fresh mangoes, figs, plumots and more.  I will pay a little extra for a well-rounded breakfast. I was kind of surprised that they offered a side of green salad with a breakfast entree, though. I will bring people here but probably sit inside next time to spare the flies and hopefully be a bit less rushed. Didn't like receiving the check while we were halfway through our meal despite her polite "Take your time, guys."
