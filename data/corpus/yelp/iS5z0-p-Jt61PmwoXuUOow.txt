Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
The Holy Taco highlights: Fresh guacamole, queso and mild salsa verde.. . Low-lights: The chips are thick and therefore a little greasy. . . Atmosphere: a Perfect patio that is covered in one area. The inside is dim and quiet with moderately tight seating if crowded.. . Price: If you are looking for the Speedy, take your butt to El Chupacabre or something, otherwise the prices seem reasonable.
