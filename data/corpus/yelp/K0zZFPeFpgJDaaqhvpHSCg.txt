Restaurant: Grand Lux Cafe
Category: American (New)
Every time I hear people hatin' on the Cheesecake Factory, I have to wonder... do you really? Or do you hate the fact that everyone and their mom seems to go? Be honest... they do have better than decent food. Grand Lux Cafe is only marginally elevated in price from the Cheesecake Factory and from my first experience there seems proportionally better in terms of food. . . Food: The Grand Appetizer Platter can easily be your meal. It's plated on a cute tiki style tray with tons of tasty finger food like chicken satay, spring rolls (not authentic but delicious anyway), Thai shrimp, and other assorted fried food. I didn't try any of the actual dinner or lunch items, but the sandwiches looked pretty average according to what I saw at the next table. You do get a lot of food in each order which is nice. The novel thing about Grand Lux is the variety of fresh baked desserts. You have to wait 30 minutes for it to come out so it's a good idea to order in advance. The beignets with three sauces are to die for as is the molten chocolate cake. I'd come here just for dessert if I didn't feel like getting an entire meal. It's that good. . . Atmosphere: The decor is kinda cheesy with lots of painted glass and gold foil here and there, like a Cheesecake Factory on steroids. You don't need to dress up to eat here as it's usually frequented by Beverly Center shoppers, but it's a nice place to relax and digest.
