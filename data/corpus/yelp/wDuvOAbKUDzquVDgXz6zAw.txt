Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Bottega Louie seems as if someone carved out the dining terrace at a posh shopping mall and plopped it in the middle of downtown LA.. . Beautifully accented and appointed, glorified "Italian deli" with wine selection &amp; section, deli, and a dining area.  Very cosmopolitan / Euro-chic for the regentrified and yuppie dwellers and loiterers of downtown LA.  Very packed with purveyors fashionably decked out to the 9's.. . However, the food was immemorable save for the oft-mentioned Portabello fries (maybe because I was immersed in great conversations), and the lighting in the dining area seemed incommensurate with noise level of everyone trying to talk over everyone else.  Too dim, too loud.  Maybe some strategically placed Dynamat or canvas paintings would help.
