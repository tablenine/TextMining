I'm going to go out on a limb here....and i mean WAY out on a limb, like the kid in the tree in John Knowles' "A Separate Peace"..... . the food here sucks donkey balls.... sorry, it just does.. . the first time i went i got the house specialty, that onion chicken dish.  chicken was DRY as could be.  reminded me of thanksgiving dinners when mom would get too drunk and place the turkey upside-down in the oven and then overcook the poor thing by 2 hours..... . the sauce was....SALTY?? hellooooooooo MACFLY!!!! anybody HOME????? people where are your tastebuds?. . when i told people i didn't have a good experience they told me i was being a gaping A-hole and to go back again.  so i did..... . second time was equally garbag-a-licious.... had a rice dish with red sauce and stringy meat.  it tasted like my 5 yr. old nephew Gregory was having a go at playing sous chef in the kitchen.  he's a rascal that one..... . again, everyone told me to try it again... so i did.  the third and final time i threw up afterwards.  and let me be the first to say when i was broke in college i lived on 7-eleven hamburgers and taco bell fare. so i don't have a weak stomach by any means.. . i've been told that the other Versailles is better, but i'm kind of over the whole thing.  OH and that bread they serve you upon being seated is SO soaked in grease it's like a eating pork rinds. gross!
