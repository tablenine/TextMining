Category: Barbeque
The ribs, side dishes and BBQ nachos are heavenly, simply delicious, you can't stop eating them, the live entertainment (we heard Jimbo-Delta) was divine - that man plays guitar like a god! Well drinks were stiff :) and the service (bartender and wait staff) was excellent. They have outdoor seating, but we were inside. What a great neighborhood-type place, I'd go there again and again.
