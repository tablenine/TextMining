Restaurant: Cafe di Sol
Category: American (New)
Perfect little spot to start a glitzy night with your girl friends sipping mojitos and margaritas or Spanish wine under festive lanterns watching the people stroll by as you lean back in your pain chipped chair.. . The calamari is a perfect appetizer to have with your drinks with a slightly more sweet and sour dipping sauce then a typical spicy marinara.. . The servers are hot and spicy, a bit slow, but why rush a good thing?. . Sometimes you can catch 3 strong men strumming away on their classical guitars lightening up everyone's spirits. Â And sometimes you just have to enjoy the company sitting beside you.. . Whatever you are up to this weekend, make time for some sol and join your friends for some tapas and drinks at this Highland must!
