you see,. . it's fresh. tasty. clean beautiful flavors. cool people. . and dammit, i can see the house that I grew up in from the walkway out their backdoor. . when I was a kid, the thai place a few doors down was an old fashioned pizza joint.....very "american authentic" with sawdust on the ground and fantabulous pies.....of course all that could be wishful childhood memories.... . back to the pho---it's perfect and always a respite from the mucked up flavors that we call most restaurant cooking.... . and I always come at off hours (I think it rarely closes) so never any real wait!
