Ode on a Greasy Bun - by John Eats. . What a great little discovery.  . . Nestled in a random mini-mall on LaBrea, I probably had driven by Umami 50 times without noticing it.  Or, if I did notice it I probably thought it was a sushi place.   This is certainly no sushi place.. . This IS certainly one of the best burger places in L.A.   It all starts with the bun.  I really do not want to know the calorie count of that bun, because the way it melts in your mouth reminds me of Hawaiian Sweet Bread buns that have are insanely high in calories.   I'd rather pretend that the bun was in someway a healthy choice, but no matter - that is one fine bun.  . . I've had the Umami Burger and the Port &amp; Stilton Burger and both were excellent, but if I had to choose I'd go with the signature Umami burger.  The meat is of very high quality, and what I notice about it is that it hasn't been overhandled like many burgers are.   A good burger should just barely hold together.  . . I've heard some people complain about the size of the sides, and they do seem small when you first see them.  But I have never left hungry, so I have to assume that it isn't that Umami gives too little, it is that most places give too much!. . Props also are earned for their collection of "real sodas".  Personally, I go for the Abita Root Beer.  . . The vibe inside is great, and it looks like they might already be expanding.  Parking can be a hassle, but no worse than most places.
