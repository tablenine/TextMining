Restaurant: The Highlander
Category: Dive Bars
The best part about the Highlander is their consistency and price. The food is good, not great, but it is consistently good bar food. And also, the bar food has a selective menu with some very good dinner entrees too. And you can't be the reasonable prices. Their reasonable prices also extend into their beer pricing. I know PBR is a $2 or $2.50 for a pint and the Miller and Bud were either $3 or $3.50. That's good pricing in my book for Intown Atlanta. The staff is very friendly. I have been quite a few times and they have never let me down.
