Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
if Langer's Deli got into a fist fight with all of the other delis in los angeles at the same time then langer's would win. with one arm tied behind its delicious pastrami back even. . . this place is amaaaaazing. best pastrami and corned beef i have had in a long time. i had the sandwich that everyone has with the swiss and coleslaw but i changed the pastrami to corned beef. i don't even like coleslaw and this sandwich was the BEST. i have mid day and middle of the night awake-dreams about sandwiches from langers. . . the waitresses are really nice and i want them to adopt me and take me to their little pastrami and bread houses where we can live happily ever after. . . the only-- and i mean ONLY-- downfall of this place is their hours of operation. i am pretty sure they are only open from 8-4 and closed on sundays. i need more time, langers! when they decide to stay open later so that i can get a sandwich for dinner then i will change my review to 6 stars. i don't know how i will do that but i will!
