The place is a little small and the parking is hard BUT their drinks are so totally amazing!  It's very hip but not snooty at all.  I personally love the Strawberry Field Martini...omg, it's soooo good.  I've tried their food too and it's not bad but it's not the best..which is normal for a bar food.  The place is usually really loud with music and the people having fun.. . *Food = ok. *Drinks = wonderful!. *Price = descent. *Service = ok
