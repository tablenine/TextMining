Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Having been at the Griddle previously, I was very surprised to see so many negative things about this FANTASTIC restaurant.  Considering what you get, by way of service and food, it is the best breakfast restaurant in the world.  . . I know breakfast and it is the best.  . . Stop complaining about large portions (dont eat it all or take some home, or better yet, give the remaining to a hungry homeless person) . . Price is in line with everything else in that catagory, you want cheap, go do Denny's.. . All in, amazing food and variety, fantastic service, and because its so good, a long wait if you go on the weekend.  Take a friend and people watch and talk, its why your getting together anyway.
