Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Sports Bars
I'm probably completely alone in my sentiment and it only reflects my bad taste, but I actually like the food at Barney's Beanery. This place usually has a fair amount of people (which isn't always a bad thing) and if memory serves, those cigarette peddlers that give you free packs in exchange for your address come around here fairly often (I loved those people!). I wouldn't call this place a dive bar, but this is not a place to go if you're a woman wearing a $300 pair of shoes. It's more of a Â casual hang out with sticky floors for people who aren't bothered by that. I still prefer the sticky floors to the peanut shells and/or hay (or whatever that is!) I've encountered in some supposedly "classy" restaurants.
