After making a reservation 1 month in advance...we finally ate at Mozza this weekend.. . The atmosphere is nice, nothing spectacular, and overall the food was good. I don't think it's as amazing as some people say...The main dining room is noisey! For a $200 dinner, I was very happy to be in the quieter room in the back.. . Burrata w/Bacon - tasty, since this cheese is amazing, but this dish is nothing to write home about. . Octupus - totally overrated. the waitress even said that it would taste like chicken, which it did...why then am i paying so much for something to taste just like chicken?!?. . The wild boar pasta was really great and so was the egg and butter pasta.. . The lamb was mediocre and Â with 2 1/2 bottles of wine, dinner was $200.. . I'd recommend to go here once, but not really worth the month wait or the price tag.
