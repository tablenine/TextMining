Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Condiments are supposed to *complement* the taste of an ingredient, not provide the entire flavor profile.. . So, when you eat sushi, the major ingredient you should taste is . . . fish, right?. . Not at Tank.  The rolls we ate tasted good because of what was drizzled on or around it.  The fish in our rolls was thinly sliced, a little wiggly, and did not taste fresh at all.  . . It was not quite *bad*. I would give this place five stars if it were a quick take-out sushi place in the loop with great lunch specials. . . But the quality of the food definitely did not match up to the prices or  the concept of the restaurant.  Their sushi is grab-a-roll-on-the-go-when-you-have-a-sushi-itch quality, not let's-go-out-and-have-a-lovely-dinner quality.. . meh.
