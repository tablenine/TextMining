Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I give Katsu-Ya five starts because it was the first sushi place I ever went to in Los Angeles, and because to this day I have not had anything better. It has been probably seven years since I've been there, but I will always remember the $200 I put on my boss's corporate card to buy lunch for the office--still to this day the most money I've ever spent on food all in one place. Katsu-Ya holds a special place in my sushi-loving heart.
