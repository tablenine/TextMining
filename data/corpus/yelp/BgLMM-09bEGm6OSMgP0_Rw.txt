Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Line is ALWAYS long --- regardless of day, time whatever. I've tried going at different times --- but no, still a line.. . I love the hotdogs tho! I like the options they have with polish dog, spicy, turkey dog and tofu dog. I dont eat too many "Real" dogs so this gives an option!. . Regardless of the line I will still wait and spend time with friends, so it turns into an outting and not just your typical wait for food.
