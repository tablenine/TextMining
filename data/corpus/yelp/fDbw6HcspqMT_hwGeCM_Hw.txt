Restaurant: Uncle Maddio&#39;s Pizza Joint
Category: Italian
Can't say I am a huge fan of the pizza here, but it's certainly not the worst pizza joint in Atlanta by far...... . Pros:. -It's like a "Moe's" for pizza, you walk in, tell them exactly what you want on your pizza, from the crust up...build-your-own-pizza...I like it..... - The pizza tastes great if you eat it quick enough. -Nice friendly staff and nice dining area. -Great Customer service. -Variety of pizzas and toppings to choose from, pretty much any way you want your pizza made, you can have it. . Cons:. . -Hard to find from the road (need better signage). - The pizzas are SO greasy/oily that if you don't eat it quick enough, the crust just falls apart due to being soaked by oil... (or at least that was my experience when I went during my one visit)..... (hence my turnoff)..... . Obviously the pros outweigh the cons.....
