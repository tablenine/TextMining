Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Great place for a burger or one of the many (over 100) sandwiches and bottomless iced tea. Outdoor seating in a cool area of the city. My friend had the Angus burger (great!), and I had the Mindy F chicken sandwich. The Ciabatta I had was so-so, but the onion and pretzel buns looked like the right choice.
