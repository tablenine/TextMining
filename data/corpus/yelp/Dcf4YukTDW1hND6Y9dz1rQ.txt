Some of the best food in Lakeview. I've never had anything here that I was less than totally satisfied by!. . This cozy neighborhood stop cooks up some of the best sandwiches, pastas, and desserts in the area! Most includes their delicious and hearty homebaked breads, which unlike the fancy breads of nearby Bittersweet, are much more rustic.. . Lets start with the appetizers. I almost always get an appetizer when I am here, because they have two of my favorites in town: GOATCHEESE CROSTINI - which is their toasted bread with huge helpings of amazing goat cheese and sundried tomato relish and HONGOS RELLENOS - which as large mushrooms crammed with mouthwatering cheese, spinach and chopped mushrooms, all in a tomato basil sauce. Yum!. . I've not tried any of their Pizzas or Salads, but I've tried most of their Pastas and Sandwiches, and have no complaints. Standout pastas include the SPICY PENNE and FUSILLI CON JAMON. My favorite sandwich is the SUPER PANES (bacon, turkey, ham, swiss, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard) but my mother always likes getting the Portabella mushroom sandwich.. . They have a white board inside that changes with daily specials, always offering some great non-menu options (their soups are always spectacular). . . At the end of the meal, grab a dessert (I recommend the lemon custard with fresh blueberries, if they have it) and don't forget to grab a loaf of savory or sweet bread to take home with you!. . The only two things to watch out for are 1) It is a small place and it gets crowded around rush times. During the summer there is a bit of outdoor seating, which is lovely. 2) They only take cash! One time I tried to pay with a travelers cheque, which is basically the same as cash, and it was a no go - kind of annoying since I usually pay on my VISA, so make sure you have some cash on you.
