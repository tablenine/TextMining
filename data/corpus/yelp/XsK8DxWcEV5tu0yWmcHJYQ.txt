This is my girlfriend's (yeah, I said it) favorite place.  Is it good Mexican food?  I don't really know.  It's good Mexi-mericanized food I guess, and the atmosphere adds to the experience.. . What they do make, they do well.  Good guacamole, the more authentic Mexican dishes are done pretty good, although I can't remember any of their names right now.. . If you want margaritas, go here and get yo' fiesta on.  They make good ones from what I can remember.  But Cesar's will get the job done faster and cheaper.  . . Call ahead and put your name in line, so that you don't have to wait when you get there.. . And don't get caught in the hustle and bustle of the place, especially when its busy.  Between the vibrating pager, the crowd and people all waiting to sit, its easy to feel like you have to get in, eat and get out.  Sit down, have a drink, eat your chips and salsa...and enjoy your food.  That's what we did.  And made out.  . . And the servers are good about leaving you alone.  They're busy enough....and do a good job.
