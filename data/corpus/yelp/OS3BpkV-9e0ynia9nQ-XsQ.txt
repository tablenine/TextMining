I really would like to love this place.  My sister (Katie B.) seems to.  However, I found the tempeh burger dry and somewhat lacking in flavor.  The service was kind and personal, but sporadic.  I didn't take the time to browse their gift shop, but from afar it looked interesting.  . . It also looks like it could get very crowed when it's busy (tables really close to each other).  Because my sister loved it so much, I'm sure I will return.  I'll have to eat something other than the tempeh burger though.
