You buy a card and can taste as many wines as you want for the amount you put on the card. You can recharge it and if you have credit left on it by the end of the evening, no problem, the card does not expire. I went with a group of girlfriends and we had a good time but I wasn't super impressed with the wine. Why? I'm not a big wine fan (I know, weird for a French person...) and the ones I like are dessert wines (Monbaz is my fav.) and they did not have any. The ambiance was cool, the finger food was good and I saw there one of the best looking men ever. Beautiful.
