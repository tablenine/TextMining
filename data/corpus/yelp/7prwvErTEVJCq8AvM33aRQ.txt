I was hankering for a good breakfast this morning because I have a long day ahead of me.  Afterall, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right?  So I mosey-ed on in here with high hopes of a nutritious and reasonably priced breakfast that's at least one step up from your local Denny's and IHOP.. . I sat at a corner table and immediately ordered coffee.  For once... the coffee was strong.  Thank-freaking-goodness.  Was it worth $2.50?  I'm not sure... but I suppose I would have to say yes considering the fact you get free refills.. . I ordered the french toast with bananas and berries with a side of smoked bacon.  I had to have the sweet and savory combination otherwise, the balance would be totally off.  The french toast was light, and fluffy inside with a nice crispness outside.  The fruit was so sweet and fresh that I really didn't need any maple syrup.  The bacon was perfectly cooked.  Not one inch was under or overcooked.. . Food was good and most satisfactory.  Not greasy, not heavy, but just right.  I think I've been appropriately fueled for the day.. . My only gripe about this place is the price.  I am accustomed to coupons, 2 for 1 deals, and 33 cent microwavable burritos.  I paid almost 20 bucks (with tip) for a breakfast.  $20 bucks for one meal?  Yikes.  Is there gold in them french toast?!    Geez... $2.95 for 3 strips of bacon.   Could I get a discount if I brought my own and you cooked it for me?. . 4 stars for now.  I will update once I sample more possible deliciousness.
