Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I love the Father's Office burger more than life itself sometimes. The first time I took a bit out of this burger, the juices oozed out of the sides of the patty. The blue and gruyere cheeses melt over the burger in cheesey perfection, while the caramelized onions and the greens round the sandwich off to the T.. . I understand how this is often seen more of a sandwich than a burger because of the baguette used, I won't argue with that distinction. But DAMN is it a good "sandwich".. . I've ordered the cheese plate. The cheeses were served warm? Which was a little strange to me. I like hard cheeses. I'd never know if that's what they once were in this case. The nut bread it was served with was pretty bomb. If it wasn't for melting the cheeses, I would be raving about the place. Keep my cheese plate as fresh as can be please!. . But other than that... I love their fries, salads, sandwiches, and atmosphere. And if I could handle alcohol, I'm sure I'd be falling out of my seat from the beer selection.. . Go team!
