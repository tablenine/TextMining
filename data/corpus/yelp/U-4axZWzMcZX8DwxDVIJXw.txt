There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said and there is really no way I can describe the experience that will do it justice.  This was my third experience at Alinea and my fifth experiencing the creativity and artistry of Chef Achatz.  I had fabulous dining companions, impeccable service and food that touches every sense and beyond.  I'll keep the rest of the experience my own because I'm not willing to share it any further.
