Well, I finally made in to this place and was hoping for better, There service was very good- the cashier was very helpful and patient- since I did not come alone I was with 3 very hungry and ornery kids. . . The chicken- I have to admit- was very flavorful and the fried bananas were equally good. The rice- was bland and the black beans were undercooked. . . My friend had the pulled pork sandwich... and she was hugely disappointed! I tasted it... and agreed. The meat Â was bland and the sauces that they offered did little to make it taste better.. . My kids hated the fries! To me, they were so so.. . So if I make it back to this place, I'll just stick to the chicken- that was worth the trip!
