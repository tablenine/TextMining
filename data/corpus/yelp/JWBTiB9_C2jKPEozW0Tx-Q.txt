I feel like I'm in an Archie Comic style 'Pop's Burgers' throwback to the past everytime I eat here!  It's counterservice and very cozy but be prepared for long lines and even grumpier service if you go during lunch or dinner.  . . The hamburgers are good but pricey!  Close to $9 for a burger and that's without fries.  But the meat is fresh.  I know that some yelpers have complained about the cleanliness but seriously, the place is just a little greasy.  You can see your food being prepared right in front of you.. . Cash only and the servers/burger people are grumpy! Don't ask too many questions or you'll be glared at.  I love it!  how many times have I dined with indecisive people who ask a dozen questions and then decide not to order?  Well, I'll like to see them try that here.  I've seen a Kate Hudson trendy mom getting chewed out when she had the cheek to ask for soymilk and maybe tofu.  Grief, this is a burger joint, not a vegan place.  Why bother to come here in the first place?  Needless to say, her kids enjoyed their meaty burgers and greasy fries with great relish while she sat shell-shocked throughout the rest of her meal.  It appears that the whole I'm beautiful, blonde, and skinny thing doesn't charm the burger man!. . Grumpy service aside, this place is great for a non nonsense meal.  Hubby and I split a slice of apple pie and our burger man decided to give us two slices instead at no extra charge.  He told me not to eat it if it's no good but it was so I gobbled it up.  He continued to grumble his way down the counter, doing what he does best, serve up a nice burger, fries, soft drink, and a slice of pie.  Couldn't get any more Americana than that!. . Oh, it's CASH only!
