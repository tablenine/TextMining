" Eek! Methinks not. " is an understatement.....I think a big "Hell No!" is in order for this review on Flash Taco. This is by far the worst place I have ever been to. I took one bite of a tamale and seriously spit it out in front of the restaurant! Â Wicker Park needs to have this placed removed at once!. . Let's all vow to never go there again! If you have a late night "i'm drunk, need food" urge, then I urge you to go elsewhere like Taco Burrito Express or something. you could pick out garbage from someone's trash in the ally and it would be better than this!
