Went here to check out a friend's acoustic bluegrass set.  I have no idea why I had never ventured in here before, given the facts A) I love coffee and B) I love traveling.  You'd think I'd have invented this place.. . It has a laid back, easy atmosphere with a full wall of travel books (thanks to Lonely Planet) and a little shop in the back.  The food is all vegetarian and is yummy.  Be careful if you get dessert with your sandwich, as the bill will quickly add up when a (huge) piece of cake costs $5.  However, the staff was nice enough to refill my latte cup with a little coffee to go with my dessert at no extra charge.  . . All in all, cool place with a good vibe to it.  Next time I think I'll eat at home and just come for coffee and dessert.
