After many failed attempts due to long lines I finally was able to try this place out. The menu maybe be intimidating or even overwhelming (there was so much I wanted to try from the menu!) but the key is to focus on a particular meal your in the mood for (breakfast =eggs/ lunch= burger, etc) prior to getting there or while your waiting on line. This place is definitely my kind of place food wise, if you want fancy customer service or a place to socialize your not welcomed because you patronize this place (if your lucky enough) purely for the food. Now if I can only be lucky enough for a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and maybe even VIP status to dodge the wait (wishful thinking)!
