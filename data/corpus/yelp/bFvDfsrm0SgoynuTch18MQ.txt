Mmm, mmm, mmm, the Griddle.  Yeah, there's a wait - but who cares? Once you get in there and get a look at that massive pancake menu the wait is a thing of the past.  And the pancakes are HUUUGE.  I almost always make the mistake of ordering pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon only to have at least one of those items completely neglected because I'm too busy trying to finish the ginormous pancakes.  . . I especially enjoy taking out-of-town guests here, because I can almost always guarantee them a b- or c- list celebrity sighting, which is a trip for out-of-towners.  . . Oh - they have lunch too, but I never pay attention to the lunch options; I'm too in love with breakfast.
