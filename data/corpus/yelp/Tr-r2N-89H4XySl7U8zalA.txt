I went to this place after my friend recommended it. I ordered the uncommon salad which is pretty tasty but I had to ask for additional salad dressing. Nevertheless, it was yummy. My friend had the butternut squash ravioli after I noticed that it was not included in the menu.. I asked the waitress and she said that there was one more serving. My friend LOVED the dish. I tried one of the raviolis and it was indeed delicious. A little bit too pricey(17bucks) for me for 7 pieces of ravioli.. . The service was wonderful. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Â I would go back there for sure.
