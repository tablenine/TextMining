Lately, I have had some pretty mediocre dining experiences in this great city. For that reason, I was dreading going out to eat  for fear of being underwhelmed yet again. . . I am happy to report that Bin Wine Cafe has renewed my faith in eating out in Chicago!. . 6 girlfriends and I went here Sunday morning for post-St. Patrick's Day feasting. We were sat immediately and began drinking coffee while we waited for the rest of our party. As soon as I scanned the menu, I was nervous. My pant's size doesn't let on but, I am pretty picky about the food I eat. I generally dislike foods that I haven't been eating for my entire life. My family says I have 'white trash taste buds'; I just really like canned raviolis. . . For this meal, I reached beyond my comfort zone and got a breakfast pizza.  When the server brought it to us, my heart skipped a beat. Was that a poached egg... on... my... pizza? Blech. Instead of crying or refusing to eat it, I just went for it. I stirred the egg around on the hot pizza and swirled the salad around a it. The hot pizza ended up cooking my egg to the point where I felt I could mentally get over the "baby chicken" part. Then, I went in for the kill; I took a bite.. . What happened in my mouth was magical. The pungent cheese mixed with the crisp crust and the salty ham (bacon?) was the perfect flavor burst. I had no idea that food could be this... um... exciting and interesting. It was simply divine. . . I thank Bin Wine Cafe for creating this delicious breakfast and for waking up my taste buds. I recognize I need bigger balls when it comes to trying new foods. I think this was the perfect experience to get me started trying new things.
