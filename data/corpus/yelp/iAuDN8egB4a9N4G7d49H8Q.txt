I am a bit harsh with 3 stars but honestly it was overrated. I was visiting LA and got a visit into FO due to the hype. It is a good burger. I could imagine it as a great place for a beer and burger for Happy Hour or even post- night out place to eat. The burger is soft and grainy and the fries are well prepared, but the price? for that? not worth it. I would say it's better than In-and-Out but it's not reasonably priced. Oh and the staff here is not as bright as the one in Santa Monica.
