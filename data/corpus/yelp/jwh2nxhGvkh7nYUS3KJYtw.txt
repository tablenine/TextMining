Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If you're trying to decide whether or not you want to visit Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles just grab a pencil, sit down and bust out some basic math:. .      Fried Chicken.      Gravy.      Grits. +_Biscuit________. HELL YEAAAAHHH!!. . If you're craving some fried chicken, you've undoubtedly already figured out that Roscoe's will get you that fix like no other place could. Here are some additional incentives (not like you need any) to grab the keys and head out the door right now:. . -GRITS with a heaping mound of butter on top! I would seriously come here just for a to-go box of grits to last me through every meal.. -Watch Snoop Dogg take Larry King to Roscoe's. . http://www.youtube.com.... . (there's also the much more awkward Snoop Dogg takes David Beckham if hot soccer guys are your thing). -The way they take your name down and call you in is amazingly organized and orderly - even with a huge mob the wait was only 15 minutes!. . In all seriousness, I was ridiculously happy with my quarter dark chicken with gravy, grits and a biscuit. Once my arteries recover from this most recent blockage, I will be back for round two!!
