Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I love their prime rib!  . . Once in awhile, I need to go back there.  I never touch these free meatballs as I get full before eating my prime rib, and I am not going to ruin my appetite!  I usually get Californian cut (medium rare) and it is big enough for me.  I sometimes get half corn/spinach sides or no side dishes at all - depends on how hungry I am.  The spinning salad...good, the prime rib sauce...awesome!. . The service is consistently good.  I like the Oak room - instead of the huge main dining room - it has cozy and homey atmosphere.  . . Their bar actually has decent wine selections including my favorite Cakebread Cab - if you are willing to splurge.  :)
