I loved this place. It was strongly recommended to me by a coworker and I was afraid it wasn't going to live up to his hype. But wow did it!. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night at 7 pm. There was parking in the back. I heard the wait can be attrocious, but we were seated in 10 minutes. The crowd moves pretty quickly. . We started off with their specialties...the Dynamite, the Special Scallop Roll, the Masago, and the Saltwater Eel.  All fantastic. But the Dynamite blew my mind. Scallops, mushrooms and some kind of magical sauce had me licking the bowl infront of our waitress. . Me moved onto the Miso soup, freshwater eel roll, yellowtail with green onion roll and some salmon sushi. My boyfriend loved the yellowtail but it was way too mushy for me.  The Miso soup was average. And the freshwater eel was pretty good. And the salmon just feel apart in my mouth...like someone had just killed it 3 seconds before. . All that sushi and beer for 47 bucks! . This is a fun date atmosphere or great when some friends want to have some cheap sushi before a movie. I highly recommend this place if you have a friend that is scared to death to try sushi or is intimidated by all the different types of fish. The sushi is simple and never overwhelming. Great for a first timer. . And i thought the ceiling was just lovely.
