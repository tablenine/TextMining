3.5 stars, really.  I wish there was a way to award half-stars. . . Dinner was fine.  Not amazing, just fine.  I would like to come back and just have cocktails and starters.  All the drinks that I had were amazing, and the prices were fine for the quality.  . . I came for dinner with a party of 7, we all had cocktails, champaign, hors d'oeuvres, a seafood plateau, entrees, a cheese plate, and 4 desserts.  We all shared, so I think that I have a good idea about most of the menu. The bone marrow was great.  The oysters were fine.  The cheese plate was good.  Really, everything was well made and good.  However, nothing really jumped out at me as being amazing.  . . Our service was mediocre.  Nothing bad happened, but it was harder to get help when we needed it, and the way they served and cleared was disorganized.  I would give them the benefit of the doubt because we were a big table, but I have eaten at Sona, so I know what is possible.. . One positive note was the price.  Again, because I have eaten at Sona, I know what is possible, our meal actually came out to be spendy, not as bad as I expected, at less than $100 per person.  With the bar tab, the cheese, the plateau, and the desserts, I expected it to be about $50-75 more.. . I have no regrets about trying Comme Ca, and I would eat dinner there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice, unless I was really craving bone marrow and oxtail jam, or duck confit.  I am going to return to try lunch and/or breakfast at least once, and I will be back to the bar.
