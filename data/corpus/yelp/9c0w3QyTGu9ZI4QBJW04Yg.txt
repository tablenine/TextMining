I've been eating at Houston's throughout So Cal for years and it is one of my favorite places to go.  Despite being a "chain" with locations throughout the country, the food is excellent.  Fresh ingredients, flavorful and consistent broguth to you by an eager staff who shares the load.  It's not uncommon for a waitress or waiter to see you're glass of water needs refilling and before you can ask, they're on it.  I've tried the fish sandwhich, French dip, chicken salad, sushi, prime rib, seared ahi, ribs, burgers, soups, all the salads and have never been dissappointed.  Only downside is the price of items which could be lowered a bit.
