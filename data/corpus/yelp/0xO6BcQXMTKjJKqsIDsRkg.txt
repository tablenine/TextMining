Delicious Tapas and lots of choices!!! This place definately ranks up there as one of my favorite tapas joints!.  My roommate claims its the best paella he's ever had and thats one of his favorite dishes. . Definately would go back, we were stuffed after 4 dishes and there were still so many other cool things to try.  Only downer is that they are byob and byow. Tapas without fresh Sangria is a little bit of a bummer but luckily they have a nice wine store next door with plenty of choices to match your tastes.
