I really love visiting Feed! Â There is something about collard greens and homemade mac and cheese that just can't be beat!. . The food is yummy, the prices won't break the bank, and the atmosphere is part vintage, part southern, with a dash of hilarious-ness!. . For a cool Chicago experience, check out Feed.....today!
