UGH holy crap this place is delicious- even the next day. You'd think the crust would be stale as a rock after a trip to the microwave, but it was still chewy and delicious. . . We ate:. Arancine alla bolognese $8 SO GOOD!!! It's rice + ground beef + potato I think under a tomato sauce, but kinda pricey. . Fried squash blossoms with ricotta $12 My first time eating a squash blossom and it was really good. Little flecks of salt were still on it and it was surprisingly light despite being deep fried.. . Chicken livers, capers, parsley &amp; guanciale $9 Whoo... this was heavy. I ate two and wanted to keel over. It was so good though I ate the third one too. Even if you don't like livers- it's worth a try.. . Mortadella, Prosciutto di Parma, Salumi Salame &amp; aged provolone $14  Ordered by a friend and she said it was good. . Funghi misti, fontina, taleggio &amp; thyme $15  Quite satisfying and not too heavy even though it's loaded with mushrooms and a strong cheese. Definitely one of the best pizzas I've had. Next time I'm going for the margherita.. . The place is tinnyyyyy. I had to keep moving my table over so people could get in/out of the booth. Make a reservation or else be stuck waiting. We parked a block away in the residential area.
