The best sashimi and sushi combo plates in Los Angeles!  Go for lunch or dinner and you won't be sorry you did.  There is such a variety and freshness to each it's like you've died and gone to filleted fish heaven.  I can't talk too much about this place or I'm going to cry.  . . See you soon, my love.
