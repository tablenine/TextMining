I had to knock off a star from my beloved Roasters. I still love this place.  The food is consistent, the staff is good, and the food comes out quick.  There are no surprises at this place. Never had a bad experience.  However, the location is starting to get on my nerves. The parking situation has become quite a disaster.  I went to Roasters last night at 6:30 for dinner.  Half the places in the shopping center were closed (the dry cleaner, the alterations place, the physical therapy center) and the rest of the establishments were mostly empty based on my window peaking.  Roasters was half empty too - no wait and tons of open tables.  The parking lot was a nightmare.  People were creating their own parking spaces at the end of the aisles, along the curbs, etc. and it was hellacious getting out of here.  I had problems finding a space when we got there but had an even harder time exiting the lot.  This little parking lot was uber congested!  I think the problem is they now have apartments in the spaces above the store fronts. I'm pretty sure the residents park in the same area as the shop patrons - I have no idea where else they would park as there is no parking behind the building. This is a bit ridiculous and I'd be pissed if I lived here.  Anyway, I will probably still go back to Roasters in the future but they've been moved down the list because of the parking hassle.  Same goes for the other establishments in this center.  Sorry Roasters.
