An LA must! Despite what I have read, the line is NOT that bad... I went during peak Saturday brunch hours and only waited like 15 minutes. The host Alex is on top of his business, as is the whole staff. He is so nice and remembers everyones name. Even when the place is a 'hoppin the staff stays calm and attentive. I am all about high customer service, which is rare in LA restaurants, and this place definitely has it. Our waters were never less than half-full. The food is amazing and you are gonna need a doggie box. I am from Texas and was not used to seeing such large portions in LA. It never happens! Bring friends, share, and enjoy the bustling atmosphere.
