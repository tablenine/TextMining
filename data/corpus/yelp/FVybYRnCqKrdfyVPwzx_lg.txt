I still miss McCray's in Midtown, but this is becoming my favorite place to get food and a drink in the neighborhood.. . The selection of sliders is great and there is a decent selection of beers.. . The patio is great, particularly since it is shaded from the afternoon sun. And there is a firepit for colder weather.. . Sometimes you just want a good regular hangout and this fits the bill. I like how they have games like Connect 4 and Checkers to keep the patrons entertained while hanging out.. . The one omission is that there aren't enough TVs to make it a destination to watch a game. But I imagine that was an intentional choice.
