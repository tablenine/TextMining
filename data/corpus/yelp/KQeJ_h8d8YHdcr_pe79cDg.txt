Restaurant: Over Easy Café
Category: American (Traditional)
This place reminds me of Bongo Room in terms of its high prices, long waits and yuppie patrons.  That said, it does boast a creative menu that definitely deviates from the standard fare.  I had the Strawberry Sublime -- french toast stuffed with strawberries and mascarpone and drizzled with strawberry syrup all over -- and it was decent, though not quite on the same level as the French Toast Orgy at Toast.  My girlfriend's peach pancakes were tasty too -- three big pancakes plus they didn't skimp on the peaches.  Although  we didn't indulge in the option, I liked the fact that the place is BYOB, even if I question my bloody mary making abilities on a Sunday morning.. . A few minor gripes:. . 1) With so many tasty options to choose from, Over Easy would be wise to follow Bongo Room's lead and offer half orders of their pancakes and french toast. . 2) I wish they had more egg dishes but that's just because I'm normally a bigger fan of the savory stuff vs the sweet stuff. . 3) If Over Easy is going to charge the prices that it does, then it should really start serving freshly squeezed orange juice, not the stuff from concentrate that you find in large plastic milk jugs. . All in all, Over Easy doesn't really compare to the likes of Bongo Room, Toast, Orange, M Henry, etc.  But it's not bad either so as long as you don't get your hopes up too much, you can expect to have a pleasant meal there.
