Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Picture this: Nice L.A. weather, making friends standing in line, topped off with a delicious hot dog. That is the experience of Pink's Hot Dogs. Sure it's a little much, but like I said, it's an experience. . . My dog: Chili Cheese w/tomato and chili-fries. . . Bring cash (it's cash only) and come dressed in layers because you will be there for a while (and the weather might change depending on how long you're there). Also, try finding local street parking. It's not as hard as you think.
