I agree with everyone that says the "best lattes ever".  We had an awesome waitress that knew about everything on the menu, and helped us select coffees that would please our palate.  She suggested the chocolate latte for me.  It was creamy and smooth, and just perfect.  I also tried the Blanco y Negro.  The coffee taste of that was a little too rich, but the vanilla bean ice cream was a nice compliment.. . The brioche doughnuts were melt in my mouth yummyness (yes it's a word ;).  The vanilla crème dipping sauce sent my taste buds into heaven.  I would eat that every day if I could.. . I had the eggs mixed with bacon and mushrooms, and they were really tasty.  I like that they come out in a big white bowl.  Made for a nice presentation.. . Overall this was a pleasant spot for breakfast.  Hopefully it'll be a place I can visit again on my next trip.
