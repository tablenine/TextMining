Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Gringo-mex at its finest.  This is not the type of place that you come for authentic Messican fare.  What you will find is a limited menu that focuses heavily on using the same 3-4 fillings with different varieties of tortilla containers.  Sort of like a cash-only Chipotle-esque predecessor.. . The best thing about Tito's is that they use shredded beef in their tacos instead of ground beef.  Also, their gringo salsa - despite being completely mild and kind of watery - is plentiful and strangely good.  Finally, my wife loves the fact that all of the food here is served at burningly hot temperatures.  . . What's interesting to me is how many Latinos frequent Tito's Tacos.  Usually, la raza will scoff mightily at any establishment that offers hard shell tacos and neon yellow cheese.  But in fact, a few visits back, through the throngs of people standing in line, I saw Danny "The Mayor" Trejo here.  . . For those in the know of his impressive body of work (Con-Air, Blood in Blood Out, Desperado, Spy Kids, Anchorman) he's quite possibly the most "Latino" Latino in showbiz today.  And if that's not giving Tito's Taco's some street cred, I don't know what will.
