Food:  Tapas were all delicious.  Tiger shrimp was very good.  Their special was delicious:  The pork was tender and the chili pepper was sweet (tasted just like a meatball!).  The chocolate banana empanada was soo yummy!  Drinks were strong. . Ambiance:  Small dining area, dimly lit.  Could get loud. . Staff:  Very attentive, always filling my glass. . Price:  $$$
