Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
This has been on my "complete your review" list on Yelp forever.. . Cute modern decor.  Excellent attentive service.. . My sister suggested this place for lunch one day while we were both in LA.  I was sold the section I saw "truffled mac &amp; cheese" on the menu.  I mean, come on, TRUFFLED MAC &amp; CHEESE.  mmmmm.  Totally lived up to the hype.  The mac &amp; cheese was creamy and truffle-y and savory.. . I ordered the Taste Club &amp; ate half of it, because I prefer to eat smaller portions.  It was good, nothing incredible, but a solid club sandwich.  My sis &amp; I did polish off the pommes frites, however.  Simply addicting!. . They have valet parking, but we didn't need it!  Found a spot right in front of the restaurant much to the dismay of VALET DUDE.. . I think I will come back here for lunch again!
