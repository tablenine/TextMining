If you come here for the first time, AT LEAST order the raumen.  I never understood the concept of going to a specialty restaurant only to order something completely different.. . Get the original raumen WITH kotteri, trust me.  Never get the XLARGE bowl only because it's the same amount of raumen in a bigger bowl, which is heart-shattering.  If you want to sit at a booth, you must request it unless you have a huge party or sometimes you're lucky you'll get it.  Otherwise, you'll have to sit at the bar and sweat your ass off from the steam in your face.  The great part is that it's an authentic B grade so you know it's good.
