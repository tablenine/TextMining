Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©

Blu Jam Cafe' is a great brunch spot. It's conveniently located if you're in Hollywood and parking was pretty easy. They have a small, but lovely outdoor seating area. I have to admit I came in for the $7.99 breakfast specials, but ended up ordering off the regular menu because those options were pretty limited. They were offering a special international menu at the time and I had to go with the French Vegetable Scrambler. I was not disappointed. It was full of creamy goat cheese and loaded with veggies. The portions were the perfect size to not leave hungry without feeling over-stuffed. I tried my friend's brioche French toast with blackberries and it was good, but I wouldn't want a whole plate of it. I tend to not like things on the sweeter side. . . The service was pretty good from our server, but she could have been more engaged. She brought us the check immediately with our food, which I'm not fond of. However, the coffee guy was on it, never letting our cups go half empty. If you don't get one of the breakfast specials prices are on the high side, but not outrageous. . . Overall, nice atmosphere and really tasty food. I would definitely go back.
