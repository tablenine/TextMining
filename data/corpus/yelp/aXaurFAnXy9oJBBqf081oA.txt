Category: Steakhouses
I have been to this place twice. You cannot call this a fine dining coz of the environment and the way they serve you. It's more to expensive casual dinning. Their steak, their rack of lamb and lamb potterhouse are SO GREAT. Melt into my mouth. Another best thing you need to order is the $600 seafood tower appetizer. It has many fresh oysters which are my favorite, lobster tails, huge cocktail shrimps and many more seafood placed in a tower of dry ice. Their house martini which I forgotten the name, is very good too. Champagne is no question - GOOD.. . Creame corn also is a must-order dish. I love cream brule and they are huge, you can share with your friend. Another favorite is seared ahi tuna.. . Anyway, I am glad I didnt have to pay every time I went. Especially the $600 seafood tower appetizer. It's the most expensive appetizer I ever had, so far, in my life!!
