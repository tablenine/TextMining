Some of my girlfriends and I came here for lunch. The decor was so similar to Marche, so I wasn't overly impressed with it!! The service by our waiter was OK, but the service from my dear friend was awesome!! I had no idea he worked there and he was so sweet with us!! He bought us all a drink and went out of his way to talk to me and my friends. I wish we had had him as out waiter!!!. . Anyhow, I had the chicken pineapple fried rice and it was pretty good and I tried the fried artichoke that my friend had and that was pretty good!!! We also all tired their signature drink which was a Mango martini which was so YUMMY!!!
