Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
There was a 45 min wait when we got here!  It was Saturday, 4 PM so a pretty random time between lunch and dinner.  My roommate said it was totally worth it so we waited even though it was raining and cold.  They have Moretti beers so that warmed us up.  The atmosphere is nice, it is good place for friends or a date.  The bread came right away and the server came back often and refilled our drinks.. . We shared the eggplant parmesan, which came with a house salad, and your choice of ice cream.  The portion sizes are huge!  I def enjoyed the food and would go back again.  Next time I will try the pizza and I will try not to be so hungry when I arrive!!. . Good food at great prices.  A single entree can easily be shared by two people.  oh yes and CASH ONLY, which always takes me by surprise.  Why don't they take reservations??
