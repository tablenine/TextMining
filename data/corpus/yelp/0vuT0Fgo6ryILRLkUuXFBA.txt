Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Tastes just like the fish/shrimp tacos you or your mom or your mexican aunt can make at home, same batter, flavor and home made feel, which is a good thing for those times when I'm too lazy to make them myself, except for the salsas their salsas are pretty weak, and their horchata was weird, and I don't like it when everyone there stops eating to stare at me, and the parking sucks too.. so on second thought I think I just might be better off getting my lazy ass to make the effort Â of making them myself.. Good tacos though I think I should get to making some right now.
