My roommie and I came here on a Saturday night and it was bustling! So glad we had a reservation. . . 1) Crab rangoon (4 stars) -- really creamy, really good....the accompanying sauce was a nice compliment...have to recommend this one. 2) Chicken Cream of Corn (3 stars) -- tasted like egg-drop soup with extra added corn...good, but I wouldn't order it again. 3) Lobster and Crab Bisque (5 stars) -- YUMMY! There were huge lumps of crab meat in the bisque....who would think a Chinese restaurant of all places would get this right?! I mean, it rivaled Joe's Stone Crab (GASP!). 4) Chicken Fried Rice (4 stars) -- really enjoyed the random seaweed admixed in this dish....a pleasant surprise. 5) Spicy Honey Glazed Orange Chicken (1 star) -- very orangy and not spicy at all....biggest disappointment of the evening...BLAND BLAND BLAND . 6) Sesame Chicken (3 stars) -- average at best, but no complaints here... I mean, anything is going to taste better after trying that orange chicken. . The chocolate fortune cookies were a nice touch, but I really don't see the hubbub. Service was decent -- my water glass was always full (one of my biggest gripes).. . So why only 3 stars? Well, of course, the orange chicken was extremely disappointing, and in my opinion, the prices were astronomical for the quality of food served (except for the bisque). Also, they charge you per refill on soda ($2.50 each time). For a "fine" restaurant, I find this to be a ghetto maneuver. Consider yourself warned.
