Restaurant: Loteria Grill
Category: Mexican
Being Mexican and knowing what Mexican food is supposed to taste like makes me wary of Mexican restaurants. The food usually sucks at those places but not at Loteria! It's a little pricey but the food is sooooooooooo good!! Seriously! I eat the nachos (minus the meat) and the potato taquitos and they've never let me down. I've taken friends and family here too and they also love it. The only issue I have is that since it's @ the Farmer's Market seating can sometimes be a pain.
