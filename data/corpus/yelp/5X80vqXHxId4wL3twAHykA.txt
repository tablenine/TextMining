Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
tito's tacos was the first mexican food i ever ate.  it's crazy when i think about how long ago it was that i got food from there.  family friends lived down the street from this place so we would pass it when we went over and every time my parents would comment on how huge the lines were.  i remember eating tacos, beef burritos and chips and salsa and thinking they were delicious.  anything that wasn't korean food was exotic to me so i don't know what i'd think of it now but my 10 year old palate thought it was excellent.
