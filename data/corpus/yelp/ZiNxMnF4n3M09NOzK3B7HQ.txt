I generally like to keep it positive when reviewing places...or just not write anything at all. I have to say that this place is AWFUL. I'm scratching my head wondering why there are so many great reviews for it. The food is good, but the service really sucks. And don't get me started on the drinks. I'm a lightweight, so if after three cocktails I'm not even feeling buzzed, there's something wrong. The drinks were more like juice with a splashes of alcohol.. . My guess on the poor service? Metromix bills this as a gay &amp; lesbian friendly establishment. If you look gay or are with someone of the same sex, the service seems really chilly. That's just my perception. Is it true? I don't know. But perhaps the Metromix thing is a mistake and they want to make sure there is no chance in Hell they'd be mistaken as a gay &amp; lesbian friendly place...so scare anyone away who potentially looks like they could be? I'm just sayin,...
