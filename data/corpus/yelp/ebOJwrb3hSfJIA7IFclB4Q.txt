Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Went here late last night and got the corned beef and hash with eggs. Canter's has the appeal of a very expansive menu and is open 24 hours. And my party was seated quickly, not bad considering how busy the parking lot was. . . However, the food itself is not that good, ranging from just okay to bad. Also, my waitress was slow to give me the check and also forgot my toast until reminded. But the expectations for the place...it's one of those delis with almost everything on it, it pretty much fit. I am not keen to go back, but I'm not going to be kicking and screaming if someone wants to. I do feel like it is overpriced, but I knew that going in. Really, I should have done drive-thru at McDonald's or something.
