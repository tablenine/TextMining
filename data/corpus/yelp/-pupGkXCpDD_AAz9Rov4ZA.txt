BEST SHAVED ICE EVER, $5.49 including tax.  . . That's all you need to know about this place.. . Basically, ginormous mound of ice covered with condensed milk and brown sugar syrup.  Filled with jellies and taro balls and rice balls and red bean and flan and green bean and boba.... it fills me up with sweet sugary goodness.. . But don't get their NRM b/c it sucks.
