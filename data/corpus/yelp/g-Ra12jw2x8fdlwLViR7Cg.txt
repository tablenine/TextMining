Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
OK, WOW, I was looking up Johnie's to send the information to a friend and realized to my horror I had never written a review.  So please allow me to add my adoring drivel to the rest of yours.. . Johnnie's is not the classic deli pastrami.  My Mom can't get over that and that's why she hates the joint.  I can only say YAY - more pastrami for me!. . Juicy fat laced pastrami meat covered in yellow mustard and washed down with pickles and LOWENBRAU!  I don't even know another restaurant in this city that even serves LOWENBRAU!  Oh, and yes, every time I write LOWENBRAU! you have to imagine some sort of theatrical surprise music playing in the background.. . In short, go to Johnnie's, just please don't go when I want to go 'cause I don't want to wait for you.
