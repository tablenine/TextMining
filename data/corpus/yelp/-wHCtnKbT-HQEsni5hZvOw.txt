Sort of gourmet down home that is the perfect place to come if you are only in Atlanta for one night!  I've been here twice in a period of 12 years, and both times were excellent.  The crab soup was exquisite, and I also enjoyed my peach whiskey drink.  Also got the Fried Green Tomatoes, which were wonderful and served with a nice tangy sauce.  My friend got the scallops and shrimp grits and I got the buttermilk fried chicken - both were good, but i'm definitely curious about the other items on the menu...my chicken was a little burnt - our waiter grabbed it after I mentioned it, and came back with a whole new plate - chicken perfectly cooked.  I've had better fried chicken....honestly, I think Korean Fried Chicken in NYC has set the bar for me...but overall, great atomsphere, great service, and a great classy way to get your feet wet with southern down home cuisine!
