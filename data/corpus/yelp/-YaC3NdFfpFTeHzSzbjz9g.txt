I'll pay for a great meal and I'll come out of pocket for a good drink or two but $26 for two sub-par mojitos?!! No sir! The only saving grace was the food which was surprising good. The vibe at Lucky is pretty posh but chill and laid back, probably best to come out for happy hour when you'd likely be able to get cheaper drinks, a smaller crowd, and better service. Also, come before 10 o'clock (or is it 9?) to avoid paying to get in.
