so tonite was my 2nd visit to father's office. ordered the usual office burger and decided to try the roasted beef marrow. lets start with the burger, my first experience with the burger was a finger licking good one. the patty was just dripping and oozing with goodness. tonite the burger was a bit off. the arugula was bad, i had a few rotten leaves of it on the burger and for some reason the cheese tasted off too. i was confused with the low quality product that i was about to devour. i expected better and should have gotten better. so thumbs down on the burger for my 2nd round here. the bone marrow was good tho. with the toast, it was buttery delicious. top it with the cilantro, capers, and i think it was shallots made for some fine dining. so to say the least, i was displeased with my burger tonight. if not for the bone marrow, my rating would have been 2 stars. that and the fact that they ran out of a certain beer, alesmith punkin ale. a big FAIL for running out of beer!
