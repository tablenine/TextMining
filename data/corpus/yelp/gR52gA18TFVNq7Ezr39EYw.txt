Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I totally forgot to make reservations, but called about an hour before we got there and they gladly took my reservations.  Hostess was very nice--she even offered to carry our drinks!  In all honesty this place was not bougie at all.  The bartender was very nice even when we asked what the heck was in the glass box behind the bar.  Our waitress was very accomodating--made sure our glasses were always full, bread basket was full, and constantly asked if we were ok without being annoying.  I ordered the prime rib and lobster with creamed corn.  Prime rib melted in my mouth--I practically did not need to chew.  The lobster was a little small, but it was cooked perfectly without being to rubbery.  The creamed corn had to be my favorite!  I will share my prime rib and lobster but definitely not my creamed corn.  Oh and the desert--coconut banana pie and the chocolate cake with ice cream.  I didn't try the pie but from the looks on the empty plate is was good.  The chocolate cake was to die for!  It was warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...must try it!
