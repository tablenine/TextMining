It's pretty perfect except for 2 small, 1/2 star things; expensive.  I dropped two c-notes on appies, (2) dinners, (2) drinks and (1) dessert last night and feel dreadfully poor today.  The other half-star off is that they don't stock Hendricks (nor does Green Zebra), but they made me a nice martini with North Shore #6 which tastes like lavender.  We ate at the bar (this is the way to go, boys and girls with no reservation on a friday night), it sorta feels like you have your own private dining room.  The larger dining room is quite noisy (know this from the 5 other times I've been to this restaurant).  Bar waitstaff was great and the "snooty" Maitre'd was not the least bit snooty; quite the opposite.  I love this place and I'm so, SO happy they didn't axe the amazing barramundi from the menu (how could they now that Chicago Magazine's named it "best entree"?).  Oh, one more thing: dessert; some kind of frozen apple cake with miso butterscotch sauce.  Imagine that...it's better.
