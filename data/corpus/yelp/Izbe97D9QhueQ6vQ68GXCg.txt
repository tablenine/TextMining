The food was decent but the bloody mary was very very good! I came here with a few friends for brunch and was surprised at how reasonable the prices are. The prix fix menu was 2 courses for $14 and for another $12/13 u can get bottomless champagne or mimosa!. . I had the brioche french toast with banana brulee and nutella.  Was very good and decent portion.  But by the end it was a bit too much sweets for me so I got a headache.  We sat on the patio which was nice. Overall I recommend it because its good value for what it is and espciallfor where its at.  Altho crowd is a lil too uppity for me to really say I'd go bak again.
