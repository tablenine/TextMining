Quotes of our dining experience:. . After looking at the menu and seeing the ube shake listed:. "This must be a Filipino place". . After biting into our Oinkster Pastrami sandwich which had layers of soft-bacon-like pork meat with cabbage and Oinkster sauce:. "This Oinkster Pastrami sandwich is pretty good and close to lard". . After I finished off the boyfriend's last piece of pastrami that fell on his plastic basket:. "Now I know why your triglycerides are high". . After finishing our very last piece of pastrami sandwich:. "This is a once in a five-year meal". . After getting some ketchup for our Belgium fries:. "The chipotle ketchup is my favorite". . From our conversations, I hope it was obvious that Oinkster lives up to its name--it's a fatty pig-out place.  So lipid elevating that Lipitor will hate you.  So artery-clogging, you may ask for them to save the pig's valve for your own heart valve-replacement surgery.  . . So fatty that...that's what made it so good.  Pace yourself friends.  Eat no more than one of these a month, or blue moon.
