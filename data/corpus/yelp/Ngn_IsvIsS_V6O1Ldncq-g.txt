Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If LA is fake, this is why... They're so busy piling on toppings that they forget what is important is the inside. In their case, a weiner barely resembling meat.  A tourist trap if I ever saw one.  Unfortunately, I saw the lines and fell for the hype and bought one.  If you want a real hot dog with real die hard down to earth fans, go visit Berkeley's Top Dog on Durant Ave.  Now there's a place worth waiting in line for.  Great dog, great bun...nuff said.  If you want fix-ins, go to Jerry's Wood Fired dogs where you can get a great mesquite grilled dog and choose from a ridiculously long list of FREE toppings.
