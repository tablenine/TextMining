Restaurant: Maison Akira
Category: French
Food: finally been able to come back after my 49 day fast!  you cannot go wrong with maison akira!!  the food is fantastic!  i went with a couple of friends for dine la however, i was the only one that went with the dine la menu while the others opted for the more expensive pre fixe.  we all started with some kind of seafood amuse bouche.  very light, fresh, and simple.  for appetizers i had the white corn soup with rock shrimp which was very good.  i had the duck for entree which came out amazing.  the croquette was just okay though but still yummy.  finally for dessert i went with the flourless chocolate cake.  THE BEST flourless chocolate cake i have ever tasted.  it was very light and just sweet enough with a side of i think coffee ice cream.  mmm!  i was also able to try some of my friends food.  the scallops were very good and the salmon was very interesting.  it was like a piece of salmon in some kinda veggie jello.  everything was wonderfully plated.  one of the desserts had a sugar cage thingy on it.  very cool presentation!. . Ambiance: i realized the restaurant isnt as tiny as i thought the first time.  its not a huge restaurant but there are lots of seating.  its very quiet and romantic with the dim lights.. . Staff: super friendly and attentive.  our glasses were never empty.  even though i had only 3 courses while everyone else had 5 all our meals came out together.  they timed everything very well.  chef akira even came out to greet us.  hes such a cute old man!  whenever the chef comes out after my meal always makes my dining experience more enjoyable.. . Price: $$$
