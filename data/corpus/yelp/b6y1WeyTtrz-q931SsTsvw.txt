My boyfriend took me here for a nice inexpensive dinner. When you first walk in, you are surrounded by photos. Old black&amp;white pictures. When we get seated, the feeling is so nice. They brought water quick, our waiter was really nice. I got the Lemon-butter Garlic caper sauce&amp;green onion with sea bass. Absolutely delicious. They refilled on drinks quick. Service here is to die for. It's absolutely amazing. They cooked the sea bass perfectly where it almost melts in your mouth. Absolutely delicious Even those who get you another drink when you run out at quick. It's like an ant farm. Fast. One entrance is going into the kitchen and one is the exit. It's amazing watching them walking around. Never once bumping into each other. Organized service. I definitely recommend anyone coming here if you are ever in LA. Even their parking valet are nice. They open the door for you when you get out to go eat, and when they bring your car back, they also open the door for you to go in. Greet you with smiles and everything. Nothing can be better than service here. Also, try their garlic ice cream. May sound odd but give it a try. It's interesting.
