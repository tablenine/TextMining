Restaurant: Devon Seafood Grill
Category: Seafood
Still as delicious as the last time.  Though being restaurant week I was able to get 3 courses for only 32 bucks which was great.  I had the Lobster Bisque to start with, a delight like last time, and some Blue Points cause I love 'em.  For a main course I went with the seafood mixed grill, the salmon and the lump crab cake stood out here.  The chocolate velvet cake made for a nice sweet dessert.  . . My only complaint this time is the fact our reservation was at 7:15 and we did not get seated until after 8.  I have never been seated so late after my reservation time, and with really no apologies or anything.
