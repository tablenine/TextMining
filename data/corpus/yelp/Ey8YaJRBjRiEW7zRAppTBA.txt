Restaurant: Joya
Category: Thai
Became slightly obsessed with this place when I first found it, but after having to wait forever every time I go I sorta have gotten fed up...granted, the food is awesome and the bartender (?robby?) is the best ever, but after dealing with the Napoleon complex owner and the ever growing crowd, its time to find another Thai place...but I will greatly miss you Joya...
