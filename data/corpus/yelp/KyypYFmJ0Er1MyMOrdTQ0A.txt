Love it!  A group of us went after Bike the Drive and had brunch.  We were seated quickly, even though it was packed.  I ordered the creamy cheese grits with shrimp.. completely off da chain!  The mimosa's were delish.  They also have a full bar, a definite plus!  Next day had the pancakes... fantastic!  My friend said she loved the french toast.  Sometimes the service is a little slow.  But overall, it can't be beat.  I'll definitely be heading back to the Wishbone.
