Food was good for all four of us.  Nothing lacking, but not spectacular.  Chicken Noodle Soup actually has visibile chunks of chicken in it (a good sign).  Portabello Mushroom Entree good.  Macaroni and Cheese side dish 2 starts; mushy and ordinary.  I would come back again.  Place is clean and prices are fair.  Service was attentive and prompt.
