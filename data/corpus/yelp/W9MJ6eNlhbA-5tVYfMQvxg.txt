Went here for dinner today.  Food was really good, we had a lot of different foods from the menu and it was perfect portions to try a lot of different courses.  The sea bass is to die for, really moist and tasty.  The salmon was really good as well.  Would recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood to try some delicious food.
