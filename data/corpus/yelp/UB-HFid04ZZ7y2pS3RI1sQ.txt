Finally ate lunch a B Bar today after walking by this place on the way to work everyday.  It's always packed for drinks at night, and was even busy for lunch considering my group showed up at 2:30.  . . The highlight for B Bar is easily the space.  It's large and beautiful, with a great outdoor area.  It almost makes the slightly above average food and high prices a non issue.  But not quite.  The menu has a nice range of options, including sandwiches, full entrees, and nice salads (my girlfriend had the tuna salad and loved it).  . . I decided to get a turkey club.  For $10 I expect a nice portion of turkey on my sandwich.  Instead, I got a turkey sandwich that I could have gotten at a diner.  The sandwich, as well as many other items, was served with delicious waffle chips.  . . I ordered a beer, but the mixed drinks looked great.. . In all, B Bar has a nice atmosphere, which makes it a fun place to take friends from out of town.  However, I think I might just recommend coming in here for drinks AFTER dinner some place else.
