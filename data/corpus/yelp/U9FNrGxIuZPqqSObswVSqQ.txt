Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Horrid - Everything has been Americanized and is so bland. . We ordered the Lad Nar and another noodle soup thing here - my lad nar was crispy - tasted like a glorified potato chip and my meat was soaking in some sweet and sour sauce that just didn't seem right.  And my friend's noodle soup was like the cheap ramen.  So disappointed - I've tried it too many times than I'd like to admit since people keep on telling me that I'm wrong about Penny's.
