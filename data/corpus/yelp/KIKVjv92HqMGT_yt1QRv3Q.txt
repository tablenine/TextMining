I'm not quite sure if this is a must-do for travelers or locals looking for something out of the ordinary but any Bloody Mary connoisseur should def stop by this place. Â . . While it is a really cool spot with lots of history and crazy things on the wall to look at, you don't leave feeling like you've had any super special experience. It is a great neighborhood pub though. Lots of beer on the menu and a big menu with veggie friendly options.. . If you are into politics, this place is hopping during any big televised debate. And every nook and cranny of this huge establishment is packed. If you're looking to have your own friendly debate, you'd certainly be able to find someone to chat with here.
