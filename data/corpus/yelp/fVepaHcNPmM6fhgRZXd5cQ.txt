Restaurant: Ben Pao
Category: Chinese
If I could sum it up in two properties, I'd say Ben Pao has (1) great martinis and (2) excellent consistancy.. . I've been here half a dozen times or more and the service, food, and atmosphere have left me with the same satisfied feeling. Â Also noteworthy is the speed at which we were served on the two occassions I was there with large parties.. . Ben Pao loses one star because despite being satisfying and consistant, nothing I've eaten there sticks out as particularly memorable.
