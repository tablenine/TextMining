I would ding them a star for the ridiculous parking situation but I won't because the food served here is so mouth-watering... I love gourmet deli's/cheese shop/charcutieries like this.. . Get the Tuna Melt!  To die for... probably THE best I've ever had in my entire life.  I don't know how they pull off doing one in a baguette that's perfectly crusty, flaky and buttery on the outside, yet soft and flavorful once you bite in.  We also ordered the Salad Trio and tried the Curried Coconut Rice, Grilled Brussel Spout Salad and a Pasta Salad with Pinenuts, Broccoflower and Peccorino Cheese.  Yum!  Although the place was packed... every employee we came in contact with was extremely friendly and helpful.. . I love how you could also purchase homemade salad dressings and the fried wonton crispies for a Chinese Chicken Salad.  We of course had to get a cupcake on the way out so we elected to try the Snickers Cupcake... indeed decadent, rich and moist.  Not dry like Sprinkles or Le Cupcake.  If I lived or worked within walking distance from here I would come here every day.
