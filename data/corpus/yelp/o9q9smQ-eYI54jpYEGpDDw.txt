Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Okay - a little background on myself. I love fried chicken. When I was a young little pin, I used to beg my mom to make fried chicken and she never would because she claimed it was too messy. Once in a while I would get it on my birthday. . . Flash forward to adulthood. I can go anywhere I want for fried chicken including making it myself. I could go to Churches (not bad), The Colonel (Pass - not what it used to be), Pop-eyes (too much batter), Larkins in Eagle Rock (meh), Â and any number of other Fried Chicken eateries. So far, none of them has compared to Roscoe's. . . Here's why: Roscoe's fried chicken is done southern style. Simple and basic. Dredged in seasoned flour and then southern fried, in shallow batches, on the stove top. It's NOT dipped in some gawd awful batter and deep fried. Peek in the kitchen, you'll see how they do it. . . I have never ever had a bad meal at Roscoe's and when I get that hankering for fried chicken, it IS the only place I know so far that gets it right. Sometimes I get the waffle and some times I don't. Depends on my mood, but if you do decide to go with the waffle, it is truly a delicious waffle and works perfectly with the fried chicken. BONUS - they have GREAT french fries. Other sides such as the mac and cheese, greens, sweet potatoes are good although I am sure one could argue that they have had better else where. . . Almost forgot - the Staff, they are so friendly and accommodating. I always feel welcomed at Roscoe's. I love leaving there with "Chicken Glow!"
