This place is awesome! It has changed my mind about seafood in Chicago (finally!). I was losing hope there for a second. It still doesnt compare to the seafood on the West and East coast, but its moving in the right direction. I came here with a friend and we each ordered off the prix fixe menu. Appetizer, entree and dessert for $35.  We got calamari for two (big portion), and lobster bisque for appetizer. Both were flavorful! Entrees were the Seared Georges Bank Scallops (lemon risotto, shaved fennel salad, basil olive oil, and balsamic reduction) and the Maryland Crab cakes (creole remoulade, mango tartar sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  The scallops were so tender and melted in my mouth! The crab cakes were huge chunks of fresh crab. Soooo good! For dessert we got the vanilla creme brulee and chocolate mousse cake with raspberry syrup. Delicious!! The service was great in the beginning but began to slow when it got busy.  But our waiter was super nice and very helpful!
