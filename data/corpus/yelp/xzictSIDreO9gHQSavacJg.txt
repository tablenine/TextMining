Methinks not is right.  Gross.  I have been wanting to eat here for years!  When you first walk in, it's like a musky closet of an elderly.  Everything looks dark and old, and smelly.  Trust me, if it were garlic I were smelling, I would not mind.  First of all, they need to hire a cleaning service.  . . The menu was blah.  Nothing "wow"  I had the garlic spread for an appetizer.  No garlic flavor, just mushy old garlic.  The calamari was good, but where have you ever had bad fried calamari?  My boyfriend got the garlic infused porterhouse (which they took back TWICE just to get the steak at medium, not rare).  We packed the left overs and immediately threw it in the trash.  I had the sea bass, plain.  I felt like I was eating at Sizzler.. . I would never go back.  Go eat at Olive Garden and ask for a sprinkle of garlic...you'll have better luck.. . Stinking Rose.  Stinking service!
