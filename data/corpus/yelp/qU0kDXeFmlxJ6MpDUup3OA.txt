i get in the mood for the standard american menu &amp; this place is so close to home it's hard not to eat here.  i remember when they first opened-it took awhile for them to get it together.  but now it's awesome.  very comfortable place to hang out with yummy food &amp; great service.  on mondays they have half price glasses of wine &amp; the wine list is impressive.  i love new zealand sav blanc &amp; they don't disappoint.. . i usually get a pizza because they do it well.  very crispy crust-like a cracker with hand pulled mozz cheese, home made sausage, deliciousness.  yesterday i tried the pulled pork eggroll-delicious smoke daddy bbq pork with cabbage &amp; veggies fried &amp; served with plum sauce &amp; honey mustard dip.  super!  and the caesar salads are really great, too.. . totally charming waitstaff-a southern belle made our dinner last nite tremendous.
