Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
This was one of the first places that I tried when I moved to Culver City. Located right in Downtown Culver, it is a convenient place to grab a quick and healthy dinner before a movie or a play at the Kirk Douglas Theater. . . It is a simple place, a place where you can show up after your midday work out in your gym clothes and not necessarily feel out of place. The area as a whole though does get a bit nicer in the evening. The menu is pretty short and consists of simple salads, big salads, soups and plates. They offer steak, chicken, tuna and vegetable options. Their plates come with a simple salad, choice of main dish and some really delicious mashed potatoes. All of the salads are really good, complex enough to be a full meal when you are hungry. . . My personal favorite is the grilled vegetable salad, especially when they include cauliflower and brussel sprouts. YUM!!! Also, the restaurant does have wine, beer and assorted soft drinks, but they also have some really delicious fresh beverages like their mint lemonade and their agua frescas. . . Whenever I want something healthy yet still filling and delicious, Tender Greens will always be one of my first thoughts.
