Me-Yow. . . I always question reviewing places like this that have a gajillion reviews but what the heck. . . Jewish deli's are my kind of comfort food. I don't do it all the time, but sometimes you just need to stuff your face with sodium filled meats and cheeses. yesterday was such a day. . . I was hungry and indecisive. I picked up a friend and we drove up from orange county. . . Amazing and delicious - this place hit the spot. I ordered the Brooklyn, (or was it the Manhattan? cant remember)  you get your choice of meat (I like pastrami) on rye with coleslaw and canters sauce (a yummy thousand island).  Add Swiss cheese and a side of coleslaw (yes i needed more! Their coleslaw is creamy and delectable) and i was in hog heaven. . . They serve free pickles, and people watching here will never leave you disappointed.
