This place is almost always packed on Fridays and the weekends. Expect to arrive a little early or try to get a reservation.. . You can't say no to their 1/2 priced maki (select ones), nor can you simply deny the quality of food or service.. . I've been a customer on several occasions, always wanting more. That is to say, whatever I get, may it be an entree or an insane amount of sushi - I'm content, but never get that full delivery. Sort of a you're at third base, but you never hit a home run.. . That's generally how I feel about this establishment. They try to provide the best experience they can, but for reasons beyond by gut feeling, it's just a "meh".. . There's nothing particularly exciting or new that they provide, or try to lure me with. I could even go as far as to say that the overall experience is a little dry. I mean sure, you could get a few drinks anywhere and have a good enough time. But that's the spirits talking, you know?. . I'd suggest you give it a go and see what happens, for sure. It's a tad overpriced in my opinion, especially for the area, but I'm guessing it's to make up for their costs in maintaining a rather hip looking establishment.
