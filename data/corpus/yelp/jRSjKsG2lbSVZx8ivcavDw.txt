Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
After tons of reviews, I can only simply talk about one thing: the service, the food, and the decor.. . The service is great. Granted, the restaurant is always full to room occupancy every time I went to Orochon, but the servers still manage to crack a smile or explain an item on the menu you inquire about. Service can get a little hectic as the day passes, which is understandable. If you were serving over 200 people a day in and out, I'm sure you'd get tired, too. . . The food is decent. Orochon was the first 'authentic' ramen joint I tried in Los Angeles before becoming a vegetarian, and I definitely had a bomb experience. They have spiciness levels, from what other reviewers have talked about, are what this restaurant is more hyped about. If you're really brave, try the Special #1 or #2. I, on the other hand, am a total wuss and stuck to the higher spicy broths. The portions of ramen are generous, I think, for the price. A huge whopping hot bowl of ramen full of firm egg noodles? Nom. There's only less than a handful of pork, so if that's your thing, order more. Side orders such as dumplings were okay. Super small portions for the price you have to pay, NOT MY THING.. . The decor of Orochon is okay. To me, it seemed sort of bland, not much to look at at such a 'popular' restaurant. A wall of those who have finished their spiciest soup rests toward the front. And the tables are so close together that you don't get much privacy, which I'm okay with.. . Overall, I dig Orochon. I would go back but unfortunately, their broth is pork-based. :( Now to find vegetarian ramen shindigs in Los Angeles..
