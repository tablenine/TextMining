Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
They have a huge menu. Basically anything you could want on bread you can get here. I have never bothered with the appetizers b/c sandwiches come with 2 sides and that's more than enough for me.. . The mac n cheese is delicious. The tuna steak sandwich is really good, whatever its all good.. . The service is good. I went there for lunch on valentines day, and that was the only time I had trouble getting a table.. . My only problem is they are generally playing really really bad music. AND sometimes they forget to bring my water.. . But that's it. Otherwise, a solid lunch spot.
