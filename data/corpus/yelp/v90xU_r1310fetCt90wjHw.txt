Awesome place!  The food, service and beers are all good!  My friends and I came here for lunch at reading some of the reviews on this place.  We were in the area so we decided to stop by.  We ordered the duck bacon sausage and also the chicken apple sausage. A side of Belgian fries and a couple of Belgian beers.  Man, this was an awesome meal.  The place is pretty cool.  It's in the art district of downtown L.A. right next to Little Tokyo. They have some other exotic style sausages made from buffalo and also with rabbit.  We are planning to come back on the weekend night to check out the vibe.
