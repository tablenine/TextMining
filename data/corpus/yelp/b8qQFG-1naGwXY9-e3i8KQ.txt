Restaurant: Oinkster
Category: Burgers
I live in the Eagle Rock area and frequently go to the Oinkster.  For starters, the building is fantastic.  It has an old school, throwback feeling with welcoming service and great TVs.  It also has a great outdoor patio so you can meet up with friends and enjoy the great Los Angeles weather.  The building alone is a reason to stop in.  . . The Oinkster also has a great selection of food.  Although the Oinkster is most known for the pastrami sandwich, my favorite item on the menu is actually the burger.  In a town filled with both greasy and gourmet burgers joints, the Oinkster strikes a perfect balance.  The burgers are delicious without being too fancy (although you can get Gruyere cheese if you want).  Also, they have a great selection of dipping sauces from chipotle ketchup to spicy mustard.  Make sure to get some French fries so you can try all the sauces.  . . Also, the Oinkster has a great variety of beer both on tap and bottled.  They serve at least one type of the locally brewed Eagle Rock Brewery beer on tap at all times.  This restaurant does not have a "bar" feel, but rather is a good place to split a pitcher with friends and enjoy the sunshine on the patio.  On the whole, this is one of the best restaurants in Eagle Rock and great place to grab a burger.
