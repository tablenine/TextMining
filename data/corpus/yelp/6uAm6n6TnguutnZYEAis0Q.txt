Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
People rant and rave about this place so I thought I'd give it a try.. . In a nutshell: Overrated pizza that looks and tastes like the 99 cent variety from the freezer.. . Yes, it tastes and looks that cheap.. . Most people who give this place 5 stars I suspect don't mind giving domino's equal treatment.. . Waited 40 minutes to get a table. Waited 40 minutes to get pizza. As I stared at my GF's crappy pizza, I wondered how crappy my $20 pasta would be.. . Almost 2 hours of waiting sucks. And spending that much money on crappy food sucks even more. So, when my pasta came I told the waitress I was totally over it and that we waited too long and that I lost my appetite. . . She looked at me like I was crazy. Good thing I know what real pizza should taste like.
