Blah.. I absolutely love Ding Tai Fung. I've been going there since their first one opened. I've had all the locations in Taipei as well as the one in HK. But.. the one in LA is.. disappointing.. . I decided to bring a friend here because she's never had authentic Taiwanese food before. The food was.. OK.. but nowhere near the level of mouth watering deliciousness that I associate with Ding Tai Fung.. . Boo.. hopefully my friend liked it though.
