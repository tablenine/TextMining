OK, so my buddy and I go to this place and grab something before a movie.  . I ordered some meatballs ( appetizer) and get tiny TINY!!!!!! marble sized meatballs (only 3 or 4) draped with some sauce.  This place is supposed to be ITALIAN!!!!!!!   GIMME A FRIGGIN BREAK!!!!!   LOSERS!!!!!!   I love good Italian restaurants.  One thing that seems to go with ALL OF THEM is that ALL THE PORTIONS ARE GENEROUS.........even the appetizers, PERIOD.. This was a CRUEL joke!!!! Ohhhh yes, and to add insult to injury THE BASTARDS CHARGED ME 8 or 10 DOLLARS FOR THOSE LITTLE TINY PEBBLES OF MEAT!!!!. . Let's see here, a quarter pounder at McDonalds is what $2.50 or 3 DOLLARS maybe?  A quarter pound of hamburger there with buns, lettuce, tomatoe, etc.. . These PEBBLES didn't even add up to an EIGHTH of a pound of meat!!!! and they charged the HELL OUT OF ME.  SCREW THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!
