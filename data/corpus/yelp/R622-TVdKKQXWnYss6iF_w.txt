I give Daikokuya 3 stars because the taste has definitely gone down in the past few months. :( Boo!!. . Their signature ramen is a pork based soup, more oily and thicker than Orochon's ramen. (if you've eaten there before) They have pretty friendly portions and you can ask for more noodles (not sure if they still do that.) During the summer they have hiyashi chuuka which is a cold dish consisting of ramen noodles, ham, tomatoes, cucumbers in your choice of sesame or soy sauce. I prefer soy sauce! yum!. Another recommendation is their Katsu-don (fried pork/chicken cutlet over rice) I think I would rather get that now than the ramen.. . *sigh* someone recommend me a good ramen place in LA! I'm not finding any!!
