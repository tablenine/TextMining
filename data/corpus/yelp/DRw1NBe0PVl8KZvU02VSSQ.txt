Went to Harry and Sons for the umpteenth time last night, and once again, I left totally satisfied. With the food, that is. My date was just meh. But I digress. The squid salad always puts a smile on my face. It is huge and is more for sharing than as a prelude to the entree for a single person. The combination of citrus and heat is perfectly balanced, the squid is perfectly cooked, and the greens are always crunchy. . We also had the rainbow roll, which was divine. One of my biggest pet peeves is sushi rolls that are so huge that you are forced to bite a piece in half, which disrupts the party of flavors that are supposed to be in your mouth simultaneously. But this roll was the perfect size, and the fish was fresh. Rice was a little mushy, but acceptable.. We also had the Tuna Tataki, which was great, but the slices could have been just a little thicker. . We also had an appetizer called a something-or-other basket. Can't remember the name. But it was kinda bland and boring. Won't order that again, but I think it is good for unadventurous eaters who are afraid of exotic tastes - like kids, or pansies. . Service was excellent, as always. We went there rather late (about 10:30), so there was no wait, but normally there is a line out the door, especially on the weekends. . Once again, a great experience!
