Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Unlike other Currascarias Fogo de Chao is apparently an authentic chain from Brazil. Every time I come here I'm reminded of that Patton Oswalt steak bit where the only right way to eat meat is lots of it or else you fall into the category of being a giant pussy. That's how it is at Fogo de Chao you get meat and lots of it. You might think that since it's a buffet style restaurant the meat this government grade stuff they get from Costco and threw some salt on it. Fortunately it's not the case the meat is always very good whenever I come here and the service is always friendly and attentive. They have new items rotate in and out and so far I haven't been disappointed. This restaurant is basically getting what you pay for all you can eat premium meats for a premium price tag. The challenge of trying to out eat the bill is always fun to try but if your stomach pops don't come crying to me, Nancy boy.
