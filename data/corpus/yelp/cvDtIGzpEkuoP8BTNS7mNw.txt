Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
I'm forced to eat here roughly 2 times a week, because my boyfriend's an addict, and when it gets too cold, and you don't want to leave the building, it's way easier to just make the poor delivery guy drive you over some Pad Thai, especially when DELIVERY ONLY COSTS $2.00!!. . That said, I can't eat food with MSG, and Penny's only makes a handful of dishes without it---even if you request it. Which makes me think a whole lot less of their food, considering there are SO MANY restaurants out there that don't use MSG anymore. . . I like their pad thai with tofu though. it works.
