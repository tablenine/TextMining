Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I absolutely love this place for breakfast!  It gets busy, but seating and service is actually really efficient.  You get to you table, and there's a fresh pitcher of lemon water waiting on the table and coffee cups ready!  They serve Intelligentsia coffee here too, which is, of course, really great!. . If you get a chance to sit on the lovely back patio area, do it.  It's sunny, warm and so inviting back there.  . . Anyway, menu ranges from whimsical nostalgia (Green Eggs and Ham) to home-style favs like Steak &amp; Eggs with  biscuits and gravy.  There's also a strong Mexican breakfast theme here too, as they serve Huevos Locos (Spicy Crazy Eggs - with Chorizo), Chilequiles (which they tout as the ultimate hangover breakfast), and an oh - so - large breakfast burrito.  . . Great breakfast, great coffee, and great kitch overall!!  Yeah Roscoe Village.
