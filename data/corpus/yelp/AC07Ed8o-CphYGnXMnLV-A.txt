Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Casa Bianca gets a bad rap.  It's mostly deserved.  Still, I think you have to know what to order.. . The wait is an enormous pain in the arse.  We usually put our name on the list, then head over to the chalet for a drink before dinner, it makes the 45 minute wait tolerable.. . the food -  I hate the pasta dishes here, they are pretty, pretty bad.  . . Likes-   Pizza .. my fave is broccoli, garlic and artichoke - yum! My     husband likes the sausage and onion. .               Bruschetta.               Antipasto salad - it's huge and really good.. . Bring your own wine, the house selection blows.  Cash only, but they have a ATM in the back.
