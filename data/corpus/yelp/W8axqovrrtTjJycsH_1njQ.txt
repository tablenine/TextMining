Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
I'VE NEVER TRIED CRACK.... . But if I do, I want it in Smoke Daddy mac-n-cheese form.  I was so distracted by this eye-rolling-good orgy of macaroni and smooth, velvety cheese  punctuated with asteroid-like bread crumbs and a smack-in-the-ass like hit of spice, that I all but ignored my ribs until that styrofoam hot tub was licked clean.. . When I finally got to the ribs, I was intrigued by its blend of smoke, heat, and tenderness.  It was like the love child of my Chicago BBQ favorites.  Imagine the smoke of, well Smoque, the tenderness of Twin Anchors, and the unpretentiousness of Honey 1.  Add some live music, a red neon sign, a laid back crowd, and there you have Smoke Daddy, one of my new favorites.
