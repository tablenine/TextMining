Craft will always hold a special place in my heart.  We went once last year and again exactly one year later to celebrate our one year anniversary.  Drove down and back to LA in one day each time just to eat here.. . That being said, my 5-star rating isn't just being given for the fond memories.  The service, the ambience, and the food definitely deserve 5 stars.. . The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous.  It's a large space that still feels cozy and there are huge windows that make for beautiful, warm evening light.  It's a restaurant that feels romantic and classy no matter what time of day - it's not the type of place that only looks nice when it's dark out so that all the flaws are hidden.  Best of all, though, are the clusters of Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling.  Those things are pure beauty all the way.. . This time, like last, I thought most dishes were absolutely incredible and a few were just good.  The spinach and smoked bacon salad, hearts of palm and avocado salad, grilled asparagus, beef short rib, gnocchi, and potatoes gratin were all to die for.  The lamb and the desserts we ordered (chocolate peanut butter tart and caramel ice cream / lemon buttermilk pie, California citrus, and huckleberries) were good.  I enjoyed them, but they really paled in comparison to the rest of the meal.. . I leave this place happily stuffed and full of warm fuzzies.  5 stars.  :)
