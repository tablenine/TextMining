I suppose there's not really much more to add. The plates and the beverages are outstandingly inventive, balanced and flavorful. The service is superb- highly attentive but not intrusive. . . Go for the tasting menu if you're into sitting back with a mind-numbingly delicious cocktail, gazing at your beautiful dinner partner, and having people bring you both little plates of incredible.
