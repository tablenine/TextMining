PLEASE READ MY REVIEW!!!!! The food is good here. For only $16.99 you can have endless meat such as pork, beef and chicken. My fave is the delicious egg soup and the yummy cup of tea after your meal. Just to inform you, always expect the service to suck.. . *Quality Rating* Â (1 poor - 10 excellent). Food- 8 out of 10 . Service - 3 out of 10 . Cleanliness- 7 out of 10
