THE BEST DAMN CHICKEN EVER!!!!! I came here about 2 weeks ago and still crave for their chicken. Why don't we have one in the bay area damnit! WHY GOD WHY!!! I can't tell you how excited I was to come here finally, my tail was wagging like crazy! I ordered Scoe's..gotta try the chicken and waffles of course. The chicken was seasoned just right and the gravy was off the hooook. I expected the waffles to be crunchy but they came out a lil soft but it was still fucking dericious. Even the chicken dipped in the syrup was good wtf? Can't wait to come back the next time I'm in Lala land. Fucking HEAVEN.
