I have only been to Sepia once &amp; only for cocktails, but man am I still dreaming of those deliciously, devilish drinks.. . I went with a couple girls I work with &amp; was a bit a nervous since we a) had never really hung out before and b) never been to the restaurant. I shouldn't have been worried. Not even a bit.. . I ordered a boring vodka tonic, but admired the drinks of others. Our waiter brought out our drinks after quite some time, but I realize now it's because the bartender was perfecting our cocktails (right?!). Halfway through my vodka tonic I realized I had "tipsy eyes". You know what that is - everything is just a bit shinier, happier, prettier, and slower. I was in heaven. My friend Elise ordered a ginger fizz, which I thought would be too gingery. Boy was I wrong. It was absolutely delicious. That will be my cocktail next time I go. Jess Â had some sort of cucumber martini, which was good but nothing too amazing. Anna had some drink with eggs in it &amp; while it was frothy &amp; beautiful I just couldn't bring myself to try it.. . Even though the drinks were a bit pricier &amp; the atmosphere a bit stuffy I would not hesitate to go back &amp; enjoy a cocktail or two. Especially when I get a little silly only after half a glass!
