Lord, Help me, I've got a monkey on my back! Every time I start to consider something else for "date night" with my boyfriend, I come back to Gloria's. "Hmm, italian sounds okay, maybe I can do that...but the PUPUSAS with the cabbage nonsense." Or "He really likes sushi, maybe... But the Carne Adobadaaaaa." Or maybe I should eat a salad tonight, fatty, but nooooo, there is Glorias, practically sharing a wall with my new apartment. She is a tempting mistress, and if you don't watch out, you too will soon have a monkey on your back. A monkey named Gloria.
