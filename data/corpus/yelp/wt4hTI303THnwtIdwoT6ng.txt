Restaurant: Alon&#39;s
Category: Bakeries
I would be a happy girl if I could awake to a hot cup of strong coffee and an Alon's Cinnamon Stick every morning.  By far my favorite thing about Alon's is their selection of morning pastries with the bread following a close second.. . I'm not that jazzed about their desserts...a little too pretentious for me, but that's just my preference.  I could take or leave the take-out food and although I appreciate the "fromagerie", I think Whole Foods and DKFM have more to choose from.  Maybe that's the point, though.. . Overall I've experienced decent service at Alon's.  The people behind the counter are friendly, but seem to realize they are working in the most reputable bakery/cafe in the city which would entitle them to give off that "i'm-so-cool" vibe when waiting on the customers.  Hopefully they won't turn into mean Fellini-bots.
