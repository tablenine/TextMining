Restaurant: Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant
Category: Breweries
I want to not like Gordon Biersch because it is a chain, it is corporate and it seems a little too manufactured.  But, every time I go here with intent to hate it, I just can't actually bring myself to hate it.. . I like the beer at Gordon Biersch. As far as drinks go, I usually stick with beer when I am here (it is a brewery restaurant so this makes sense to me).  I rarely order entrees here but instead stick to sandwiches, pizzas, appetizers and salads.  They have a nice selection of appetizers which are great when you are having drinks and need a snack.  I've tried the potstickers, calamari, chicken wings, Southwest egg rolls and fried artichoke hearts - all are pretty good.  The pizzas make a nice light meal and are pretty tasty - I like the veggie and fresh mozzarella varieties.  I really like the salads here, too - they are really big and have nice fresh ingredients and there are quite a few different salads from which to choose (I like the classic Cobb salad just because I always do).  And, they have those tasty garlic fries.  Again, I want to not like the food here because it is a big chain and all that but I have to admit that I actually do like it.. . I live right by Gordon Biersch so I have been here more than a few times to watch college basketball and it is a decent place for this if you can arrive early enough to get a seat with a good view of the TVs.  And, I have been here for multiple private parties in the room upstairs where the pool tables are.  They seem to do a good job with private parties based on my own experiences and based on the number of private parties that seem to be held here.
