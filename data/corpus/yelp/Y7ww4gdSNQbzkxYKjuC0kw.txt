Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I've been here a couple of times now. I like it, but I don't love it. It's kind of like Italian fast food, comparable to something like Buca de Beppo-without the family style gigantic portions. I used to order from Ugo all the time when they were located on Pico, close to where I live. I thought it was great and reasonably priced for delivery food. It seems that the prices have been raised since they've moved (of course since they're now in so much cooler downtown culver), and it's not that great for dine-in italian. I love the area, and it seems like it would be a good casual place to get a quick bite...but last time I was there I only saw one waitress! and I think it was for the entire cafe! needless to say, we waited about ten minutes just to be asked about our beverages. . . I do LOVE the bread. It comes warm and is the perfect amount of crusty on the outside and soft, denseness on the inside. I got the chicken marsala-yummy. I knew that already from when I used to have it delivered. It comes with veggies and potatoes-those are also really good because they are cooked in the right amount of olive oil and seasonings. My friend got the chicken pesto panini and said it was ok but she could tell that the chicken was precooked because it was cold and not fresh tasting. yuck! Too bad she didn't order the gnocchi like I suggested! I have had the 3 or 4 cheese before and it's really good.... . The more I think about it though, the less I have a desire to go back...It seems kind of high priced for what it is.
