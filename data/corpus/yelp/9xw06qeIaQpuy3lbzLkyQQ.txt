I went to visit my friend who lives in San Marino and he took us here for dinner. I've heard tons of stories about this place and originally I thought it was a brewery, but it turns out that they just serve a whole bunch of different beers... The list of beers is impressive just like 99 bottles in Santa Cruz. THis place is huge and they've got an extensive menu for you to choose from. I wish there was a Yardhouse in nor cal...It is on the pricier side but well worth your money. I'd highly recommend their soups.
