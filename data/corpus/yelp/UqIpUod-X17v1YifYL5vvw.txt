Limited veggie options. . . But the 'Hot as a Mutha' is to die for. Literally. You will die. Eat at your own risk! We screamin' loved it :) The peach salsa that accompanies that one little lightly breaded habanero heaven is lovely, but does nothing to calm your charred and shrivelled taste buds. Must try, if you love spicy stuff.. . My friends loved the 'Advisory: Limit One' Long Island.
