Nice atmosphere, good sushi special during happy hour. Tried a couple rolls and both were pretty good for a place that isn't a "sushi bar." . . Nightlife seemed to be the expected "trying too hard to be at the latest spot" crowd and the bouncers seemed to be pretty discriminating. I walked right up and they let me in, but there were others standing nearby, seeming to want to be admitted. Didn't really understand what policy they were using at the door. . . Very crowded by the bar once inside and I didn't stay long. I preferred the lower-key happy hour.
