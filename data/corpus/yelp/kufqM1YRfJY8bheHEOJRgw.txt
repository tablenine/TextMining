I've never had anything at Panes I didn't like.  Though I'm not a big fish fan in general  the Tilapia sandwich is nothing short of amazing.  Try it, even if you're not a 'fish person'. Their cookies, pastas and breads are yummy.. . Downsides: waits (both in line and for your food once you order) can be long, especially at lunch (those IL Masonic people jam in), service can be crabby, and has been noted, it's cash-only.
