Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I cant remember the last time I had a great pizza pie, oh yea! At this place! My cousin invited me here a few times with him, and I must say this place is awesome. You can stand outside and drink a beer like nothing that you bought from the liquor store next door. Another thing is that they LET you bring your own alcohol in there but sneaky like. So anyways the food was great , well havent had anything else besides the pizza but it was really really good. I would give a more detailed description of this review but its been such awhile since ive eaten there but ive been meaning to write a review for this place. Anyways I would of given it 5 stars but thats pushing it since the wait is extremely long and they dont take reservations. So if your looking for some good pizza and wait outside having a beer and dont mind come here.
