This place is da bomb, folks! I too noticed that I have left out a review of my favorite sushi place. Go Sushi 55 is a place we like to "entertain at." It's impressive.. . I first went here with my boyfriend and another couple after we couldn't get a reservation at Sushi Gen down the street. This place was wide open on a Sat. night. . . It is located in a broke down Japanese mall, which I see as a total plus, especially if you stop by the ridiculous arcade on the way out for a little Dance Dance Revolution or Typing of the Dead. . . I've been there three or four times, with a small group and it's never been crowded. It kind of smells like fish, but shouldn't it?. . The chefs are usually getting a little tipsy toward the end of the night, and if you know what's good for you, buy them a beer. They respond with fish treats.. . We always get some sort of combo platter or chef's recommendation platter, miso soup all around, Sake, and those little Japanese ice cream balls-Mochi for dessert.. . My boyfriend always has to order and eat something that's alive to feel all tough and shit; clams or something, they usually have a few live options. . . And we always get TORO!!!!!!!! TORO, bitches or fatty tuna is soooooooo good here. Around $10 a piece, but we like to order a piece for everyone and ball out. This is about as close to "livin' the good life" as we get.. . All and all, it's not that expensive, not for how good it is. The combo platters which are good for two people are like $12-$25. Not sure on total prices, because I usually work it so my boyfriend gets the bill here. You see, this place is so good and still such a well kept secret, that we take our friends visiting from out of town that want to get down on this LA sushi scene. And yes, they're always impressed.
