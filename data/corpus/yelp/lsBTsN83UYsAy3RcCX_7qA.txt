Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I've given Bottega Louie a few go arounds since it is so close to where I live, but unfortunately, the food is just not up to snuff.  The restaurant is actually quite well designed and really hyped up my expectations, which is probably why I've been generally disappointed.  The one thing that was really tasty, however, was the Bianco pizza.
