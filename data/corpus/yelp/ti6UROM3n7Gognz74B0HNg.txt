Service deserves slightly less than a 3, but food does deserve a 4...so the average is...a 3!?!!  ^_^   (edit: actually, i think they deserve a 4!!! =D Service depends on who was working that day...^^). . My friend got me all excited about this place such that i literally starved myself just so I can stuff myself w/ shellfish when the time comes.  We came as a group, but they won't seat people until everyone is there.  I guess they don't want us to hog a table for too long.. . We had to wait quite a while for our food, service was not good.  We didn't get our drinks until the food nearly came.  Other people sat down way after us, but got their food just about the same time.  I was so hungry that I thought I might feel too full to eat -- that kind of feeling. . . but when food came out...it tasted great!  (i'm actually salivating while thinking of it).  We tried crawfish and shrimps, fried catfish, fries, sausages, sweet potato fries, chicken wings.  . . Drinks come with free refill.  You get a free corn if you order 3lbs of crawfish.  . . My suggestion, if you don't like the feeling of working so hard for something so little, go with shrimps.  Crawfish really has too little meat, and their shells alone makes up all the pounds compared to shrimps.. . other than the service, we were all stuff and walked out pretty satisfied.  Catfish, and fries!  give those a try.  The sausages weren't that "wooH" but the others were!. . I'd definitely come back and bring my family there one of these days when I can find time where all of them are not busy.  . . Cost: we ate a lot, and it came out to be about 20 bucks per person, with tips and taxes.  =D
