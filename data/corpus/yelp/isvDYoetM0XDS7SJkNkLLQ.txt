Here goes my first review! . . The food is good-- although I've tried many smaller joints in Monterey Park and Alhambra that are comparable. The prices are outrageous and can't justify the quality or the service, which is lousy!  . . The new addition definitely makes it easier to get a table and the additional parking is the only reason why I'd give this place 3 stars.  Otherwise it would be one.. . Completely over rated!!
