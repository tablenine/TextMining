Slow fast food.  It's their concept and a nice concept at that.  It works, the food is good, but have you ever given thought to fast slow food?  Imagine a thick, meaty slab of ribs thrown at you five minutes after ordering.  Or how about sitting at a table and ordering the 30-second risotto?  . . Yeah, that would be some fucked up shit: "Ma'am, we're going to try as hard as we can to not stain your dress, but this table-side service doesn't give us much room for cleanliness when we have to butcher the cow next to you."  *Starts up chain saw*. . Your risotto would be raw wet rice, like outside a church on a rainy day.. . Slow fast food, though, that's nifty.  . . PS  This is the most expensive fast food I've ever had.  Worth it though except the fries, they're stale.
