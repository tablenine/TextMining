Restaurant: Ria&#39;s Bluebird
Category: Southern
I'd like to thank Bobbin W. for introducing this fantastic restaurant to us!  It was quite a delight.  Man, who knew that sausage links can actually be cooked to perfection. Well, here at Ria's you must order a side of these links because they are so worth the extra calories and grease.. . The sausage links have the perfect crisp on the outside and the meat still manages to be tender and juicy on the inside.  Love it!. . I actually tried the BBQ chicken quesadillas w/ mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised by the "meatiness" of the dish and perfectly crisp flour tortilla, outer shell.. . This place is worth the wait. If you haven't checked it out yet, it's a definite MUST.
