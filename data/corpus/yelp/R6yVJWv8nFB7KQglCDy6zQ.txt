I'm starting with a "4 star review" because I don't think I got the full experience.... YET. A girlfriend ordered take out and it was all waiting for me when I got to her house- she had sort of ordered a sampling of several items for us to try. . .  I was excited to check this place out after reading about it being one of the "50 Best New U.S. Restaurants of 2009" in Travel &amp; Leisure Magazine. They describe it in their article as "Korean street food" which is nice to see because I didn't know exactly how to categorize it myself. I liked everything about the concept of the place, from reading about the owners on their simple, hip-looking website to the fact that they have done minimal advertising and it's been all word-of-mouth.. . I'd like to go back soon to try everything else I didn't have, but this is what I did have:. Duck &amp; Pho dumpling-   perfect and delicious. Asian squash and bacon dumpling - fabulous flavor combo. Wrinkle beans- turns out these are green beans with some spicy peppers and maybe bacon? A nice spicy side dish. Short ribs with scallion rice- great flavor, not a lot of meat though!. Soba noodles with bay scallops &amp; a thai basil broth-    this was crazy good and I couldn't get enough. Even after being carted across town, the noodles were delectable and that broth was full of the most mouth-watering lemongrassy goodness. I put it on everything.. . I am definitely a new fan and will be going back to try everything else in the very near future!
