Restaurant: Canoe
Category: American (New)
Canoe is a wonderful restaurant, that has mastered the art of maintaining impeccable service, food, and atmosphere. Set right next to the river, the view from inside or out is amazing, and the servers are incredibly well-trained and knowledgabel about both the food and the wine. My boyfriend and I each ate three courses, and none of them were a disappointment. The roasted pheasant was perfectly cooked, and the mussells were seasoned to perfection.
