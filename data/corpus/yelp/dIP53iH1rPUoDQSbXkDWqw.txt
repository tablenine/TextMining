I have been hearing about Ciudad for quite some time and have been to the Border Grill in Santa Monica several.  There was a great blackboard eats special that we took advantage of on a Sunday when they had their tapas menu.  The menu had some great options and all in all the food was the highlight.  The abalone ceviche was great and was on par with some of the best I had in Lima.  The Portuguese sausage was alright, but my wife seemed to enjoy it more then me.  (Yes that did sound dirty.)  The farmers market salad had a great mix of greens and the mushroom empanada was also pretty good as well. Personally I enjoyed the goat cheese fritters the most.  Of course it is hard to go wrong with lightly fried goat cheese.  Now for my beef for the night.  I know I tend to drink a lot of water and I always try to give out waiters a heads up so that they can leave a pitcher or give the bus boy a heads up.  I gave our waiter a heads up and I went over 20 minutes without a refill.  In the course of that time I asked three times before our waiter remembered and made the comment "Oh yeah, you said you drink a lot of water."  Come on man!  I know that tapas night is probably a pain because you have to run around serving a bunch of small plates, but really?  After that though it seemed like he was making up for lost time and filled me up 3 times in the next 20 minutes.  For me the service was the turn off of the night.  Ciudad was one of the few restaurants to cater to the downtown 10 years ago when it opened, (you also can tell that they have not updated the decor since then.)  It seems that as the competition increases in the area, that maybe they need to step it up a notch to keep themselves in line with the higher quality of service and decor for the same price point at other area restaurants.
