Ugh, how can this place even get a one star rating. . . It is basically a TGIF in disguise for all the WeHo hipsters trying to be cool.. . It has tacky trinkets all over the walls and some really shitty video games in the back. . . The food is barely passable. I got cheese sticks, which in case you haven't seen them before are breading surrounded by cheese. They deep fry them and the cheese should be melted in the middle.. . Well mine was not. It was like eating string cheese right out of the fridge with really bad breading. How do you mess up something this simple.. . Sure the portion is huge, but when you can barely finish the first one how am I going to eat the other 11 that are still on the plate.. . Theres pool tables surrounded by drunk bros that will hit on anything with boobs as well.. . If you suck at life then you will love this place.
