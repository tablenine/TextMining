Extra ginger sauce, please!!!. . Uh.. who the heck gets pizza here? It's all about the Hainanese chicken rice. Chicken over rice has never been so good! The chicken is boiled in stock and the rice is steamed in chicken oil. So simple and so delicious.. . Tips: Also try the fried shrimp rolls. Park on the street.
