Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The boiling crab... . Wow. Legions of Asians swarm here with the promises of great amounts of seafood served in a bag on your table topped w/ wax paper.. When we went last, there wasn't a terribly long wait (we didn't even wait) but after 20 minutes of sitting, a huge crowd had gathered outside on a Thursday evening. . What we got:. We got crawfish, shrimp, lobster, corn and sausage, and all in the traditional/classic "boiling pot" seasoning.  . It was great, but seriously, after the first few bites, it felt like I was drowning in wet sauce and there was no end in sight.  It was everywhere... By the end of the meal, it seemed like some shellfish holocaust happened at the table.. My only real complaints here are that the sausage could be better and the seating is a little tight. . Personally, I prefer clam/lobster/crab bake style more and the seasoning is just too wet for me.  It's kinda hard when you've got to worry about being up to your nostrils in a bag of seafood and sauce.
