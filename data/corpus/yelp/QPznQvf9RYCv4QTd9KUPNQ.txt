Eh.  Over priced small burgers.  Roll is boring. iceburg lettuce, maybe good for 1947 but come on $6.75 a burger. It isn't even cut or chopped and takes away from the taste of the burger. In n Out way better and more value.. . The fried meat again for the  money mcd's can do better.  For a place that's been around it certainly hasn't adapted well.  Except for it's prices! .  $20.40 for one cheeseburger, one ice tea and one pie a la mode.  What a gip.  Norm's would be half for more food that taste the same.  . . The apple pie was good.  The ice cream, eh. But at $7.50 again what a gip!!!!. . Service is fast.  Place is clean and busy.  But now that I finally tried it, not going back.  Go to" the Hole in the Wall" around the corner. 10x better and more value!!
