So I came here on the first night after landing into LA. Friends of mine took me here last Wed night. It was just the 3 of us and we feasted!! We ordered the sashimi deluxe which was absolutely fantastic. I think the assortment really depends on the day you go. Hit or miss. I don't really like ordering chefs choice of assorted anything.. but my friends advised that it is really well worth it. The assortment of the sashimi deluxe was awesome. We got some toro, tuna, yellowtail, ika and salmon. Not to mention the tuna tartare(both in regular and spicy) We also got the sushi deluxe- that was sad and I was not impressed and it was smaller than the sashimi delux. I had asked the waitress if they had grilled chicken gizzard, and they said yes- they came back with pieces of fried chicken- don't ask. Wanted to return that but the friend had already dived in to it. We also got miso soups which were pretty good- not the heavy and powdery stuff. Also ordered shrimp and vegi tempura which was alright. Including the 2 bottles of sake we ordered I think the bill came out to be $175. . . Since I had a good experience here and it was the only sushi joint I knew of, I took my cousin here last Sat. It was just the 2 of us and we got there around 9pm. It was packed, but we didn't have to wait. We ordered the sashimi deluxe - and I was soo disappointed. I never stuffed myself with so much tuna! That's all there was and like 3 pieces of salmon!!! Fresh, yes- assortment BAD!! We also ordered the grilled smelt fish which was sad. I've had much better in NYC. We also got an order of uni - thank goodness I was happy with uni.. ohh.. yummy uni.. . . Anyway, would I go back again? Maybe on a week night. Would I give the sashimi deluxe another shot?? yes, but on a weeknight- What about a weekday? No - order a' la cart
