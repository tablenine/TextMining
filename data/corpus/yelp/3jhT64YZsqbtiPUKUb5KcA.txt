Hands down, my favorite place to go for happy hour (but I've never come here for an actual dinner). $5 martinis. $4 appetizers (very generous portions...more than enough for dinner for me). I usually get the mussels or the goat cheese bruschetta...or both if I'm really hungry or splitting with someone. My meat-eating friends enjoy the cheeseburger. Best of all, Devon has TWO happy hours, one from 5-7, and another from 9-midnight. I go to law school right around the corner, so during the school year I come here after my evening classes. It's dark, cozy,and the perfect place to unwind after a long week of work and class...especially if you get one of the booths in the back.
