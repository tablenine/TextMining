Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
it's really cute when you first walk in. pictures of old hollywood celebrities adorn the walls of the waiting area. the main part of the restaurant isn't as cute and doesn't really go with that old gothic theme they were shooting for. there are murals on the wall based on a garlic theme.. . the service here was excellent. they must of read previous reviews and stepped up there game cause i had no problems in that arena.. . to start we had the focaccia bread and garlic spread which was really intense for me. you basically eat steamed garlic, kinda gross to me.. . i ordered the steamed garlic clams and they tasted...like clams. unless you eat it like a soup, you won't really get much of the garlic flavor.. . my sister ordered the lamb and couldn't eat it, i agreed. a bit rank.. . my mom liked her seafood pasta and my dad like his garlic chicken so i guess it wasn't all bad. . . to finish off, we split garlic ice cream. and by split, i mean my dad ate it all cause no one else liked it. i'll try anything once but with this...just once is enough.. . the bill was crazy, came out to 107 for 4. i'm not used to spending that kind of dough on a typical night out to dinner.. . i think this is a place i'd only go to once, jut for the experience. and that must be why it was full of tourists.
