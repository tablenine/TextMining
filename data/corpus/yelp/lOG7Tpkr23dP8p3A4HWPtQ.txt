SO DAMN GOOD! I can smell the aroma from this place a block away.. . Just thinking about my experience in Porto's--standing in front of their cakes and pastries displays and seeing all the varieties they got-- put a big smile on my face and sparkles in my eyes. . . Their cheese rolls are so goooood!!! Sweet and creamy! I wished I'd ordered more! I also like the spinach croissant they have, very flaky and oh, the spinach center is so rich and creamy also. Oh and I love their mango mousse cake. Did I mention that their pound cakes and quesadillas cakes are very worth the money! Actually everything is so cheap but they all taste SO yummy! . . Their non-alcohol mojito tastes almost like the alcoholic one. It's like a limeade with mint. VERY refreshing especially in the summer heat. . . OMG, they should seriously open one in the bay area!!! OMG, I wish I could try every single item they have!!!
