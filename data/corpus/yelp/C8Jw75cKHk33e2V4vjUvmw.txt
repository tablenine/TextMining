get the kotteri and some delicious rectangle-shape gyoza and you are set.  the kotteri soup is sooo warm and fatty and flavorful.  the green onions just add to the deliciousness that is their kotteri ramen. . . it opens at 12pm on sundays (as of yesterday...) so go there around 1145 and the wait isn't too bad.
