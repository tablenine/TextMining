One thing:  Get the sugar cane juice!!!!!  There is a big poster of it on the wall, and they have a cool cane press right at the walk in counter so you can see it being made.  I thought my home away from home Miami had the only restaurants where you can mosy on in and get some freshly squeezed sugar cane juice (without the ginger they put in it over at Patel Bros. on Devon) It is addictingly delicious, and about as sweet as orange juice.  BTW, tell them not to squeeze orange into it.  . . Their pho is not as good as Pho 777, and they are busy as hell, but they make this beef and lemon grass dish which is to die for.
