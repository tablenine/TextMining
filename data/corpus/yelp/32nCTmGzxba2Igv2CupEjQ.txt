All the food here was mediocre.. . Service was ok, the atmosphere was nice, the dining room was a bit crowded, and the prices were kinda steep.. . The food... nothing was horrible but nothing was extraordinary either.  All very "meh."  Had the short ribs, pork, and flank steak.  Short ribs had a good sauce, but were cooked a bit tough.  Pork was somewhat bland and one of the three porks (cooked three ways) was odd-tasting.  Flank steak was maybe the best dish of the three but was seasoned a bit too salty.  Also, tried the truffle parmesan fries which were good, but definitely not the best truffle fries I've ever had.. we actually didn't finish this, which I almost never do.. . I wanted to try dessert at the beginning of the meal.  But by the end, I was full, and also, I was disappointed in the rest of the meal, so I decided to save my money instead.
