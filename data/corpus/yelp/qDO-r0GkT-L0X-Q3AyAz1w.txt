I stopped by at 3AM and got a bun stuffed with the pork belly dregs from the bottom of the pot. Instead of a thick slice of pork belly, I got tiny bits of meat, sauce, and fat. And yet-- holy crap- that was delicious. The bun was soft and delicious and the filling was extremely generous. I hate taking a bite of a sandwich and biting into all bread. Don't get me wrong- the mantou was good enough to eat all by itself, but it made me really really absurdly happy to have pork belly in every bite. . . Although- to be honest- the portion is pretty small. I originally balked at the $4 and change for a single tiny bun, but when I consider that I actually pay more for the less generous and comparable buns at Ippudo or Momofuku, then I realize maybe I'm being unfair. The owner talks a lot about responsibly sourcing his food and I love that he blogs about it because it shows how much he cares about food and his restaurant (even if his tone is a little abrasive, the man is hilaaarious). I'm guessing part of the reason people go into sticker-shock is the decor. Fancy restaurant it is not. Baohaus is basically a take out counter with two counters against both walls. A bright electric blue covers just about every surface. It's a little jarring, even at 3AM. . . Great, friendly staff. Nice plates when you "eat-in" too. Something to try and I'd stop by again. Just be aware that this is not going to be as cheap as a dollar-dumpling place or even your neighborhood deli sandwich. You'll need to spend about $15 to feel full, but the quality in the ingredients and the cooking is definitely there.
