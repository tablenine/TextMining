Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
What can I say, I love this place!  I always look forward to going to Alfredo's.  The experience begins even before you even step into this place considering where it is located.  With all the sleazy strip clubs around, the location for this restaurant is quite awkward but it doesn't matter to me and not to all those that pack in every week.  . . Once you get into this restaurant, you have Soprano's and mafia type environment.  I have always been seated by the same old fella and served by the same waitor.  This waitor is a trip cause I am afraid to talk to him because he tends to bite your head off; reminds of me of hte Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.  However he is a gentleman and always has nice things to say about the ladies that are with you.. . As far as the food, it is excellent!  I wouldn't be giving good reviews the food wasn't good.  I especially like this dish they have which is chicken with pesto.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
