I've heard and read so many bad things about this restaurant, but my experience was great!  Sure - it's expensive.  There is no question about that.  However, there aren't many places I've been where I CRAVE the food afterwards.. . We had reservations and were seated immediately at a table overlooking the other diners.  Of course, it was a weekday, so that may have made a difference in our wait time.. . We ordered an appetizer platter that had an assortment of delectable treats.  We also ordered the famous garlic noodles and dungeoness crab.  The noodles were so delicious, we had to order another plate!  Formality be damned, we actually sucked and licked our fingers after we ate the crab.  . . The drink list was impressive.  I had a very tasty martini followed by a lovely glass of wine.. . After our dinner, we were visited by the mother of the family.  She inquired about our meal and experience.  We raved about the crab.. . Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable dinner.  The food was delicious and our service was impeccable.
