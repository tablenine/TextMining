Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
The food is decent but not worth the price unless you stick to the pastas.. . A slice of plain cheese pizza is $2.50 and it wasnt worth it because the crust was slightly burnt. . . Oh and btw the Ugo off of Culver Blvd is tapas style. It's a different menu than the cafe on Cardiff.
