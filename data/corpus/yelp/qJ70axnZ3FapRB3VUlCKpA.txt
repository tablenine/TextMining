Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Jerry's serves up some of the most exciting fare between two slices of bread that I have ever tasted. . . Although the most legendary of sandwich shoppes are typically of the Jewish deli persuasion, Jerry's takes a slightly more hip approach by offering non-deli proteins such as fried chicken, seasoned pork loin, skirt steak, and smoked salmon. Additionally, Jerry's keeps the menu fresh and exciting with sauces and seasonings such as the lemon pepper mayo and chipotle chutney that are tastefully outside the box, but still familiar enough for all types of customers. . . And the bread! Good lord this may be the best part! Jerry's boasts an impressive bread selection that includes your standard wheat and rye, but also includes ciabatta, onion, and pretzel rolls. I'm highly partial to the pretzel roll, but I suppose you will have to try it for yourself. . . Unfortunately, the friendliness and quality of service from the staff can be a bit inconsistent based on my last few experiences, but the sandwiches are so damn good that you probably won't care. . . Be warned that the menu has over 100 sandwiches to choose from, so it's best to leave your indecision at the door.. . Recommended from the Menu: . Crab Cake Sandwich . Fried Buffalo Chicken Sandwich . "Diego A" - Skirt Steak and Avocado Sandwich (must have on a pretzel roll)
