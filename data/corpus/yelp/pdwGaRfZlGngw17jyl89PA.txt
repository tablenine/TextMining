I have conflicted feelings about this place.  I had a burger post haircut at Aveda.  I passed by on the way to said appointment (one-ish) and the place was packed.  Wandered by around 2ish to eat, crowd had thinned, but still the only seat was at a counter (Booo!  I don't care if it's the namesake).  Anyways, I got a 1/3 lb angus beef with provolone, fried onion strings, roasted red peppers, and garlic aioli.  Mostly I wanted the fried onion strings because of that enticing ad I see in the RedEye like everyday.  But it costs freaking $1 extra.  For the regular $8.75 (eight something, can't remember), you get 4 regular toppings, one sauce, and one cheese.  But premium toppings are $1 extra per topping.  Which includes fried onion strings and fried egg.  Anyways despite my ONE regular topping and one premium topping, it came up to $10.13 with tax.  . . That's right $10 for one burger, no sides, no drink, just tap water (hence 3 stars).  Sadness...not to mention I had to leave a tip, too.  Service was decent, but come on I was sitting at the counter.  It was delicious and everything but the now defunct Bennigans had something similar (topped with fried onion strings) and it cost $9 with fries.  Also keep in mind that the roasted peppers while delicious were kind watery and dripped everywhere.  I would have loved a fried egg, too, but then that would be fricking $12.  It would've been satisfying if I had a side, but by itself 1/3 lb. was not enough.  Maybe I'm just a heifer, but do think about getting a larger size.
