Restaurant: Lula&#39;s Sweet Apothecary
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Lula?? Lulaaa?! Where are you...come to LA please!  Ok, let's just say that "obsessed, entrhalled, infatuated" would all be accurate descriptors, but not nearly powerful enough terms to tell of my instantaneous love affair with Lula's Sweet Apothecary. Cured my ills? AND sent me off on an ice cream skipping spree.  Yes, it is like a drug. . . Not only are the flavors absolutely incredible, my favorite being peanut butter fudge...oh goodness i can feel the saliva pooling in hopeful anticipation just at the thought....but the atmosphere of the tiny place is just perfect. I was sure that a barbershop quartet was likely to pop up from behind the counter at any moment to serenade me while I tried to wrap my mind around the delicious creamy sensation dancing on my tongue. . . Oh right...it's vegan too. Which completes the circle of my obsession. If you're vegan you will bask in the glory of Lula's and likely follow in my obsessive love. If you are not vegan, you will bask in the glory of Lulas and likely follow in my obsessive love. Really. I'm that confident. . . Lula's should have t-shirts, buttons, posters, postcards, and little plastic ice cream cone paper weights so I can show my love to the world!
