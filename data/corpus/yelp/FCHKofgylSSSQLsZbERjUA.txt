I felt like my trip to Atlanta was a tour of Top Chef'dom.  The space itself is very dramatic, with clean lines and a hip decor, something that i see as the "new steakhouse motif".  The night that I went, our server was somewhat distracted which led to somewhat awkward periods of nothing, no server to be scene, no food or drink in sight.  When our server was present, he was very nice and had some good advice, sadly he was just not around that much.   We started with some hard cider, a great choice to accompany our oysters and beet salad, both very good.  The appetizers were followed by some scallops and short ribs accompanied by some brussels sprouts.  The food was good, but nothing spectacular, this was a case of super high expectations being met with a good meal and me leaving underwhelmed.  Had I now know where I was and had my service been a little better, maybe I would have given this place 4 stars, but it was really nothing spectacular.  Some of the wine I ordered was also out of stock, which is understandable but again, i was just underwhelmed, sadly.
