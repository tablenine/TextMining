Oh I had such High Hopes that I had actually reached the promised land.  I have been on the search for Tex-Mex here in ATL, but have not had any luck.. . I came across this place after reading about it in the NY Times.  I came in on a recent afternoon.  I first ordered a margarita, and it tasted right. (as opposed to the powdered sugar monstrosity at Fuego).  The chips and salsa were the right consistency.  I ordered a Dos xx.. . I decided to apply the ultimate test, I ordered enchiladas.  My spirits were up, as were my hopes.  Perhaps I wouldn't have to book a flight home every few months to get my greasy fix.. . Then the plate came...and the Spanish rice was in a ball, like you get at a fine french restaurant.  The cheese was that fancy "interior Mexican" white.. . The food was good, don't get me wrong, and I'll be back for the Dos XX, Sangria, and margaritas, but I left there knowing my quest is not complete.
