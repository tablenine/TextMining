Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Glenn's is not a diner if you're expecting a diner. That bears repeating. But if you want fresh fish, or just a big selection of standard and unique brunches and sandwiches, it's a great option. . I live down the street and I was so worried when Glenn's got knocked out of commission by the water main break. Luckily, they must be well insured because they were open again in no time.. It's a good place to go for a quiet meal with one other person. Any more than that and you're probably the spectacle of the restaurant, because everyone dines in one fairly small room; louder conversations are not at all private.. Oh, and as a Polack, I feel okay saying that their potato pancakes are just plain weird. A mayonnaise-y-hashbrown glob. It's not a bad little side dish they've created, but don't call it a potato pancake.
