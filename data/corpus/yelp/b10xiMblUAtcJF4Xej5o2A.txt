Really good NY-style thin crust pizza is hard to find in Chi-town...this place is great. I love the charred crust. My favorites are the pesto pizza and pepperoni w/ fresh mozzarella. The service is friendly and the prices are good.. . The place is small, so you can expect to wait a while to be seated/served when it's full.
