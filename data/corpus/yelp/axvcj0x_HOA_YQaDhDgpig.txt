Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This place has some of the most unique and delicious ramen... well, ever! The broth is so different from anything I've ever had before. I haven't been brave enough to try the Special #2, but I wouldn't recommend it. I just don't get why you'd want to purposely damage your own stomach lining. I love spicy and still usually get the shoyu ramen #4 or #3 on a "feeling the spicy" day, just so I can keep all my taste buds happy and alive and enjoy my meal. Â The noodles could use some improvement - a little soft for my taste, but keep in mind that Orochon is their own unique ramen. There can be a wait, but it's good, cheap, and pretty quick food. Don't take the scary shaky elevator! Take the stairs up.
