OK...I get it, it's not REAL sushi. They have all these specialty rolls that have truffle and fois gras and deep fried tortilla crispy things. SO WHAT. If I want uber fresh nigiri and sashimi there's a million places to go. OK, maybe not a million, but a bunches. And most of them are in LA or SF, with one that I can think of in NY. But for specialty sushi bombness that is often imitated but never duplicated, I pull up to Domino's pizza (Which is where the valet driver takes my car) and walk into Sushi Specialty Heaven. I even have my fave waitress who I have a raging girl crush on. . . I always order some variation of the following:. 1) Crispy Rice tuna. 2) Crispy Sesame Tuna. 3) Crab Tuna Cone. 4) Yellowtail Tasting. 5) Bonito Sashimi. 6) Scallop Fois Gras. 7) Garlic Albacore and Truffle. 8) Crispy Onion Albacore. 9) Seaweed Salad. 10) Deep Fried Green Tea Ice Cream. 11) Chocolate Lava Cake. 12) Green Tea Ice Tea. I spend about 60-75 when I go.. . Make note:. Make a reservation or come before 630. . Valet is free at lunch and 3.50 for dinner.. Dress casual.. Leave your autograph book at home.. Try not to stare at the famous people.
