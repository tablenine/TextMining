I'm a fan, I went to the The Doheny event in Downtown LA. They had this special venue that hosted the Kogi truck and it was pretty well organized, but okay back to the food. We ordered Two Galbi tacos which tasted okay but after trying the spicy tacos, we decided that we liked the Spicy pork tacos and should have gotten the galbi burrito as a spicy pork but we'll catch them next time. My friend tried the Chicken and she ad she liked it too i decided I had enough chicken for the day so I passed. We also got Pork Belly which was okay but thought it could have been cooked more. Â All in all I will be back again.
