Restaurant: The Twisted Spoke
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
For some strange reason, I keep calling this place "Toasted' Spoke which coincidentally would suit them just fine with their extensive drink menu and plethora of Bloody Mary options!. . I came here last Friday (another beautiful day when the patios are screaming your name!) and sat on the rooftop deck.  Luckily, we had no issues getting a table because we arrived just before the crowds, with the same idea as us.. . I had been hearing about the Bloody Mary's here for a couple months and could not wait to finally experience them.  As promised, it was served with practically a buffet of treats that compliment the Mary perfectly-peperoncini, cocktail onions, about 4 slices of delicious salami and OF COURSE the beer back!  We also had the mussels which were equally delicious-smoky flavor with pieces of bacon in the broth.. . One itty bitty issue was that the server was new.  Our drinks took awhile to come out and she had no clue what mussels were.  I am cutting her slack and kept the 5 stars because we have all been the 'new person'!!. . Can't wait to go back to Toasted(Oops!) Twisted Spoke!
