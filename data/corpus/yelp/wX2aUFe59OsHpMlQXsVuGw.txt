Nutella stuffed french toast with powdered sugar and whipped cream! I wanted to devour it the moment it was placed in front of me. It was sinfully delicious, down to the very last nutella filled bite. Everything is huge here, huge and tasty. One pancake is approximately the size of a smallish pizza, you definitely wouldn't need a full stack, or even more than one for that matter. You must go early though, as there will be a wait, but it is sooo worth it.
