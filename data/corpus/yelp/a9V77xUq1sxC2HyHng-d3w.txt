Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's has become a tradition so I love it not only  for the food but for sentimental reasons as well. Even the lady with her thick rimmed glasses and haute attitude has become part of the experience as she has always been there to curtly confirm my reservations. I warm up the ol' belly  with meatballs and chips and before I know it, the server has pulled out the table for me to scoot into the booth.  . . I'm a little bummed out Lawry's loosened their dress code. I guess people don't like getting dressed up anymore, or look decent.. . The prime rib is awesome and you can ask for whatever cut you see on the cart. You can get the fat trimmed or added, whatever your preference. I love the salad, partly for the presentation, but also because it's a straightforward without too much dressing. I am not particular about the sides because I enjoy them all. Well, if I HAD to choose, it would be the creamed corn.. . For what you get, the price is right.  Once I was treated to an off menu dish of sauteed lobster, shrimp and scallops in a butter herb sauce that was, dare I say it,  just perfect.
