We just literally came back from this sushi place and boy am I fired up to write this review.  If you look at the list of restaurants that I have reviewed you will see that I have been to a lot of sushi places so I thnk I know what im talking about.  We did not have reservations  but we were seated immediately, thats fabulous.  The server came to give us the menu pretty promptly so that not bad.  The place had a nice ambience.  The downfall begins with the food.  We ordered, the BobSan, Alaskan Dragon, sea bass roll and the scallop temaki (I cant remember the exact names of the lastt two).  The price is similar to Toro and Usagi Ya but the quality is just not good at all.  The rice is wet and sticky and they scrimp on the fish and they stuff it with Avocado and other stuff.  The Bob San was not good at all, there were two rolls that were stuffed with leaves instead of the fish.  They have 6 small pieces per order for the roll and they are small.  After the first order I wasnt full at all so we ordered the Passion and the Alaskan.  Ilike King Crab and the Alaskan Rainbow didnt have enough crab at all, I could barely taste the crab so I ordered a different one which is just King Crab roll (Alaskan) and my gosh I still cannot taste or see the crab.  The Passion was just as bad, we just had to pick the salmon because the rice was too wet and sticky and the avocado was overpowering the roll.  Doesnt end here, the service is too slow in this place, granted they are busy but how long does it take to get the check.  I will not be returning at this place at all and I dont recommend it.  So many good sushi places. in the city.
