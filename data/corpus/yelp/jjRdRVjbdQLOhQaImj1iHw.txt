Restaurant: Crust

YUM..... . I loved absolutely everything about this place!. ~Great outside seating along Division. ~Beautiful courtyard seating in the back with shade. ~Delicious pizza!. ~Eco-friendly restaurant. ~Great service. . I love how the pizza at Crust is NOTHING like traditional Chicago-style pizza.  It's almost like Crust is an outpost of L.A. or something, with the thin, veggie dense pizzas.  It's a nice change of pace from the usual "deep-dish" stuff we are used to in Chicago.. . The best part of Crust might be how large the restaurant is...you'll always find a table and there are tons of options to sit indoors, outdoors, in the sun (those 3 times per year that we see the sun), in the shade, etc.
