This place is just OK. I took my friend there for his birthday a few weeks ago and he arrived before me so the hostess seated him. So when I arrived, he got up to meet me at the door for like 1 minute - and when we got back to our table....it was GONE! The hostess said that the table was empty for too long! Â So we had to wait another 30 minutes for another table, which was right by the door and very uncomfortable - but we spotted another table in a little cosy corner and was seated there after starting to complain about her bad attitude. . . The food was not that great and it was EXTREMELY loud in there. I could hardly have a conversation without almost shouting. I had the Salmon farfalle or something like that - which lacked a little flavor, but adding salt made it taste better. All in all, I wont be back here anything soon - just not my taste.
