Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Had no idea this place had amassed so much hype over the years until I saw it being consistently mentioned in LA's Best Pizza Lists.... . I can confidently proclaim it is by far the best slice you'll find in all of LC/Glendale/Eagle Rock, which was unforgettable for me growing up in the 818, where your only other options were Papa John's and The Hut. Pizza Hut, that is. Although, Guido's in Tujunga is pretty good, too. But chances are if you aren't a local or remotely familiar with this place, you won't be feeling the same warm fuzzies. In fact, you will probably be experiencing immediate petulance at the first glimpse of a line forming outside the establishment filled with patrons who are also whining miserably like you. And when your order arrives, you might proceed to scoff at the fact that this is not authentic New York style pizza. But then again, they never claimed to be.. . Instead of wandering in with the same unreasonable eagerness you had when trying Pinkberry for the very first time, expect just a cozy old school pizzeria, the kind with red checkered table cloths, red pepper flake and parmesan shakers, pizza stands, and tiffany style lighting, that serves up a legit pie. I highly recommend topping off your pie with their homemade sausage, meatball, and eggplant, or any combination of those with other veggies. EXCEPT THE SHROOMS. Never tried them but I hear they are canned. The eggplant might sound a bit unusual on pizza but it is breaded and fried much like eggplant parmigiana, which is one of the reasons their pizza is so special.
