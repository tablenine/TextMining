Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
Having recently returned from a trip to Germany my wife and I had been craving the beer and wurst experience (It had only been a week). Wurstküche looked liked the place to satisfy our hunger.  It blew our already high expectations away. . . Imagine a German version of Father's office. Lets call it Father's Wurst, although that would translate to fathers sausage. So maybe we don't call it that. Great exposed ceiling interior, cool bench seating so be prepared to sit next to some new firends. Loud but not bad. The crowd was an eclectic mix but mostly dominated by hipsters. . . They offered an amazing Beer selection. Focusing mostly on German beers. Not to mention a great selection of wurst. We had 2 bratwurst, large fries and 2 Franziskaner Hefe Weisse.  It all came out to $28, not too bad. The fries were fantastic, crunchy and salty. The dipping sauce selection was very unique. I recommend the curry ketchup. The sausages were tasty along with a  really nice bread roll the sausage laid in.  . . Great overall experience. Can't wait to go back.
