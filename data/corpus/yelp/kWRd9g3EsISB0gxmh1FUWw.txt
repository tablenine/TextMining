Enjoyable. Went here with some friends visiting per another friend's suggestion; him and his girlfriend really enjoy eating here. I thought it was good. We made a reservation the night of, only about two hours before, and they were able to get us in. When I walked in, we got shuffled right into our little spot for 6: in a corner table that was pretty separate from the rest of the restaurant. Very cozy, kind of small for six, especially if two in your party are over 5'10". It was nice though, a romantic interracial couple triple date (3 couples, all interracial). Got the spaghetti and meatballs and they were enjoyable; not as special as Rosebud's meatballs, but there was still great taste. I could have had a little bit more sauce on my pasta, but I'm kind of a saucy girl (in that I like sauce. I am saucy though.) . . I tried the canneloni that my friends got and the cream sauce was out of this world. Very good, and I am definitely Â not a cream sauce girl. That dish was so cheesy, so beware those who are lactose intolerant! My boyfriend got some pizza, which was also tasty. . . All in all, I'm not in this neighborhood enough to be all gung ho for it all the time, and I tend to try to eat where I am, so I won't be back here for awhile, but quite possibly for our interracial couple triple date
