DELICIOUS!!!. . I watched this small little bakery blossom to something bigger as time went on.. it became sooo popular!!. . There is NEVER a time where its empty! it is always packed!!! a LOT of people rushing around...mostly biz people squeezing time in for lunch. It is totally worth it waiting in line..... . You must TRY their potato balls! they are my favorite...it is SOOO GOOD!! i promise!!! i always get boxes of them haha. the sandwiches are good too =)
