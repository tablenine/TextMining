I wasn't sure what to expect on my first visit here, and the extensive menu is a tad intimidating, but I shouldn't have worried. I ordered a simple option -- chicken and vegetables, and it was wonderful. The veggies were fresh, and the flavor of the sauce was extraordinary. I may be a little more adventurous next time. The service was no-frills and fast. I was there for dinner, but this seems like it might be the perfect lunch spot. . . And you can't beat how CHEAP this place is! I'll be back!
