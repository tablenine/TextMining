Category: Latin American
The outdoor seating here is fantastic. I was walking around Melrose with a group of friends from out of town searching for a place to drink/ grub and we were lucky enough to come across Lala's. They were able to seat all 8 of us right away and kept the beers coming. Good selection of imported South American beers, including Crystal which brought me back to the good ol' days of traveling through Peru. Truth be told, we only had an appetizer or two, but the empanadas were great (from what I remember) and the aroma in the air was delicious. I will most definitely be coming back here soon (and maybe get an actual meal this time too!).
