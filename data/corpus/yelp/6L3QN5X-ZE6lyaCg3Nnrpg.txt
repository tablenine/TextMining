Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I want to like this place, I really do... but the food sucks.. But the atmosphere is great and the service is good, so if you've been drinking all night at the Cinema Bar and it's 2am go ahead and eat some sobering pastrami and fries.
