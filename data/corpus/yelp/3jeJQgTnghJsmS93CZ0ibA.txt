This place keeps getting worse for me.. . The service is often inattentive and misinformed. On several different occasions, I have been told entirely different things about what is included in the "mini-buffet" and what is not, only to have the manager correct the waitress. The menu is confusing and often incorrect. Not to mention the prices - Middle Eastern food (especially vegetarian) is relatively inexpensive to prepare. Whatever they're charging, it's to cover something other than the cost of food... maybe to cover the wages of all the inexperienced staff running around? I suspect that they are often brought in as friends of the family, and thus not judged on the strength of their experience and skills. . . I have sat down never to be brought any table settings, regardless if I was ordering the buffet or not. If I order an entree, I should not have to go to the buffet to get a fork, knife and napkin. . . I've also had bad experiences with getting the waitstaff to split the check, even when we have prearranged things. I had a party of 20 there one evening - two tables of 10, two checks. It shouldn't be that hard. I think we waited about half an hour to get the check back, after witnessing two waitresses going over our bill, scratching their heads and arguing right in front of us.. . Last Sunday I went for the mini-buffet, which I was told by the waitress couldn't be ordered that day. The menu says, "No mini-buffet on Saturdays." After having the manager correct her, I went up to enjoy some delicious falafel, only to find that it wasn't included on the mini-buffet that day. Why? I have no idea. No explanation. Every other time, it has come with it. So I paid $10.95 for pita, hummus, cucumber salad and lentil soup. Hip hip, hooray.. . I won't be returning.
