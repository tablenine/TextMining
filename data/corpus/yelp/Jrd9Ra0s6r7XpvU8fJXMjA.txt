Restaurant: Wasabi
Category: Sushi Bars
I was recently introduced to Wasabi by a few friends one of whom is friends with the owner, As soon as we sat we were greeted by a smaller statured asain man visibly having a great time He was introduced as Nan the owner and that it was his birthday.  He then offered us saki on the house and free beer out of his two birthday kegs of Sapporo!  How many times does an owner say " have as many as you want"  That was the start of a great dinner the place is super clean very well designed and so well priced.  The food was amazing, my favorite was the Tami Wami roll, Lobster salad deep fried.  I cant say enough about the place I have always just grabbed a quick bite at ru's but this is a place to take notice of!
