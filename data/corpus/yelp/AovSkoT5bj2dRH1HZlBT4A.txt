Giant Chunks of Tuna! Any restaurant that has that on the menu (that's not the name of it, but I wanted to make a statement.) is aces in my book. . . I eat sushi a lot and they have some of the freshest fish I've had. And the price isn't so high that I get turned off by it. Great for groups and families. I have also never had to wait really long to get a table. They are very efficient there.
