So I would say this place is good to take friends who are out of towners who don't eat Chicago pizza regularly.  It's not my faveorite pizza, but it's really good chicago style pizza.  The crust is thick yes, but it has this flaky buttery taste to it, that noone else has.  The cheese issss goooood.  Yummy hot stringy cheese that just melts in your mouth.  The sausage tastes homemade.  I would not doubt if they made their own.  The only thing is, if you eat here, just make sure you are ready to wait for a table.  I'm not sure if they take reservations. And the pizza takes a while to cook as well.  So order an app before, so you don't starve to death!  Great place to take out of towners :)
