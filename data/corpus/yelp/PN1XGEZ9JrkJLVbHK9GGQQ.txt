This place is practically an institution in Boys town.  I adore this place inside and out.  For winter days it's lovely to sit in the dark-wooden bistro, but summer is ideal for lingering on the outdoor terrace.  With its fountain, checkered table cloths and garden it's so euro it could have been shipped directly from Provence.  The crepes are magnefique, but perhaps a little steep considering the size of the portions.   There is no bustle about this place, chilled out atmosphere , perfect for a romantic rendevous or intimate dining with friends.
