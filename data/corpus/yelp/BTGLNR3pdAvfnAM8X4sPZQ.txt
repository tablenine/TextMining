This past weekend, a friend and I strolled down to Porto's on a wet cloudy day to enjoy some mighty fine Cuban sandwiches and their friends.. . I normally order the Ham and Cheese on a Croissant sandwich but this weekend I decided to be a bit adventurous and try a different kind of sandwich. Must be the weather.. . I went for the Ropa Vieja Sandwich. . . Oh man.. it was so fucking delish. It was nice to bite down on a warm sandwich sitting outside in the cold wrapped around the warm comfort knowing that I still have 2 potato balls to sink my teeth into.. . Just a quick 2 cents on those potato balls. . . How fucking good are those morsels of heavenly potatoey goodness? MMM MMMM MMMMMMM!!!! As I sit here at my lame job, my mind wanders into a big plastic ball playpen where you see kids swimming in at Chuckee Cheese or something. Except in my version, instead of plastic balls, the playpen is filled with potato balls.. . !!!!. !!!!. !!!!. . fyi, if you are looking for some Tapatio... you gotta pretend like you're looking for some crack or some black tar heroin. It is not out in the open, you have to ask for it real quietly like you're buying drugs on the corner of 4th and Main.. . I LOVE YOU PORTO'S!
