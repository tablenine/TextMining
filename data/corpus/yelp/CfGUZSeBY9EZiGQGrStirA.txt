Damn fine food, and not too long a wait (especially if there are only a couple of you).. . BEWARE the pancakes!!!  Individually, those suckers are effing huge and an order consists of *three*.  Word to the wise - order any pancake as a side (or ask for just one).  I've never seen anyone be able to make a very sizeable dent in the full order and it's just a waste of food.
