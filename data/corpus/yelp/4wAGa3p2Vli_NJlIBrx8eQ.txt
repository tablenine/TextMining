Canter's. Old school, real Jewish Deli. I've got to respect a deli that puts its chopped liver right out there, no embarrassment.  It's open 24/7 and has a separate bar that's open from 10a -1:40a. Gotta love it.  It's got 60's/70's somewhat faux looking paneling, nice large tiled ceiling with  mustard yellow and beige tiles..booths and round booths, tables, nothing fancy. Waitresses that could be either your sweet or no-nonsense grade school teacher. None of this sterile, overpriced, underwhelming Jerry's Famous business, pish posh.  Don't bother there except for the soup.  The soup at Canter's is better!  OMG Chicken Matzo ball soup. Cure all remedy.  Get the Matzo Ball soup-"Mish-Mosh" with Kreplach, Rice and Noodles...love in a bowl.. you'll feel better already.  Smoked salmon (lox) with bagels, cream cheese.  Hot turkey sandwich covered with turkey gravy and tons of mashed potatoes.  Cranberry on the side.  OMG. Knockwurst sandwich.  Hot Corned beef sandwich on rye.  OMG. Potato pancakes (latkes) with sour cream and applesauce.  Yum!. You take your check when done to the register "old school" and don't forget to validate your parking, 2 hrs free with validation. Thank you Canters.  But, don't miss the bakery on the way out.... The bakery is WONDERFUL.  Like another reviewer said, the BEST rugalach I've ever had.  The raspberry and the chocolate rugalach is soooo good.  Wonderful Challah, they have great yellow star cookies with sprinkles, and have a wonderful apple turnover. . If you like deli food, I'd hope you'd love Canter's.  Canter's and Langer's are the best delis in LA and simply a MUST try.
