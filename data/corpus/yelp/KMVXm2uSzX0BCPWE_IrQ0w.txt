Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This place is a must for any prime rib lovers in the area.  I must have been here over 20+ times and every experience has been pleasant.  Make sure you make reservations because this place is always packed and even with reservations you might end up waiting a bit.  Good luck if you do not have reservations ahead of time.  You must arrive at the restaurant with your entire party or you risk losing your reservation.  The moment you enter the restaurant you can enjoy their meatballs in the waiting lounge.  For a reasonable price you enjoy a spinning salad, prime rib, Yorkshire pudding and also you can get creamed corn and/or spinach for a nominal price.  The creamed corn is to die for!  Their prime rib has got to be the best I've tasted but very comparable to House of Prime Rib in San Francisco.  Overall I would rate the Lawry's experience higher though.. . Pros:  Top choice for prime rib lovers!. Cons:  Valet parking only
