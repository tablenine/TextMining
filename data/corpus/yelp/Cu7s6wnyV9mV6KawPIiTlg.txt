I went a few weeks ago, caught up with the truck 'bout midnight in the parking lot of The Brig. Line was NOT as long as I was expecting. Waited about 30 mins. . Ordered the short rib sliders, short rib tacos, and a kimchi quesadilla.. . I didnt care for the kimchi quesadilla, but my girl almost choked, she ate it so fast...the sliders were alright, the tacos.... . OMG!! I'd travel again, have myself an adventure to have some of those tacos again.. . The guy who took our order was SUPER friendly, we let someone get in front of us (gasp) and he actually paid for our food!. We got our food quickly, sat on the hood of my car and grubbed. I'd wait for it again. Its the experience, dont wanna wait? Go to the resturant they have in Culver City.
