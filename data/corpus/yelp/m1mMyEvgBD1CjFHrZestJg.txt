Restaurant: ilili
Category: Middle Eastern
Decor: Excellent. Posh, swanky lounge area and main dining room is wonderfully made -- modern, cool, but still intimate. . . Food: quite possibly some of the best food I've had anywhere, not kidding. Must-try: hummus with pine nuts, lamb kebob (best part of the meal), and the lebanese beignet.. . Drinks: great cocktails. must-try: the margarita (forget the full name)
