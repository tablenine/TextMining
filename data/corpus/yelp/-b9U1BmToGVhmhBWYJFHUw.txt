Have you ever wanted to travel back in time? Well one step into this place and you'll feel you've been transported back to the early 1920s.. . With only counter space surrounding the kitchen area for you to sit, make sure you go here expecting to wait or expecting to be sitting in separate groups (if you came in a big group of people). The walls are covered with plaid wall paper, popular in a time when telephones were newfangled modes of communication. Speaking of newfangled, their register is right out of the teens of the past century, with wooden buttons and a bell that rings the moment it opens. Classic.. . The menu is short and sweet with no more than 10 items on the entire thing. Order a burger, either hickory or some other kind I can't recall, with cheese or not. That's about it. Side of fries with that? Sweet potato or regular? A milk shake, root beer or some other soda? Maybe you'll finish it off with one of their delicious pies, though there are only three to choose from so pick carefully. Notice that the menu gives you the dates of inception of the recipes from the burgers to the pies. You'll be amazed that it still stands up a century, literally a century, later.. . Don't let the simplicity of this place fool you. The burgers are as good as gourmet with an almost sweet taste that melts in your mouth. Add whatever kind of "sauce" you like to it to give it that extra kick. While you may feel you've entered into a time warp your mouth will feel like it's been elevated to heaven with each passing bite of whatever you have in front of you. You'll feel so full by the end you'll wonder how anyone went hungry back in the day. . . Walk back outside with the cars whooshing past and you'll know you've returned to the 21st century but your mouth and belly will be reminiscing for a more simple time.
