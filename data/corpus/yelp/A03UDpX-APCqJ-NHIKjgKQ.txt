Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
This place is awesome!  When my husband said he wanted to go have dinner there I was expected some small, simply decorated cafe with homestyle food.  It is small but the atmosphere is very trendy and cute, with outdoor sidewalk seating and a full bar inside.  . . The food was awesome! I had a salad that was to die for my husband had half a chicken with mashed potatoes, baked beans and macaroni and cheese.  Everything was awesome!. . I will definitely go back as so far this is my favorite restaurant in Hollywood!
