This is by far my favorite sushi spot.  The sushi itself is great but they have this appetizer that just get's my mouth watering the minute I know I'm going there.  . SHITAKE BUTTER YAKI. If you like mushrooms it is a must have.  . I have been going to BYOB's to try and save some money but I'm always drawn back to Bob San.  The prices are not that bad at all.  The new renovations they have done looks great.  I have never had a problem with the service. And the hot saki just puts me in this great mood.  Just talking about it makes me want to go there 2nite! HA!
