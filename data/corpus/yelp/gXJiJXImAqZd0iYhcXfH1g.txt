FRESH FRESH FRESH!. . Gen Sushi has the freshest fish in LA. They specialize in serving nigiri and sashimi, NO rolls. Three of us came here on a Saturday night and the wait was about 45 mins, which was definitely well worth it. We sat at the bar and just began naming off types of fishes we wanted - fatty tuna, hamachi, mackerel, uni and the list goes on. Every type of fish was very fresh and tasty. We also ordered the yellowtail head which came with a lot of meat and cooked very well. . . For 3 people (with beer and sake) the total was about $250. I consider this pretty cheap for the quality of food we received. Will come back for sure!!
