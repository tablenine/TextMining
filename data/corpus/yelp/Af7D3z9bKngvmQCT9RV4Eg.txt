Sometimes the yelp hype machine can make something seem so much better than it actually is. 3.5 stars for me, rounded up. Yeah, the #6 for $10.95 was pretty good and yeah, the garlic lemon sauce was pretty tasty, but it didn't live up to the expectation. Being the picky Asian that I am, I will give mad props to the tasty rice! I could have just eaten the rice all night. The chicken was pretty good. It wasn't amazing. It didn't give me a foodgasm. I didn't make me want to stand up on my chair and moan like Harry Met Sally again. It was good. The paella? It was pretty good. I know Versailles is know for their chicken but there was just too much chicken in there. Give me some more seafood! If we're paying $40 for a plate that serves 2 people, I want some goshdarn seafood. The rare pieces of calamari that we did find were so tender. Mmm mm mm. Tasty.. . Yeah, I guess I would go back. I will say though that the car smelled delicious when we left the club later that night.
