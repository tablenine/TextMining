where's the porK?  i went to alon's the other day for breakfast and was craving an egg sandwich with some sort of meat (typically breakfast meat is pork).  the guy behind the counter looked offended and disgusted that i asked for prosciutto.  seriously people, even some of the jewish delis in nyc sell pork!  i gave this place three stars because they do have the best desserts and bread in town and because it's within walking distance from my house (therefore do not have to deal with the parking).  i do agree with the other yelpers that the service is not always the friendliest.
