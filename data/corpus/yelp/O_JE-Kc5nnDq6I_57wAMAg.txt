Restaurant: Roebling Tea Room
Category: Coffee & Tea
This joint is a fall-back option time after time, and it typically works very well.  . . The food, while plainly that New American/bistro sort that is ever-popular in Williamsburg, is consistently good.  The risotto, the steaks, and chicken are great options.  Brunch is particularly good, with the hearty "drunken beans" option, or a solid bowl of grits.  Brunch's fruit salad and plain yogurt is as refreshing as it is tasty.  And true to its name, the tea menu is dizzying in its length, and tea connoisseurs will approve.. . The decor is a strange melange of antique, country, bistro, you name it - but the antlers and cream-colored wainscoting are charming.  As of late, it's been oddly and exceedingly dim in the evenings, and I'm not sure why.  In warmer weather, the summertime patio in the back is very pleasant.
