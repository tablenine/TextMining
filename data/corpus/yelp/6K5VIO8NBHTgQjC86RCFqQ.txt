Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I don't get it. This stuff isn't authentic Mexican food and I'm not even Mexican and I know that. I don't know. Just like King Taco, I wasn't impressed. It's like Taco Bell, but a little bit better. I guess it's an institution, but last time I went, it wasn't anything special. It was quite bland. Maybe next time I'm starving to death, I'll give them another try. Otherwise, I know millions of other places I'd rather go. Some of them, don't even have walls.
