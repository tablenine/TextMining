I've been to the location on Vegas and in Beverly Hills. I've enjoyed both locations equally. Â CUT is by far one of my favorite steak houses. . . This review will be for the location at Bev Hills. . . DELISH DISHES THAT KEEP ME DROOLING:. - Bone Marrow Flan (TRUST ME, try it!). - Maple Glazed Pork Belly. - U.S.D.A. PRIME, Illinois Corn Fed, Aged 21 Days. Bone In Filet Mignon 16 Oz. - U.S.D.A. PRIME, Illinois Corn Fed, Aged 21 Days. Bone In Rib Eye Steak 20 Oz. - Matsutake Mushrooms with Shiseido Peppers. - Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg. . Everything was as amazing. I brought my own bottle of favorite wine and there was a $35 corkage (worth it). And to top off an wonderful evening, Mr. Wolfgang himself walked around and chatted with every table. . . I want to go back and try out their bar menu.
