It was alright.. . I am no sushi expert, but I'm guessing that if Hispanic people are preparing your sushi, it might not turn out all that Asian. I could be wrong. I tried the California Rolls, and they were pretty standard. My bf and I also tried some teriyaki chicken, and it wasn't all that impressive. He had to ask them to heat it (or reheat it?). . . The sake bombs were awesome, mainly because of the whole place-the-shot-on-the-beer-mug-and-let-it-fall-by- smashing-the-table ritual. That part was fun. The sake didn't really taste all that alcoholic, and we weren't affected (aka we were as sober as a judge.). . The atmosphere screams PARTAY!!! The waiters and waitresses literally start dancing, lip-syncing, and they even dress up as your faves (ex. Michael Bolton). The whole show aspect is fun, unless they embarrass you if it's your birthday and make you dance. On a chair. Luckily, I wasn't embarrassed. ;). . This place is mostly for big groups trying to celebrate any type of occasion. . . Oh, and they kick you out after two hours if you go there for a "show". Beware! :P
