I got take-out from here recently so I can only really comment on the food.  I ordered gyoza from the Japanese menu and cashew chicken from the Thai menu.  . . The gyoza were disappointing - there were only 5 (for $5!), they were pretty small, they lacked flavor and they barely had any meat in them.  The dipping sauce on the side was probably the worst I've had anywhere - it just had way too much vinegar in it.  Small, dull gyoza for a buck each?  No thanks.. . The cashew chicken was decent but I've had better versions of this dish around town.  It was kinda soupy and had a little too much filler (celery? wtf?).  At least they made it very spicy like I asked.  . . Anyway, I'll have to go back for the cheap sushi nights and to try more of the Japanese menu, but I think I'll get Thai food elsewhere.  I feel like other nearby Thai places (Little Bangkok or Thai Chili, for example) have better Thai food for less money.  . . 2.5
