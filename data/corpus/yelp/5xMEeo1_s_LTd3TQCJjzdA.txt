Cheese made of cashew nuts!?  COOOOL!  I am a huge cheese fiend and am learning fast that they are many yummy and just as pleasing cheese substitues and Real Food Daily is one of those places that offer just the thing...  :D. The menu is indeed quite extensive...asian, italian, mexican, soul food....I did know one thing for sure; I was gonna try me some of that melty nacho cashew nut cheese!  After some careful internal deliberation... My lovely vegan friend Rachel helped me decide on their Supreme Burrito.  After all what would go better with my cheesy cheese?!. You also get a side salad and I opted for ceaser.. The burrito was incredible!  Very fresh...And it was loaded with a lot of yummy goodness including tempeh bacon (which added a very interesting flavor &amp; crunch) and a generous amount of  delicious chunky  Avacado!!  So I got my jalapeno cheese, avacado and bacon...without the guilt.... Their menu can be a little pricey for the type of food in general (I've never paid $13 for a burrito...19 with tip!). ..but the portions are large, the foods organic and you will feel very satisfied.
