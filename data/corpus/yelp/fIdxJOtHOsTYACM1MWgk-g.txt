Caught the truck for the first time last week off Wilshire and found myself in a line with a wait about 40 minutes long. Overheard this dude saying he drove all the way from Anaheim to indulge in these tasty fusion tacos...now the 40 minute wait didn't sound too bad considering I didn't drive from another county. Ordered a spicy pork taco, short rib taco, and a kimchee quesadilla. The slaw that topped the tacos were just as savory as the sexy marinated meats. Kimchee quesadilla is simply cheesy Korean goodness. It was so good that I had to head over to Eagle Rock (where the Roja truck was stationed) a few days later to wait in the long line again to devour these tacos. Don't mind the wait, your tastebuds will thank you.
