Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I had to edit from 4 stars to 5 stars.  1 - Cause I just ate their for the second time this week and it was DELICIOUS and 2 - because all these whiny little 1 star people don't get it. It never claims to be authentic and never claims to be gourmet cuisine. Some of these people are SO bitter.  Anyway, read on.... . OK. It's not authentic and the lines are long and the first time I went I didn't like the tacos OR the chips or the salsa.  But the 2nd time you think "Hmm, it's not that bad."  Then the third time you think "OK. It's not very good but I really like this salsa/ gazpacho stuff"  and by about the 4th time you realize they put crack in their burritos and tacos to make sure you keep coming back. . . And you're a little sad that you've become a crack addict but you keep going there a few times a week to eat their deep fried tacos WITH CHEESE. ALWAYS WITH CHEESE.  And you not only resign yourself to the fact that you now love their food, but you praise the fact that you can walk there in about 3 minutes. . . Mmmmm
