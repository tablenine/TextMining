Man, that hostess was a BIATCH...  She acted like she was a bouncer at a really hot club and we were the peons trying to get in.  I could imagine her thinking in her head "Do you have any idea how many famous people I've sat?!!!" or "I'm best friends with Paris Hilton's publicist's ex-girlfriend!  That makes me somehow better than you!"  Her superiority complex was quite amusing.. . If you can make it past the delightful young woman at the front, Toast is pretty awesome--because, let's face it--it all boils down to the food--and toast has a great menu and a great bakery as well.  Plus, they serve breakfast ALL DAY!  . . The french toast was airy and light and tasted like donuts or cake.  The coconut macaroon dipped in chocolate was ginormous, and tasted just about perfect.  The lentil soup was fantastic and so evidently homemade from great ingredients.  Their sweet potato fries are a cut above--probably the best sweet potato fries around--they are fried crispy but not greasy and pair nicely with the ranch dressing.  They use real sliced turkey in their turkey sandwich.  The sandwiches are definitely *toasted* which always makes them better in my book.  And for the piece de resistance:  BLUE VELVET CAKE/CUPCAKES. WTF?  How did I not know about this stuff?  I thought I was a red velvet expert--but blue velvet--how deliciously yummy is that?!  Try it, I say!  . . A great way to spend lunch al fresco on a Friday afternoon to see and be seen.  You, too, will glance at the pretty and funkily dressed patrons and say to yourself "Don't you have JOBS people?!"
