It was hot and we wanted something light, so my friend drove me to Porto's.  She loves their cesar salad, eh, i tasted it, it was ok.  but i'm not a big cesar salad fan.  . . I got the veggie sandwich which comes with a side of banana chips.  The sandwich was slightly greasy for a veggie sandwich, but i realized the grease was likely from the roasted red peppers which, unfortunately, makes up a bulk of the sandwich.  . . Overall my sandwich was tasty.  Unfortunately, i didn't try the pastries there that time, but next time....
