Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
I've only ever ordered take out from Butterfly but it's always good.  At my office we order the sushi if we want to have a more special lunch, like for someone's birthday and it's always beautiful. The sushi is fresh and delicious...we've tried almost every single roll.  The only one we weren't crazy about was the Samurai Maki but we like everything else.. We also order Thai from there and I like it just as well as our other regular spot Manhee Thai.  We'll definitely keep ordering from them.
