Good down home cookin'. Well not my home, but you know what I mean. I mean this place has got some grub for that diabetes! Macaroni and Cheese, Greens, Cornbread, Fried Chicken, Potatoes, grease, lard, love. If Lenchitas married Roscoe they would procreate and have the cutest most delicious babies on the planet.. The wait can get ugly so be prepared. The place isn't fancy, it's cozy and it's small, but it's awesome. go.
