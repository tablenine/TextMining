I just had desserts here! I was totally floored by the fantastic display. I ordered a napolean and Â the straciatella gelato (chocolate and vanilla).. Baked and layered crunchy paper thin pastry sheets with a finely sweetened vanilla creme, and topped with a brown buttered carmel with chocolate drizzle.. . Service was spectacular. The gentleman at the counter was very friendly and quite knowlegable. . I would highly recommend this location!!!!!!
