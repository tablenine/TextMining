This place is ok... but after going to Katz Deli in NYC, this place can't even compare... even tho the price is about the same.. . We ordered a Pastrami Sandwich and a Philly Cheese steak (This was what we ordered at Katz Deli... we were subconsciously ordering the same thing to compare with Katz)  Their Philly Cheese steak was better than Katz.  The "steak" tasted SO good... I just wish it wasn't so expensive!. . Pastrami sandwich was pretty good too. It was definitely tasty but not $15 tasty.. . I may come back here again if I crave a good phillycheese steak since it is so close to my bf's house.  But I'll have to remember that this place is PRICEY!!
