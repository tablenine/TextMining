I really liked Calo!  Went at about 9 pm on Saturday night and only had to wait about 5 minutes!  Very nice interior, good woodwork, roomy booths, and moldings were a nice touch to the perfectly lit environment.  . . I ordered a Caesar salad and it was very good.  Got the dressing on the side, and I must say, one of the best caesar dressings i've had....not too parmesan-y.  . . Wasn't very hungry so I had baked clams as my entree.  Very good!!!!. . My only upset was that Calo does not offer Moscato by the glass.  I was pretty disappointed, but had an overall nice experience here.  Will definitely come again to see what all the hype is about over the pizza!
