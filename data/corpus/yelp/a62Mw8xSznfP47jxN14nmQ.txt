After all these years, I finally walk into Sushi Gen.  Tried it for lunch, must return to check out dinner.  The four stars are mostly for the great value for the price.. . Got the $15 sashimi lunch.  They give you lots of raw fish!  The three different cuts of tuna sashimi were ok, not much flavor, and the sliced tuna was icebox cold, really cold--not a good thing.  The yellowtail was nice.  There was also squid sashimi, spicy tuna, and some cooked items.  Plus miso soup and rice.  Lots of good (not excellent) fresh fish, a great value.
