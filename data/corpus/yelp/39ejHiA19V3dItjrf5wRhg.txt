This place is crazy. The decor inside makes it feel as if I were in Las Vegas or something. Huge pillars, bright colors, murals, flat screen TVs. What? The service is also very good, considering it's in Koreatown (and I, for one, am not Korean). . . But really, let's cut to the chase. The specialty pizzas are amazing. And yes, Potato Gold makes everything here worthwhile. I haven't even really been able to try to order anything else because Potato Gold is such a sure bet. Sweet Potato in the crust murders me everytime. It's like an entire meal in each slice of pizza. This is one of those things that does live up to the hype.. . The appetizers are another story. Hit and miss for most. From what I recall, the french onion soup was pretty good. As were the potato wedges with the sour cream dollop in them. The calamari was definately not up to par...Who's really going to order all these appetizers anyway when you have half the kitchen already on the pizza anyway?
