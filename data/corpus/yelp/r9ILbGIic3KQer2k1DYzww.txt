stumbled into this place late last night and based on the people out front and the atmosphere we expected the menu to be a bit more progressive. the menu was ok but had the typical asian fare i felt like i could get anywhere. they had just one maki selection which i thought was odd. why not a few more. i can think of other fusion places that have alot more fusion.the $5 corkage fee was nice because the wine and beer selection was too minimal. our server was ok. he was a little cold and short with us but prompt enough. the female server was sexy. the white girl with the short hair. i wish we had her.
