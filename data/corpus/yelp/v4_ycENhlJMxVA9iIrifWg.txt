Category: Japanese
Welcome random mealers. Six brave warriors set out to conquer the Wall of Bravery for the toughest random meal of the day assignment yet. We faced the Orochon special #2 (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). This "bowl of death" knocked out our first warrior before the battle even commenced as he only choose the spicy #2 (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). This leaves us five warriors to charge into the battle.. . I was the first to taste the special #2. This nearly knocked me out and I knew that for me the battle was nearly over as I stared into the ginormous bowl of Orochon ramen consisting of 6 scoops of a diabolical spice blend and freshly chopped jalapenos for a full 5 minutes. As the battle raged on for the four remaining warriors, two were knocked out after drinking 5 large glasses of water each. This left two remaining warriors, but it quickly dwindled down to one as this warrior decided to drink the jalapenos whole with the soup and was swiftly knocked out. The final lone warrior put up a gallant fight and presented to the Orochon Wall of Bravery Gatekeeper with his empty bowl...but tragedy stuck as the gatekeeper uttered "3 minutes over". . . With those 3 little words our party failed in our epic battle to become immortalized on the wall of bravery. So close to victory but yet so far away. As we departed heartbroken we vowed to come back and fight another day as we may have lost today's battle but we did not yet lose the war. We will train and with perseverance we will defeat the Orochon special number 2 and gain immortality on the Wall of Bravery.
