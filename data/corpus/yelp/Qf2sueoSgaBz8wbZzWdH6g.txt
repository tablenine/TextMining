Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I took my friend here with me the other day.  Joseph is so nice he let us in  even though they were already closed and locking up the gate.  He even hooked us up with the extra fish, because we were the last ones there.  6 different salsas and one magic creme.  I believe the magic creme is something like sour cream.  Yummmmmy  . . $1.50 for fish and $2.00 for shrimp. As much salsa as you want !
