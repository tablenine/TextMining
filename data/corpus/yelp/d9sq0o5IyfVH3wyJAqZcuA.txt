Another shining example of perfectly mediocre food in that long illustrious list of bad Chinese and Asian food in Wicker Park. This has been a problem that has nagged me for over 9 months now. How can you not have either one of *one* good Thai, Chinese or Indian place in all of Wicker Park? I'm not asking for all three. Just one. Any one.. I have no horror stories here. The food is never bad. Just completely, make-me-miss-my-own-cooking kind of unremarkable. It's a pity, really.
