Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is amazing. It's a Hollywood and LA staple, a must visit. The hot dogs and food are amazing. The menu is vast, the combinations are endless and almost overwhelming. And they have something for everyone, beef hot dogs, turkey dogs, even a vegan option.. . Doing a review of a hot dog that has been there for over 50 years and has a near god like reputation seems silly to me, but I have to give credit where credit is due. My only complaint is that it's such a long drive from home (Phoenix).
