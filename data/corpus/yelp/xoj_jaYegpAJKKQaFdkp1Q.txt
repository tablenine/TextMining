Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I seriously can't get enough of this place, it is a prime example of the way restaurants should be run...highlights:. . 1) the service: one word, phenominal...plates were taken away and replaced, drinks were never more than half empty, and we were constantly asked if there was anything else we needed in a very unobtrusive way...even the "gaucho" men with their food asked if we wanted any cut in particular.... . 2) the meat was hit or miss at times, but it was ok at its worse and orgasmic at its best...the filet was to die for, even wrapped in bacon...I always liked the sausage, and the top sirloin was great...another highlight was the house special, one serving at the beginning of the meal was just ok, but the second, when it was fresh off the spit, was TO DIE FOR.... . 3) I went for my birthday and, without even mentioning it overtly to our server, I was presented a b-day flan on the house...not necessary, but just a sign that the restaurant is out to please its customers.... . Some people (especially vegetarians or the like) would not be a fan, but it's all you can eat and a prime example of the type of place you have to at least check out once in your life just to try it...a bit pricy, but worth the annual/semi annual trip :)...
