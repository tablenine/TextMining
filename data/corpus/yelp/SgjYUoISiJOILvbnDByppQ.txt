Restaurant: Noni&#39;s Bar &amp; Deli
Category: Italian
Balls! If you were looking for the sketchy convenient store on the corner of Edgewood and Crackville streets, just east of the connector,  but swung two doors wide, you'd find Noni Italian Deli and Bar.  . . A true ghetto oasis. I must admit I'm biased towards anything trying this hard to succeed, especially in my own hood. I must also admit the homemade Tagliatelle with Pancetta cream sauce and a side of local fennel sausage was top notch (and homemade). Dinner companions had different versions of the pasta and everyone was satisfied completely.  Dinner for 4 with bottle of wine and extra drinks was fairly priced. . . Wine list was pretty much all Italian and very well thought out, keeping in mind both value (Stella Sangiovese can be bought at Green's for a retail of around 7 bucks a bottle, even still, at $6 well worth it even by the glass) and variety (Costamolino Argiolas white wine made from a fairly indigenous blend of Italian grapes, really good too if you're splitting a bottle).. . Bottom line... I wish these guys luck. Although trouble is around the corner, they've been able to build out a neat little spot that is way ahead of the curve of Edgewood... Coincidentally the sketchy convenient store is more active during my  (5am) trips to the airport than it was during the evening we went. . . Rear parking is available off of Edgewood (get in there via alley like entrance just west of front door) and recommended.
