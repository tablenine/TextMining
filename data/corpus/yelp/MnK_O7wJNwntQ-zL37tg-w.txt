Matt's birthday party was here this year, and, let me just say, this is a great place for a party. We started out at the bar area, which was very comfy, and waited there until our table was ready. The drinks were good, and the chairs were comfy. The only problem was that I was sure that our waitress's shirt was going to fall off. But, that was the problem with all the cocktail waitresses: their shirts seemed to be battling gravity, and gravity was winning.... . Our food was awesome. Everything that we ordered was good. Our waitress was on the ball, and helped us out with the menu, gave us great advice and provided excellent service. . . The whole meal was pretty pricey, but you're paying for a lot of ambiance... a club-like atmosphere, geishas walking around, gravity-defying tops, hollywood, you get the picture. It was a fun time, though, kind of like a theme park for adults that was themed around geishas.
