Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Dunlays is only a few blocks from me so its always a safe bet when i want a good meal.  The wait staff is always polite and attentive.  A Cubs tattoo is a big plus in my book.  The menu isn't huge..which I actually like in a restaurant.  Beware of menus that are 4 pages long!  The food is probably all sitting in a freezer.  I like to order the burger, and for brunch the Dunz Omelette with potatoes.  I think the secret is gouda and provolone in them.  Its a good place for a laid back night of good food and drinks with friends.
