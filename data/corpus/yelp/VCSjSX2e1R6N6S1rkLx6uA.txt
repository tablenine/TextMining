I love coming here. Their food is clean and fresh. You should try their pizza...it's thin crust with fresh mozzarella! Also, if you don't have time to sit and eat there, try browsing through their little gourmet market...I picked up their fried chicken, Thai Shrimp Noodle Salad, and Brownies...All were delicious, it was a bit pricey but worth every penny!!
