met some friends for a sat brunch. it was delicious!!!!! i'd give it 5 stars instead of my 4 1/2 but i was frying under the sun in their patio seating. however, it was probably the hottest weekend in LA in a long long time. i had the grits as a side with my chorizo omelet. heavenly! my friend's potato salad was excellent too. i hear that the french toast can become too sweet if you order just that but i'd go back for brunch in a jiffy. i appreciated that their ice coffee was still strong despite my ice melting in about 3.8 seconds.
