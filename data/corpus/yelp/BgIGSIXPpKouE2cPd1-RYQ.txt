This place serves up some tasty kabobs. I love the atmosphere and the voluptuous belly dancers on set nights.  Opt for floor seating, that's where all the action is on the weekends.  It gets packed early so plan on waiting awhile.  . . Order up a round of Efes Turkish Beer and ask for their special spicy sauce and dollop on their moist kabobs and enjoy!
