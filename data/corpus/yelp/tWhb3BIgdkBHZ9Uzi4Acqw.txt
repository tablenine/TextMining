Ew.  I can't believe the good reviews this place is getting.  First of all, if a TGIFridays menu and the Cartoon Network mated, they would produce these menus as offspring.  Seriously ridiculous.. . What you order off of the menu isn't much better.  Sure, it's reasonably priced for seafood and the portions are enormous, but what you get is a whole fish (head and all) that is bland and overcooked, along with a huge plate of over steamed, wilted vegetables.  Do NOT order the frozen margaritas- ours arrived in a frightening shade of neon green and didn't taste much better than they looked.. . I should acknowledge that the service was decent, as were the refried beans and shrimp.   Also, I have to say, a giant pirate statue can make any gross meal just a little bit better.
