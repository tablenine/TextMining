Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
Well, if you didn't know this place was on the Food Network, you will after seeing the big picture with Guy Fieri just inside the door.  And then the owner points out another picture printed on the menu during his friendly welcome speech.. . The food was solid.  The two things that stand out most are the bread used for their cemitas and their various sauces.  I had the cemita with carne asada and also half of a cemita with shredded chicken.  Flavorful meats, stringy cheese, and two types of sauce packed between a crispy sesame bun.  It was delicious.  I also appreciated the tortillas-soaked-in-salsa goodness of the chalupas.  Their horchata was average.  The service was awesome -- everyone there was very friendly.. . If you come in ignoring the hype, you'll find well-priced, quality Mexican food with great service.  Sweet place.
