Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
There's plenty of burgers available here in LA, for all tastes, and all wallet sizes.  I remain a fan of The Apple Pan because it consistently delivers a great, fresh burger.  If you're looking for the "see it, be it" crowd, then this is not the place; The Apple Pan is pure nuts and bolts.  . . It starts with you seating yourself at the first available counter seat (no one will bother waiting on you and don't get any funny ideas that  they're gonna even motion to seat you).  The waiters have been the same ever since I've been going there, and they expect you to know your order (think Soup Nazi from Seinfeld).  So brush up on their menu (it's not a very complex one) beforehand, or else Mr. Waiter will look at you with slight disdain.  Well actually, he'll look at you with slight disdain, regardless.. . Out of the two burger selections, I'm a fan of the Hickory Burger, with Cheese.  And an order of fries, with a root beer.  The fries arrive first, sometimes overly-crispy due to a little too much time frying.  Tasty nonetheless.  Mr. Waiter puts out a small paper plate and dollops some ketchup on there for me to dip.  Then my burger arrives, wrapped in simple white paper.  I've never been able to figure out quite what makes this a taste sensation, but my primitive senses are wowed by the melted cheese, hot burger, hickory sauce, and the texture of cold, crisp, thick lettuce.  Always.. . This is not a hang-out joint.  You sit, order, eat, pay, and leave.  Don't expect to get chummy with Mr. Waiter.  Personally, I've been in and out of this place in 15 minutes flat.  But happy each time.. . p.s. I've heard the pies are good.  Personally, I never had room in my stomach for more.
