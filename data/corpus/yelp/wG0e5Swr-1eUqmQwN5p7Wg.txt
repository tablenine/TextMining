In Torrance, got there at 6 - the truck wasn't there til over 15 minutes later.. from where I was standing [I don't know how to estimate the number of people haha] got to the front around 8.. 815.. the person [or set] in front of me order 6 different orders! So when I went up, I had to wait another 10-15 minutes until my order was taken.. . Got the short rib burrito, pork and chicken taco [to try all the meats] - shoulda gotten tofu too.. . Anyway, it's a unique taste.. but SO not worth the 2+ hour wait!! Burrito = $5, somewhat small. Enjoyed the first half of it because I was eatting the short rib whatever but during the second half, IT WAS ALL MUSH! I don't know what the mush is... . As for the tacos, I didn't eat them until I got home less than an hour later but they were okay. I just ate the meat and tossed the tortilla because portions of it dried out [not their fault]. Chicken was bleh, but the pork was nice and flavorful. I wonder how the tofu tastes like. I'm not going back ever because it's not worth SUCH a long wait. I will I know it's be less than.. mm 20 minutes? wait.. . So much rave and what not.. totally did not impress me. I'd rather pay to eat AYCE kbbq than wait in line for a quite small burrito [didn't fill me up, very disappointing]. I'd go again if the meat was more evenly spreaded or fairly spreaded [maybe they are going cheap?] and if they are more available = shorter lines.
