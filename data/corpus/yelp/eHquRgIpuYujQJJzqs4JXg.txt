I had no idea that vegetarian food could taste this good!!. . I got the "Grillin' Chickin" sandwich which was their grilled chillin' chicken (veggie protein patty), lettuce, avocado, red onions, tomato, cilantro pesto, and chipotle ranch on a wheat bun, and got the Sweetheart Fries (sweet potato fries) as a side. mmm mmm MMM it was sooo good! The "chicken" patty was so soft and juicy and it tasted just like real chicken! And all the tastes and flavors blended so well in my mouth. I devoured the whole sandwich in 5 minutes. The fries were also pretty good but not the addicting kind of good that I usually expect from sweet potato fries.. . My friend got the Papa's Portobello burger and hers was delicious as well! If you're a mushroom fan, get this.. . They also have really refreshing and yummy peach white iced tea! It may be a little too sweet for some people but to me, it was perfect.. . If I ever decide to become a vegetarian, I know where I'll be eating 3 times a week!
