Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I have to thank my lucky stars that I live within walking distance of this amazing place.  The cafe has an adorable outdoor patio, with lots of tables all over the place.  No matter what time of day it is, nearly all of those tables are taken.  I love that lively atmosphere; it makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.  The building itself is cozy and cute.  It has a handwritten beverage menu up on the wall, with delicious drinks like mint mocha and Strawberry Fields.  I've had breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert here (not all in the same day, mind you), and I can confidently say that the Alcove is perfect for all meals.  I generally tend to come for dessert with friends -- the cakes are a bit pricey but absolutely scrumptious.  Another thing that really distinguishes the Alcove and makes me love it even more is the table in the back room that has its drawers stuffed to the brim with notes.  People leave everything from love notes, angry notes, philosophical meanderings on the back of a receipt from Albertson's, and New Year's resolutions scribbled on napkins.  This is one of the ways that the Alcove highlights the diversity of Los Feliz and reflects the unique nature of this neighborhood that I'm proud to call home.
