Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
Call me crazy, but outside of the general hipness of this place, the food wasn't amazing.  . . As stated in other reviews, Grindhouse is located in the Sweet Auburn Market, which in general a pretty cool place.  There was a line for Grindhouse which in my mind is typically a great sign.  There is very little counter space, so you may find yourself hovering for a spot to sit down, otherwise, take your food and sit at the tables on the other end of the market.  It didn't take too long to receive our food.. . I figured I'd try the signature, Grindhouse Style burger.  The beef was overcooked, the toppings tasted washed out.  And it seemed to be missing any seasoning.  No salt on the counter, so I didn't add any of my own seasoning.  The crinkle cut fries are my favorite, so they were yummy.  The potato roll is always a winner.  It reminded me of the Martin's brand potato rolls, which are absolutely the most amazing buns for burgers.  Which are next to impossible to find in ATL, WTF?. . Pricing was a bit high for a quarter pound patty.  Make it a combo for $2.50 more.. . I don't really see myself returning here for a burger.  The area is sketchy in general and the homeless person who felt the dollar I gave him in mixed change wasn't enough, is a certain to be a deterrent for me.  I think I'll stick with Manuel's Tavern, mmm, charred yummy goodness. . .  I think this place still leaves me in pursuit to find the best burger in town.
