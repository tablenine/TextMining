My boyfriend and I went here for Friday night drinks and the place was hoppin' !  We went there for the "tachos" and some mighty delicious liquor.  I tried out their bloody mary which was spicy as heck but quite delicious and then finished off with their peach inspired martini.  Love the outdoor patio area and even though the music is a bit too loud, it's much quieter if you sit outside.
