I have a very obnoxius friend from Shanghai who claims to be a xiao long bao expert *roll eyes*. He and I are always bickering about something let it be about food, where to go, whatever, you name it. We argue just to argue (yeah.. odd friendship, i know). Anyway, we were in LA one weekend and he decided to take me here to try their XLB. I was skeptical only because it was his idea and he did all the ordering. In about 10 minutes, the first batch of XLB came. I took my first bite and i was in awe.The skin was thin, the meat was loose and tender oozing all the good soupy stuff... it was everything he had described. They were little pieces of heaven in my mouth. For the first time, i did not argue with him... well it only lasted about 5 minutes because we then started to fight over the remaining dumplings left in the bamboo batch.
