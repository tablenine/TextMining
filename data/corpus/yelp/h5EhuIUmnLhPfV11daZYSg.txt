This is one of the most popular Sushi restaurants in downtown L.A. as can be seen by the number of people waiting in line before the doors open for lunch and the number of people waiting outside after they put their name on the waiting list.  The biggest reason for their popularity at lunch is the Sashimi special.  The Sashimi special includes mixture of fresh sashimi and cooked fish, rice, miso soup, tsukemono (pickled cabbage), seasoned tofu dish and pickled seaweed and cucumber.  What makes this different from the other Sushi places is that they give you plenty of fresh sashimi at a reasonable price.  The sashimi special will fill you up for under $18 including tax and tip.  We typically go there about 15 minutes before it opens (it opens at 11:15 a.m.) and if you order the Sashimi special, you will be served within 10 to 15 minutes.
