The following review was written by my boyfriend in my "voice", making fun of me and my yelptastic ways as we were sitting in Canter's together at 5am.  Enjoy :). . Firemen (so hot), police men (no comment), teachers, doctors, soldiers - Things we normally associate with heroism.. . I'm excited to report that this morning I was pleasantly surprised by the most uncommon of heroes.. . Stranded in the concrete jungle of LA, finding myself inhumanely awake at 430am and STARVING, I fought through blackberry's crap internet experience to find the only thing open at this hour was Canter's Deli in West Los Angeles. Much to the chagrin of my "date", we made the brave move of putting ourselves in the position of having to drive back west in rush hour traffic. Said "date" only whined 72 times on the way to the joint, and 23 times during his first cup of coffee.. . Okay, so you get the picture. I'm a damsel in distress. The only thing that could rescue me at this point?  Canter's potato cakes - the recipe for which I'm beginning to suspect was written on the same tablets God gave to Moses so many years ago.  This tightly guarded secret, known only to the faithful patrons of this always-open diner, were more than good.  They were my "bread of life" - my hero.. . (Blah blah blah observations about the ingredients/adjectives for the food, the waitstaff, etc, etc...). . From the cheery, eccentric waiter to sitting at the counter side by side, to the bizare "fall leaves" ceiling tile that requires an LSD tab to fully appreciate...Canter's is, if not worth the drive going back in traffic, a totally great "experience".  Even whiny/grumpy "date" was smiling by the end...
