I'm no Pastrami fan by any means but when I saw this place had 200+ reviews, well my man I hoped in the car and headed on up to Culver City to check out the hype.. . Johnnies is tucked away on Sepulveda and will flash right by you if you're not on the lookout however easier directions should state that it's located on the same block as Tito's, go figure.... . So I park, walk in, see "CASH ONLY", go to ATM, remove cash and then sit down at the how do I say it, SMALL bar and open up a menu (let's just say that if your're over 6 feet tall, opt for a booth otherwise your knees will be killing you).. . No decision here, original pastrami is what I read about so dammit, that's what I'm having!!! ..... with a diet coke, I need to watch my figure too :) . . 5 Minutes go by and out comes this GIANT pastrami sandwich ("thank GOD I didn't order fries!" I thought) . . It was delicious, absolutely delicious, the pastrami seemed to melt in your mouth and the bread was spot on, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. . . To top it all off was the dill pickles and hot mustard served on the side, let's just say my fat ass ate the whole thing, then cursed at myself later on for overeating.. . I'll be back, but just as a heads up, split a sandwich with someone, you'll save some bucks and an angry stomach.
