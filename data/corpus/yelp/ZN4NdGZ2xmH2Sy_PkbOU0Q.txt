When I visited this restaurant on New Year's Eve for dinner, I couldn't believe all the bad reviews I had a read beforehand. This place was so great! My date and I had a gift certificate so we had some room to splurge, but I agree with other reviews, this place can get a little pricey. For appetizers, we had the crab cake and lobster rolls.. So tasty and delicious. My date had the Surf and Turf and I had the Diver Scallops, both fantastic. Our waitress came over a total of 5 times, but I did not mind at all. I don't like to be constantly bothered while I'm eating, however, she was still very nice, polite. The service was prompt.
