I don't even know if I need to add my review to the mix of a world famous breakfast house.. . Imagine heaven is made out of pancakes. Then you get to eat it with syrup. . . Enough said. It's good, always full of people and you won't regret the meal. Food can take awhile, seating may be tough and the servers aren't rude they just have a ton of tables to take care of. . . It's a great experience and a fabulous meal. Enjoy!
