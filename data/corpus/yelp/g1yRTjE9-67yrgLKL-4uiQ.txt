I have this problem, you see. When I see a place with more than 1000 reviews, something bigger than my appetite overcomes me. I am the hawk and this was my prey. So, who cares if i have to sit in traffic for an hour and a half to get here? Who cares if i have to pay for Little Tokyo parking after wasting all that gas? Oh, a one hour wait at 9PM on Thanksgiving eve? Sure. This place was the reason people started using the phrase, "it's definitely worth the wait.". . They only offer one soy-sauce based broth which is made by soaking pork bones to add a deeper, richer flavor. The noodles held such a great texture and freshness and atop was a heap of green onions adjacent to a slice or pork and marinated egg. The whole entree held items that were ALL very unique and so so savory!  The Shredded Pork Bowl is what really set this meal aside. Anyone who decides to put your stomach through short term misery by starving like an idiot [Chhyah, stupid. *looks other way*], can divert that pain by simply ordering this dish. The pork was like BUTTER! BUTTER, I TELL YOU! These two dishes were such the perfect combo to please a hungry stomach. . .  It really upsets me that i'll have to wait in line for it again since they do not allow take-outs due to their never-ending waitlist demands, but  i suppose nothing good ever comes easy. SOB.
