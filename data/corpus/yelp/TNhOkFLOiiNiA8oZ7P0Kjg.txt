Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I love this dumpling house, it is so good!  This place rocks my tummy out! Been there twice and every time....... same reaction...... I am blown away! I went with my hubby by mistake once and then with my bro and hubby the second and both times it was awesome!  Close to a real dumpling experience per my bro, who's been to China.  He said it brought him back, WOW!  What a compliment! We shared a table because it was ultra full and went to town on the menu.... my fave was juicy pork dumpling!  Dumplings with a soupy suprise when you bite into them...... yummo!  I love the fried rice and the wonton soup as well.  I rolled out of there full...... it was great! Helpful staff and attentive!  I would definitly tell all my friends, heck, I'd probably join them if the went! Bottom line...... I am confident to say........ I would recommend this place to you.........!
