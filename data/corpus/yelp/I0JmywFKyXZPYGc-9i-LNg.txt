absolutely get the garlic eggplant and tofu. i don't care if you want something meaty - this is delicious, and it's good for you.. scratch that, go on tuesday and pay $8.95 for a $20 tenderloin entree. and take me with you. i'll bring the wine. can we go at 6 please?. (secret decoder ring says: all entrees are $8.95 on tuesday night, it's byob, and there's gonna be a wait)
