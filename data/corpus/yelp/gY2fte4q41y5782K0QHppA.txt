For me the best ramen in LA can be found here.  . . The broth is savory without being overly heavy.  The noodles have a decent firmness, I think I would prefer it just a touch harder.  . . The real standout here is the chashu which comes from Kurobota (Berkshire) pig stock.  The meat is so flavorful, fatty, and tender; it redefines chashu for me.. . Go on sunday for a late night treat as Daikokuya is open from "12:00PM - until the soup is gone"
