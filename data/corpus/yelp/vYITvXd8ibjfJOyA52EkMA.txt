Only reason why we came here was cuz I bought a coupon from . http://restaurant.com. . We came here half expecting this place to be completely overrated. However, we were proven wrong. Everything we tried here was delicious. The boys for 'Surf &amp; Turf' roll.... I have never seen two grown men be silenced by a mean. . . I love the decor inside, it totally screams me. Since we had the coupon it makes the place more affordable. Can't wait to go back.
