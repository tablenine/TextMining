We used a Groupon here last night.  The food was just ok.  My dish and my husbands were huge but the other couple we were with both orders dishes that were much smaller...made no sense.  We had some spicy chicken dish and kung pao beef.  I like my chinese food to have some veggies in it...these had none.  . . It's pretty expensive for what you get.  Our server seemed more like a car salesman than a waiter.  Honestly, when I want "fancy chinese" I'd rather go to PF Changs.  I don't think I'll be back here.
