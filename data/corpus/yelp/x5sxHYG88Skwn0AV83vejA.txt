Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I came to Johnny's with a few hungry yelpers after hunting down the Coolhaus Ice Cream Truck. What can I say, we like to do dessert first.. . It was on of those really awesome California nights, where it's not to cold nor too hot, so we decided to sit in the patio near the fire pit. I ended up splitting an original pastrami sandwich with a side of chili cheese fries and an ice tea. My pastrami was good, not amazing but not horrible either. Â I was expecting a bit more from the chili cheese fries. But looking around the patio, I noticed that everyone seemed to get onion rings instead, so maybe that's where we went wrong. . . Our server was this really nice older lady, who kept checking up on us. She was totally one of those older breeds of servers, who like to call you "honey.". . I'd totally go back and give this place another try. If not for the food, then for the funky signs they have hanging through the restaurant.
