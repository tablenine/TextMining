Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
I've been working just down the street from Medici, and I'm in the place once a week for the restaurant and twice a week for the bakery/coffee shop. It's all good.. . I have to give a special recognition to Medici's chilli. It's good, really thick and hearty. And it's reasonably priced, while some items on the menu strike me as overpriced. . . I've gone to Medici with a weekend group of friends, and we have all enjoyed the experience. Medici is a fine place.
