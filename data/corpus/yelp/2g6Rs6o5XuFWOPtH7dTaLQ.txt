I thought this place was actually just some fancy-smancy coffee shop which featured above average acoustic guitar players...luckily I was way off. I ended up here twice in one weekend, the first hanging out with some cool kids I worked with while being "non-profit boy". I was only thinking we'd meet up for coffee, maybe whatever snacks they had to offer, but UC offers some great options, and the kids jumped all over it! The prices weren't outrageous so I was able to cover all of our lunch, which always works, plus the kids absolutely loved their sandwiches. I next ended up here later with a friend from Milwaukee who was celebrating her (our) birthday. She said she had never been to a place quite like UC and their drink options were incredible. Pretty cool.. . Since I work right by this place I think I'll actually start making it my first coffee option, instead of the over-priced trip to Starbucks.
