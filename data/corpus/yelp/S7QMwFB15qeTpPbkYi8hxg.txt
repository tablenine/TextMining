Category: Italian
The atmosphere is really great. I love the exposed brick, the lighting in the bar, the little hidden patio. The wine is high quality at a nice price. My dinner of the Tuscan and side Caesar was right on. The sandwich was not greasy and the veggies were cooked to perfection. My friends lasagna was a little lackluster. I am not one for lasagna anyway but neither of us found it very good. . The clientele was varied, lots of GA State students waiting for the band to play, a few couples getting an after work drink, some gay some strait, some emo some business. . All in all a pretty cool hang out.
