Fantastic! One of my best friends is training here and treated me and my bf to dinner last night and all I can say is that I was blown away-impressed by this place. Maybe because I'm not familiar with Hillstone or steakhoses in general but I was totally not expecting such great service, ambience, and top notch food. . . Portions here are HUGE.. I cannot emphasize this anymore. For the three of us, this is what we ordered:. - Carmelized Onion Soup -- pretty mush your typical french onion. - Spinach &amp; Artichoke Dip -- the dip is so full of flavor that you want to melt after taking a bite. big plus, they serve it alongside salsa and sourcream so you can ease your palette after taking one too many bites of heavy artichoke dip. - Chicken Ceasar Salad with Avocados -- friend ordered it and it looked delicious but I didn't try it. - Salmon Market Fresh Fish with Red Cabbage -- OMG the fish looked and tasted phenomenal and the cabbage was beyond yummy. I had to stop myself from eating. - Filet with Butter Brusell Sprouts -- bf loved this cut esp because it was cooked to perfection and was lean. . All in all, this place was really delightful and even more so because our friend treated us out. Will definitely come by if I'm in the neighborhood :)
