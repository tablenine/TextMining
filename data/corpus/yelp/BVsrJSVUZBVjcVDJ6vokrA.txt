This place has delicious food for reasonable prices. YUM YUM. The BBQ Pulled Pork is tender and juicy. I wish it had more BBQ sauce in it, but the meat itself was moist and tender. THe fries were extra crunchy, and the white sauce that it came with was delicious. It add something extra to it. There's also a peanut butter and jelly muffin, OH MAH GOODNESS! CREATIVE! The icing on top was peanut butter, and the jelly was in the middle of the muffin. SCRUMPTIOUS. And I never get dessert! (I'm more of a chips and fries kind of gal.) It's good food, I just wish the sandwich had some more flavor.
