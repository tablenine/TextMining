Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Flavorful, hardy, healthy food.  What more could you want?. . The thick, savory vegetable soup is a blend of 14 different veggies and is consistantly wonderful!  And their Chicken dinner with mashed potatoes is amazing. They also know how to prepare and grille vegetables (unlike a lot of restaurants).  . . Large menu, full of choices. . But don't forget the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE for dessert. . One of our absolute favorite restaurants.. ALWAYS A WAIT FOR DINNER, but worth it.
