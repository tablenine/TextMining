Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
If I could give Din Tai Fung Dumpling House a 3 1/2, I would. . . When a friend posted a photo of the porkchop over fried rice on Facebook, I immediately pressed the "like" button and added Din Tai Fung Dumpling House on my "to eat" list. So on my recent trip to Los Angeles, my boyfriend and I went out of our way (40mins from our hotel) to see why 1034 people on Yelp gave Din Tai Fung Dumpling house 4 stars. . . We arrived to Din Tai Fung about an hour and a half before closing on a Sunday night and I can tell you it was still crackin'. There was about 4 or 5 groups of about 5+ heads. Since we were just a party of 2, I knew we would probably be able to bypass these groups. I was really impressed by how efficient the Din Tai Fung staff was. They take your order while you are waiting and within a few minutes of being seated, the food arrives warm and delicious. . . As much as I would love to give Din Tai Fung 4 stars, I was more impressed with the service over the dumplings. I really didn't think it was worth 45 minute drive if I could have gotten something just as good closer to the hotel. I am not a huge fan of dumplings and Din Tai Fung didn't do much to change that. The porkchop over fried rice also looked much better in the photo than what was placed in front of me. . . If you're in Los Angeles and willing to trek out to Arcadia for some dumplings, go for it. Din Tai Fung is just one of those places to try once if you're in the area. I'm from San Francisco and there are more than enough dumpling places within a 7 mile radius to get my fix here.
