Geisha House is good if you are celebrating a birthday or are pre-partying before going to Kress or Les Deux or Opera night clubs across the street.. . The food is pretty good if you know what to order.. . I recommend the crispy rice tuna (with jalapeno), the crispy onion albacore and the skewers of all different types.. . The managers are great and the staff well-trained. Â It can get busy, so get a reservation.
