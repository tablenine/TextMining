The poster in the lobby caught my eye...an older Zagat review that put Bones above Peter Luger on service and equal in terms of food...interesting.  Must be good right?. . Bones has the old,  guys' club vibe, but surprisingly, lots of patrons were pretty dressed down.  And there were kids there, well 2 to be exact.  The waiters were a bit awkward, but the service was attentive.  This is the sort of place that will sweep the bread crumbs off your tabletop over the course of dinner.  If you're easily impressed by this like I am, then you can appreciate the service. . . The menu is predictably simple.  You have your choice meats and some crab or lobster dish.  The meat dishes range in price from mid-30s to mid-40s.  I had the 10oz filet minon ($35), medium rare and it melted in my mouth.  The lobster bisque was very tasty.  The Bones salad was pretty good, but dressing-heavy.  Veggies had to be ordered separately, but since I came to have meat, I waved away the suggestion of vegetables (lets not detract from the main course, right?).  . . This is not a place to go to if you're on a budget, but is great for an occasion that calls for a calm, subdued dining experience.  You never feel rushed once you sit down and multiple waiters stop by to ask if everything is okay, before leaving you on your own with your slab of red meat.  I forgot meat could taste soooo good.
