Seriously people, be real... this place isn't all that.  I actually found it to be sloppy, greasy, and it didn't taste good either.  What a waste of time and money.  For those of you who claim to LOVE this place, you don't know what good food taste like.  Take it from me - I'm an eater, and I know what good food is.  I won't eat Kogi's food again.  What a dissapointment.
