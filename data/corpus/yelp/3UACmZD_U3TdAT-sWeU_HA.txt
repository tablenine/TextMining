I have been eating at this restuarant for years. It is my favorite for a real Indian meal and nice ambiance. I like the combination of vibe and value for the meal. It is easy to find Indian for cheap $$ and no vibe or nice Vibe and not so good "fusion" Indian or wack portions (aka Tantra). So in a sense this place delivers the full package. I am tempted to be stingy with a 4 star rating because the service quality can lack based on whose working the bar or what server you get. Sometimes its spectacular service - but never horrible. Bring your KCRW card if you have one for a nice discount. Try the cheese Naan and the Tika. Yum.
