I HEART  this place so much!  This place was my personal heaven after a long day apartment hunting.  I am so much in love with this place that I purposely had to choose a place far away so I wouldn't want to eat here every day!. . I got the curry chicken crepe, which became my new love.   I was flipping through reviews here, and realized I missed this place.  So now, I think i will be returning, trying something else, and hopefully coming back with a better review!
