This place wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't good. I teetered between 2 and 3 stars but "Meh. I've experienced better" is pretty much what I think of this place. I didn't really like the decor although I did like the exposed brick inside. For appetizers we ordered the breaded pickles which I didn't really like: they felt too greasy but i'm not a big fan of pickles anyway. Â For my main meal I ordered the baby back ribs, which did not fall off the bone and the meat was not tender. Although I ordered the "wet" ribs (as opposed to the dry rubbed) they weren't very wet. Pretty dry. The flavor was okay. I felt like it needed more bbq sauce but I didn't really like their choices: spicy or sweet. I would not go back, not because of any bad experience, but simply because it was so meh. Oh and 2 of our dinner companions got an upset stomach from the meal, although neither me nor my boyfriend did.
