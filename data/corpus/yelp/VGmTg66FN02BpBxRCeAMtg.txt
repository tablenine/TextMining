Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
I don't mind chain restaurants, and at the end of the day, no matter how much you dress it up, Roys is still a chain. But, the food was pretty good, so I won't hold that against it.. . For drinks I had the pomegranate martini. Loved it. I also had the pomegranate mojito. Eh, it had too much lime in it. But the drink that I had to send back was the blackberry sangria. It was watered down and just not good. . . Our food was delicious on the other hand. We ordered a roll to start and I had the pork for an entree. The pork was cooked perfectly and the sushi roll was incredibly fresh. . . I'd come back - but I think I would try the prix fixe menu.
