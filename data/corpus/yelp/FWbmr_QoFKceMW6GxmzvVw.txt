I wanted to do 4 1/2 stars, but it didn't let me. I love this place! Don't know how I can even begin to express my love for their breakfast foods. Everything that I've ever ordered has been great -- however, so that you don't think that I'm a crazed or blind fan -- I will say that I do not particularly care for their coffee or Chai, I'd rather order the over priced freshly squeezed OJ. Their wait staff is ok, their busboys are amazing, these men will do anything to keep you happy. Oh, yes, the food! Ok, their french toast is better than homemade good, the California Omelet is Ohhhh sooo delicious! The chocolate, banana, walnut crepes never disappoint. Parking is a pain, if you're lucky you can park in the adjacent residential streets. The out door tables are doggie friendly :) Haven't been there for lunch or dinner yet since I'm such a huge fan of their breakfast foods. My boyfriend usually gets their sandwiches and always devours them, so I'll take it as a good sign!
