Figaro..... figaro figaro fiiigarooh.  I dunno but that's the association I have with figo.  Perhaps a strange connection between this place and Macaroni Grill which has Opera singers every now and then.  To say I digress here would be an understatement.. . Anyway, Figo - it's actually been a while since I've eaten here (been to this location 2x) but they are all pretty much the same.  Decent pasta, fairly cheap, and pretty kickback.  Figo seemed great the first couple of times I went, but after a few so so meals I kind of got turned off by the place.  It's been probably 6 months or more since I've been to a Figo.  . . Figo makes their pasta fresh, which I like, but the sauces are generally lacking.  Also, the portions are fairly small but I guess that's how everything stays so affordable.  I suppose you are supposed to fill up on bread.... but seriously filling up on bread and pasta isn't my idea of a good time unless I'm running a marathon the next day.  I guess you can try to balance it out with a salad, but the few leafy greens you get are no match for the carb overload the rest of the meal provides.. . The quality of the food is actually pretty decent, so that part is nice.  You don't feel like you're eating some second rate middle school lunch food, but it just doesn't all come together.  I wish I could better put my finger on it.  . . Of course take this review with a grain of salt... I am not the biggest pasta fan.  I like pasta, but it has to be fresh and the sauce has to be killer.  If it is so so, I'll definitely pass.  Figo approaches the so so, but manages to hover just above.
