I love their portobello fries.  I must admit, this is why I always want to come. . Ambiance: I love the ceiling to floor windows and high ceilings in this big open white space, its so simple yet beautiful on one of our many gorgeous SoCal days.  . You walk into a bustling bakery with a display of ornate desserts and pastries so delectable, you'd think its fake.  ALongside is the wall of drinks and sandwiches, etc.  But walk past all the bustle and you are greeted by a hostess standing behind a gold-guilded table with an old-fashioned book of records to take down your name. There is an open kitchen so you can see the hustle and bustle of the chefs preparing the meals. It's a great place to people watch, those outside and in, and a lovely place to come for dinner or lunch.. Service can be a bit slow as well as the seating but its worth it. If seating is slow, theres a lovely bar on the side where you can kill some time as well.. All the food, and I've had most of it by now, is delicious.  Again, order the portobello fries!
