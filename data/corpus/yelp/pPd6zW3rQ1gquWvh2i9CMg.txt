Restaurant: Aja Restaurant &amp; Bar
Category: Dim Sum
So I made it to Aja last night with a couple of girlfriends and I liked it as a dinner night out spot.  Yes, the 'Asian' theme is a little heavy and the top 40 DJ and colored light show creates that pseudo trendy vibe that homogenizes all new ATL hot spots....But on the plus side, the valets were warm and friendly (on a cold night), both our waiters were excellent, and I enjoyed the dim sum and some of our shared entrees. Lamb chops were a great portion and perfectly cooked, but coulda used more seasoning.  The salmon dish was blah and the honey ginger entrees are tasty even if it is a little too typical. I couldn't stop looking around: up at red behind the bar, the calligraphy scrolls on the ceiling, the candles at the buddha altar.  Menu pricing is a little weird; $7 fried rice? and desserts are unappealing.  Maybe I have been in ATL too long and I'm a sucker in the H2S cult, but I already wanna go back for dim sum on Sunday.
