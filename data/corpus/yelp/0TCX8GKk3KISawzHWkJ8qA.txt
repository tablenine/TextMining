Yes, they have a variety of sausages for you to choose from, but they are WAY to salty for me to taste any difference among the sausages.  I took a bite of the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage -- SALTY.  And I ordered the sun-dried tomato sausage -- SALTY.  The saltiness just overwhelms the taste buds.  You order over counter and head back where there's a bar and long tables with dim lighting and a DJ playing music.  The fries are pretty good. At least it wasn't as salty. Yes, they have some interesting beverage choices, but pretty expensive.  I guess it depends if you're willing to pay for a new experience.  Nice, but wouldn't go back.  I can see why a lot of college kids may go or just a decent alternative place to chill without spending as much money at a fancy restaurant.
