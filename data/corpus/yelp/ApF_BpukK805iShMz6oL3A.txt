Restaurant: Coobah
Category: Latin American
Just moved to the Southport area and walk by Coobah almost every day.  I was intrigued since there is always a crowd dining outside and everyone looks like they are having a great time.  So when faced with a decision of where to go to dinner Wednesday night, we wound up here.. . Half price bottles of wine were the real reason we came.  How can you go wrong?  Because we had to wait a little while for our table (it was pretty crowded), we parked ourselves at the bar and got started on that bottle.  The atmosphere was very Latin American; with the live music and the men speaking Spanish next to us, I felt like I had left Chicago.  . . Entrees are a bit pricier than we were expecting and since we had also been contemplating tapas for our dinner, we decided to choose a few different appetizers for our meal.  Excellent idea.  We ordered the calamari, crab lumpia (like an egg roll, sort of),  fundido rajas, and each ordered a black bean &amp; corn tamale.  I have to say the tamale was my favorite thing.  If I could just walk in there and get a few of those to go, I would.. . Servers were all very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be back (most likely on a Wed night again).
