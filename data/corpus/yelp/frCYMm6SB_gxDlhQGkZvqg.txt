Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
It's a separate category of food that I really crave a few times a year. If you are sad because there is no salsa bar and drive thru then get the hell out of the line. This is the White Castle of Los Angeles, it has it's own charms you are raised on. The record I have is 9 tacos in one afternoon.
