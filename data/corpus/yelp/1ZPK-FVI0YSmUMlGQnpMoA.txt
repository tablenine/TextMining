Dear Los Angeles (and possibly, the universe),. . Your search for the perfect hamburger is over. OVER. Did you hear me? Yeah, stop writing, pull over and seriously get out of the drive-thru line for In-n-out.. . I've been back to Oinkster at least 3 times in the past 2 months just because i couldn't stop salivating at the thought of their burgers.. . They're huge, they're perfectly cooked and better yet, they're COVERED in pickles and their buns are PERFECT. It's like everything you've ever dreamed of in a simple American cheeseburger (which you can get with gruyere, too!).. . I heart their crispy thick fries and their homemade condiments (garlic aoili, chipotle ketchup and mustard) taste a billion times better than what Heinz could ever think about making.. . I'm not a fan of taro, but I hear the ube shake is equally as delish.. . No word on the salad yet (seriously, why would you eat a salad at a place called OINKSTER?!) but I know that the pastrami and pulled-pork sandwiches are also to die for.. . So there you go. Drive to Eagle Rock right now. You can thank me later.. . Sincerely,. moye
