So much disapointment, I was so looking forward to going to Craft with my Culinary Club. We got a tour of the kitchen which is absolutely amazing but the food and service was lacking. . The waiters reached over the table and across our laps which anyone who has worked in Hospitality they know is a big no no.. We had to constantly ask for drink refills and our first dish of a 10 course tasting was a sea Urchin panna cotta. Well you can expect this to have an intense flavor and the flavor stayed in you mouth for practically the whole meal and stayed on your water glass. Which in my opinion is digusting, I dont want to take a sip of water and taste the ocean. Not a smart choice to start the meal. There were several technical problems as well, I found a lemon seed in my lobster ravoli, which tasted bad in itself, but find a lemon seed, the restaurant of the top chef head judge, I expected better. The ravoli had no texture, someone had pureed the filling and destroyed the beautiful texture of the lobster. They also overloaded it wih lemon zest to the point it was all you could taste. I was by far the worst dish of the evening and took one bite and pushed it aside.. . At the end of the meal they had use some pastries to take home, a blueberry muffin and some carmel popcorn. The muffin was completely inedible, it also had the over powering flavor of lemon zest like the ravoli. . . Overall total disapointment and my head chef advisor was pissed after the meal about the service and food quality, at $130 a pop it was not worth and I'm not going back
