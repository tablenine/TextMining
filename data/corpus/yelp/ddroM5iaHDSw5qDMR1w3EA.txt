I've been to Toast a number of times, and I think the pluses are definitely having a nice brunch outside in the sunny weather and the people watching opportunities. There always seems to be a good line around brunchtime on the weekends.. . The food tends to be okay, with the breakfast dishes and sandwiches the best deals in my opinion. The soups and quesadillas, for $7.50, are a bit much. Portions are generous, and the potatoes (especially the fries) are outstanding. My protein scramble came out rather lukewarm today, but cooked well. The fruit bowl was a good mixture of fresh fruits, but I would've liked this a bit chilled, rather than room temperature.. . I am a fan of the Lus sandwich, which is a pressed sandwich of chicken, avocado, spinach and mozzarella. With a side of fries, this is definitely a good and hearty lunch sandwich.. . I do always find it rather frustrating how the valet service of the restaurant obviously parks the cars on the street, and basically hogs up all of the street parking in the area.
