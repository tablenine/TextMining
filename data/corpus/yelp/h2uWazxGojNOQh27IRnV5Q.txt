Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Tank is simply the best sushi Chicago has to offer in this sushi addicts opinion. I have searched for truly fresh and inventive sushi ever since leaving the sushi capital of San Francisco and Tank is my new weekly standard. The sushi chefs have created a menu that caters to almost any palate and satisfies both sushi newcomers and traditionalists. The restaurant is modern, sexy, and impeccably staffed. Their staff offers actual knowledge (can you believe it???) when it comes to their menu, and will help you find exactly what you will love. The chefs have no problem accommodating special needs or preferences, and they are more than generous with their rolls. . . My Recommendations: . Chopsticks (like crab rangoon but BETTER!) . Scallops appetizer (AMAZING) . Lamb Chops appetizer (Sounds crazy but is AWESOME) . Any of their Tuna (it is the freshest and most flavorful I have found) . Watermelon Salad (summer fun!) . Sashimi Sampler!!! (TRY IT) . And any of their featured rolls per your taste . . I recommend this place to all of my clients (as a Realtor they are always asking for recommendations) and they become fast followers. The only downside about Tank is that you can sometimes experience a wait on the weekends if you want a table. I suggest the sushi bar, or glamorous red bar where you can eat and have some incredible cocktails, or be sure to get there before 8pm to snag your table...you'll be there to closing!
