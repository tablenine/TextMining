i'm a cafe worker so i'll grade it appropriately.. . great coffee, great service, good muffin (mind you, i spend all day making them at work)... bagel with cc and veggies come in a timely manner, and are usually given to me by a smiley "kitchen worker". and i think there's wireless, i dunno i have it wherever i go.. . oh and a really big patio. i ride my bike here regularly, very biker friendly.
