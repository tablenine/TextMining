omgggg unbelievable french toast!!!! the nutella french toast hits the spot if you've got a sweet tooth in the morning. their coffee is amazing as well! their sandwiches and eggs are insane as well. however heres a fair warning...dont even graze the doorway if you're thinking of a lite meal...it's on the heavy side...the extemely heavy side. but well worth it for an early breakfast. one time i had to wait for over an hour...so it does get packed...but worth it regardless.. . final word: yayyyy for breakfast!
