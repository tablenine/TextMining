Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I will preface this with saying that I am not a prime rib fan (I am more a filet/porterhouse kinda girl), but it was Mother's Day and it was the MIL's choice.. . The spinning salad was nothing more than a bowl spinning on ice to create a table-side show...completely unnecessary (and the dressing was blah). Â The prime rib was OK and probably considered good to prime rib lovers.. . My husband ordered the trout (knowing he could eat half my steak and have surf-n-turf) and said that this was good, but they brought the prime rib cart by and served the prime rib while he sat there without his dinner.. . I didn't leave hungry, but I'm not going back.
