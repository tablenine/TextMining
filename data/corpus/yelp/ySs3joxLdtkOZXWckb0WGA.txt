Restaurant: Wafels &amp; Dinges

This is the scoop. One white guy and one Hispanic guy operate the truck. The Hispanic guy was clearly not the boss, cuz when I asked when the 2nd truck is coming, he said his boss was looking into it. No, not because he's Hispanic you racist bastards. I digress. There's a pdf menu of their offerings on their website along with special dinges displayed on a whiteboard when you get there. Today's special dinges happened to be honey, coconut flakes and bananas. They also offered Iced Coffee (Reg, Hazelnut, Vanilla, Chocolate). Regarding the freshness of the wafels, there were some already on the counter but ours were made to order. Maybe you have to specifically request yours fresh. When asked, they said the ones on the counter were there 'resting and cooling down'. Wow, even their NYS License Plate reads WAFEL. Tax is included.. . Wafels $4 (+$1 per topping or +$3/unlimited toppings):. -Brussels - this square waffle would be the one you could relate to most, light, airy, fluffy, and crispy, the one they serve at brunch places, i liked this better of the two actually, will get next time, i tried this. -Liege/Liege Cinnamon Royal - not sure if I tasted the sugar pearls here but this was more doughy and heavier on the tummy, it was fresh and tasty though, being the badass that I am I ordered 'the works' minus maple syrup, honey, and dulce de leche.. . Note: A sport bottle of Poland Spring (24oz) will run you $2. Some yahoo waited on line just for this.. . Thanks to . http://nycfoodguy.com.  for informing me about this and enticing me with oh so orgasmic pics:. . http://nycfoodguy.com/.... . . P.S. Check Twitter for their daily locations. 1 truck moves between several locations at any given day. . http://www.twitter.com.... . . Total came out to $7 after everything. .
