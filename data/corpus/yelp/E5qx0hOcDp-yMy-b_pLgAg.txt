Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Recently I had dinner at Pizzeria Mozza with two girlfriends, we arrived at around 6:30p on a Tuesday, and were able to sit at the pizza bar immediately. The atmosphere was great, as well as the service. We ordered the fried squash appetizer with the mista salad, both delicious in their own ways as the squash I believe is fried in rice oil, making it a bit healthier than greasier apps you will find at other restaurants. For our main course, we ordered the fennel sausage pizza, which was outstanding, and the Prosciutto di Parma pizza. The best part was that we weren't grossly stuffed after our meal, but more, heartily satisfied! Highly recommended if you're craving some great pizza but don't want dominoes!
