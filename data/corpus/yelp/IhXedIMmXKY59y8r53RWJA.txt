Restaurant: Market
Category: American (New)
I have to agree what someone else wrote about Market: "Market needs to decide if it's going to be a sports bar or a lounge or a restaurant -- it can't be all three". It was a little hard to tell. I think that it has all the makings of a decent restaurant, all it has to do is loose the "gimmicks" (i.e. popcorn shrimp served in a popcorn vendors box, cotton candy served in a mini-shopping cart, and onion rings on some kind of a rack.) Loose that silly stuff and focus on the good straightforward food in a well designed restaurant. The roof top deck/lounge was a nice touch, the only downside is that they have to place orders with the bar that is 3 floors below.  The cocktail waitresses really have to work for their tips with all that up and down. All in all though, good food, good atmosphere,  and the place is pretty new so they are trying to get their formula just right as they move along. We wish them the best of luck, and look forward to returning.
