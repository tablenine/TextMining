I've been here twice for lunch as I work down the street. The first time I thought the food was good, the service okay, the ambiance - not sure about. The music was blasting and there was a bad smell, but I liked the decor. We went there again today to see if it was any different. As I finished my chicken sandwich my lunch buddy noticed my chicken was raw (of course I had already eaten 3/4 of it). They took the sandwich off our bill, but barely acknowledged this was not good thing to serve raw chicken. . . As we were walking out the door the owner asked us how the meal was and we told him we were served raw chicken. He then kind of shrugged and gave a look like "so what?" I thought my lunch date was going to punch him. We won't be back.
