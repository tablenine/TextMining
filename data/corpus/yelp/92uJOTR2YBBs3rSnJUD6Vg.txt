I asked my best friend for some real Chicago style pizza and she took me here.  This was some of the best pizza I have ever eaten!  I can't wait to go back in June.  The Cheese and how deep the pizza was...wow.  I'm not a fan of red sauce (yes even on my pizza), so I was able to just scrape it off..and it worked well with it on top!. . Its a DO, for anyone in Chicago!  You will wait a little while so hopefully the person you are eating with is entertaining.
