No this is not the best Mexican restaurant in Chicago by far, but there is some reason that I keep coming back here. Maybe it is the fantastic central meeting location? The great chips and salsa? The swirl margaritas?. Food is decent and portions are bigger so if I order my favorite Benito's Combo platter (huge chile rellenos, enchilda and empanada with rice and beans) I know I'll be bringing some home with me. Entrees are served with a soupy bean mixture so if you want refried beans you have to ask.
