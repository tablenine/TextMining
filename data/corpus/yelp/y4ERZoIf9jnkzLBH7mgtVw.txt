All the reviewers below have said it well.  Porto's is amazing.  One thing missing from the reviews however are the SMOOTHIES.  The Horchata smoothy has become my new crack.  I actually drive out of my way to avoid this place.  This is not your regular Horchata.  Thick, like a milkshake.  If you are a Horchata lover, RUN, don't walk to Porto's.
