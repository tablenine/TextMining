My good friend came here with me for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  It was on a Thursday at 1 so there was not wait and the patrons all seemed to be pleased carrying on their conversations.  I arrive about 20 minutes before my friend who had apparently gotten into a tussle with her closet (luckily she was the victor) but the wait staff offered to take my drink order and made sure that my water glass was full the entire time I waited never pressuring me to order.  . . Once my friend arrive the waitress quickly appeared, offered us the special of the day of pan seared scallops then gave us time to order.  After twenty minutes and having a wonderful view of the kitchen I was pretty well decided on the leek ravioli with browned butter and almond, and my friend watched an amazing smoked salmon salad that included bagel chips and capers (sort of a deconstructed lox and bagels) pass by and quickly made up her mind.  . . The ravioli was wonderful!  I typically like meat in most of main courses but was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the vegetarian option.   Apparently Rebecca liked hers as well since she ate the entire thing...she also mentioned that it was unique and really tasty.. . The portion size of my pasta was a little small however, forcing me to eat a lot of bread and order a dessert.  Luckily it was my favorite dessert in the whole wide world, creme brulee, with little lavandar short bread cookie.  The cookies were a little dry, as most shortbread cookies are so I didn't really eat them but the creme brulee I devoured.  . . All in all it was pretty good I think.  I may come back again, but if someone had reservations there ask me how it was I would definitely say good but to be sure to order a starter salad ;)
