This is one of my new favorite sushi spots now.  We arrived for a late dinner on Friday night around 10pm a little before they closed so we didn't have to wait for a table.  The prices are reasonable and the sushi is really good.  The sashimi chef's special is a real bargain with 12-13 pieces of sashimi for $13.  We also ordered the spicy yellow tail roll, baked scallop roll, spicy tuna handroll, halibut sushi, and albacore sushi.    Probably not as good as Sushi Nozawa but it's cheaper and close to the same quality freshness.  Their omakase is only $35...need to try it out next visit.  Service is pretty good for how busy they are.
