Ok.....Love the interior design , VERY simple clean, reminders me A LOT like San Francisco super rectangular eateries. Just a single line of tables and the kitchen facing..... . Food...not so much. Bland, (the condiments, I could have bought at ralphs, were it's only saving grace..lol)...I have had much better Pho and at a much cheaper price. . . Even though reasonable, a tad overpriced, mainly because Â of the decor. The service is so-so....the selection is limited.. . I really think this is a hot spot because of the scene-sters that attend. Very "Hip" which is cool because its silverlake, but crappy because you are waiting for a while outside and paying to eat 2 star food. I don't mind paying a little more for the ambiance, but your food better rock...and sorry to say Pho cafe is much more of a folk star, not a rockstar.
