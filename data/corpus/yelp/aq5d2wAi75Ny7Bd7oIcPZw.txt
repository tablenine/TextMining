Restaurant: Adobo Grill
Category: Latin American
Very recently I've turned into a big fan of Old Town. I love the variety of shops and restaurants that are neatly crammed into just a few streets. Parking can be notoriously difficult to find, but lately I've had the parking angel riding shotgun with me in the Mini Cooper, directing me to the rare open spots on Wells. . . Adobo Grill was always at the top of my list of restaurants to try, but timing was never right. I'd usually head out on Saturday evenings when waits would be way too long. However, yesterday I lucked out and came by on a not so busy Thursday! Parking angel had directed me to a prime parking spot so I was even more stoked when I didn't have to wait at Adobo Grill.. . I had a long day at work and decided I wanted to drink away the day's stress. I'm not normally a fan of the liquid dinner, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I saddled up to the bar with the BF and we ordered the two most popular cocktails - the Adobo Margarita and Mojito. I'm not usually a fan of margaritas over ice, but this place has turned me into a convert! I probably offended the guy by asking for a frozen margarita first and he probably spit in my drink, but I digress. The margarita had just the right amount of my on-again/off-again buddy Jose Cuervo. I had a buzz, but it was one of the good kinds - complete with non-stop giggling and 100 mph chatter. I'm sure the BF loved it.. . We also ordered some chips and four salsas, which were very good. People rave so much about the guacamole here, but given the allergy, I wasn't able to try it. I am glad, though, that the salsas didn't disappoint!. . I'll go back to Adobo Grill to have a full meal one of these days. But in the meantime, I'm sitting happy thinking about that great liquid dinner I just had at Adobo Grill.
