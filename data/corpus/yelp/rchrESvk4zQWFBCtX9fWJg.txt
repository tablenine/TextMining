Whoa heart attack.  I think this place could easily be used by frat bothers as an initiation challenge... who can finish the whole order of pancakes?!  This restaurant is a fun place to gossip over a cup of coffee and 10 pounds of French toast and 1pound of whipped cream.  This is a Los Angeles institution, which is known for their dirty floors, long waits, and delicious oversized dishes.     . . The restaurant is small, and really crowded on the weekends.  I would recommend going during a weekday if that's possible.  I have had the eggs there, and they were not great.  I think you have to just forget the Adkins diet and go for the carbs.  . . Get ready for powdered sugar coated deliciousness!  . . Ps. the only reason I am giving this 3 stars and not 4 is because it is a little too much for me : )
