Yep, that's 5 stars people! I absolutely loved everything about my experience at LA Mill.  From the amazing service to the delicious breakfast and even more delicious coffee and cappuccino, i now understand what all the hype is about.. . There are several people who have given the "i don't get it" feedback, but i guess it is for a specific type of experience.  Maybe some were expecting just a casual cup of coffee, and entered into a gourmet experience that wasn't what quite what they were ready for.. . We sat outside on a Saturday morning and ordered a small breakfast with lots of coffee.  I ordered the specialty orange cappuccino and Tobin ordered a Chemex of the LA Mill specialty brew.  My drink was like a little bit of heaven and the coffee was the best cup of coffee i have ever had.  We were poured and served the Chemex at our table.  I've never had coffee brewed this way and it was amazing.  I am used to French Press coffee and this was a different, almost lighter, cup of coffee.  We were so convinced we had to drop in next door to buy the Chemex, filters and coffee beans.. . Now i could keeping writing about the coffee, but the food was amazing too. Tobin ordered baked eggs with mushrooms and bacon accompanied by a side of toast.  I ordered the side of clam fritters with wasabi-lemon-creme sauce.  Both dishes were amazing.  There were definitely enough fritters to share and the egg dish was a nice small sized breakfast for one.  The rest of the menu looked amazing and i will definitely be back to keep trying all the items.. . Now that we are in town for a while, you can find me at LA Mill every Saturday morning!
