I love The Vortex in L5P. And what's not to love? They have great food, a good beer selection, decent prices and fantastic and friendly service (you can't go wrong with Amy as your server). . . Just thinking about their tater tots gives me a hankering, their Kari Kari appetizer is delicious and their turkey chili is amazing with just the right amount of kick. But I would steer clear of the quesadilla; it's just so-so, and a true disappointment if you're a quesadilla fanatic like I am. . . Tuesday night is their trivia night, which is a great time with a non-cheeseball trivia host.
