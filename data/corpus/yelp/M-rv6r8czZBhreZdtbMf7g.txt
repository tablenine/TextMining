Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I think with most people, you either love it or hate it.  With the second time going there I agree that it's not exactly the "shit."  It's definitely the hype about the infamous dogs at Pink's that is supposedly worth the hour to hour and a half wait...but it's just a hot dog...that I have to eat with a fork and knife?. . I mean don't get me wrong, they have some pretty off the wall creations that can be thrown on a dog named after celebrities and all but it's aiiite...for me.  . . The only time I would suggest this place is if it's you're first time there, but otherwise I don't think it's all that a beginner cook like me can't make at home.  And I would make about a dozen for the same price that would make me full.
