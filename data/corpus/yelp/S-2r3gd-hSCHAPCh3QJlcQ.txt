Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Ambiance:  Always packed with people and rather loud.  More of a casual lunching scene - not intimate or romantic (any place that promotes their range of chili flavors is not romantic).  Luckily there is quick turnover so waiting is never too long.  MAJOR CON - the restrooms are a wreck!  Considering the size of the place it is strange that there is a single bathroom for each men and women.  Even if they were trying to create a private bathroom setting as a luxury - it does not succeed when it is left with no toilet paper, no paper towels, ravaged cupboards with open doors revealing gross bathroom utilities  Same disgusting status in both the male and female bathrooms - it couldn't have just been by chance.  When I see such a gross bathroom, I worry about the kitchen.. . Service:  The waiters are upbeat but always rushed.  Because they have to cover so many tables, they are often forgetful if you ask them to bring something.. . Food:  The pancakes are delicious and enormous (they would have to be to spend $13 on just three pancakes).  Honestly you can feed 3 people an entire meal with these pancakes.  I always order an omelet - my favorite is the Cobb omelet (it does not get better).. . Overall:  I would recommend going here for breakfast and lunch food.  There are some minor celebrity sighting to be had at this place.  I can only hope that when you show up the bathroom is in a more sanitary state.
