If you want NY style pizza in Chicago, no need to go anywhere else.  The slices are large, foldable, slightly greasy (dab with a napkin dear if you are worried about this), very cheesy, and yummy!  This is not Piece so be prepared to stand at a counter, order, stand some more, pay, find a seat, wait, go back up and get it (depending on how busy they are), then back to your seat to enjoy.  Tiny wine and beer selection and no one working there is going to tell you to "Have a nice day!" but who cares?  Get your pizza on then roll elsewhere for adult beverages and a friendly dose of customer service.
