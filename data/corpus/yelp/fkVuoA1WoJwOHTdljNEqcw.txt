This was my first Chicago steak house experience and I was very please. Walked in and it was PACKED on a Tuesday.  Very old school atmosphere.  We still had a 15 min wait, so went over to the bar, got a great spot and ordered two cocktails. Very old school bartenders who knew how to make still cocktails. We finally got a great seat in the corner of the restaurant. Two more cocktails. Had the crab and avocado app. Really good. House salad was great. For dinner my fiancee had the filet and I had the bone in sirloin. Both were fabulous.  I would deff go back.
