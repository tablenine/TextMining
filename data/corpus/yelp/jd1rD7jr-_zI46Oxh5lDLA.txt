Outdoor seating was excellent. Food was great. Heirloom tomato caprese salad was awesome. Gnocchi with goat cheese stuffed chicken was good, but quite heavy in a butter sauce and I couldn't finish it--but which made for great leftovers the next night. :). . The only downside was after already contemplating which wine ot get, getting recommendations from the server and ordering a specific bottle of wine, the server came back to tell us that they actually didn't have it, which was fine, but he was not particularly apologetic about it and simply told us to pick another one and shoved the wine list in my companion's face. Was a little tacky and disrespectful, I thought, but not the end of the world. I still enjoyed my night there a lot.
