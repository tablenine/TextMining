The food was great. Â My friends and I go there even though we're not vegetarians.. . I ordered a beef with mixed vegetables and requested it to be a little spicy.. My girlfriend ordered Scallops and Chicken -- it wasn't on the menu and they made it just for her.. . Even though I had a lot of food I didn't feel bloated after my meal.. . The server was attentive and the owners were nice. The price was also reasonable.
