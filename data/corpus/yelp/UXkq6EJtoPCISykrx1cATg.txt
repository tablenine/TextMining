I was very pleasently surprised about Sola.  Went for dinner on a Thursday, and they had a burger special. I am not much of a burger guy, but I was feeling meaty.  The wagyu burger with pretzel bread is outstanding - so flavorful! Probably the best burger I've ever had.  The truffle and parmesan fries were also nice - mine were slightly under cooked, but they were still very flavourful and didnt stop me from wolfing down about 2/3 of them.  . During my burger infused elation I paid little attention to my dining companion, but I faintly recall them saying their food was equally as good. . I do recall the drinks though, and both the mojito and the pretty in pink cocktails were outstanding.. Go now.
