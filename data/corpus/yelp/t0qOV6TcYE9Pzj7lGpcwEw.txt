This place is great.  I came across this place on accident while I was in J town in LA.  At the time, this place looked like the only decent place to eat that was still open.  To my suprise, this is the best ramen I've had to date.  Gyoza's are great, ramen is excellent.  I try to make it visit this place each time I go down to LA.
