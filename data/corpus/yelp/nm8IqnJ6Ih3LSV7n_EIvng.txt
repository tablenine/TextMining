Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I wasn't a fan to begin here...So I have to say my 1st few visit was convenience and healthy dumpling meal.. . As I am going visiting more and more Dumpling House, I realized the food here is consistent... I enjoyed the small bites of juicy pork, the warm vegetarian, red bean dessert.. The items are EXPECTED on TASTE each time I return here.  This to me is important because there's no bad or good day, there just DUMPING CRAVING sit down.. . I finally visited their new location and its more modern.  I also had a chance to tried more of their menu and I really enjoy it.  I came home and made my own version of noodle and it was a hit!. . YES.. I AM A FAN OF DUMPLING!
