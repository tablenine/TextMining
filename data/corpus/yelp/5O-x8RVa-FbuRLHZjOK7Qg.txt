Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
It may be the best steak in LA that is served in a restaurant built for French food.. . Why four stars?  . . First, I have eaten at CUT a number of times and the food has not been consistent sometimes it is really top notch and worth every penny, other times it is average and non-memorable (on the scale of "great" steak houses of course).. . Second, I am from NYC and was brought up eating steak at little place in Williamsburg, Brooklyn famous for their steak, bacon, onion bread, and the golden medallions that accompany your check.  All steak houses are judged against the PL standard and CUT just doesn't make the mark (I prefer Sparks and others to CUT as well).  I think a large part of this may be their insistence (or even their willingness) to offer sauces/toppings to their steaks.  Sure its a west coast thing, but it also screams to me "we are a little worried about we are serving.). . Thirdly, while the tart tatin is rather delicious the rest of the sides aren't that great.
