Restaurant: Ok Cafe
Category: Diners
My co-worker and I had lunch at the OK Cafe this week for her birthday.  I had never eaten hear before but she said it was great.  Our booth overlooked the to go section of the restaurant, which was kind of neat.. . I ordered the chicken (baked or rotisserie) chicken, collard greens and sweet potato.  I was pleasantly surprised that the sweet stuff for the sweet potato was on the side because I prefer to eat them plain.  The collards were very tasty and not too soggy.  My chicken was good but kind of dry.  I will probably choose some other meat on my next visit.. . My co-worker ordered the turkey and dressing with collards and mac-n-cheese.  Instead of mac-n-cheese, she got the squash casserole.  She didn't complain because - 1) the waitress was gone and 2) she said it was good.. . I could have used a little more tea, but our waitress did not reappear until she dropped off the check.. . The food was for the most part very good and I would eat there again.  I would probably also bring out-of-town guests here if this was the type of food they were in the mood for.. . The restaurant is very busy, so be prepared to wait - the bigger your party, the longer the wait.  You may have to park in one of the grocery store spots and walk over instead of waiting for a closer spot.
