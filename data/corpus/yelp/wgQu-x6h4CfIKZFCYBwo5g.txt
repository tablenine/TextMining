This place was worth the drive and I will be back I am sure. Pulled Pork sandwich was really tasty, don't miss all the homemade sauces but especially the bbq sauce for the sandwich. Regular fries are cooked perfectly, really good with the garlic aioli sauce. Coconut cupcake is small for the price, but the cake is tasty and moist and the frosting is exactly how cupcake frosting should be. Buttery, light, not too sweet. . . Next time if I go with a pastrami lover, i'm going to try it because I am sure I need to share, it looked really good and a big portion.. . I got there early for lunch and I went from being 3rd in line to a line out the door. It's worth the wait.
