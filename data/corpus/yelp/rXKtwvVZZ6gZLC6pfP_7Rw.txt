Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Came here for a birthday and they were great about bringing out a small treat, dimming the lights, and having the whole restaurant sing together. We also chanced upon a performance that was quite entertaining. This place is definitely very family-oriented (aka noisy and crowded), but that atmosphere can be pretty awesome sometimes.. . Took away a star because of parking. Yes I know I'm cruel.
