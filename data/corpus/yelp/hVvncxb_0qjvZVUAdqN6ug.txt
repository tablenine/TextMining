Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
A flippin' plus!. . Now I love a great sandwich. As basic as it is, sandwiches have their own food group within my diet. Coffee, fruits and veggies, grains, dairy, meats, and then... sandwiches! . . I'm really into sandwich treatments-- I'm referring to housemade spreads, chutneys, flavored mayos, cheese, and veggies as well as the bread. I was ecstatic to see that Jerry has an extensive selection of savory accessories to dress up your personal pièce de résistance. If you don't feel like creating a custom sammie, there's plenty of signature selections to choose from too. Psst, Jerry: would love to see goat cheese as an option!. . We ordered the hummus appetizer to start-- a lovely spread of delicious chickpea spread, fresh pita and the toasted variety. I could've stopped here, but went for the gold: the Henhaus H sandwich. It's their signature chicken salad dressed with chutney along with swiss cheese and applewood bacon. The bread? Our server recommended the pretzel bun. I've had many a pretzel bun in my day and Jerry's nails it. Ahhh, pretzel perfection enveloped tasty, slightly tangy chunks of chicken salad. I kept eating and eating 'til it was all gone. No exaggeration on the healthy portion sizes-- I couldn't eat again until the next day, no siree... not even a snack!. . The beer menu is wondrous and the streetside patio is one of my favorites on Division. Jerry's: you're a DO!
