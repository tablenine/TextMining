Inventive and delicious. I really liked the kampachi- seriously made me a fan.. The dessert was really fun because of the unique flavors of ice cream they had! Very memorable!! There was a mix of sweet and savory flavors. I can say I tried corn ice cream, and it really did taste like eating corn except in ice cream! . I like the atmosphere and the service was on point.. Too bad I live in California because I would like to try more of their dishes.
