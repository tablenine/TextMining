I went yesterday for my birthday and I really enjoyed my dinner. When I first enter the lobby area the hostess was very friendly and we got seated right away. Good Sign. Our waiter was Omar who was very comical and made us feel comfortable through out the entire dinner.. The seating was kind of tight meaning if I had to get up to use the ladies room my bf would have to get up too in order for me to exit. Also I could hear the conversation of the next table so it was really tight seating. I had no where to hang my chanel purse so I just placed it on the floor. Boo to that. . The food:. Shrimp cocktail = excellent, huge, but pricey at $5.95 each. . Bone in fillet med plus = Very good however I believe STK steak is much better. Spinach, corn, and the best lobster gravy every!!! expensive tho but very yum!. Dessert = Butter cake soooo good! . Also they gave me a free sin cake for my bday so that was sweet!. I was extremely pleased when I was walking out the door and the hostess said " Happy birthday" and smiled. I was thinking how does she know? Impressive. Great experience overall and not too expensive like what I have anticipated. But I didn't pay the bill so who knows hahaha
