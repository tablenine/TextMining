Went back to give Fraiche another go. Menu changed a bit - I'm assuming due to season - but the squash soup I loved wasn't there! Our server was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu - no snootiness this time whatsoever. We stuck with the lamb and steak frites again - I know, so original, but our previous rating was primarily regarding our overall experience.. . Something has changed since our first visit - management, staff, whatever it is it's for the better. I got a much more comfortable vibe being there. The staff seems to have taken their noses out of the air and down to join the rest of the world, which makes for a much more pleasant dining experience. . . Service can really make all the difference! I will happily go back.
