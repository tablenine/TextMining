I couldn't get enough of the green-olive Oil dipping sauce! I could have made a meal out of just that stuff and the bread!. . I did order the chorizo sandwich with the salad. The salad was gone in seconds! Whatever that dressing was I loved it! The chorizo sandwich was very satisfying as well.. . Lala's isn't "blow your mind good" but if you factor in how reasonable their prices are you'll realize that it really is a damn good place to grab an affordable-quality meal!
