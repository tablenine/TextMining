if you live on the east side, go to Michael's Cajun instead. It's on Colima in Rowland Hts.. . the food was ok, nothing special. the service wasn't good though. we found out that we were short one suasage but still got charged for it so we told the manager about it. she came back and said that "she asked the chef and the chef said we ate it." really? how would the chef remember how many sausage s/he put in our bag over an hours ago? i'm sure s/he had a lot more sausage to cook than just ours. the manager agreed to take out the missing sausage but had to add "this time only, won't do the same next time." sigh, she was young and she probably thought we cheap-ass asians ate the sausage and didn't wanna pay... but a suasage is like what, $2? if i wanted to rip them off i'd pick a crab and say "short legs, gimme discounts!"
