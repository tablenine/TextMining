Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
What can I say about Lawry's that hasn't already been said!  The place is awesome (except for the wait)!. I came here w/ family for our Thanksgiving dinner.  This is the very first time in my life that I went out to a restaurant for Turkey Day and not having a home cooked turkey w/ all the trimmings! But I digress..... So my future bro in-law told us to get there early and put our name on "the list" because there is usually a 2-3hr wait....and guess what..we waited exactly 3 hrs but I was told it was worth the wait...besides..we spent those wonderful 3 hours at ......THE BAR!. So after the 3 hr wait...we were shown to our table and introduced to waitresses dressed as PILGRIMS...yes, PILGRIMS!. They were very attentive...from the first drink order to the bill!. So..Lawry's starts off with some warm sourdough bread with sliced pieces of butter....and then we had something called the Spinning Salad.....(i took video! )...it was a green salad with some type of creamy thousand island tasting dressing...very good!. Lastly (before dessert)...the chefs come around to every table with a big giant iron rolling bbq that is worth more than a cadillac!. The waitress asks what type of prime rib cut we each would like..how we like it prepared plus 2 sides (1 being mashed potatoes).... I got the LAWRY'S cut done medium ...and OMG...from the first bite to me chewing on the bone marrow....was down right delicious.  The prime rib melted in my mouth and was perfectly paired with their SPICY!!! (Ay Caramba!) horseradish!!  I also added a Lobster Tail which was awesome!. It was a perfect meal!!!  . Best Prime Rib Dinner I've had in a restaurant...hands down!!!
