Restaurant: Tin Lizzy&#39;s
Category: Mexican
I was so happy when I found out that Tin Lizzy's was opening on Memorial. Now I no longer have to drive to Buckhead to get my margarita fix. The Texas and cranberry frozen margaritas seem to be my fave. I also love their chips - crisp, warm and nicely seasoned. I always order the three amigos as I like the variety of the salsa, queso and guacamole. The tacos and quesadillas that I have tried have been consistently good. . . The service is great - friendly and efficient. Last time we were here, one of the staff brought someone else's food to our table on a couple of occasions and we said it wasn't ours. Mind you, it was a Friday evening and the place was packed. No big deal, right? Well, he comped us a pitcher of margaritas as an apology. Very cool. . . Only thing I wish they would have done is changed up the interior from the previous occupant and put their own stamp on it. Â Oh well, after several pitchers of margaritas, who cares!
