As the kids say, I J'Adore this place!  I have driven by several times, but decided on breakfast today.  The nice thing here, is that everyday you can get brunch/breakfast items, not just weekends!!  It is really cute inside, kind of like Grandmas house.  I could not decide what to get, so the gentleman mentioned the salmon hash.  Yum Yum!  They give you a biscuit (the best I have had in along time) and 2 eggs along with a small side of holindaise sauce.  It was a good serving size, as I decided to save some for later.  I Definately have to recommend this place!
