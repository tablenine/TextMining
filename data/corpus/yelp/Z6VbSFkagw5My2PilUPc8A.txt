Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
I swear this is true:. . A few years ago, my first trip to the Brick Store came about because a friend at work had just gone through a terrible break-up.  Swollen eyes were hidden behind dark glass in true dramatic fashion.  Of course, the usual medicine was immediately plied.  Three of us were sitting at the benches along the wall and were well into our cups when a cutie came over and asked my friend if he could get her sunglasses.  He was acting on a dare from his table.  Due to extreme puffy face, she wasn't willing to give them up too easily.  "Sing "You've Lost That Loving Feeling" from Top Gun," she said.  I was amazed at the creativity given her  situation.  My amazement doubled when he got down on one knee and started to belt it out.  Tripled when the entire bar joined in.  All of Brick Store was singing to my heart broken friend!  That tops anything I've experienced in a bar or restaurant-anywhere!  The bar burst into applause, she handed him the glasses, and he returned to his table victorious.  . . Brick Store has good food, an amazing beer list, lines out the door, and the chance for the experience of a lifetime!
