I am giving this place 3 stars based on the service. The wait was excruciating to get  a table even though they weren't  that crowded, and then it seemed as if no one knew what was going on. The owner (i guess it was the owner) brought us some drinks and chips and salsa after he noticed we had been sitting at our table a really long time. That was nice. The staff was pleasant enough, just not very organized. Maybe they will get it together soon.. As for the food--it is cheap and good. The salsa is typical, but the corn on the cob is delish! It is covered with spices, mayo, and cheese! And I tried the shrimp enchilada and the chorizo burrito, both of which were pretty yummy. And the bill was cheap! So I overlooked the service. I'd go back for sure, but not if I were in a hurry.
