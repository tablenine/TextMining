Ok I just got back from the KOrean taco truck.  Waited over an hour to see what the hype is all about.. . and.... . It's good, but not great.  I don't think it's good enough to justify waiting in line for that long again.. . I ordered three types of tacos - beef, pork,  and chicken.  The beef itself seemed like it was marinated with hoisin sauce.  The pork itself was good and had a nice little spicy kick to it.  Chicken itself was very bland.  When eaten with the tortilla and slaw as a whole taco, the most dominant flavor that comes through is the slaw.  It's made with cabbage, onions, and cilantro tossed with a sweet/tangy dressing.  The slaw overpowered the taco and the meat couldn't hold up to the flavor of the slaw.  I didn't try the burrito, but if the lines get shorter, I'll definitely have to give it one more shot in the future.  . . Don't come here if you're expecting authentic KOrean bbq or if you're expecting authentic Mexican tacos - this is a fusion of the both types of food.  I'll be coming back if the line is shorter (hopefully it will be with their recent expansion to a second truck).
