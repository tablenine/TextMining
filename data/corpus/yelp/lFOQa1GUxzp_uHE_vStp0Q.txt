So, in my last view I advised everyone to spring for VIP.  My wife and I decided to do so last Saturday night.  We were able to exit through a "no-wait" VIP line....no issues here.  However, access to the Upstairs lounge which was supposed to be VIP only was WIDE OPEN.  There was a big lummox standing on the stairs, but did not check anyone's wrist strap.   People without wrist bands were allowed to come and go as they please, which overcrowded the VIP lounge!  I am upset because the club scene in ATL is a scam.  You never really get the "whole-truth" until you get to the club.  I will not be going back to Suckie Food Lounge.
