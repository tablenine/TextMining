I'm going to stick with the random comment reviews, so here goes.. . 1. I eat steak a lot and this is the best I've had ever. . . 2. The Japanese Wagyu is soooooo tender and has sooooo much flavor, but it might be too rich to eat a whole steak of it. Split one amongst the table. I recommend the American Wagyu New York Sirloin which has the best of both worlds: full meat flavor and tenderness.. . 3. As we were walking in, Wolfgang Puck was conversing with the table right next to ours. I thought he might he come over and talk with us but he didn't. It made me sad.. . 4. I normally have no shame, but pulling up to the Beverly Wilshire with 5 people crammed into the back of a 2 Door 99 Honda Civic was one of those rare times I did. I'm just glad we didn't roll up in my 88 Toyota Camry.. . Cost: $680 for bone marrow flan, warm asparagus, butter lettuce, maple glazed pork belly, a bottle of wine, 2 Nebraska ribeyes, an Illinois bone-in New York Sirloin, a Japanese Wagyu Ribeye, an American Wagyu New York Sirloin, mac and cheese, potato puree, parmesan polenta, creamed spinach, berry cobbler, passion fruit flan, and a coke
