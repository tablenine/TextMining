probably one of the best french toast i have ever had in my life. the roasted potatos were ok though.. . plus: outdoor seating. plus: valet parking (if you dont mind that). plus: awesome awesome french toast and pancakes. plus: their regular refillable coffee is not bad at all. plus: my friends had these really thick slices of bacon, like, yeah, really thick ones. so if you are into that, i heard their bacons are the best!!. . NOOOO: very, no, extreme limited options for vegetarianism. they can't even do tofu substitution!!!. NOOOO: bit pricier than regular breakfast place, but once in awhile shouldn't hurt your pocket.. NOOOO: everyone wants outdoor seating, so expect to wait.. . there it is. a good place in deed after all.
