Omg I love crawdads and this is the best crawdad place I've been to. The crawdads were delicious. It was spicy and flavorful with corn and hot links.Mouthwatering and flavorful! I guarantee you will not be disappointed. . . Parking is tough and we waited about an hour and half but it was all worth it. I do not like raw oysters but after eating it at boiling crab, I feel differently about it. If the raw oysters are fresh and prepared well, its definitely good especially from Boiling Crab.
