Category: Fondue
Some say it's the best fondue place in Atlanta.... . I beg to differ... . . Yeah it's kinda sorta neat in a Chuck-E-Cheese kind of way the way it's on a 'ship', near alligators, etc.... . But that wares off in oh like 2.5 minutes.... . The vegetarian options here are meager, and the price outrageous.. . Give me a cheap fondue pot anyday, and i'd have a better time with my fishtank thanks.
