I've been a few times now at various times of the day, and the lines are always long. But they move and the ladies behind the counter are fast and friendly. I always have pig out on both potato and macaroni salad, iced tea and lemonade, and a double-dipped roast beef with cheese.. . I've heard good things about the lamb, I might have to try it next time. I usually split a pickle if I'm there with a friend, but they are too big for me by themselves. They should sell halves.. . I like the atmosphere, it's really casual. It can seem daunting trying to find a place to sit if it's really busy, I think they have extra seating upstairs, but I've never had to go up there, I can usually find a spot at the long communal tables, rubbing shoulders with strangers who are sharing in the enjoyment of the (rumored) original French Dip.
