The lobster tempura was not very good nor was the salmon and yellow tail sashimi. The crispy rice tuna and the crispy onion albacore was good but Katsuya's is so much better. For the quality of the sushi, the price is too much.. . It's a very trendy place, good place to hang out with friends at the bar downstairs, cocktails were good. I would go there for drinks and go somewhere else for sushi.
