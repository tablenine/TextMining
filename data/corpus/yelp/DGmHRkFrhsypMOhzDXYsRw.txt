Category: Bakeries
My first experience at Canter's was couple of weeks ago. A friend was in from out of town so I thought we would try it out.  Our dining experience that day was great. The server was fabulous (I wish I remembered her name) and our food was just as great. I couldn't wait to come back. Well, I went back again yesterday and I took two more friends that have never been there before. I bragged about the food and the service continuously until they gave in. I must say I was very disappointed! Our dining experience was just the opposite! Our server was Fran. She was rude, disrespectful, impolite, and obviously did not belong in this business. Her attitude was so bad we couldn't believe it!!!  She basically told me I couldn't have fries with my sandwich. I would ask her a question about the menu and she would answer with disgust and in a disgruntled manner if she answered at all. It took everything I had to stay put long enough to eat my lunch. If you get Fran as your waitress, PLEASE ask for another. She will ruin your whole dining experience.
