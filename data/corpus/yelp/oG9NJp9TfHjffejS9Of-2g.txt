The atmosphere is a little different than what I'm used to. It's a dimly light diner and it's p cool I guess. The people that work there are friendly and have an interesting taste in fashion. The food was p good. I got the Paul Bunyan Steak and Eggs. It was good, the steak was alright, the hash browns were good and made a little differently from what I'm accustomed to, and the scrambled eggs were buttery.. . My friends had a Jucy Lucy burger and a Veggie burger. The Jucy Lucy looked awesome. It was a good sized portion and my friend added avocado which made it look so much better. He also got the onion rings which looked like the best onion rings I've ever seen. The vegetarian burger looked aight (not my kind of thing lol). . . Would come back.
