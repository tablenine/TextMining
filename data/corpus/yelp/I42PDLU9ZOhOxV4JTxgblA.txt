Okay, this is only part one of my review here, because I haven't technically eaten here, but I did spend some amazing time at the wine bar here last night and got to know some of the incredible people who created this place. The first was David Rosoff.. . Have you ever met someone and immediately realized that you are in the presence of greatness. Well, this was one of those times for me. He is an amazingly talented individual and one of the hardest working men in showbiz as they say. And he put on ELO for me, so all I can say is, you rock sir! I also had the pleasure of meeting creator Nancy Silverton (of Campanile fame) and she is a true delight. . . Now for the wines (as if there was any question that they wouldn't make their way into my review). The wine selections are amazing here and if this is the area you "have to" wait in while waiting for a table, yes please. I say take your sweet time with my table, I am perfectly happy right here! . . Another awesome part of this place is the fact that they will seat and serve til midnight! There are so few quality places in LA that serve late and folks, if you want to avoid the crazy waits here, just make it a late dining night and the wait will be much smaller. I plan to do that very soon.. . Stay tuned for part two....... :)
