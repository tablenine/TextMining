The BYO factor is definitely a selling point here.  This place gets really busy weekend nights, so reservations are crucial.  The tapas are pretty fair and coupled with the fact that you can bring your own beverages, the price point is right on.  I am a fan of the bacon wrapped prawn, but plan to have the dates for my next visit, which I hope is soon!. . The waitstaff is pretty lax, but the tapas are quick to the table.  I would suggest ordering in flights or rounds.
