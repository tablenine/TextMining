If you can stand the obnoxious crowd here, at least have some wasabi fries.. They're really the only good thing about this place, aside from the bathroom mirrors. Â I wouldn't recommend bothering with their mixed drinks as they're overpriced and my boba martini whatever had overcooked boba in it (mmm..mushy!).
