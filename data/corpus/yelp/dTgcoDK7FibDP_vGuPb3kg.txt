Admittedly, I've not made it beyond the cured meats, cheese, olives and salads - I'm a nibby-food person who needs a little sustenance while drinking (big grin).  . . If you're feeling a little fancy, this is the grown up place you're looking for.  This is the place you take your in-laws to warm up and wind down.  There's nothing stuffy about it and you're guaranteed to get an excellently prepared plate of eatable, rustic art .. . Not a fan of having to wait for a table, and the 5-6 times I've been here, I've had to wait for a table twice. Of course, I've never attempted this one on the weekend - actually, I avoid the whole strip on Friday and Saturday - but I digress, the point is that everything is consistently fantastic and although I think the little wooden bowls of salt and pepper are adorable, I am concerned about the sanitation - do we KNOW that someone did not sneeze over it or stick their finger in it to taste?  (Shrug)  It's a good thing you don't have to use it - the kitchen makes the food so fabulously that it is just a table decoration. . . My friend has had the fish and chips - she said it was fantastic (I didn't try it) and my sister very much enjoyed the flat iron steak, so maybe one day I'll be in the mood to graduate to the main courses.
