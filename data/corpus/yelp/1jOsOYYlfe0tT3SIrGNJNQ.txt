Wow. You know that feeling when you are perfectly full? Just satisfied? . . They figured it out (at least for me haha). I had the skirt steak with a red wine and mushroom sauce and it was divine. The meat was cooked just how i like it and it was decently size portion for the price. . . And the panqueques........ ummmmmmmmmmmm. I had the basic one with only dulche de leche It was almost too sweet, and i love sweet, but it was a great way to end the meat filled dinner. . . I really enjoyed dinner, the only problem i had was how close we were to the group at the next table. But it's a small problem that i didn't even think about until i starting thinking about problems (make sense?). . . And the bread and dipping sauce was original and tasty. . . You should go
