Came here again on a friday night, and it must've been the BUSIEST day of the year because nothing else would excuse the slow service. It literally was a 3 hour dinner, and my bf and I had only ordered an entree. It took about an hour to get our wine, in wine glasses you can probably get from the 99cent store. The bread that came out wasn't warmed up, in fact, it was actually cold. The stale bread I have back home was probably better. . . To be fair though, it was a busy night, and our server was very nice and smiley. The time it took for her to take our order and for her to give us our check however, was too frustrating for me to bump my review up to 3 stars. . . Overall, food was decent, but definitely overpriced. I had said before that the price was fair for the food, but that was coming from a virgin foodie. The more experienced foodie will definitely say the food was overpriced. Probably wouldn't come here again if I had the choice!
