When I first moved to LA, I ate at this place at least once a week. This place continues to remain one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. The utility to cost ratio is excellent. Some recommendations:. 1. enoki and scallops. 2. fried baby shrimp. 3. sea bass/black cod. 4. any of the skewers. I could write an entire page on this place but I think it's enough to say that you should try this place at least once.. PS The restaurant is located in this little Japanese enclave on Sawtelle so if you never been here it may be worth coming just to take a look around at the different shops and restaurants.. . ....also if you're seriously deranged after a few Kirins there is a karaoke place attached to the restaurant
