Quaint, delicious breakfast spot in an expected location...across the street &amp; facing the rear of the ridiculously blue Scientology Center. In fact you may miss it if not for this very fact. Parking sucks but once you find it within a block or two it's well worth the trip. In fact, Â a brisk walk before breakfast never hurt anybody. . . My food was perfect and so was everyone else's that I wished I had but I can only eat so much in one sitting. The three of us ate for $50 which is perfectly peachy by LA standards. We arrived at 10:00am waited about 15 minutes on Mother's Day which was no problemo. Service was efficient and quick. . . I had the skirt steak (medium), stone ground grits with gruyere cheese, two eggs over hard, wheat toast and fresh squeezed lemonade. I'm convinced that I've missed grits &amp; cheese my entire life. I'm sure to return very soon to get better acquainted.
