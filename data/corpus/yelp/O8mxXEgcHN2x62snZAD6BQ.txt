I liked it. We made reservations and went there to celebrate a birthday. . Upon requesting a better table, the staff had no problem accommodating my request (the original table was near a noisy part of the restaurant).. . The staff sang happy birthday and provided a piece of birthday cake for our guest of honor. There is also an area to hang your coats if you wish. The bathroom are located in the basement and are very nice with marble walls and flooring. The bathroom doors were a little tricky to close since they were two doors that you needed to pull together to lock.. . The drinks were very good - I had a pomegranate drink with vodka that was yummy. The food was delicious. There are many vegetarian options.  I loved all the food we had - the grilled veggies, the feta cheese and the mushrooms.  Everything was very good. The service was great.. . The ambiance is very laid back and relaxed. They are offering special rights now too Sunday through Friday (although I can't remember exactly what the specials are - too many pomegranate drinks for me that night).
