Wow, I've had some wonderful brunches and dinners here. Some tasty cocktails as well. Their menu tends to trend towards the innovative, using local produce and high quality ingredients, portions are large, and it's making my stomach rumble thinking about it. The staff is great, they book talented musicians, and I've always enjoyed my visits. It's a bit on the pricey side though, which is unfortunate, and makes my visits more infrequent than I'd like them to be.
