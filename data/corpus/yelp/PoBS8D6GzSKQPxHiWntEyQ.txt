Restaurant: Fritti
Category: Italian
This is one of my favorite places to eat in Atlanta. I'm not sure if it's a great restaurant or if the pizza is any good. I have, to be honest, not sampled much of their food because, EVERYTIME I come here, I only want the same thing. Fritti has the rarest commodity..., a perfect dish. The goat cheese croquet and micro green salad app is simply flawless. It's simple but made to order, the croquets are always cooked to the same level of doneness, crispy and golden brown on the outside with mild gooey chevre in the middle. Try it with the Rosso De Golfo Primitivo. It's a perfect pairing for a perfect dish. . . My Mother, a former restaurant owner said something to me when I was a kid, "Great food is food that bothers you when you've gone awhile without eating it." This dish is that good. It's the first thing on my mind when I get to Cabbage Town. . . The place itself is very nice, with dark decor and a massive brick oven that can make the place a little hot during the summer. They will open up the huge bay doors to cool things off but, sometimes in Atlanta Mother Nature refuses to grant cool breezes for months at a time. This isn't really a kid place, most of the simple pizzas have ingredients that your average kid won't dig. . . ***Note, they have a bar off to the right of the restaurant. If you are a local who is new to town and/or you live around Fritti now, the bartenders do a great job of paying attention to regulars and taking care of them.
