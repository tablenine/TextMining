I love baos, but the hype was not worth the hype. I would definitely pick Ippudo pork buns over the Haus Bao. . . I did want to change it up a bit so I got the Uncle Jesse Bao. Not bad, a bit spicy, but worth the crispy outside on the tofu. . . The baos are not as delicious as they look so go with out any expectations. I was very disappointed after waiting a few weeks to go. . . I would go again only if they have the buy one get one free special.
