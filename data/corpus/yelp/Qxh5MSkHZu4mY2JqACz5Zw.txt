Impressive portions. Coffee press. Indulgent flavors. Trendy atmosphere. Bring a friend to share the joy.. No one ever said it was wrong to have such a sweet breakfast with flavors I enjoy at a bar--Bailey's and Khalua. You heard right, and what better alternative to have it than in pancakes??  HUGE circles of fluffy goodness get edgy on the plate, though they are fluffy, there's that lingering texture after you eat that destroys some of the flavor. . . Pair this with their french toast, and I'm almost in heaven. I've always been a fan of french toast, and this was amazing with just the right density of bread, with a nice crust on the outside. Perfect.. . Let me choose from mild or bold coffee, from a press? I'm in heaven. Nothing tastes better than coffee pressed coffee and I was absolutely blown away by this rare standard of freshness. . . What's better? Box the leftovers for yummy midnight snacking. :)
