Restaurant: one sixtyblue
Category: American (New)
I discovered One SixtyBlue when I was searching for highly regarded restaurants with tasting menus in Chicago. This place completely exceeded my expectations. . . The space itself is interesting-- looks like a concrete rectangle sitting randomly on the side of the road, but when you walk in, you're inside a beautiful bright space with neat lighting and an open kitchen. . . But you really have to take all that in before your food arrives, because after that you don't even notice where you are anymore.  The six course tasting menu included tuna tartare (my favorite!), pork belly (oh SO good), and duck breast, among other things. Artfully presented, all the dishes were a treat for the pallet. . . The service was excellent and friendly, though a few of the runners failed to mention the contents of the dish.  The sommelier and waitress were profusely apologetic when the wine came a few minutes after the dish one time.. . After all that, they give you a print out of the menu and little bags with a small dessert to take home.  Such care!  I look forward to visiting this place again sometime.
