I have to start by saying that i haven't been to the new location yet but i went to the old one quite a few times.. . When i go to six feet under its always sitting outside on a nice day/night and enjoying views of Oakland while eating good food and enjoying a frosty beverage. The food here is always good and the service excellent. I love the crab cakes and shrimp basket.. . I can't wait to try the new location, hopefully parking is better than it was at the old place. That one could fill up quick later in the evening on particularly lovely night.
