Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I first heard about The Griddle Cafe when I saw a little piece the Food Network did on them.  Pancakes bigger than your head!  Waffles with bacon baked in them?  I must check this place out!. . They have a pretty impressive list of different kinds of pancakes.  For those who don't mind dessert for breakfast (this is me), order up their Black Magic pancakes - crushed Oreos cooked into your pancakes, then topped with whipped cream.  In my one attempt to order a "healthy" pancake, I got the Sow Your Oats - rolled oats, cinnamon, honey in the batter.  It was like eating raw oatmeal.  Too dry.  . . You must also try Mom's French Toast.  My mom never made french toast like that.  . . This place is great to soak in some of the Hollywood/LA vibe.  It gets very crowded for breakfast, so expect to catch some rays for a little bit as you wait for a table.
