There was a time when I could cook my own darn crepe, but that time has passed.  This is a fine substitute.  . My friend took me here for lunch the other day.  Neither of us had been there before, and we ducked in cause it was open in the middle of the day and not so crowded.  The patio in the back was a pleasant surprise.  It's so super cute.  Perfect atmosphere for a sunny summer afternoon.. I had a savory crepe of grilled veg.  It was light and delicious.  My pal had chicken pasta and said it was wonderful.  Didn't try the wine, but I'd be willing to go back and give it a shot.
