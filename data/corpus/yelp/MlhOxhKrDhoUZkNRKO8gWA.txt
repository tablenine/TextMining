Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
Choose your own Stir fry is not a new concept, in fact this style of "Mongolian BBQ" has been popular in other cities for quite awhile.    The concept and flow of things takes a few tries to get your food right.  Essentially you are the master of your bowl, whereby you select raw ingredients and sauces and then hand it over to the stir fry cook to finish your concoction.  The restaurant has posted suggested combinations for your culinary guidance.  The problem is not everyone is a cook, and if you put too much of something your dish will be ruined. If you truly mess up, its okay you can return to the line and start over as the restaurant is basically all you care to eat.  A nice touch here is the full service bar.  The staff is very helpful, especially toward newbies to the concept of choose your own stir fry.  My friend Michael is militant about not eating carbs, and swears by The Real Chow Baby has his lunchtime goto spot.  Parking is valet but free, there is also limited street parking.  Personally I prefer to go to more autentic Asian restaurants, but this is a fun spot to try.  the ingredients are indeed fresh, and some of the combinations I came up with were really tasty.  Easy does it on some of the sauces, they contain quite a bit of sodium and the general rule of a little goes a long way applies here.
