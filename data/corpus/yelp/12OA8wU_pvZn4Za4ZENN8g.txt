Did anybody stand in that crazy line that wrapped around the block for 10 cent sandwiches in celebration of their 100th anniversary??  . . I've been here several times and after the novelty of the historic site and sawdust wears off, the french dip sandwich is still soggy and not that tasty.  I do like the mustard though.   Other than that, I didn't think it was that big of a deal and definitely not worth the long wait.
