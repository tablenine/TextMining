Bring some Mrs. Dash or some garlic powder if you want some flavor in any of the food here. And you'll want to bring a bottle of water because the waitress won't bring you any. And cash 'because it's cash only and the ATM's broke.. . I was tripping out the first 30 minutes in here. We're sitting at the table and the waitresses would look you in the eye, kind of smile and then walk away without saying a word. Didn't bring us water, didn't ask to take an order, didn't say "be right with you" just looked at you blankly and walked by. I'm thinking "Do I have to like, say hello? Break the ice?" I'm like how am I supposed to get this conversation started? When she did finally talk to me after walking by 5 or six times without even saying a word she was pretty nice though but that was so bizzare.. . It looks like most people love the burgers but I wasn't wanting a burger. Probably should've I guess. I split an 8oz steak (because they were out of the bigger one). Got some fries with that, a giant salad with giant leaves of lettuce, like postcard size leaves you have to try to cram in your mouth. We split some onion rings and then shared a fried fish sandwich with American cheese. . . Steak: Saltless, chewy, flavorless. Fries: Saltless, room temperature, half of them so thin they're crispy as a chip, flavorless. Ranch: Flavorless, tasted like creamy water. Onion Rings: Saltless, flavorless. Fish Sandwich: long piece of flavorless crispy fish on a giant flavorless crumbly bun. . I doubt I'd be here unless I was really wanting to wait an hour for a burger to eat outside in the Summer and wanted to be ignored by some staff.
