Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Been here twice and no, it wasn't as good as people were talking about, they didn't marinate the meat at all, and you have to do it yourself and if you're not really Korean, you hardly sure of how to marinate them, so that was a hassle. The waiters and waitresses were not helpful at all and the waiting for seat was crazy, the parking was even worse, it's uphill and not enough spaces for that many peeps. Overall, food are okay but other things, not so, I would take them to another Korean all-you-can-eat buffet close by that's better than this, such as Tahoe Galbi or Guirim...
