Restaurant: Devon Seafood Grill
Category: Seafood
Devon Seafood Grill has the trendy-classy-fancypants vibe going on, but its not overly intimidating.  I tend to enjoy ambiances but focus on the food, and found this place to be a winner on both fronts.. . Pros:. * good variety of good food on the menu - Of course there are the $30 specially prepared fish dishes (its a seafood restaurant - don't get the chicken, c'mon).  However, there are also plenty of appetizing options in the $15-20 range which are just as good, just different.  At that lower range, for example you can get a tasty and surprisingly filling portion of high quality shrimp covered with Panko breadcrumbs, plus the traditional fries and a non-mayonnaisy cole slaw sides.  Very tasty- this isn't Long John Silvers (LJS) here.  The crabcakes were also exceptional - nicely flaky and not too mayonnaisy - just like how I like my women.. . *  Good seating options - the well-appointed downstairs area has a number of semi-private dining areas and comfortable seating throughout, but you'll probably need a reservation.  We were fortunate enough to wander in at a good time and grabbed a great table in the upstairs bar area for a more casual and just slightly noisier experience.  Finally, there is even a separate room with a toilet within the restroom , so if you prefer to do your business in a more private place, this restaurant is for you!. . Cons:. * smoking allowed in the bar areas - having lived in cities where they've figured that dining out is a better experience without the smell of smoke dampening the taste of the food, this still bothers me - c'mon Chicago.  C'mon...
