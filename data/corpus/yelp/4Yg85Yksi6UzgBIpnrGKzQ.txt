Good food.. . Bad service.. . While i was seated at a table for four, and there were only four of us; we were asked to pay the added gratuity that menu states is for a table of six.. . The valet is spotty and disappeared on us. We waited 10 minutes in the lot, wondering if we needed to call a taxi to arrive home. This place needs BETTER service. Waitress did not check on our table once, and the heaters weren't turned on when it was 40 degrees outside.
