The food is still good but the service? Wow. Down hill like nothing else. . . I was here on a Sunday night at an odd hour and it was a bit slow. Everything was fine when we were seated but then it was crap from there. We placed our order including drinks. We ended up getting our food before the drinks so we asked for them again. It was just a Coke and a water, nothing difficult. However, we had to ask twice for the drinks. A little aggravating. Then the side of rice was cold. Not lukewarm, straight from the fridge cold. Clearly we ask for a replacement. The first waiter acts like he doesn't understand the request. He gets another guy Â to come and figure out what the problem is. My boyfriend has to tell him in Spanish what the deal is. OK, I'm sorry, how hard is it to figure out that the rice is cold and we want another? Really? From then on the service was terrible. We ate to the sound of the bored waitstaff (it was slow) cursing in Spanish the entire time and then having the waitress practically chuck the check at us. No one came by to check if we needed drink refills, they took condiments off our table while we sitting there and in general it was an altogether rude and unpleasant dining experience from the multiple people that served us (was everyone taking a turn?). . Now, I still like the food but for shitty service like this and for the price (which isn't exactly dirt cheap), it's not worth the trouble. Step up Versailles, you're not that awesome that we can't go somewhere more pleasant for Cuban food.
