Great food but a little cramped. As I understand you need a reservation although walking from the grove we stopped in and only had to wait 15 minutes. I suggest eating there at night in fall as I hear it gets hot and there is no A/C. Plus the tables are close. The dates with bacon are great and I tried several ham dishes that were amazing! The wait staff was a little distractable with a hint of snobbishness, but nevertheless we got served quickly. I tend to like Tapas places with some homemade Sangria, which they didn't have. You can buy some wine next door at the wine shop and if you show the receipt the corkage is cheap. . Overall go for the food, Its a limited menu but everything was great. Don't go for anything else.
