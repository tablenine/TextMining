One of my favorite places to eat in Atlanta. The only downside for me is how loud it can get when you eat inside in the evenings but that's alright because they have a patio for dining outdoors when they weather is warm enough.. . The atmosphere is nice, the food is quite tasty, and you can order tapas style so you can try lots of different things.  Plus, they have a terrific selection from sushi to mini burgers, steaks to sea food, a raw bar to a regular drink bar.  This a great afterwork hangout for getting drinks with friends, local celebrities are seen here, and its a nice spot for people watching.. . I love, LOVE, their shiro magura (sp?) rolls, the chicken satay, calamari salad, rock shrimp salad...the list goes on and on. So many great things to try!
