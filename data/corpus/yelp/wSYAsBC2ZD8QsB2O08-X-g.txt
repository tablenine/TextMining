Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
There were many things I liked about Alfredo's but I can not give more than three starts.. . I love the fact that this place is an independent restaurant.  There are too many restaurants that are owned by a corporation (**group restaurant type of thing where one company is running several restaurants) and it is nice to see little place like this doing well. The owner is a very nice guy and so as all the other staffs there. You will feel very homey when you come to this restaurant.. . The pickled veggies they serve as an appetizer. Delicious! I would LOVE to know how they make them. They were one of the best pickles I have ever tasted.. . The cappuccino. SO good...... You have to order this after dinner. Forget their desserts. They make a mean cappuccino here..... . Other than that,  the food was not impressive at all. It was not bad or anything. It is just that their food did not surprise me at all. It was a traditional, Sicilian Italian food, nothing different or sensational.. . In short, this place is def not my favorite place but a reliable Italian restaurant and am happy to have found out about it. I maybe coming back in the future...... . . PS: I would not be so excited about this place for a date...The outside and the inside looks like a shack.
