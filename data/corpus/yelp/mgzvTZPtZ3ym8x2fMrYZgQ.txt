Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
I love barbeque, and I can't get enough of Fat Matt's. . . This unassuming shack has great music and friendly people. Â . . Very small place, so there's a good chance you'll have to wait a little bit, but you can enjoy the music and eat some pecan pie while you're at it...
