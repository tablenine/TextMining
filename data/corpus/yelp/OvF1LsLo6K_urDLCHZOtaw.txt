Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
Desta is a wonderful little Ethiopian restaurant on the corner of Clairmont &amp; Briarcliff (across the street from Mo's Pizza) which seems to be THE corner for Ethiopian cuisine with at least 3 other restaurants in the same shopping plaza.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but walk in and you'll find the owners have made a nice attempt to make this place a little more charming and modern than most Ethiopian restaurants.  The restaurant seems clean, the servers friendly and helpful and the food wonderful. Of course they offer plenty of tasty options for vegetarians with the Vegetarian Combo being the fave.  For those who enjoy meat- their Tilipia is awesome!  It's lightly blackened with lemon and pepper and wonderfully crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I've had other dishes as well, but the Tilipia is just so good that I can't remember the others.  There always seems to be a few friends hanging out here enjoying a dinner or drinking wine or coffee.  . Desta is a nice casual place to eat dinner with a few friends or a give them a call and order takeout.  It's a great takeout option vs Chinese!. . p.s. Desta receives 4 stars in comparison with all the other yummy places to eat in Atlanta, but among Ethiopian restaurants it's one of the best- 5 stars!
