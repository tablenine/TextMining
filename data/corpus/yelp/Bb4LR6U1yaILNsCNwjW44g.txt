Love this place. we probably come once a month! The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but the pastrami here is worth it. I would go during the day before noon otherwise it gets pretty busy. I always order the #19 with fries and split with my friend. Service is quick and can order, eat and pay all within 45-60 minutes. Before eating at Langers, Katz Deli in NYC was my fave pastrami, now I am not sure which I like better!
