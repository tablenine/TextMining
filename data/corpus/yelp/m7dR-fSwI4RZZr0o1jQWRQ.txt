Ate here a few weeks ago.  We sat on the back patio where from what i understand they built a new bar....its pretty cool.  There is quite a bit of space back there and it backs right up to Freedom Parkway and you can reach out and almost touch the Freedom Trail.   You can ride your bike right up to the patio or if you are on a walk stop by for a refreshing beverage. Probably one of the better patios I've seen in Atlanta.. . First cool thing....I'm pretty sure every beer is $3.  Thats always a positive.  To eat I had the 3 tacos for $10.  Overall you get a lot of food but to be honest the taco's were  average.  They have a pretty good sized menu so I'd probably try something else next time.. . I'd definitely go back here, but at this point cant give it more then 3 stars due to the food I had just being average.
