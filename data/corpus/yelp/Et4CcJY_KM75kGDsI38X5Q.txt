I'll be honest, if it wasn't for Man Vs Food I would have probably never  heard of this place. However, I love noodles and spicy food, so I just had to go check it out. I ordered the Soy Sauce with level 2 spice, while the rest of my party tried the miso and salt soups. I must say, the flavor of it was fantastic and it wasn't too hot where you could not enjoy your meal. Of course, that depends if you like spicy food. . . The only negative was that the service was only okay. When they did help us they were very knowledgeable and serviceable as anywhere else I have been. But the only problem was that, they sat us down, took our order, brought our food,  and we never saw them again until the end of our meal. I guess that can be understandable because it was pretty busy.. . Overall, it's not enough to detract from the experience and the great tasting food.
