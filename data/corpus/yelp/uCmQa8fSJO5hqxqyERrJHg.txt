If you want big portions and loud ambiance, without any true Mexican flavor, then this is your place. Nothing will be too spicy (the waitperson looked at me in utter confusion when I asked if they had Cholula or Tapatio, but once I clarified hot sauce, Tabasco was offered). Nothing will be too exotic (when I asked if they had agua frescas, big blank stares. Juice? Oh sure, apple, orange ...). I won't go back. Just because if I want to make an american cheese taco, I can do better at home, and I have Tapatio at home. . . Also, WAY too loud.
