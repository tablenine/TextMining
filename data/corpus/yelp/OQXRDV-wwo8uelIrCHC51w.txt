Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
This place is to die for, and the prices are just right.. Their sandwiches are good, but it's the bakery goods that really shine.. Potato Balls are amazing and so are their spinach feta pies and Empanadas.. A couple of times some of their baked goods were room temperature while others at the exact same time were plenty warm. I guess it just matters what time they were made.. We've also ordered several cakes from here, including Tiramisu, Triple Chocolate Mousse, and Meringue Fruit Torte. All were absolutely amazing!
