Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
I must admit that Courtney R. and I experienced the horrendousness at El Tesoro together so maybe it's not fair to gang up on the place but DANG, it was really bad. . . Three servers in one small room with 7 tables. THREE SERVERS and not all 7 tables were full. Our server was only serving our table and then apparently she was hanging out with the bartender watching him build a house with toothpicks the rest of the time.. . At one point, I got agreement with the girls I was with that if the food came out cold we were just going to leave and go to Raging Burrito down the street. The service was already that bad before our food ever came out of the kitchen. I just expected it would make it to us ice cold. It came out warm enough to avoid a walk out but not as warm as I would have liked. . . The food was mediocre at best and just lacking. The blackened mahi mahi could have been spicier...and more blackened. The black beans could have had more zippity doo da. The green beans and broccoli were pretty good though. I was hungry so I ate most of it anyway but I could have enjoyed it more.. . They were also out of several items on the menu which was another harbinger of doom. Can I have the brisket taco? Nope, no brisket...and by the way we are out of duck too...oh you want that wine? Oops, sorry we just ran out. . . Overall, this experience was an indicator to me that Â El Tesoro has jumped the shark unless they do some major soul searching and overhaul the hell out of the place. El Tesoro...you used to have some good qualities but now you are in the pooper with me. Now don't misunderstand. I'm not mad, I'm just a little sad.
