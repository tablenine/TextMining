my one and only stop for ramen in LA..even though there are always a long wait for table (my only con about this place)..it's totally worth it..don't be scared by their B rating and their not-so-clean place..just look at the line of people for the restaurant..it speaks for itself... . first off..their ramen is pretty BOMB (yummee) compared to other ones i;ve tried in LA... secondly..shredded pork bowl is SO DELISHHH..*drools* it's so tasty n sweet melt-in-you-mouth type of thing..LOL. last but not least..pork belly appetizer..oohh laa laa..this is bacon ala Japonese which is better than any bacon i've had..it's sweet n savory sliced meats that melt in your mouth..literally !!. . if all this good reviews haven't convinced you..MY REVIEW SHOULD !!!
