Restaurant: Mary Mac&#39;s Tea Room
Category: Southern
If you want southern food and southern hospitality in Atlanta, Mary Mac's is the top destination.  If you're not used to this style of southern food, be prepared for butter and salt overload.  The menu is full of classics that will clog your arteries but wipe away stress - ahh comfort food.. . The service is friendly but on busy weekend lunches can be a little slow - there will be many large groups and excellent people watching.  I found the prices reasonable.  The portions may seem small at first but dive in and you'll fill up quick, especially if you get southern style sweet tea.  If the portions were much bigger they might have to put a defibrillator at each table.
