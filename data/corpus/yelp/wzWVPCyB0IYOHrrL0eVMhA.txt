WARNING:  If you're watching your weight or have a general disdain for heavy food, then this place isn't for you.. . I had passed by The Griddle Café for years before I actually ate there.  I wasn't too interested in trying this place, because I refuse to stand in ridiculously long lines (unless $100 bills are being handed out). However, a couple of friends suggested this place and we decided to go there on a weekday morning.  We were seated right away. . . I ordered eggs and turkey sausages. My friends ordered the French toast and the pancakes (I can't remember the exact kind, but I recall apples and cinnamon). The portions are huge! The French toast and pancakes look like they're on steroids. I had a taste of both. The breakfast really lives up to the hype. Best French toast and pancakes that I've ever tasted! Also, the Irish coffee is yummy. . . I've been there a couple of times since my first visit. My suggestion is to go during the week, unless you don't mind waiting in line.
