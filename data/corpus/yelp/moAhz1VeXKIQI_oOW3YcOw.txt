LOUD. I have eaten here once, when there was outside seating, and it was okay. I don't normally like Chinese food, but this is a low-on-grease restaurant. They have a few vegetarian dishes which are pretty descent-- nothing too special, and I only go there because I live across the street. I wouldn't go out of my way for this place. Even when I go to pick up my food, I have to shout my name and have them repeat the amount, it is seriously that loud in there. I'm under 30 too, so I don't know who they are catering to with this loud music. I think this is supposed to be an "atmosphere" place, but I can't imagine going there are shouting across the table. Â There's got to be better Asian restaurants around.
