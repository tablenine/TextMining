Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
When my friend from NorCal comes to visit he likes to dine at different eateries in LA and today we took him and seven others to Roscoe's.  We were surprisingly seated in about 5 minutes.. . We all mostly ordered the number 1 which consisted of the famous chicken and waffles (I opted for the dark meat).  This along with freshly squeezed OJ came to about $15.  The chicken and waffles were good, but I think my southern bred palate says, "I've had better.". . Overrated is the word I would use to describe this place.  It's mentioned in a movie or 2, media hype pushes the place to Mecca like status and boom!!!  The masses flock to it like bees to honey.. . Ok, ok for the haters.....3.65 stars.
