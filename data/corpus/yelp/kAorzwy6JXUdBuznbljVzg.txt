Seems like I've been going against popular Yelp opinion these days, and I'm going to do it again.  Went for Sunday brunch, and came away feeling 'nothing great'.  I've been to better places for brunch, maybe it's just not Shaun's thing.  It was just....very average.. . I got the standard steak and eggs with some grits.  The steak really didn't have much flavor and even though cooked medium rare...it still somehow felt dry in my mouth.  The eggs were cooked correctly but they are eggs, there is not much you can do with eggs.  The grits were probably the best part of the meal, nice and thick and o.k. flavor.  But again...I could have went right down the road to Thumbs Up Diner and had better, more flavorful grits there.. . The beignets we started off with were inconsistent, some were cooked perfectly and others were overcooked.  O.J. was clearly fresh squeezed since I had two seeds in my glass.  The space is nice and the patio is nice, but wouldn't come back for brunch at least.
