Excellent service. Generous and attentive owner / host..  The rest of the staff seemed a bit underexperienced, perhaps?  Funny and interesting set of house rules posted atop the bar..  Busy, social atmosphere, mostly of 20 and 30 somethings.  But as an ardent worshipper of Jamon Iberico de Bellota, I was not impressed. The dry and obviously old cut jamon reminded me more of super market prosciutto than genuine jamon iberico... As an Afghan veteran stationed alongside the Galician Regiment in Herat, Afghanistan, and privy to their secret stash of Jamon Iberico, I was quite disappointed.  But the fact that it exists, in the deep south, as good in itself.  Other than the disappointing jamon, the rest of the meal was excellent. I ordered over 10 tapas between myself and my date.  Kudos to the young owner..  Would suggest that a chef makes a small show of cutting the jamon on the table, not only to advertise it, but to show that it is freshly cut.  I rmember the Spaniard Colonel cutting off my very first jamon slice with his folding knife in the Afghan sun...  It was one of my life changing momnets, in the midst of a warzone.. You can provide the same for countless others in Atlanta area...
