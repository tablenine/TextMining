Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
Eleven City Diner is still my favorite deli in the city but it's also my "go to" brunch spot as they deliver on my favorite meal of the week, time and time again. . . We were on a mission for pastrami and eggs. A friend had to have it and I knew who could deliver it. And we weren't disappointed! . . We sashayed in around noon on a Saturday. The wait was minimal and the even better news was that I was able to order one of their fabulous Bloody Mary's as we stood with the others waiting for a table. . . Within 15 minutes we were seated and pouring over the menu. My friend was ecstatic- so much so that he started calling his friends and family about this "new find". He ordered a "Hebrew beer", and spent some time with the owner (Brad) discussing some version of it that he was familiar with and wanted to know if/when they would have it. . . But then the food came up. The Tom Waits for me (two eggs, two sausage, two bacon, two pancakes- I can never finish it but I love ordering it!) and the pastrami with eggs for him. A hush came over our table as we dug into our food. . . Service is always spot on- in fact- even though there may be weeks between my visits- both the owner and the staff recognize me and welcome me back. I love that personal touch! . . I know that it's a victory when I take friends to new places that they haven't been but who then ask to go back again and again. And that's just the case with the Eleven City Diner.
