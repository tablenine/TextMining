Their is no better Corn Beef or Pastrami served West of the Hudson River than Langers. The hood stinks (literally), the hours are short and the prices are high but if you want the best in LA this is it. I order the Pastrami w/ slaw and Russian dressing - OMG!. I've been going here since I was a little boy in the 50's: I've been to Bretts, to Art's, Â to Cantors, Nate n' Als, Factors, Juniors, Johnny Pastrami and all the rest, and I'll say it again: 'THIS IS THE BEST IN THE WEST!"
