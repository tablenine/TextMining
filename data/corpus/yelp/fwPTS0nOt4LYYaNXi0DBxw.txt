Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
We've entered the atmosphere of Flo several times, nearly always for dinner.  Flo boasts a fun menu with identifiable (i.e., real) ingredients and, with just a few exceptions, amiable staff (that is to say that Flo's staff member are amiable, not that the staff are on the menu).  Our faves include the Flobimbop, the grilled calamari (a special that frequents the menu in the summer), chicken chile verde, and wilted spinach with garlic.  While we like Flo's smokey brand of spicy, there are plenty of options for your buddies who gravitate toward milder flavors.  My only critique is somewhat unfair:  Flo is too far away from us now.
