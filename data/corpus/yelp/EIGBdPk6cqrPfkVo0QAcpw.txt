My Bestie DblJ took me here after a movie. The name of the movie and the movie theater I dont remember. Mind you this was only a few weeks ago. My new schedule has hampered my review time. Anyway, I really liked my Manly Burger. Bacon always sets a burger off. The burgers are small but quite delish!! The thick fries were very thick so not as crispy as I like hence the one star off. Also the place is small so you are up close and personal with folk. Coke in a bottle from Mexico was great and the place has atmosphere. I had no choice but to dock a point for no alcohol, other than that its a cute spot. . Sadly I did not get to taste those awesome looking desserts. I will go back to try those.
