This is a great place to eat plus see a few stars from your favorite TV shows. We original wanted to go to Gladys Knights but they were closed. So we heard about Thumps Up having breakfast food. We had a small wait but we was with friends which made us a group of 6 with one child so we were OK with waiting. We were seated in the back witch was great cause we get loud. The only problems is that the only accept cash but the got an ATM for us no cash carriers. It is a small dinner with good breakfast food. While we waited on our food two celebrities came in from the TBS show House of Payne. and yes we took pics with them..lol..eveybody was full or more like stuffed. Will return with more friends soon..
