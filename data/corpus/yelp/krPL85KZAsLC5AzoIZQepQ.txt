I shit you not, I went to Fred 62 twice in one day.. . My partner and I went to LA for an interview with a film school he'll be attending in the fall and prior to that, we met up with our friend in the morning, who suggested having breakfast here.. . I only had fruit&amp;yogurt + coffee since we had breakfast before leaving San Diego and I could not squeeze some good diner breakfast in my full tummy. (Shame shame for not ordering a real meal).. . Hours later we came back for lunch (ha!). I was just so amused at the server's confusion...wait...were you 3 here earlier...?. . Had a delicious burger+fries for pretty cheaps.. You really can't go wrong with diner food, but this place goes extra right.. The service is also great.. Please, just give me my food, no attitude, no ass kissing. Kthnx.. . I absolutely also LOVED the one the server's t-shirt: "We serve crackers.". Let me tell you, as a Latina, I often feel alienated from "mainstream white culture" and all the wine-tasting these people love to do (why taste? JUST DRINK IT UP who gives a shit if you don't like it as long as it gets you get fucked uuuup!). Things like that t-shirt, remind me that I am not invisible, or a piece of shit.. . I'll be coming here more often :)
