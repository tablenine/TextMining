Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Deep dish pizza is on my top favorite foods to eat, and Giordano's is famous for having great deep dish pizza.  I have eaten here a few times, because their individual lunch deep dish pizzas are quick, inexpensive and they fulfill my need for a pizza fix.. . Why do i give them 3 stars only?  For starters, the service is terrible.  Each time I've gone to this location, our waitress was rude and slow.  The ingredients are mediocre quality and the price for a regular pizza is not worth the cost.. . 1 large pizza will run you about $30+.  For that much money for pizza, I want great quality ingredients.  . . There are other great deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago.  I'm open to suggestions on which to try next.
