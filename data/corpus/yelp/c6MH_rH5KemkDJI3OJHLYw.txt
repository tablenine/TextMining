After a recommendation from Laurel P (there I go name dropping again)I decided to finally roll in after a mimosabash at Moonshine yesterday afternoon. . . I walked in to the delight of some of my favorite hip hop jams of the 90's playing from the speakers. Since we were filled with mimosas, we asked if they served them as well. They did! We ordered 2 flamkuchen pizzas, which includes bacon &amp; carmelized onions and we had goat cheese added as well. All of their pizza is about nine inches, which basically comes out to 6 slices.The pizza was delicious and was devoured by three of us in a matter of minutes. . . This place is quite a delight. The setup is very cool and I love a place with huge windows to stare out of. The server was very nice, but I cannot remember her name. Nothing like a snowy, lazy Sunday afternoon enjoying pizza and mimosas while listening to Outkast's "Elevators".. Can't wait to go back!
