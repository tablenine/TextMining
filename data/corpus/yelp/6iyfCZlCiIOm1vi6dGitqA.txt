OK, let me start off by saying that I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, nor am I a healthy eater. My idea of eating healthy is dabbing my pepperoni pizza with a napkin to eliminate some of the grease. That being said, I like RFD. And, no, as soon as I set foot inside this mecca of health and responsible eating I did not fall quivering to my knees like Superman to kryptonite, storming out and stumbling/whimpering into the greasy arms of Norms down the block. I  actually enjoy their healthy fare (shock! awe!). .     I love the Salisbury Seitan with the mashed potatoes/gravy and excellent Caesar salad. Did I say salad? Rarely does that word escape from my lips except in mockery and contempt. But at RFD it just feels so good. The seitan dish is a very good responsible substitute to a hardy meat and potatoes meal.. Bottom line: RFD proves that healthy (vegetarian) food doesn't have to be neither bland nor boring (or scary).
