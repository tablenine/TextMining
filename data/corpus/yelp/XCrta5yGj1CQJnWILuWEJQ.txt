My Yelp friend Dachs and i went here for lunch.  Dachs is more of a food critic than i am so read her review for more details.. . Small place, there were only 4 tables inside and a couple tables outside.  We sat inside and it was alright, but the smell of the kitchen made up for that-yummy!!!.  I had chicken curry sandwhich with a side salad and it was the BOMB!  Each lettuce had ta taste of dressing, the chicken was not dry, just right, the bread was perfect.  Dachs had the same thing, but as a salad.  . . Hmm...now that i think about it, why didnt we order dessert, Dachs?  Sorry, i forgot, especially since i know you are a dessert person.  Well, we have to go next time, for sure, and we will take Abs with us !!!! :)  (I was distracted of thinking about our foot massages. LOL) . . It was a fabulous place for lunch, highly recommended.
