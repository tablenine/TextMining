Philippe's, I pledge my unwavering loyalty to you. For 53 years you've never failed to satisfy my craving for your double dipped pork sandwiches, sweet coleslaw, and yellow-fire mustand. I wake at 2AM craving you. I think about you when it's been awhile. I long for your sawdust floors and bargain cup of coffee. Even if your food didn't make me swoon and sigh, I'd give you five stars just for longevity and that "old LA" feeling. Although I've tried others across the nation, no one has ever come close to your scrumptiousness. Your flavor has remained unchanged. Yes, as the years have passed, your meat has gotten thinner, and your price has escalated, but you've managed to hang in there, old girl.  And your candy counter! I WANT those old display cases, especially the Life Savers' rack.  . . There's no need for me to ever try anyone else. I love you.
