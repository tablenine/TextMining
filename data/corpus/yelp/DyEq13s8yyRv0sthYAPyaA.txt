Category: Lounges
Was invited here for a work dinner, which seems like a popular reason to visit N9NE in West Loop.  The downstairs long bar is nice, the big spectacle of a round bar in the middle is empty, so I don't get its purpose.  Overall, the place has a Space1999 interior, meaning cold and modern but it borders on being peculiar.  The kitchen though, was fantastic and that made up for everything.  The service was good.
