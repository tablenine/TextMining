When I first came here 3 years ago at their old location a few stores down, the quality was actually a lot better. Now, I don't know if its too big for them to manage, but everything is so dirty. We will always find leftover food still on the bowls and plates. We even found a lipstick stain on one of the cups once. And the food just doesn't taste like it used to. They have a big menu with many choices though, I give them that.. . Now, it's their drinks that have me coming back. The taro sago mixed fruit smoothie is sooo goood. They always use fresh fruits in their drinks instead of powders, which makes their drinks taste 10 times better. The drink line is always out the door, while there is hardly ever a wait for the resturant.. . I give them 2 stars for the food and 4 stars for the drinks, averaging out to 3 stars.
