Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
It's places like Bottega Louie that make me wish (for a split second) that I actually lived in LA.  Where else can you have an AMAZING brunch experience, people watch like crazy, AND be able to wear 4inch stilettos to breakfast and not have anyone judge? ;). . My friend and I split 2 dishes - one savory and one sweet - which is the best way to brunch.  . - The lemon ricotta pancakes are SO delicious.  It's so light and fluffy and comes with this blueberry compote.  Om nom nom nom . - The Farmers Market Breakfast is also a must-try.  The eggs are poached perfectly and you don't end up with some greasy egg dish.  The vegetables are all so fresh!. . The ambiance is fabulous.  The service excellent.  Now if only I could transport this place to the Bay...
