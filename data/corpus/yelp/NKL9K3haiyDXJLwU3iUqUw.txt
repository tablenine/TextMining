I decided to eat here after reading about the "great atmosphere". So i was curious about what people thought was great. And as for service, the servers were all real nice, and didn't get impatient when my friend asked for a pink sauce and tried to explain it to the server who already knew what she was talking about. There was also this guy other then the server who walked around refilling beverages, wiping crumbs off the table, taking used plates. This is the first place i'v been to that has someone other then the server walk around and clean up after everyone, so i thought that was real neat. . And i did enjoy the atmosphere, it was not too loud, but not smothering us with silence. It was just perfect for me and my friends to chat, i could even nurse my infant (with a nursing cover) comfortably. . So the five stars for the service and atmosphere. In regards to food, it was good, a bit on the expensive side, but i think the money went to the great service as well as the food. I ordered the seafood risotto which has really juicey clams and small mussels, the rice itself was great (it tasted better then the fake paella i made with safflower, my sister loved my fake paella but i am way pickier then her) and the dessert was nice. . And a note, there was no elevator so a hostess had to help me carry my stroller up the stairs, it was interesting.
