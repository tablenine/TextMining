Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Huge room full of long tables with a beautiful tank of fish and a crazy mix of Thai and Elvis decorations.. random! The food was sooo good! Chicken panang here is delicious and has the right consistency. The price is right and you don't wait long for the food. I have never been to eat here at night, but I am sure it gets packed. We had to valet in the parking garage which was really weird... but whatever the food was so worth it! I will definitely come here again!
