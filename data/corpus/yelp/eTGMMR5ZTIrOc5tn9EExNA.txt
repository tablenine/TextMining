Restaurant: Chego
Category: Korean
Based on the many positive reviews on Chego, I went there with my girlfriend and cousin. It wasn't terrible, but $9 bucks for rice, which was better described as porridge and some mint leaves with Korean seasoning is pretty retarded. I ordered the beef bowl and thought my meat portion was slim, but compared to Â my gf's and my cousin's I probably had twice the amount. They ordered the pork belly bowl which came with 2 pieces each. Each piece was about the side of cherry tomato. If you decide to eat at Chego, I hope you have a better experience then we did. But do yourself a favor and go to KTown.
