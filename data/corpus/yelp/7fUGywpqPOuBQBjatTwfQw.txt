Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes!. . Sorry. I had to get that out of my system. Boy do I love pancakes, especially the ones at Griddle Cafe. . . Food: For about $8 you can get a trio of pancakes that are 4-5 inches high. They're so light and fluffy that they're unmistakably products of the old pour and flip, but their hugeness is deceptive. If you don't look closely enough you might mistake a stack for a true cake. Several pancake toppings and batter mix-ins stand out on the menu including oreos, berries (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ), Kahlua (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ), and espresso. The salad (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ) is also yumtastic and comes in huge portions. They also serve lunch items like burgers (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). . . Service: Pretty slow which isn't surprising given the crowds, but attentive to your needs. . . Atmosphere: If you have 5 people or more you might get a seat in the back rooms (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ) which are decorated in a faux urban decay paint job complete with plush couch. I was kind of grossed out by the couch; it's just asking to become a syrup sponge. Also, it was freakishly cold in that room and there was a door to an office on the side which employees kept trying to open unsuccessfully. Together, this gave me the impression I was in a meat locker, potentially holding stone cold dead mafia victims behind that door. It was awesome. . . Parking: There's a lot right behind the restaurant. You enter it on Fairfax. . . Synopsis: I already want to go back, but parking and the wait here sort of sucks. Pancakes!
