This place is great.  I found it by accident when I was wandering around one Saturday.  Service was quick and friendly, and the food was great.  The Cazuela De Queso appetizer is a cardiologist's wet dream.  Giant bowl of melted cheese with a ton of yummy greasy chorizo on top.  How can you not love this.  Of course, I always try to get variations of chorizo and cheese (chorizo con queso, queso fundido, or whatever they happen to call it) at all the mexican joints I go to, but this is one of the best.  For an entre, I had the El Grandioso Burrito "Suizo".  Being the stuck up foodie that I am, I cannot resist any dish that has "El Grandioso" in the name.  It was very good, and the chicken was shredded and tasty, not the bland stuff you get in some places.  Prices were absolutely resonable as well.  Overall, this place has found a permanent spot on my list of places to go within walking distance of my house.
