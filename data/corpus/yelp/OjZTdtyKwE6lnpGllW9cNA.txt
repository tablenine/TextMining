Most of the food is not bad, but completely unremarkable. . . One glaring exception, however, is the matzoh ball soup which is supposedly based on the owner's mother's recipe.  I don't know what kind of Jewish household he grew up in, but this is the blandest soup and the least fluffy matzoh ball I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot).  . . Not bad for what it is -- the fiancee likes the tuna melts and raves about the "big salad."  But if you want authentic Jewish deli food in this neighborhood, head to Manny's instead.
