Came here because my cousins (Illinois born &amp; raised) said it's a must have, especially for an out of towner like me. When we got here I was surprised at how long the line was, it was definitely worth the wait though. When my cousins asked me what I like on my hot dog my first answer was "ketchup" and they laughed, so I guess putting ketchup on your dog isn't the thing to do out here? It's cool, I managed, and it was still just as tasty. I'll for sure make another stop here on my next visit.
