Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
Spacca Napoli is consistently fresh &amp; delicious.. I'm especially fond of the margherita pizza &amp; house salad.. Service is friendly &amp; quick, but can be a bit pushy during peak times. . I'd definitely recommend sitting on the outside patio with a glass of wine = )
