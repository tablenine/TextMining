Every visit has been terrific.  The "peel and eat" shrimp (or you can have them peel 'em) are incredible.  The cocktails with fruit juices squeezed immediately after you place your order are must-trys.  And the mussell and chorizo dish was so good I wanted to lick my bowl in the restaurant.. . Service was a little slow this time but at 9:00 p.m., the place was still packed to the gills with more people trying to get in.
