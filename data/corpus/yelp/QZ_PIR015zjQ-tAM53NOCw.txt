Restaurant: Thumbs Up Diner
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
-1 star for freezing temperature in the diner. +4 stars for a solid breakfast, great coffee, friendly near telepathic service and rich menu.. . On the advice of a fellow Yelper I tried Thumbs Up Diner mid-week rather than on a busy weekend morning.. I was STARVING when Mr. Man and I arrived at 10:30 and to our surprise there was a wait for a table even on a Wednesday.. We snagged two seats at the counter and were brought hot delicious coffee in adult size mugs right away.. It was hard to decide what to order amongst the biscuit sandwiches, southern goodies and build-your-own breakfast choices.. When our server came back to take our order I closed my eyes and let my finger drop onto a page of the menu. With so many people eating delicious looking food around me and the constant in and out of folks picking up to-go orders I didn't think I could go wrong.. I ordered the Farmer's Scramble with a whole wheat biscuit on the side. Mr. Man ordered the chicken and waffles. He LOVES fried chicken. Like in an obsessive way.. We warmed our cold hands on our coffee mugs and within about 15 minutes our food arrived.. My plate was bigger than my head and though I couldn't finish it I really enjoyed it. I loved the fresh chopped dill on top of my heap of eggs, potatoes, sausage and cheese.. I managed to get a bite of chicken off of Rob K.'s plate and it was mighty tasty though he said it could have had more seasoning to it. . . All in all a good recommendation though I don't know if I'd wait a half hour on a Saturday morning. I get really cranky when I'm hungry.
