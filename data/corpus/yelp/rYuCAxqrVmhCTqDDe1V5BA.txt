Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Mary's is good.  But it ain't that good, sweeties.. . My larger complaint is due mainly to the pricing.  These are burgers.  They are not steaks, and thusly I don't necessarily want to pay $13 for ein burger, mein herr.. . However, they are tasty and come in a wide variety.  I suppose you're largely paying for the ambience here-- which is a receipt in a shoe.  Clever.
