Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Absolutely in my top 3 favorite restaurants anywhere.  Toast can do no wrong!. . I went to college in Chicago but then moved back to the east coast.  Now every time I go back, I go to Toast - once at the very least!  I was in town for Lollapalooza and the Stuffed French Toast made a wonderful start to my Friday AND Sunday.  The Orange Juice is bright and tangy, and the "Monster" Bloody Mary tickles the back of your throat in a perfect Sunday morning way.. . Get there before 10am to avoid a long wait, any later than that and expect an hour to an hour and a half.  But don't worry, there's plenty to do in the area while you wait!  Give your name to the very (very!) cute greeter, and then wander down Webster, Halsted and Armitage to find really cute shops.  You can also swing by Oz Park to see the statues of the "Wizard of" characters.. . The Pesto Eggs are also a good choice.  I hope to branch out my orders, but so far I can't bring myself to get anything except the French Toast Orgy ("one of each") because it's so amazing.  One piece stuffed with strawberry, one stuffed with marscapone, and one stufffed with chocolate (this one will make you sigh delightedly in appreciation) make for a tasty trio, all topped with yogurt and granola (so it's healthy!!) and an array of fresh, cut fruit.. . There's no attitude at Toast, from servers or patrons.  On Sunday, I saw a surly-looking woman walk in, find out the wait, and walk out stomping angrily.  If only she knew how good it was, she wouldn't have left.  But she is the one who missed out; if she wasn't willing to relax and enjoy a beautiful morning in Lincoln Park, she didn't deserve Toast.
