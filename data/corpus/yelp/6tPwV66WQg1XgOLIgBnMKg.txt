Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
Papi's is the most authentic Ive had in Atlanta and north of Little Havana :). . Even a non pork fan would love their slow cooked pork.......and the Bistec is excellent.  The milkshakes are absolutely addictive!. . Only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the crampedness and the speed. I would love to see them expand now that the Havana Sandwich Shop is defunct . . (or did they just relocate and no one told me :(). *disclaimer*  I havent been to Mojitos yet, and its been over 4 years since Ive been to Coco Loco
