Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
so... I've been trying to eat at toast for the past year, but the wait is always too long and I'm always with a group larger than 2. I finally decided to wait it out with my parents (2 hours) because I had heard so many good things about the place. . . Well, I will say the food was delicious, but its what I like to call "fancy brunch" and I'm more of a "down-home" brunch type of gal. So, if you are up for something a little different than regular brunch then this is your place, but if you want biscuits and gravy head somewhere else
