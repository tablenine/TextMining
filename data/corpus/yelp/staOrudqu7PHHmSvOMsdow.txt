Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Everyone who likes garlic should try this place at least one for the novelty factor.  Parking, like most of the restaurants on the row, is exclusively valet.  The decor inside is grandiose and over the top, but sitting at one of the little tented tables does have that "cutesy" factor that the girls may dig.  The meal starts of in a promising way, with two types of small rolls, one with a broiled sliced garlic topping, and one without.  The garlic olive oil has a nice hint of garlic, but the garlic parsley spread is delicious.  That and the garlic ice cream are about the only worthwhile items I've had here.  The garlic ribs were unremarkable, overcooked, and I was unable to taste much in the way of garlic.  The lamb shank was equally unremarkable, and was also overcooked.  The cauldron of garlic and butter steamed clams was my third attempt at bat at the Rose, and this was far better compared to my prior two entrees.  Only thing is that I felt like a seagull after munching on a vat that seemed to have at least 40 clams inside.  At least my girlfriend likes this place, and if it makes her happy, I'll be back.  Maybe the fourth time is the charm?
