This place is just as good as any hotdog place in and around chicago. Every once in a while I find myself in the area really late and feeling like eating something terrible for me. There is no better place to indulge late at night than this place. . . The 2 star subtraction is for the people. You are gonna get full fledged deuchebaggery from all angles over here. From the anti-ketchup nazis who think they are cool (like the a-holes at the Weiner circle) to the clientele. . . Being in the River Grove area you are going to have a very high percentage of guys named Mikey and Tony who drive IROC-Zs, slick back their greasy hair, puff out their flabby chests, wearing wife-beaters and dragging along their over hairsprayed, fake-baked, girlfriends (with a 96.5% of being named Nikki). This can turn your stomach and ruin your appetite if you let it. . . Other than that if you are around go for it. After all, a hot dog is a hard thing to f up.
