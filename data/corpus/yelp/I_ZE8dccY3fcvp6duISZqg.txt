Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Benefit of the doubt here with the 3 star since they have the spiciness level choices, but other than that I really cant say that their Ramen was anything spectacular.. . The noodles were more like spaghetti noodles than any other Ramen I've ever had, and the fact that I had to pay extra for an egg and an extra piece of pork. I really didn't get many noodles in my bowl anyways. more bean sprouts than anything to be honest.. . The atmosphere was fine and the servers were very nice and friendly. We went on a Wednesday evening around 9 and there was no wait. Food came out in under 10min.. . all in all it was OK, but I don't really see myself going back anytime soon.
