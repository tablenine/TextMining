Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My favorite restaurant! YOU MUST TRY IT.. . PROS:. 1. BIG portions. 2. GOOD prices . 3. Best french toast (fluffly, moist, thick challa bread). 4. Best pancakes (humungus and various flavors). 5. Best sandwhiches (thick soft challa bread! The chicken sandwhich is great). 6. Best coffee- French pressed Coffee- unlimited refills!. . CONS:. 1. Some pancakes are TOO sweet. Omelettes aren't that special :/ Orange juice is too small.. 2. Dangerous place for healthy eaters. 3. Parking can suck- go on the residential streets closeby, but read the signs. Or try the back lot shared with CVS/some other big store.. 4. Usually long lines
