Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
I think this is the best pizza I've ever tasted.  . . My favorite was the margherita with pepperoni.  The pizza was huge, but that didn't stop us from devouring it shortly after it arrived.  Because the interior of Antico is so small, I might suggest ordering your pizza to go, but I had a great experience just sitting at the family-style wooden table and eating my meal off a flat pan.
