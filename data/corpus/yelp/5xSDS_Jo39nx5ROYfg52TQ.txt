Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Back in high school when I was craving Roscoe's and didn't feel like driving out to Hollywood, I would come here with my friends. I even had a birthday dinner here with a group of 12. They don't normally take reservations but I called in a couple hours beforehand to let them know I had a bigger party coming in and once we got there we were seated right away. VERY accommodating! They also gave me a slice of sweet potato pie as my birthday dessert =). . Clientele here is a bit more diverse, which is not a surprise considering the area it's in. But I always get that homey vibe whenever I come here.. it's like we're having one big family dinner but we're sitting at different tables, haha. Unfortunately, I have to take away 1 star for the mac and cheese. For some reason, it's not nearly as good as it is at the other locations. But I still love this place and won't let mac and cheese get in the way!
