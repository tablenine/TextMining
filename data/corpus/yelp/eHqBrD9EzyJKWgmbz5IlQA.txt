What can I say I love getting a beef double french dip sandwich here with some pickles and the potato salad with a cold coke. Just in case you are wondering this place is so good its always packed with cops and firemen. They always know where to eat! The decor is total dive with train stuff on the walls and wood chips and sawdust on the floor. The place only accepts cash and can be slammed. Be careful the spicy mustard on the tables can be very very spicey. The parking can be tricky but they have two lots and I usually find a space. . Since I am not downtown in the day without meal plans I don't get to go here that often.
