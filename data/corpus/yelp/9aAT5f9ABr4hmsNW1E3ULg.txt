Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
Came to Antico... Yes, It was good pizza...was it the best pizza I've ever eaten...NO. The crust was too doughy. I usually like my pizza dough a little crispier and more flavorful ...basically Â the entire pizza had no flavor. Just lots of gooey cheese and dough.. . They say you have to eat the pizza HOT to enjoy it...but when it was HOT it was a gooey mess. Everyone says that this pizza is AUTHENTIC ITALIAN pizza like it's eaten in Italy.... I would love to visit Italy one day BUT for now my taste is more accustom to affordable pizza, with more flavor and not so doughy crust, that I can sit down and enjoy.
