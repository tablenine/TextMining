Steak TAco Review:. . Steak: incredible. Very flavorful, and a bit salty - but after adding a bit of lime it all complimented quite well.. . Salsa Verde: Amazing! and very unique! A bit of a milky-green color, with a different flavor than any other verde I've had. A good amount of kick, but with a bit of a "smokey?" flavor too. Very good!!. . I had this taco "Mexican style" and the cilantro and onions complimented everything VERY well! Probably one of the best tacos I've had - Ever.
