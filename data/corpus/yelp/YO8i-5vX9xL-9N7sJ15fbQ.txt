Five stars for Kogi not just because of the food, but rather what it's doing in regards to teaching people about social media and the LA food scene! Love the Short Rib Taco and the Blackjack Quesadilla. Stay close to the truck to wait for your order because the food usually doesn't take long if they're not backed up.. . Also here's another a tip: don't expect a short line of a truck comes to the Armpit of Nowhere, CA. Don't complain about it. Just enjoy.
