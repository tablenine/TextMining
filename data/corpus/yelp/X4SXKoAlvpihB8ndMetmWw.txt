I have always loved Shabu Shabu, but when I came here my level of Love rose 100%. . . The Beef is unbelievably tender, they're uber generous when it comes to the fixins (rice / garlic / ponzu sauce / etc).. . The only thing I don't like is the wait. If you want to eat at lunch time, make sure to be there by 10 - 1030am to secure your spot (it's seriously tiny in there). . . Who votes they kick out that trinket store next door and just expand?
