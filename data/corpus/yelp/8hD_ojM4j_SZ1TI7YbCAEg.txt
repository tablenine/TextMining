Nothing horribly wrong with this bar on my visit, nothing horribly exciting. . . Rooftop was closed off, bartenders were ok. Shots seemed tiny compared to what I'm used to, but since I can barely take a shot anyway, I was ok with it. Â The bartender closest to our area didn't really know a lot of shots. We had to explain what was in a few. Uh, isn't that your job? Where have you been lady?. . Bottled beer could have been colder. I don't think I saw any rocky, blue mountains on my friend's bottle. . . Crowd was alright but to be honest, we had such a large group here that night I was surrounded by my own. . . My visit was on a Thursday and they turned the lights on at 1ish. By 1:15 or so we were being hustled outside. Uh, huh? I was confused as to what was happening, but only until I got into a cab and saw what time it was. I just assumed lights on ment close to 2. You fooled me Market. You fooled me.
