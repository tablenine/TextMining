Came here with a happy friend of mine one night. He likes all kinds of sausages, so I'm going to leave the sausage review to him. He really enjoyed the rattlesnake sausage, gobbled it up with a smile! . . What I really dig about this place is the selection of beers they have. Specializing in Germans and Belgians, this place has hard to find stuff on tap. (Chimay White, Bitburger, PBR!) Walking in the front doors you find the grill and meat fridge. The magic is to the left, and down the hall, there you'll find yourself in one of the chillest bars in downtown LA. . . After this place we went to Culver F.O. and that place was more of meet and greet place. This is more of a, I'm gonna chill place with by buddies place. Nice and dim, loosely seated, and spacious. You never feel cramped nor do they have you shoulder to shoulder with anyone. . . The place is new so there are still some kinks to be worked out. Longer lines, limited seating, blah blah blah. Beer's good, so what can you say... and it's in arts district, so you can chill be and be hip... like the other hipster people here.
