Restaurant: Red Light
Category: Asian Fusion
I'm not much for any kind of food emanating from Asia, so I've always been reluctant to come to Red Light.  I finally was convinced to go to Red Light because she had a Groupon, but I remained very skeptical, especially after perusing their menu online prior to visiting and knowing I'd only be able to eat a few things off of the menu.  . . Boy, was I ever surprised by my experience at Red Light.  The food exceeded expectations in a big way and was truly outstanding.  We started with some pork dumplings in a sweet and spicy sauce.  They were very good, and I began to open my mind.  I had the pork duet entree with pork hash with a similar yet different sweet and spicy sauce.  This dish was certainly better than any Asian type dish I'd ever had.  She got the salmon and liked it a lot.  We also got a side of asparagus, which was also very good.  And I don't even eat asparagus!. . Service was outstanding.  They were attentive but didn't hover.  And they were extremely courteous.  Great team effort by all the service staff.. . The layout of this place is similar to that of Marche across the street.  The decor is kind of cool but not quite as cool as Marche.  They do have a nice, long bar here where about 10 people can sit.  . . The only thing that would keep me from coming back here more than once a year is the price.  It was approximately $100 for the two of us, including two beers and a dessert if you didn't include the Groupon.  If you have two people throwing back wine or drinks you're looking at close to a C-Note and a half when you consider your tip.  So it's a bit pricey.. . Overall, I give Red Light four stars across the board for service, ambiance and food.
