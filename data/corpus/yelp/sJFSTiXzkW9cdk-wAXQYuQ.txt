Restaurant: Marietta Diner
Category: Diners
If you take anyone here, and they cannot find something they would like off of that 10+ page menu, they are WAY TOO picky! As mentioned numerous times, the Marietta Diner has the best assorted selections of food that I've ever seen in one single place. Greek, seafood, American, Mexican, 'round the clock breakfast....Every time I order myself a meal their, I have take home for a second meal :-) I believe that makes it well worth the price along with the great tastes. The only bitching I have (along with others, and the ONLY reason they don't get 5 stars from me) is the service. It seems to be "that time of the month" whether they are a waitress or a waiter.. If you can ignore that, you will be happy you tried the Marietta Diner!
