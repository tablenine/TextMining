Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I was so excited to try what everyone has been buzzing about one of downtown finest, Bottega Louie. The hustle of this place reminds me of the Sopranos, American-Italian New Yorker down to business. All the pastries, desserts, sandwiches, and cold food to-go are right at front for ease and convenience. and I really like the decor of elegant white cleanse and uber high ceilings.. . As I walk in, I immediately drool over those rainbow macaroons in neat row calling my name "rescue me!!". . I bet the desserts are delicate and filling, however the brunch has failed to impress me. To say the least BL don't have the variety nor novelty on the brunch menu. The taste and quality just okay and I can't say I liked it.. . Hopefully Bottega Louie won't let me down next time for a round of dinner or lunch. I'm not giving up on you yet!
