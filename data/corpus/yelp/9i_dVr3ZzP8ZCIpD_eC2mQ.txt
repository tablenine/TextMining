Prepare yourself for the best grilled cheese you have ever had.  Several kinds of cheese, thick bread, no silly low-fat misguided shenanigans, just pure old school eating joy.  Add to it a bowl of tomato soup....they are so genius at Silver Cloud they have already read your mind and paired these two things together.  You are back in 3rd grade, friends!!  . . Fast, friendly service, good prices, easy to get a table always, and great Bloody Marys to boot.  You cannot go wrong with Silver Cloud.
