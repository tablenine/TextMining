Restaurant: Roebling Tea Room
Category: Coffee & Tea
awesome tea selection, awesome ambiance, and a great food menu make this one of my favorite places to chill. what a relaxing place! the plants and slightly dark *gloom* and music....just awesome. . . it's a little off bedford, so you need to be looking for it to find it.... except Â that's not how i stumbled upon roebling tea room - i got lost! haha. as usual. getting lost is fun though because you get to find new cool places!. . even the hipsters here are nice!. . brunch is really chill here too. can't wait to come back next time in in nyc.
