This is by far my favorite breakfast place in the city. All of the food is reasonably priced and quick! I think that I've had everything on the menu (with the exception of the french toast....french toast and frosted flakes??? no thanks) and all of it is awesome. My two favorites are the biscuits and gravy, and the red beans and rice. Yum. Their freshly made lemonade is really good too. Hell, all of their smoothies and other fresh fruit juices are absolutely delicious. . . This place does usually get pretty crowded by 10am. Earlier on really nice days. And don't expect your waiter/waitress to be super attentive. All of my servers have been good in terms of making sure my coffee is always filled and taking plates away. But seriously, don't expect a ton of interaction with them. Also, don't come here for a little alcoholic fixer-upper on a Sunday morning. No booze before noon.
