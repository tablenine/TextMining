LOVE this place!  One of the best places I've had Mexican food.   I always wondered why this place was always packed, but its totally worth the wait.  Their flour tortillas are made fresh, so they're soft and fluffy like everyone else said.  You could even watch the guy make them.  Their chips and salsa are awesome!  Fresh, thin and delicately crunchy.  I had one of the specials that had beef fajitas with bacon wrapped shrimp and it was DELICIOUS!! Good portion size, so I took home the rest.
