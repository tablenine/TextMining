Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I have never been compelled to write a review - until tonight - about Gingergrass.  This restaurant has gotten my money and patronage since opening and used to be my favorite place to eat - fresh, tasty food, reasonable prices, nearby location, you know, all good stuff.  . . But never in my life have I personally witnessed a restaurant fall so far from grace, leaving me with only the hazy memory of its former glory.. . First, the food is so saturated with a salty, saucy coating that most all the dishes taste the same...  Now I am not a horse, but you may as well serve up a salt block, garnished with a sprig of alfalfa.. . Second, there has recently been a mysterious shortage of rice.  On several occasions I've been told they were out of rice, and would I like something else?  Certainly not!  I am Asian, and I need rice with my Asian food!  Whoever takes charge of rice I deem unfit for Asian food service till the end of time.. . Third, if I wanted to listen to new age trance on loop all night, I'd be at my little brother's high school rave party.. . Fourth, although I don't eat at Gingergrass nearly as often as I used to, the food still manages to give me horrible indigestion EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Maybe I'll post my next review on LA's public health page.... . Slowly but surely, another one bites the dust.
