Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
Great place.  Not only does Ping Pong pack in a good value, but the atmosphere takes you to New York for a night.  The waitstaff can be a little short at times, but again, it just adds to the NYC feel.  Excellent vegetarian options, and the potstickers are great.  . Grab a bottle of wine at nearby Kafka, have a great three course dinner for less than $20/person, and go to The Closet across the street - perfect night out in Boystown.
