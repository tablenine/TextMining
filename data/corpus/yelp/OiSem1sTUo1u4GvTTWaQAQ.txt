Apparently this is the fancier version of Cheesecake Factory (same founder), considering that the prices are slightly higher and the decor is a bit more upscale. The food, though? I prefer Cheesecake, only because the food is very, very comparable. Oh, and Cheesecake has better mashed potatoes.. . I had the Salmon Three Ways, which consisted of, what else, salmon prepared in three styles: horseradish crusted with asparagus and almond ginger, soy glazed with shiitake mushrooms, and white wine butter sauce with green beans. I know what they mean now when they say that less is better when preparing salmon. Though I do like shiitake mushrooms, the soy glaze was way too sweet and overwhelming for my taste buds. The fish, however, was really fresh. . . My boyfriend opted for the Weiner Schnitzel, which was a bit heavy for me - albeit tasty. I couldn't help but feel bad for the baby cows as I took several bites for taste. Â Dessert was the molten chocolate cake. Eek. It was too rich for my blood - wish I could've tried the beignets instead. . . Would I go back? Most likely not, as long as there is a Cheesecake Factory around. Grand Lux ain't so grand.
