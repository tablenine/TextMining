This place is awesome.  Nothing is like this place in the winter.  You definitely don't feel like your in the city, but more like a lodge somewhere in the UP.  Cheap pitchers, great sloppy joe's, insanely thick blue cheese dressing for my big ass salad, and delicious seaburger sandwich.  You don't have to go with the burgers!  Beer garden or indoors, you can't beat it.  The people who aren't fans of this place are the kind of people that don't like camping.  Simple as that.
