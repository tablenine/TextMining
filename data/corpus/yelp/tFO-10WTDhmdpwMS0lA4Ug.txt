ive been here twice and both times were like heaven.  the wait can be daunting, but its soo worth it! i had the Addicited to Noisella and Saturday morning fever.  both were so good and the portions are huge.  my friend had the blueberry pancakes and those were to die for too!! the only down fall is the parking and the waiting.  but its la, what else can you expect?
