Although this place is known as a 4 - 5 star restaurant, I give 2 star rating.  It is located in the middle of Beverly Hills.  It is very well known to see the A profile celebrities, but the service sucks.  The hostess is always stuck up and gives you an intimidating gesture.  Unless, you are a VIP member or a top celebrity,  you won't get any friendly service from them.  The food is okay.  There are some special foods that are not on the menu.  If you ever go there, try their seared tuna in a cone appetizer.  Fyi, it comes 3 on a serving tray , but it's like $30.
