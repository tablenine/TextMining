Two words: hanpen cheese.  I could binge on hanpen cheese.  This is one of my favorite places to go since I live right around the corner.  The wait is usually long and the place is always packed!  I usually get take out and eat at home unless I have visitors/friends stopping by and in that case, we stand there and wait!  I usually order: hanpen cheese [the best thing on the menu], tori soboro, chicken yakitori, tebasake wings, chicken leg and thigh, miso rice ball, black cod, miso soup, and fried scallops.  Everything here is pretty good but the service is pretty bad once your inside.  Again, I think the bad service has to do with how busy it is.  The prices are great--my husband and I can eat up a storm and only spend about $20.
