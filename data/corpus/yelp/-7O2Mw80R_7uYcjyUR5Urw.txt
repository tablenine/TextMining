I really love the mix of Mexican and Korean! I made sure not to eat much that afternoon so that my two hour wait in line was worth it. I tried the pork tacos, kogi sliders, and kogi dogs. All were super yummy and worth the wait. Not sure in a big rush to go back and relive the wait again but I highly recommend trying it at least once.
