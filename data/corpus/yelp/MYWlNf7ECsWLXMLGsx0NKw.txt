Wow. This place is really, really good. We had the spring rolls for an app, and shared the eye round and meatball pho and the grilled pork and fried eggroll vermicelli bowl. Some of the best Vietnamese food we've had, just absolutely beautiful. The herbs were screaming fresh, the nuoc mam perfect, the service friendly and attentive, and the place was packed with Vietnamese peeps. Highly recommended!
