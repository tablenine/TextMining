Not to be a debbie downer but I have totally had better sandwiches and deli salads. Their brie &amp; ham ficelles are tasty no doubt, but I find most of their 'wiches to be overpriced and ho-hum. Sure, the grilled veggie sandwich is tasty, but man, it tastes like what people expect of LA- kind of cold, kind of dense, kind of a let down. And, the cupcakes. *sigh* I have TOTALLY had better. And how about the flies that kind of trapped in the baked goods corner after 3 pm? Yes, I've witnessed that travesty. Cookies are blah too. . . I once ordered a southwestern salad here and they forgot to toss mine with avocado. After sending it back, I waited a good 10-15 minutes for some magic to happen. When there was nothing, I went over to the counter and waited for my plate. I was then chewed out by the deli counter guy who said that it's illegal for me to carry my own plate out to the table. CHEWED OUT. That man needed a bitchslap. . . All in all- it's not a terrible place. They carry Andante Creamery cheeses, they have delicious chocolates there. The cheese monger is always super generous with samples. But I don't think its the first place i think of to get food...
