I had been dating a guy a few months when all of a sudden the most awkward day in a young relationship popped up-- Valentine's Day. I get a call from him inviting me to a romantic Valentine's dinner which I happily accepted with a ton of excitement. He wouldn't tell me where we were going but insisted that I needed to dress to the tee for an upscale, exclusive evening on the town. Being a girl who doesn't like to shop (yes we do exist) and owns very few dresses, I freaked and spent two weeks trying to find the perfect dress for this special evening. Needless to say it was stressful. . . Finally the big night arrived and he picked me up and brought me.. HERE. Yes, he brought me to the Magic Castle, perhaps the most unromantic place on the planet. I was horrified. It took a few glasses of wine for the shock to wear off. We ate some old school, non adventurous food in the restaurant which was expensive and boring. Then we moved on the magic tricks. OK, so they were mildly amusing as was the piano that played by itself but come on! Why do people come here? I realize I'm a disgruntled girl who was unhappy about purchasing a dress to come here but I've been back since and still.. Is it because its "exclusive" and hard to get into??? . . Suckas!
