If you are in L.A. and haven't been, do it. It may be an experience you have never had before. Waffles AND chicken. You can eat them separately or you can eat fried chicken the way the food gods wanted you to. With waffles. I've even seen people mix maple syrup and Tabasco on top of their waffles and chicken. I haven't done it but you know what? I probably will.
