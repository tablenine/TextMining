Tap, tap.....tap, tap, tap, tap.  What the hell is that?!?!?  I heard and felt it again.....tap, tap, tap, tap.  I looked to the end of the bar where I was seated and saw one of the servers treating the end of the bar like his personal tom tom.  This was annoying to say the least.  I asked my waitress to request a moratorium on the drum solos.  She replied that the waiter in question was a drummer (as if that made it okay).  Well, he stopped, kind of.  He still tapped every now and then as if he had a compulsion or a nervous tick.  Despite all of this, my meal was good as usual.  I am not a fan of eggplant, but Spoon's use of it in their panang curry gives it a unique taste.  I do recommend this place, just don't sit at the bar when magic fingers is there.
