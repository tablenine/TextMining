Very busy during the lunch and morning hours, but well worth it.  They have great pastries with a good range of sandwiches.  They have increased their prices in the last year, but I would still consider this place a bargain.  Some of my usuals are the fruit tart, guava cheese and cheese rolls, the napoleon, the checkered cake, steak torta, and the potato balls.
