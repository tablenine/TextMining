Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Sports Bars
The perfect place for happy hour or to watch a good game, the energy is usually always insane. I've never been disappointed with the menu or the bar which are both reasonably priced. There are tons of TVs, tables, and loud hyped up people. If you need to unwind after a tough day at the office, Barney's is your spot!!
