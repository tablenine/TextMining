Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I think going on weekdays besides fridays you don't suffer much of a wait which happened for me. I can't say this place has the best tasting hot dogs but what I'm attacted to is the different varieties they have or aka "variety of ways to clog your arteries." I think everyone should try it at least once if they're in the area just for the experience and the clogged arteries. Hey you might even get to see a famous person or a wana be actor. Parking is no picnic. If I'm ever back in the area I'll probably stop on by just for the heck of it and because I have nothing better to do with my time.
