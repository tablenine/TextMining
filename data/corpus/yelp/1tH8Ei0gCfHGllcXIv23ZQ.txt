I waited for 1hr and 20min. I figured what the hell, I'm probably only going to do it once and I was suppose to be working so I didn't really mind.. . It was pretty good. The Los Angeles street venders that stand out in front of Laker, USC and UCLA games still have what I believe is the best hot dog of all time.
