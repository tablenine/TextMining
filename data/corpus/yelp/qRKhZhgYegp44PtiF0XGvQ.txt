Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Steaks were really good, but not great.  I think the quality and the way the meat is cooked is top notch here, but I find that the flavor is lacking (I tried the bone-in ribeye...I prefer the more buttery/garlic-y flavor that other steakhouses do perfectly).  If you're more into the natural beef flavor, then this place does it in spades.  Great quality meat with great service.
