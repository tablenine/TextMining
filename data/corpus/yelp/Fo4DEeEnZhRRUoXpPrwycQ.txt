I've heard about this place for years.  I finally got to try it the past weekend.  . . The hours posted here on Yelp are wrong.  They have a sign at the door posting the new weekend hours are starting at 10am instead of 10:30.  We were lucky to arrived half and hour early and were able to take the second last table from the first round of seating, i.e. we didn't need to wait at all. A couple of Americans were seated next to us, but half of their party had not arrived yet. The waitress sent them back out the door. The couple were still at the door after we finished out meal 50 minutes later. Poor guys were stood up by their tardy friends. Perhaps, they were fooled by the wrong hours posted on Yelp. I could understand why the restaurant sent them out, because if these two were allowed to stay, they would be holding the table for 50 minutes while the busy restaurant would have lost at least one round of customers for that table.. . I think this place is overrated.  The xiao long bao are good, but not good enough to deserve an hour wait for a table.  My wife has tried the DTF in Hong Kong and she said the one in Hong Kong makes better XLBs than the Arcadia branch.  . . We ordered 4 kinds of buns including the original XLB, the crab meat XLB, a tiny XLB (available on weekends only) and a dessert XLB filled with taro root paste.  We also ordered the Shanghaiese Nian Gao (which was quite good) and some noodles and couple more dishes (nothing to write home about). I also tried their hot and sour soup, and it turned out to be just sour soup.  Very disappointing.. . It is a good restaurant, but it is just not worth the long wait.
