Shockingly good!. . I'm not trying to say this is the best Thai food I've ever had, but I was totally taken by surprise with this place. First time, somebody brought carry out to work and I was looking at the menu and thinking to myself... "dang, this menu is pretty big with some crazy stuff on it I don't usually see at the local Bangkok Palace in Anytown USA." and as some man put down in some holy book along the way:. "and then he ate. and it was good". . So, I took the gf (who was born in Thailand) and we both got watery eyes without the usual begging for the spice to make it that way, which is good... and I'll eat just about anything but had to pass on the Bamboo Caterpillars. I said "maybe next time" but I'm pretty sure I was lying to her.. . We could only try so much, but it was all good and the stuff came out randomly, which I actually liked cause it felt like some Thai grannies/aunties were working hard on it somewhere and were sending it out when it was good and ready. Yes, it did take a while, ok?. . I'm pretty bummed I found this place at the end of my Chicago stint, cause I would definitely hit this place regularly.
