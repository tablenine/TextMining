I went to Luckie for a friend's birthday for the first time last weekend and after weighing the pros and cons, I figure it may be worth returning if I'm in the mood for sub-par food and mediocre music.. . Pros:. . 1. The layout is pretty functional and spacious. The VIP section upstairs is nice and open with a great view of the city and plenty of comfortable seating.. 2. The prices are reasonable. My meal fell just under $15.. 3. There was an okay helping of eye candy to look at.. 4. The staff was friendly.. . Cons:. . 1. Much of the music was sorry. I was not feeling about 75% of the tracks they played, which is probably due to the fact that they broadcast live on the radio the night I went. I hate the radio.. 2. The club became too packed. This is a problem. Greedy promoters need to learn to turn people down so the people already inside can actually have a good time without standing under someone else.. 3. I could have passed on the food. . 4. There were one too many "rats" there. I mean nasty girls with unappealing outfits, bad weaves, and no couth, dancing a little too "Magic City."
