This place gets 4 stars just for serving Shiner Bock! And the extra one is for the Tuesday night trivia night (shout out to DJ Darrin.)  The beer was the first thing I noticed (other than all the good looking men.) The great margarita specials caught my attention,  too.  I felt like I was back in Texas. It's a total "Texas" bar with license plates and chalkboards on the walls. Not your ordinary taqueria menu, but pretty close.  What's up with the philly cheesestake taco? Not the norm, but very TASTY.   Don't wear anything nice because the food is drippy and GREESY.  It's a very laid back atmosphere, anyway, so no need to get gussied up (at least not during the week anyway. I've never gone on the weekend.). Queso was so-so, but the chips, salsas, and guacamole were great.   They may have the best chips in Atlanta.. Parking stinks, and get there early because the happy hour crowd takes up what few tables there are. . Stick with the daily specials and your tummy AND your wallet will be happy.. Tuesdays are a blast! It's 90's trivia night where every 30-something conjures up memories of singing to Alanis Morrisette and when Baywatch ruled.  They play 90's music the whole time.  The manager, Kenny, greets and says goodbye to everyone as if he's the neighbor you've known forever.
