Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
solid cheap good diner food. . . eggs? check. pancakes? check. french toast? check. other random lunch/dinner sandwiches you really shouldnt be bothering with because for the love this is a diner? check . delicious milkshakes? check plus.. . i really liked this place. came over pride weekend and it was super crowded, but they turned tables quickly and the owner of the establishment came and apologized for the wait. i will definitely be headed back! STELLA!
