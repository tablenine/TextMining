"$11.50 for a hamburger?  Y'all must be crazy". . Thank you High Life Man, typically I'd agree with you, except when said hamburger is coming from Hamburger Mary's where the extra bang for the buck is apparent from the first bite.. . We stopped by this past weekend, for the first time, with my sister-in-law and 15-month old nephew in tow.  Dining outside, they were incredibly accommodating to the little-man.  In fact, 2 or 3 babies were dinning that evening.. . I had the patty melt.  Quite awesome.  Loved the bread and 1000 Island.  Hamburger Mary's can handle the meat.  My medium-well was in fact medium-well, not a hockey puck or still mooing.. . There are so many good things on the menu.  I can't wait to return.  . . Also, our service was great.  Be sure to try the Mac-n-Cheese bites.
