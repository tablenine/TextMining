Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
it's no ricky's, but during the week when you have no other choice, this place is the next best thing. not THE best. but the next best.. . it is cheap at only a buck fiddy a taco, so at least you can eat here for slightly more than the price of round trip bus fare. if i want to spend exactly 3 fingers on a meal, this is the place. it's cheaper than a smoothie. there are a bunch of salsas and toppings so that you can design your own taco, which is pretty snazzy. the cabbage is great and i liked the spicy guac. . . it is nice to sit outside and enjoy your crafty tacos, minus the hipster girl who tripped on her way in and screamed "FUCKKKKKKKKK!" and then didn't acknowledge how loud it was. personally i love a nice side of turrets with my lunch so i was cool with it.
