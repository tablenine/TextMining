I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their sashmi plate for lunch. It's only $15 - what a steal for all that fish! If you don't want to wait, you should arrive at least by 10:50 and get in line. Everyone needs to be there or else they won't seat you. Don't worry - you don't have to wait long. Their door opens at 11:15.  And shh... this is a secret - but they do take reservations for lunch. Only a few tables a day but worth it if you call ahead. . . Dinner is good too but the same sashimi plate for dinner is $26 (well you do get a little bit more food but not that much).  . . Ditch work and go Mon - Fri for lunch. Well worth the trip if you love straightforward, good quality sushi.
