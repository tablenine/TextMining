I just don't get it. This place has raving fans and long lines. To me, all the food tastes like lard. You stand in line in a big open room that is much too noisy. You order at the counter. Then you sit in a big open room that is much too noisy, hoping your food arrives quickly so you can get the hell out. But it all just tastes like lard, and you wonder why you ever stood in line in a big open room that is much too noisy. I just don't get it.
