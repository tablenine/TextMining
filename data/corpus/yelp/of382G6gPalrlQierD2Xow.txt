An actual overheard conversation:. . 45 Year Old D-Bag: Hey ladies.. Two Barely Legal Trixies: Hey.. 45YODB: So what do you ladies do?. BLT1: We're still in school.. 45 YODB: Cool, cool... I'm a semi-retired millionaire.. (TBLT have common sense to abruptly turn around and end the conversation there.). . Semi-retired millionaire?  I didn't realize that qualified for a job title.  And if you're a semi-retired 45 year old spitting game at girls that could be your daughters, shouldn't you at least be a multi-millionaire?  I mean, what does a million dollars get you in semi-retirement these days?  I'll tell you what... not much.. .
