We didn't even eat here because the service at the host stand was awful. There were two teenage girls "in charge" and when we asked how long the wait would be for two people we were ignored (they were texting and playing around with the phone)... Then, after about two minutes of us standing right in front of them, we asked again and the surlier teen girl told us "no clue." So we left.
