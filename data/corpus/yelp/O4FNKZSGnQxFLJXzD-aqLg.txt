keep lookin' for a yellow truck, you'll love the liege wafel from belgium. we are glad that belgians have invaded the gotham city but buy beware, they are expensive. they are worth like a gourmet pizza slice. bring $5 for a wafel - this includes one dinge or topping or if you have $3, go for mini-wafelini, a small wafelete with slices of banana &amp; strawberries on a stick. don't worry the menu is not foreign - you'll get used to reading like: coupe dame blanche. it will satisfy you; it's an anytime snack. i had the wafel both ways light n' crisp and the original which i like better. don't chase the truck, it leaves at about 4:30 PM and probably sold out.
