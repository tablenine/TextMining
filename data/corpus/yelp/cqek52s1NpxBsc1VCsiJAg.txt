dad and others have been raving about this place and he brought home a variety of their fattiest goods. it was delicious of course but my arteries slowed a beat a minute. we got the pastrami sandwich, the cuban, the roasted pork, and the pan con bistec (steak) sandwiches, along with the staple potato balls and meat pie (i feel dirty saying that)... but they were good. but everything is meat--friend with butter. LOL, but it is ethnic food and i take it for wut its worth, an experience. . . my fave are the cuban sandwich and potato balls... worth the trip
