Share! . . That would be my advice to any future costumer at Griddle Café. The portions are ridiculously big and very heavy. Dont buy more that one or two dishes and share them between the three or four of you.. . That said, I really like Griddle Cafe for its cozy laid-back feeling. I would definitely come again - and buy less food!
