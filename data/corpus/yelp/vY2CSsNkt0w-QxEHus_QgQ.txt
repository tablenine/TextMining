okay first off, I can do without the  valet parking, waste of money, but there is no choice. . . Basically this diner is quite a surprise! :) It looks like Silver Diner from the outside, but when you go inside, it is fancy-city: waiters in white jackets, white table cloths, fine dining. One of the best parts was that when our party was seated, I was addressed by name. :) . . We started with the Homemade Chips w/ Blue Cheese, which if you love blue cheese, this is the dish for you. Lots of flavor in this starter.. . All the dishes are very creatively served. My colleague got a sandwich and it came out on a kabob. The "Greek fries" were slices of potatoes with feta and Greek seasoning on top.  . . I got the fried chicken with macaroni and cheese and collard greens. I absolutely LOVED the macaroni and cheese. It was so so so cheesy. I looked at the table next to us and one of the kids had macaroni and cheese as his entree, I was a bit jealous.  . . The James Beard Banana Creme Pie was enough for two people to share. One piece was way too big for me.  It was absolutely delicious. There were fresh banana slices in the pie, and it was covered in white chocolate flakes. . . The Brownie Sundae was divine. The brownie was so moist and there were chocolate chunks in it. What made this so great was that when the waitress brought it out, the brownie was still hot! . . The service at Buckhead Diner was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything. She always came by our table and checked on us. She was very friendly and very nice. . . I would highly recommend Buckhead Diner to anyone that comes to Atlanta!
