I am probably not qualified to review this place, but I must say it served my purposes quite well.. . 1. It was not too loud, but not too quiet.. 2. It was not too light, but not too dark.. 3. That bartender mixed the best damn sapphire &amp; tonic I've ever had.. . Yes, ok, I admit it, my purposes were meeting someone from a dating website for the first time. Whatever, wipe that smirk off your face. Why don't YOU ask me out if you're going to make fun of me for using Jdate?
