Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Yuck. That is exactly how I would describe Penny's... Or as a girl I know put it: "It looks like dog food.". . Penny's food is flat out not good. They somehow manage to mess up every single Thai and Chinese dish they create, and the flavors are always off.. . It's not even that cheap! There are other noodle places in Bucktown that can serve you just as quickly at around the same price. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.
