EXOTIC &amp; FINE TASTING THAI FOOD WITH NICE SERVICES!. . I yelped this place decided to give it a try over the weekend.. . One of the most impressed Thai restaurant that I have been in a long while. Their dishes are all tasty and portionable. Four of us picky porkers wiped out the whole table of food clean(&amp; we weren't even fat). Prices are cheap, which add to the upside of my rating!. . Service is fantastic. The head waitress kept coming over to ask us how the meal goes. We get water service twice(rare in Thai restaurant now a days). Here are four dishes that we ordered:. . ***** Papaya Salad with crushed peanuts and cashew nuts - So good!. **** Marinated raw crab with spicy sauce - Exotic sea flavor, love it!. ***** Salty catfish pan fried with crispy mint leaves - Wow, more rice pls!. **** Battered fried oysters with bean sprouts - Kinda like tempura Thai style.. . Would go back there in a heartbeat. Too bad we live in OC. Parking might be a problem during the noontime, but there's a valet service. We being el cheapos parked 2 blocks away. Anyhow, I'll walk three blocks for Ruen Pair!!!
