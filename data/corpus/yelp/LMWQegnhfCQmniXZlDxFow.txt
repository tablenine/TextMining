This is really a 3.5 joint for me, mainly because I think I didn't go big enough.  Overall, it's a cute spot to meet up if you're not in the mood for a bar and you have a big sweet tooth.  . . The refrigerated cases held a good assortment of cakes, breads and cookies that all looked tasty, but the layout is such that the baked goods are in the case perpendicular to the cash register and I didn't see them until after I'd ordered.  Bummer, because I would have liked to have tried the Apple Sauce Spice Cake.. . As for the treats - BF and his mom got a Strawberry Shortcake Shake and a Blondie Sundae, respectively.  Both of them raved.  I got one scoop of Coffee Toffee Crunch and a Snickerdoodle.  The ice cream was great, but I think I'm spoiled by Al Gelato's Hazelnut (amazing!).   . . My feeling is that if I go back for a big shake, sundae or ice cream sandwich, then my review might hit 4.
