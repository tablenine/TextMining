Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I must say, they have some darn good dogs here. When I saw their menu I was surprised that you could have so many different styles of hot dogs. Their pricing is fair too. Pretty good spot to swing through on a late night adventure. There's always lines outside no matter what time of day or night. So be patient.
