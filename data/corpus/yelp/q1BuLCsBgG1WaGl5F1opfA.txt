Having come back from Spain and Italy just recently.. I am still having a craving for Shawarma and gooood Gelato. Havent tried the kebab yet, but the Gelato was definitely on par. I am not sure what their selection is like most of the time, but where the hell was pistachio? Great Gelato.. I hope they do as the romans and switch that sin up. . . Parking lot has only two spots, and there's nothing else around except for the worst mall on the planet and Sizzler. Hope some cool stuff props up around there soon.. . -1 star for parking and local. +4 for everything else.. Cute girl at the counter too.
