We hosted Father's Day yesterday and my dad is one of those guys who grew up in the city and thinks going to places like Bari is just the bee's knees. My husband likes to go out "exploring" the West Loop on Saturday mornings and this weekend I dragged my ass out of bed to go with him. We wandered in and even though this place is tiny, I could have spent at least an hour looking at everything they have on their shelves. . . My mom works for Barilla and they had an entire line of olive oils and tapenades that she can only get by ordering directly from Italy. How cool is that? . . We came for the sausages and that's what we got. 2 lbs of the mild Italian sausage and 1 lb of sausage with garlic and Italian parsley mixed in. Grabbed 2 lbs of Italian beef out of their fridge, some Marconi giardiniera and we were on our way. Both of the parents loved the combo sandwiches we made for them yesterday and even not being a big sausage fan, I was highly impressed. . . It wasn't crazy crowded on a Saturday around 10:30am but I imagine the later it gets, the busier the meat counter is. Â A ton of people came to pick orders up and I can tell you, we'll be one of those people in the next couple weeks.
