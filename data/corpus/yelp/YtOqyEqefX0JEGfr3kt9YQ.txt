I'm not going to repeat anything else (hopefully; I didn't really bother to read much further than the next four reviews) because what everyone's said about Hide is more or less true.. . But I will add this: Hide isn't the best sushi in LA, and on many days it's not even the freshest. Ultimately, it's a solid bang for the buck. You know that the line's going to be ridiculous and if you don't get there by 6pm, you'll be waiting outside with all the other suckers. Go early, enjoy yourself and if you are lucky enough to draw the sushi bar from the "S/T" on the dry erase board, say "waddup" to the boys who show no shame in looking at your girl, especially if she's hot.
