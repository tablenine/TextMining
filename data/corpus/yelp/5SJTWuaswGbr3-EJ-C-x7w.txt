This is one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  I started eating here when I lived a block away.  I moved to Va Hi 6 years ago, but I still try to come here once a month.  Here are the items that I love:. Appetizers - the croquettes . Sandwiches - The Cuban Sloppy Joe. Main Dishes - Ropa Veija, Boliche, Puerco Asada. Sides - Steamed yucca, Muduros. Deserts - Flan. The staff is so friendly and it's a very comfortably atmosphere.
