Thank you Santullo's, while not as good as pizza from New York, you have reminded me how much most pizza places in Chicago suck. I have gone on too long eating crappy thin crust in Chicago, and even fooled myself into thinking some of them were half way decent (Bacci I'm looking at you). Sure, there are some good places like Follia and Coalfire, but they are gourmet pizza's that never really satisfied my cravings for real New York style. I only wish I had found you sooner. . . Note: yes Chicago pizza sucks, deep dish is horrible, and chicago style thin crust is for the most part just bad. Â Plus why the hell do Chicago pizzerias cut their pizza's into little squares? What dumbass came up with that idea and how did it spread everywhere?
