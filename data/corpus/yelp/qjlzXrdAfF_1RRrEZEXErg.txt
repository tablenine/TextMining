Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
So for $1.50...its the best damn fish taco ever... and the shrimp is 2.00... and that is just as good... if your looking for a posh place...this is not it...if you're looking for a place that has a lot of variety..this is not it either... Fish, Shrimp and that it... you get to put your own topping and bam you eat...I haven't found another place yet with this quality of food for that low of the price..... . cash only people
