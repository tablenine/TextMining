I'm really looking to find somewhere like Tu Lan on 6th in SF... . . The first time I saw Pho, we made a BIG mistake by going to the Thai place next door (which was good... that is another review). Grant and I really really wanted to change directions but our friends were waiting inside.. . Pho is clean, very quick, let me stress that VERY quick and fresh. The menu is very limited and everything has rice noodles. We ordered the vegetarian spring rolls and the only cold noodle dish that was vegetarian (There is also only one hot vegetarian dish. Everything else has meat or shrimp).. . With a cold soy bean drink it made for an awesome cool lunch on a hot day.
