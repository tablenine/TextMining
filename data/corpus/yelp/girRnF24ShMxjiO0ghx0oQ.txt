*Edit*  So this isn't much of an edit or a review, but I'm really digging the chocolate pie with graham cracker crust. In fact, I may I order it again..and again..and again...or just as my main dish. Is that bad? . ------------------------------------------------. . First visit - a-ok. My friends and I felt very rushed from the moment we sat down. The menu was a random mix of things making it hard to decide. Food was good and plentiful. Scene was okay - felt like all eyes stopped and stared at everyone who walked the door. What is this - high school?  Overall not a bad first time experience for a really crowded Thursday night. I'm glad we had reservations because the wait looked ridiculous.. . Second visit: a little bit better than the first. This time I came in for a drink and ended up getting a dessert to go with it. The chocolate pudding pie hit the sweet spot I was looking for. I really loved the graham cracker crust, and I'm not a big graham cracker fan. The pudding was a nice step up from Jell-O instant mix, but it went well with that crust. What a treat to end a rather low key night.
