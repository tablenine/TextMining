Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
Sinbala has great Taiwanese food. They are famous for their sausage and casual Taiwanese cuisine. The noodles, rice dishes, and wontons are all delicious. They also have shaved ice, which is a great way to top off a meal. There's usually a line, so budget your time for that, but once you sit down, the service is prompt and friendly.
