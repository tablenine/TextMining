Fraiche is a solid 4 1/2 stars.  I love how unpretentious the environment and staff are.  I've dined here twice. Here's what was eaten (&amp; drunk): . . Day Spa - Gin cocktail that is light and delish!. Duck Rillette - So rich.  A treat.  Enough for 4 people to enjoy.. Baby Beet Salad - Very light, with homemade Ricotta &amp; hazelnuts.. Beef Tartare - Tasty. Monkfish - I liked it but thought it was a bit over done.. Branzino - Light yet flavorful.  Really surprising how yummy it was.. Lamp Spezzatino - Delectable!  Comfort food.. Pappardelle w/Oxtail Ragout - Heaven. Ricotta Fritters - So So. . They do not skimp when it comes to portion size!  Lots of bang for your buck.
