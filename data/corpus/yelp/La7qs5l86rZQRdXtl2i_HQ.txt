This is a beautifully designed restaurant that reminds me a lot of a chic new york type of space with ultra high ceilings. The problem is that they don't have an acoustical material around so the sound bounces all over the place and gets really loud inside. Every person I know that has been here has always complained about the sound. The food is good, I've only eaten here for brunch and their breakfast is awesome, simple and delicious.
