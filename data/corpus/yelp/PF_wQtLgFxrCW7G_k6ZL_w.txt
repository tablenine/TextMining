The service was ok, we sat for a good 10 minutes waiting for one of the waiters to come around. We finally flagged one down as they were walking by. Once we ordered, the food was served right away but they still forgot to bring us some beers we ordered.  Also, it's a bit loud in there and you can't really hear the Elvis impersonator sing.... . The food was really good, the portions were big enough for at least 4 people to share. The pineapple friend rice was amazing!   I was a little disappointed with their fried banana, it was a bit too hard and didn't taste fresh.. . I'll definitely be going again.
