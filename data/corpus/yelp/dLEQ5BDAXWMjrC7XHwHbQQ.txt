Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Gottatellya, I wanted to like this place.  On my trip to Japan last year, I had a ramen epiphany: a simple bowl of perfectly chewy noodles in a creamy shio broth accompanied by a soft cooked egg and tender sliced pork.  I had  a bowl at Santouka which came pretty close.  L.A. has otherwise been a ramen wasteland.. First of all, the previous reviewers are right about the service.  The young kids running the place are full of personality and very helpful.  But a ramen restaurant is afterall about the ramen, right? The noodles were more floury than chewy, really a little disappointing for all of us.  Perhaps requesting "firm" would have turned out better.  The shio broth was quite good and rich.  My main beef is really with the measly portion of pork.  I found my three slices almost by accident hiding behind a green onion.  The Chasu must have been sliced by a light saber-wielding Jedi master.  That sucker was thinner than a supermodel after Ramadan.  C'mon, people, I know this is a recession, but protein is still a food group the last time I checked.
