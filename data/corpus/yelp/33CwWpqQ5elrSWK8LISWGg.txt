Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you go to Pinks with high expecatations, you will be let down.  This isnt AWESOME food or food that you should travel an hour for by any means.  But if you look at Pinks expecting just a hot dog stand, you will be pleasantly surprised.  This hot dog stand has everything and can do anything.  They have regular hot dogs, 15 inch jalapeno hot dogs, turjey dogs, vegetarian dogs, hamburgers and the list goes on and on.  Yes, the food is greasy and fatty, but its a f*cking hot dog stand, whatd you expect?!?  . . My personal favorite is the guadalajara dog that comes with onions, relish, tomotoes and sour cream.  Something about the contrast of the  the cool of the toppings and the warmth of the dog draws me in every time.  Their fries are also awesome and their onion rings are so so at  best.  Pinks is a good place if its not your destination, after a long day of shopping on Melrose, having an awesomely fatty hot dog and fries is heaven.
