Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
SUMMATION:. They didn't call it TASTY for a good reason.. . ATMOSPHERE:. For a college friend's birthday dinner, we agreed to check out TASTE as she saw some bimbos from the show Laguna Beach eating there. As expected the small dim lit restaurant was full of wannabe actors and pretentious metros. That's all well in good so long as the food measures up. Our waiter had one pink strand of hair hanging down the side with the rest cropped short. Not trendy. Not cute. So two years ago.. . DRINKS: . The waiter raved of their signature drinks and as a result we each ordered a different one from their list. Cucumber cocktails are supposedly the upcoming thing even though they've been around for years. After a couple of sips we all had to push the drink aside and order something else. Consensus: Watered down, teaspoon of alcohol and not even if you like those fruity girly drinks.. . APPETIZERS:. My pear/pomegranate/goat cheese salad was very tasty but that was where the good experience ended. The short rib appetizer was overcooked and the soup on par with the Campbell's variety.. . MAIN DISH: . My seared tuna was cooked all the way through, sauce full of msg and the bok choy that highlighted the description in the menu was the size of my thumb and soggy with one leaf. This was supposedly the waiter's favorite dish.. . DESSERT:. Have a good dessert and the experience can be saved. The flourless chocolate cake (again he claims this was a new thing) was pretty good so it was somewhat redeeming.. . I'll come back to try their breakfast but this is a perfect example of why you really can't listen to these idiots on Yelp!
