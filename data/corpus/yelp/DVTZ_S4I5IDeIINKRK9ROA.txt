GARLIC! If you dont like garlic, just disregard this message and dont go here. But if you do like garlic, I highly recommend this place. . . My girlfriend took me out to dinner here for my birthday. The ambience is fun. Kind of like youre eating out doors under a canopy. The service was nice. . . The food was great. I had the prime rib. My girlfriend had the prawns pasta. The prime rib was tender, thick, and yes.. filled with garlic cloves. Was delicious. One of the best prime ribs I ever had. . . Do not take a date here if you plan on having some romace (sexy time) afterwards. Your bodily fluids and odors will reek of garlic. But if youre into that sort of stuff... knock yourself out!!
