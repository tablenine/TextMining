Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Ah... I love Tito's tacos.  I don't care what people say about it being potentially inauthentic, when it comes down to it, there isn't much that beats walking away with that little cardboard box of greatness.  It's really been too long (maybe 2 months), but it seems like just yesterday I ordered up 2 tacos and a large guac... delicious.
