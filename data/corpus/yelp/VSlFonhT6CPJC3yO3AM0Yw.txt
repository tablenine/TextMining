My office is just a short walk from this place, so I've eaten lunch there many, many times over the years. I think that the comments of Joe R. and Pauline C. are very accurate. This is not what you'd call a relaxed and leisurely dining experience. In fact, my friend and I have taken to calling Shabu Shabu House, "North Korea" due to its seemingly endless rules and pushy old man proprietor who lords over the place like it's his totalitarian oasis surrounded by an outside world he cannot abide or trust. . . Here's the "Pros" as I see them: It's a fun experience that doesn't get old; the meat (rib eye cut very thin--just like the meat used for Philly cheese-steak) is always fresh; once you're seated, the service is highly efficient; it's actually a decent value by Downtown LA standards (even the large plate is under $13 and quite filling); also, they give endless refills of dipping sauces and steamed rice.. . Here's the "Cons": The pushy old man who runs the place can get on your nerves--he's completely devoid of personality and his sole mission is to get as many patrons in and out of the place as quickly as possible; it's difficult to feel unrushed and relaxed at Shabu Shabu House so don't come here for ambiance or lunchtime conversation, come for the unique grub; unless you get here by 11:10 a.m. (20 minutes before they open) be prepared for a wait to get seated. . . I share the feelings of those who seem unable to justify their own rating of 4 or 5 stars for this place, yet they give that rating anyway. In my case, Shabu Shabu House gets 4 stars based almost entirely on its uniqueness and the fact that, despite its many shortcomings, I just crave the damned stuff! It's tasty comfort food that hits the spot. Wow, I can't believe I actually LIKE to have lunch in North Korea!
