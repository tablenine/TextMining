I ended up eating here because I didn't know Meltdown wasn't open for dinner.  Though it seems like every time I've passed by this place, there would always be a line, it moved very quickly and there were still plenty of seats to be found.  The price isn't bad (about $10) - I was pleasantly surprised to find a substantial portion of steak with my steak salad.  However, stay away from the balsamic vinegar dressing.  Maybe it was a bad portion I received, but it was more oil than vinegar - blech!   As a result, my salad was pretty bland.  My friend got the Chipotle BBQ Chicken.  The chicken was soft and flavored but her salad tasted somewhat bland, too.  I guess everything is supposed to be healthy here, but it sure doesn't have to taste that way!
