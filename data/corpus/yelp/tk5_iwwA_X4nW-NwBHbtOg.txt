If you want to be enchanted by authentic modern Mexican food, plesae make an effort to visit "CIUDAD" in Los Angeles. I was there by destiny waiting for a client meeting and as soon I stepped in the door I was graciously greeted by a professional host that escorted me to a very romantic dinning room area... Â I chose the prefixe menu and let me tell you I looked like a "Iron Chef" critic swamped by their attention. The cuisine is terrific, the decor is amazing and the staff were as professional and courteous as can be... CIUDAD goes in my Woohoo! list as a lunch and a romatnic venue.
