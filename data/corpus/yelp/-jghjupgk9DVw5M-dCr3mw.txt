Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
Let me start off by saying that I really wanted to like this place.  It's across the street from the Landmark Theatre, which is is best place in town to get my fix of French film.. . The only redeeming quality about this place is that the savory crepe batter is quite authentic and as good as you might find from an average crepe purveyor anywhere in France.. . Everything else about the could use improvement:  decor, all foodstuffs besides the crepe batter, plates and especially the service.. . This is simply a older establishment that is resting on its laurels and aiming itself at an American clientele who doesn't know any better.. . I won't be back.
