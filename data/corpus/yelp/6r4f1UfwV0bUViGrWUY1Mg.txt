Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Don't let anybody fool you. Man, these tacos are great! Let me tell you... the lines are huge, that alone speaks for itself.  Check out their website, their song and their menu at: . http://www.titostacos.com. . . This is LA's Taco Mecca, where all taco eaters must travel to. I'm not kidding you... If you say you're from L.A. you better have had a Tito's taco at somepoint in your life because otherwise... you're not truly an L.A. dweller.  . . The taco doesn't look like much. Sure it's a crispy shell stuffed with greasy shredded beef topped with fresh iceberg lettuce and yellow cheese shavings. But , when you put on their salsa... OMG - Heaven rushes your tastebuds. . . This is an all time favorite. Now, I only go there every couple of months because they're not healthy for you; but it's definitely a treat.
