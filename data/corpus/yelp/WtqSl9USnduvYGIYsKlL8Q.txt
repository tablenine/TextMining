Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Summary: My go-to steak place in LA that sits near the top of my list of favorite fancy restaurants.  I've been here at least 20 times and have never ordered anything besides the Bone-in Chef's Cut Ribeye.  Mastro's comes just short of a 5 star rating because of one bad experience I had.  I wish I could give it a 4.5 rating.  I will return.. . The service is excellent here and it is one of the best places to start a guy's night out, celebrate a special occasion, or to fulfill one's steak fantasies (it's OK, it happens).  . . In my mind, there is only one steak to get here if you are not sharing, the Chef's Cut Ribeye (33 oz.) -- try the Porterhouse for Two if you are up for the challenge.  I usually order my steak rare -- no exception with the Chef's Cut.  Hands down, the chef's cut bone-in ribeye is my favorite steak.. . The Retaliation Steak:  So, what was my ONE bad experience at Mastro's?  Not TOO long ago, I ordered my steak RARE per usual and it arrived MEDIUM (maybe even a little more cooked than medium).  I showed the waiter that this was clearly a MEDIUM / MEDIUM+ piece of steak and he / she kindly agreed to have a new steak prepared  for me.  Maybe they confused the order?  It's OK, I thought to myself, I am going to get a new steak anyways.  However, my replacement steak looked black and blue / pittsburgh style and was the 'fattiest', low grade piece of meat I've seen at Mastro's.  I thought to myself, was this a RETALIATION steak?  I definitely thought it was .  Bottom line, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth for a year.. . Overall, Mastro's is still a world-class restaurant worthy of its current rating.
