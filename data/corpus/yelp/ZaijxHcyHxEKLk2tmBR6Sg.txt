Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Decided to act on many other Yelpers' advice and try out Fat Matt's Rib Shack...on the busiest day of the year - Memorial Day.. A line out the door and snaking into the crazy busy parking lot.. Rob K. and I ordered a combo (quarter chicken and some ribs), a half slab and potato salad.. The homemade pecan pie on the counter next to the register was calling to me but I held back, saving it for another time.. . I normally don't like barbecue sauce due to it's sweetness. At Fat Matt's I pretty Â much hogged the side of sauce that came with the meal to myself. Oh My God. . Rib meat was falling off the bone and it was wonderful.. I couldn't get through my meal, finishing only about half before I was full of barbecue goodness.. . If you've driven by the shack a million times and still haven't tried it - pull over. Today. Do it. Yum.
