I know people will argue saying the there are more authentic Spanish food restaurants in the city, but they cannot argue about the quality and quantity of food. I have taken so many people here for there first time and everybody has RAVED about it. I even have a friend from England that when she comes out she always has to stop here and chow at least once.. . It is a little pricey but you get a lot of food for it. It does it extremely packed but I have never waited more then 30 min. I have experienced the young ignorant hostesses that George D. has but you just smile and be done with them.. . I have never gotten to crazy here, just some chicken tacos every time but they are good with there sour cream sauce...yum yum. But I have stolen bites from other friends dishes and I have never had something I didn't like.
