My daughter and I have been here four or five times.  It is very conveniently located accross from the movie theater.  We had grown to love their veggie burger.  The last time we ordered it (January 2010), the burger's texture had changed.  It was not the same.  I mentioned it to the waitress and she said they had a new chef and she would mention it to him.  . Otherwise, their food and service is good.  The bathrooms have air blowers to dry your hands.  I hate those.  Would much prefer paper towels.  . I will go back because it is convenient and I will need to see if they can perfect the vegiie burger again.
