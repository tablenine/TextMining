Steak fit for a glutton, and the company tab made it taste all the better.  . . I had the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye....nice marble, seared and cooked to perfection.  . . I believe it melted in my mouth, and this 22 ounce ribeye was finished.. . We overspent on wine to wash down our overpriced beef.  Would I return....maybe on the company tab...
