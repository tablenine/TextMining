Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Its creative all right.  Its super fun and exciting.  Its open late... BUT its in Wrigleyville!. . Its not that I don't like Wrigleyville - well, I don't, but I have no issue with it as I am never in the area, but now that I ate at Ian's, I am torn.  The ideal time for me getting a slice of pizza is later in the evening when I am coming home and need a bite to eat.  BUT its the same time that the place is filled with drunk obnoxious people, people that I want to avoid as much as possible and which I ignore after gazing upon Ian's pizzas.. . Oh, the sights.  So many versions to try... so little time.  I've had the mac and cheese slice.  YUM.  I will have it again, but I don't think its as good as everyone says.  Its good, but I had my expectations up really high after I heard so much about it.. . Just yesterday, I had the black bean and guacamole version.  Now that is what I call a pizza slice.  The black beans gave it a unique taste and the guacamole left my mouth feeling smooth, as if soft cream coated my tongue.  . . Come here earlier, before people get drunk.  Its a fun place.  If you must go late and have little tolerance for drunk people, send your friend to grab a takeout and enjoy the pizza in a calmer environment.
