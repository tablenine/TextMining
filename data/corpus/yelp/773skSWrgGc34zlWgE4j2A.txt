Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Great little stop without pretense or attitude.  A wonderful hole in the wall institution.  The first time I was here, I met the owner and he walked us through his simple menu of fish or shrimp tacos, the various salsa and condiments.  He was really nice and even gave us complimentary bottles of water.  I've been back, and I'll continue to stop by whenever I'm in the area.  Go there for a quick bite if you are stuck for a place to go.
