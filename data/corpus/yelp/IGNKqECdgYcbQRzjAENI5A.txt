I love this place and would eat here all the time if it weren't all the way down in Lakeview.. . The menu is simple and the items on it are inexpensive and yummy.  The service is fine and the owner is particularly nice...what more could you want?. . Also the decor is totally up my alley but I'm a French major, so there ya go.
