Held a client lunch here and was not disappointed.  I'm not a drinker so I can't speak to the beer selection, but the atmosphere was comfortable and fun.  I bet happy hour is a blast.. . The lunch menu offered a good variety, and the specials were interesting.  Two in our party were vegans and both were pleased with their options and the food they ordered.  . . I chose the "Creamery Girl" toasted cheese sandwich with the tomato bisque soup.   Wow!  The cheese sandwich was excellent, and the tomato bisque superb.  I am a big fan of grilled cheese and tomato soup, but this is a far cry from my normal Cambells and Kraft singles fixin's.  This was good.. . Others in my party really enjoyed the seared tuna sandwich, black bean burger, and the grilled chicken sandwiches.  . . The lunch crowd was loud, and it was a tight fit.  It was a cool day, and the wind was whipping about, so the excellent outdoor seating was not an option which pushed people inside.  To me, a warm spring evening meal on the patio would be fantastic.. . The service was professional, and efficient, but we could have been offered a few smiles along the way.  Still, if the crew was short-staffed, it didn't show in the speed of service.. . We will be back.
