Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
Another husband &amp; wife team beats the dust (in Culver City).  Jason (executive chef) &amp; Miho Travi (pastry chef), along w/ Thierry Perez, Keith Fox &amp; Amir Ohebsion, opened Fraiche last month.  They have been the latest toast of the town, flanked by local residents and neighboring visitors.. . The offering cuisine is rustic French-Italian, with flavors synonymous from their own countryside, simple in ingredients but big in taste.. . My friend and I opted to share the SMOKED EEL W/ ARUGULA, ORANGE, MINT, &amp; BREAKFAST RADISH.  Rudimentary as it may seem, this salad offers fresh and interesting flavors, with the bitterness of the arugula dabbling with the slight vinegary dressing, downplayed by the sweet slices of mandarin oranges, all the while punctuated by the smokiness of the eel.  Refreshing!. . The BLACK COD (w/ artichokes, tomatoes, green apple, basil) is rustic in flavor.  A dish that you might enjoy at some hidden villa in Tuscany, exemplifying the ripe flavors of summertime.  . . The MONKFISH "FRANCAISE" (w/ spinach, white wine, &amp; shallots) is rich, buttery, creamy, savory, but not heavy.  These delicate nuggets will leave your mouth wanting more!. . For dessert, we ordered the TORTA DELLA NONNA (w/ a dollop of caramel ice cream), and the STONE FRUIT COBBLER (roasted peach &amp; nectarines, fresh slices of blackberries, biscuits, a dollop of blackberry sorbet &amp; whipped mascarpone cheese).  AAAAAAMAZING!  These heavenly sweet delights ended our dinner with a mellifluous note.  . . The 5 stars are strictly for the food critique and not the decor.  Though I'm not enthralled with the interiors, as I find it quite kitsch, it did become insignificant once I tasted the food.
