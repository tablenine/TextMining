Met Blais. Took pictures. Then my friend dissed the lamb burger and he was gone. But, you know what, it really wasn't that good. . . However, the other items we ordered were respectable: the bacon cheeseburger (was it bacon AND cheese space burger?) and turkey burger. Both were good. For our third choice, I wish we could have done a sub in with the special of the day- turkey AND bacon burger. Next time... Maybe. . . Ordered the sweet potato tots, fries, and onion rings. These fried starches weren't bad, weren't good. It almost tasted as if some items were fried just a little too long (if there's such a thing) and some a second too short. . . Nutella shakes... Delicious. I don't like marshmallows and these shakes are topped with marshmallows and I freaking drank up all the shake and ate up all the marshmallows. . . Went Saturday around noon. It felt later than it was because the place was so freaking packed. Service was good.
