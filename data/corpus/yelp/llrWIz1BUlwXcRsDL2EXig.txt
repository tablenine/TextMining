this place has a great patio for a sunday brunch. when you want to escape the mess of 3rd street eateries, come to this spot for some good grub. i'm not a bacon lover but all my friends say it's heavenly. i'm a fan of their pancake selection as well as their egg dishes. but it's really all quite good. one of my favorite brunch spots in LA for sure.
