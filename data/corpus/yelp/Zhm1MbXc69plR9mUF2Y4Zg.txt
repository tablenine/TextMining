The absolute best burger I have ever had!  You must get the Hickory burger.  It has the secret sauce, and also request hickory sauce when you get your fries!!!  AMAZING.  . It helps to go during off hours as the place does get quite busy and not a lot of counter space.. They also have the most amazing tuna salad sandwich ever!  But you hardly ever eat that because the second you step foot in the place your mind immediately shuts down until you taste the greatness that is Hickory Burger!!!!!  Must have one now!
