Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I've never been to Korea but I imagined this is how Korea is like (in my head). The food is amazing. The price is fabulous! Your clothes will smell of bbq for days but it's all worth it. The drinks are overpriced but the AYCE KBBQ part is what's amazing.
