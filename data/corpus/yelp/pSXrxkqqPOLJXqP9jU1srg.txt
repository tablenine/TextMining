Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I LOVE THIS PLACE.. . My boyfriend and I went here for our four year anniversary. The restaurant is adorable, as soon as you walk in, you feel you are transported out of LA. We sat 'outside' on the patio (if you look up the ceiling is interwoven trees and vines). Demurely lit tables fill the restaurant, but even on a packed Thursday night, I did not feel annoyed or interrupted at all during our meal.. . Waiter was incredibly knowledgeable and suggested wonderful dishes that truly felt like the best suggestions.. . I started with the Duck Foie Gras (torchon style) and had the Lamb Shank on the special menu. I ate the entire thing, the Lamb was literally falling off of the bone, slow roasted, and no knife needed. It came out in a clay pot and when the top was removed, the simmering flavors suck you in - everything else becomes a little hazy. I finished with the Strawberry Rhubarb tart, which was excellent. Just thinking about it now makes my mouth water.. . My boyfriend had the almond encrusted goat cheese dish with the figs and then the ribeye - both of which were fantastic. So much flavor in the ribeye, and such a huge portion too. He finished with the cobbler.. . Desserts may change each night, because they come by with a chalkboard on which the desserts are scrawled in chalk. . . I never felt rushed or patronized, two things that happen frequently in LA restaurants.. . Perfect for a special occasion or a place to go for appetizers and a glass of wine. Great to get away from LA without leaving the city.. . I would go back again, in a heartbeat. . . Only downside, it's a bit pricey, but worth the plunge.
