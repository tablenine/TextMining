I was a vietnamese food virgin.  It's true!. This was a great introduction... the crepey thing was wonderful, and instead of pho I got the cold vermicelli noodles with lemongrass beef and shrimp.  Great flavors washed down with a glass of cold sake.. The service was super fast and there was a brief wait for a table.  . Personally not a fan of the unflattering super bright lighting but that's just me!
