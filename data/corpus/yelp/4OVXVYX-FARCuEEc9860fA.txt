Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
1 star. Brutally unsatisfying food and the long lines make Tito's Tacos "all hype and no substance." Often touted as a "L.A. institution" or a "must try" by TV features and fellow yelpers alike, I found nothing remarkable from my visit to Tito's, save perhaps low prices. In fact, the tacos and burritos have an "institutional" taste --much like bad cafeteria food-- and the beans are undistinguishable from made-for-restaurant canned beans. Even with the low prices, why throw money away when there are so many other options around?. . Verdict: Just not my cup of tea... To each his/her own... Try it if you must, but I honestly cannot recommend.
