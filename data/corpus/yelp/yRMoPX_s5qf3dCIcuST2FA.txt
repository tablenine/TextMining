The pizza here is definitely unique and delicious!!  I couldn't believe I fell in love with their mac and cheese pizza (I refused to eat mac and cheese after I nearly threw up from eating Easy Mac in college....ever since, just the thought of it would leave me with a queasy feeling in my stomach).  Anyways, fast forward to the Yelp Elite party last week.  One bite of that pizza and I was amazed.  It was so good!   I wanted to have my husband try it and order a pizza the next night.. . We ordered the pizza a couple of nights later along with their Portabella Mushroom Basil Chicken Parmesean. It was delicious....fresh ingredients and tender juicy pieces of chicken.  If you like portabella mushrooms, you'll love this pizza....tons of pieces scattered throughout the huge 20' pizza!. . I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the pizzas!
