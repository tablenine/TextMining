Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
when Daikokuya is too crowded (which it usually is), i head over to orochon. this has some variety to their ramen because u got three different soup base options and there is the degree for spiciness. SPICY ramen lovers should go here. i'm not a spicy person so that stops me from being in love with this place but i do enjoy it .plus they carry the cold ramen which i like when other ramen shops only have it during the summer. cold ramen has a cold sesame sweet shoyu taste with a mix of veggies, egg, nori, and ham with the noodles.
