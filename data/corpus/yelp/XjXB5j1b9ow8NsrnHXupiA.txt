This was surprising, and I mean that as a compliment. We chose this restaurant to begin our Friday evening mainly because of its convenient location - and our ultimate dining experience was an unexpected bonus. The space is loud and bustling, but we got a great corner table so we didn't have to yell and could people watch out the window at the same time. And the food was wonderful - from the potato fundue appetizer, roasted beet salad, to the pizza topped with a fried egg (!), and gnudi dumplings. Even a custom order by a friend turned out to be a fresh combination of pasta tossed with olive oil and toothsome roasted vegetables. I'd say, don't bother with the reservations. Put your name down, don't be fazed by the crowd, and spend your hour's wait at one of the many fine watering holes nearby.
