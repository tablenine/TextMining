Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I came here with a bunch of other academics during a conference. The pizza was edible and thick, but it was definitely not in flavor country. I tried the supreme and veggie versions, and like someone else said it seemed like the pizza was a little undercooked (the sauce and cheese was a bit on the runny side).. . In spite of all the hype for Chicago deep dish, I was thoroughly unimpressed. We had to wait half-an-hour for the pizza, and the beer selection was very limited (any self-respectable pizza joint will have an awesome beer selection). It gets three stars, since the seating for large groups is great, the food was adequately filling and the company was good (albeit this is not something the joint can manipulate directly).. . Quality over quantity, man, quality over quantity.. . CONTEXT:. Date: November 2007. Time: Dinner. Table for 14, no reservations
