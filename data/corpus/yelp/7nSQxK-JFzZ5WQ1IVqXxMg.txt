Stumbled in this place with my girlfriend after seeing some sketch comedy in the area. The place was pretty empty around 9pm but we went in anyway. I'm so glad I did. . . The deep fried green beans were to die for. The burger my girlfriend had was great she said (I don't eat beef) and I gobbled down the rainbow trout I had. The little plate of rolls and cornbread they give you was awesome too and we asked for seconds.. . They have some very cool art around, with wooden chickens and various food/animal life. . . All in all very cool place, will definitely go again when in the area.
