Loved Leon's!. Went on my birthday last week with three other friends for pre-dinner drinks and apps.  Was perfect!  Fries with multiple dipping sauces (Smoked tomato mayonnaise was my fave), waffles in a bag, tiny sweet peppers stuffed with goat cheese (yes, please!) and lots of fall drink specials.. . The atmosphere is very laid-back, open air.  Perfect for conversations with friends or just hanging out with a book.  . . Definitely want to go back for a full course.
