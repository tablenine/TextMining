Review based on 5-10 visits.. . Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. Everything I've tried here has been great, if not excellent. Especially love their perfectly baked and glazed cheese rolls. I wouldn't mind coming here for lunch and dinner if I lived closer! I really hope they open more of these in the great Los Angeles areas. Everything is just so absolutely delicious! The only negatives I can really think of is how packed this place is, but luckily they can calm the lines down pretty quick. The only times the lines stop moving is when stupid people take 10 whole minutes deciding what they want to order when they're already at the register. I won't hold that against them, of course, but it does happen somewhat often. Also the back parking lot is somewhat messy. Other than that, this place is amazing. Definitely visit and try a few things.. . Overview:. Super busy, but quick lines. Quick service, good food prep speed.. Nearly everything is delicious! Try a variety of baked goods too!. Parking lot is a bit messy.. A few blocks from the Americana!
