Saturday, 2 p.m. and the wait is still about 30 minutes, so  I wouldn't recommend trying to come here when you're starving, or you'll surely suffer. It's a pretty small place, not too many tables and it sounds like they're always slammed.  We sat at the counter, which was fine for two.. . I had the Season of Love pancakes---pumpkin pancakes with caramel and crunchy bits.  I could have done with more caramel instead of the dollop of canned pumpkin on top, though.  Our waiter said that this was how Stevie Wonder ordered his pancakes here so they added it to the menu. I made it through about 1/4 of it and took like two pounds of it back in a doggy bag.  It'll be my breakfast for the next few days....sure, they're soggy, but still good!  (Yeah, I'm pretty shameless when it comes to food...). . Can't wait to come back and try the Nutella french toast.....and the "Peanut Bubba" french toast....and the "Devil's Food" chocolate pancakes....
