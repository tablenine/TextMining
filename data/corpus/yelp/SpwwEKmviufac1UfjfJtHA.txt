The sum of the parts are greater then the whole. What would you do?  If I where to say...  We're lost in the midst of true loves last kiss left out on display. . . Had a greasy good time with A-run G. and little P.  Shoot the shit and be done wif wit.  A big plate of little octopus, some plump shrimp Santorini, subterranean hummus possibly made by Morlocks and best left under ground, a great Cyprus import beer, a slick gyro,  a shit load of delicious bread both flat and raised, plastic cutlery, piss poor service, atmosphere worthy of a second tier town in a third world country with first rate country cooking, and too much sun only slighter better  then being under a fascist Greek gun.  Drag the four stars out of me I want to give three but the sum the parts are greater then the whole and I can't let go of the romantic notions that reside inside.  Ain't life grand?
