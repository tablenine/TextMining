Hubby took my here for my birthday--I hadn't been in 4 years. The service was superb, the food was delicious, and the portions were adequate.  . . My hubby is a true meat and potatoes guy, and really doesn't like anything other than tried-and-true American restaurants. He's STILL raving about this place, and even suggested that we go again.  He especially enjoyed the Calamari appetizer.. . It is a little pricey, I'll admit, but it's definitely somewhere to go for a treat.
