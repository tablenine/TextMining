How did I forget this one?!?  Elements catered our wedding at the Pacific Asia Musuem a couple of years ago, when they were just starting out.  We were getting frustrated with The Kitchen and I called Elements on a whim.  Carol, one of the owners, invited us in and gave us a tasting dinner.  She and the staff were so gracious and nice and the food was wonderful!  Since we are Chinese, we wanted an Asian flair to the food (Discovered Chinese cooking simply not conducive to catering).  Carole at Elements understood and we decided to go with American food with a strong Asian flair--kind of a match of my Chinese-American background with my wife's HongKong upbringing.  On our wedding evening, a catering group of twelve and the chef O'Neil showed up, cooked up a storm, and served delicious curried beef satays, crunchy thai fried rolls, tender flavorful ribeye steaks marinated in Asian spices, miso vinagrated salmon, and people were talking about our wedding for months!  . . The price wasn't inexpensive, but reasonable for the service and the quality.  They are probably, justifiably, more expensive now, but they worked tirelessly with us through changes and indecision.  The only negs were that the lemonade and a couple of appetizers didn't quite taste the same as our tasting.  Otherwise, we were very happy.
