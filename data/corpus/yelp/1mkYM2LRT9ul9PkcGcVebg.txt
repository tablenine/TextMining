837619347+ reviews.  What is the point?  I guess I am writing this review just for the Ramen list that will take several thousand years to complete.  Why?  There is no effing ramen in Texas.  You appreciate certain cuisines much more when you live in an area that does not serve it.  First of all, the wait is rather long and the seating areas are rather cramped.  . . After much deliberation I settled on the Daikoku Ramen with the pork cutlet bowl combo (could feed 2 persons).  Pork belly is so scrumptious that I don't think I would mind spending my life inside the piggy's stomach.  Being wrapped in panko bread crumbs added a great texture.  I also found the mystical golden egg.  The egg in this ramen was so rich and heavenly that you just want to close your eyes and meditate on that thought.  Nirvana achieved.
