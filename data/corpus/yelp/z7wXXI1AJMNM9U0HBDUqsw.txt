Went there this Sunday morning for brunch/breakfast at 10:30 AM as part of a party of 3. Seated immediately and ordered the North Carolina Crab Cakes(since that is where I hail from) with poached eggs, cheese grits, and a corn muffin.  Everything hit the mark with the crab cakes nicely spicy.  Definitely would go again.
