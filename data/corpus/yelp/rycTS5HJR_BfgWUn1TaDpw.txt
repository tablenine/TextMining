Ye ole ramen god that you are.  Where do you say I should go?  I am sooo sorry but I can't hear you.  I do apologize.  Whoa, heard you that time...so it's called Daikokuya or something like that.  I have to wait outside in line?  How long?  The guy will tell me half an hour and it will really be 45min???  That doesn't seem enticing at all!  what?  Oh, okay...gotcha "I won't regret it".. . Well it turns out he was right, I didn't.  Lucky for me they have a small TV inside that was showing the Simpson's while I was waiting.  It was the episode where bart find out that they are imprisoning the children to eventually eat!! Helped the time go by for sure.  So I ordered the Ramen because honestly can you come here and order anything else?  It was well....really good.  I have to admit, I was impressed.  Very filling and 180 some odd yelp reviewers can't be wrong!  They have never let me down yet!!. . Pork broth, soft but kinda hard noodles that taste so nice.  The funny thing is they know they have a good thing.  Otherwise, why would they put up a sign that says: "Why are our noodles so good?".  Well apparently it has something to do with soaking things for a really long time!  Oh, almost forgot...tap Kirin...amazingly cheap as well.. . Anyway, don't even think about coming here with more than 4 people as you will never eat.  Order the ramen and enjoy!  This place would have gotten 5 stars from me but...I hate waiting so long.
