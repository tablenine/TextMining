Restaurant: Apres Diem
Category: French
After Screen on the Green got rained out, I went to Apres Diem with Stephanie S., Nikki K., Blake B. and Larissa G. (followed later with Justin B.).  The place is unexpectedly cute - unexpected because it's located in a strip mall.  But when you walk in, it's cool (lots of air conditioning - yay!) and dark - the cuisine is European and Mediterranean, but the look of the place is much more Mediterranean in feel.  The low lights, warm-colored walls created a great vibe to catch up with old (or new) friends.  . . There were a number of different items to choose from on the menu - I went with the salmon sandwich which was yummy.  I was initially concerned with portions because the sandwich and side salad looked a little small, but it definitely filled me up.  They have a nice selection of wine and beer - a few German and Belgian beers.  The staff were all really nice and friendly, and the service was prompt.  If I'm ever back in Atlanta, I'll definitely be back at Apres Diem...
