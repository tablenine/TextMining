Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
I go to Eleven City pretty regularly and I really enjoy it.  It is a tad expensive for your typical diner but the portion sizes balance that out.  I can never finish my food.  And my husband who can eat a ton always leaves completely satisfied.. . I don't remember who talked smack about the shakes but he/she is OH so WRONG!  They are so delicious!  Not only do you get a shake in an old fashioned glass, but they give you the extra in a tin - that always wins me over! :). . And as for the owner... I've seen him there pretty much every time I've been there and don't have any complaints about him.  You know he runs the joint but I've never witnessed any kind of scene.. . Go check it out!  You'll be glad you did.
