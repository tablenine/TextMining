great place to eat late at night!!!! i'm not even from chicago. lol. i came to visit my cousins in chicago from CA. i had the char dog and fries. i didn't have to order the chocolate milkshake because the person in front of me already did. make sure that you order the chocolate milkshake. you just need to experience it yourself to know what i'm talking about. lol. it was the best char dog i had over in chicago. but the fries was nothing special. the place is pretty cool but don't get offended when the workers cuss at you. hahaa
