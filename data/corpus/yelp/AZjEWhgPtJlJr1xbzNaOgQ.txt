Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
So...I ate there once. The food was really good. I was gonna eat there again.. . So I'm sitting at home and I decide, "Hey, an Umami burger sounds good. I'll call 'em up and order for take out.". . So I call and try to order the Port and Stilton burger.. . Guy on the phone says, "No problem.". . I say, "Does that come with lettuce and tomato on it?". . Guy on the phone says, "No, it doesn't.". . I say, "Well, can I get lettuce and tomato added to it?". . Guy on the phone says, "No, it comes how it comes.". . So...I pause and then say, "Well, can I pay for some lettuce and tomato on the side so I can put it on myself when I get home?". . Guy on the phone says, "Nope. It comes how it comes. That's just how we roll.". . "THAT'S JUST HOW WE ROLL?". . Well, that's NOT how MY MOUTH rolls.. . So said thanks anyway and hung up.. . Seriously. I don't need some LA douchebag telling MY taste buds that THEY'RE wrong. If they have lettuce and tomato...and I want to PAY for lettuce and tomato...who the FUCK are they to tell me I can't put it on my burger when I get home?!. . Are they the fucking BURGER POLICE? I think not.. . So they'll never get my business again. Nor will I recommend them to any of my friends.. . LA is a big place. Someone who actually wants their customers to be happy will get my hard earned dollar.. . Umami can try to pay the bills with all the lettuce and tomato they have laying around, not being sold.
