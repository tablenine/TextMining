Yummy, yummy in my tummy Tender Greens is delightfully plummy!. . I had the recent pleasure of enjoying a delightful summer lunch at Tender Greens with the big sis in downtown Culver City and fell in love with everything about it - the set-up, the location, the delectable selection and variety, the friendly staff, the short wait, the opportunity to see the salads and other items being prepared as you scoot along the counter, the outdoor patio seating, the reasonable prices and the casual, light atmosphere.. . Each of the menu items looked appealing in their own right.  After contemplating the steak salad, I settled on the special of the day, which was a duck salad with peaches, goat cheese, walnuts, cranberries, baguette croutons and a vinaigrette dressing.  My sister ordered the Cobb salad, which had huge chunks of chicken, bacon, avocado, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes and ranch dressing.. . I was thoroughly satisfied with my selection.  The duck was as tender as could be and its saltiness was nicely balanced with the sweetness of the peaches.  Each flavor and texture was perfectly juxtaposed with the crunchy walnuts and croutons contrasting well with the soft goat cheese, duck and peaches.  And, the tanginess of the cranberries added a little pop to each bite.  My sister enjoyed several bites of mine and found it equally tasty as well.  Her Cobb salad looked amazing too, but my allergy to avocados kept me from stealing a few bites of my own.  I'll definitely be up for trying it one of the next times I go, sans the avocado of course.. . Having enjoyed our first experience at Tender Greens as much as we did, we are both eager to share the same delight with our parents and others so we all can experience and continue to experience the delicious and healthy fare found at Tender Greens.
