After reading so many good reviews, especially about the famous garlic chicken, I decided to come here and try it. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. The chicken came out mostly juicy and tender, but its taste was a little too sour/sharp. There was too much vinegar on it. The fried plaintains that came with it were good. I also ordered the stuffed yucca appetizer, and it was so hot that I burned my tongue, so be careful.. . For now, I need a break from this restaurant, but next time I come here, I'm trying something else.
