Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed! I didnt expect it the restaurant to be so huge. Anyways, me and my boyfriend had to sit with two couples to our side. It was a u-shaped table so they had to pull the table out and let us go in, it just sucked that if we wanted to go use the restroom we couldn't because there was no way of getting out. So, next time me and the bf are just going to reserve a booth or a regular table. The food was so fulfilling and plentiful! I had the Lawry's cut while my bf had the 24oz prime rib. I added a cream spinach as a side and my bf added the creamed corn. The spinach was good but after a few bites, it was just too creamy and rich for me. Our server was really sweet, but the outfits that she and the other servers had to wear needs an update in my opinion. I kind of felt like I was in a cafeteria with a bunch of people, maybe the mood would have been better if the restaurants lights were dimmed a bit more, because it was just really bright in there. . . Overall, the food was good and for the price you really just cant go wrong.
