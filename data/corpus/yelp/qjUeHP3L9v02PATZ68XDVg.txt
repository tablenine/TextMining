I'm only rating this according to FOOD. Concidering I'm a carnivore. I dont believe in vegetarianism....lol, This place is Excellent. I mean...I'f a T-Rex came in here....even he would say, "hey, I'm getting full." (this is according  to if T-rexes could talk). . .             When it comes to quantity, its all good, but the quality is a different story....Not saying quality in this resturaunt is bad, but With a lot of meat, what cook wouldnt spent quality time with each piece of Steak, Prime rib, and chicken? This place could definately use a flavor boost. After downing about 25 pieces of pure meat....Your gonna feel a little more sick than satisfied. . .              Your thinkin...."Hey moron, you would feel sick if you ate 25 pieces of anything!!" Not true...Go to Manpuku tokyo BBQ and see what I'm talking about.
