I so wanted to like.....no.....love this place.  I wanted to give at least 4 stars and I toyed with the idea.  But in the end it was just 3 stars.  . . Had reservations for a Saturday night.  When we were first sat I noticed 2 things: we were sat closest to the kitchen so it was loud and they're were a surprising amount of kids here?  What?  Kids?  So after I chilled out and got over the children and kitchen noise level - I started with a nice Spanish red wine.  They serve a nice flat bread with chickpea/truffle oil spread to start.  We were also served an amazing amuse bouche of coconut/peanut soup (there was more too it, but my memory fails me).  Then the boy and I split 2 apps which were really good: crispy pork belly and fresh farm egg ravioli.  After another glass of wine I started on my entree of Sea Bass.  Again, it was really good - but if I'm spending as much money as I did (boy's bday dinner) it better be one of the best meals I've ever had and it just wasn't.  It was really good - but good/average.  I must say, we were served a shot of hot chocolate with cinnamon to finish and  because we were there celebrating a birthday - we were served a really nice interpretation of s'mores.. . So that's it.  It was good - our server was fantastic, very knowledgeable.  But all in all - just not worth the money for what we got.
