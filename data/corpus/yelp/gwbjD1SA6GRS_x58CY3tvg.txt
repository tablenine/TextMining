Before being introduced to this place you'd never catch me peeling the shell off a single shrimp or fighting to free the meat out of a single crab leg, however, times have changed! . . This place is GREAT! It's a total experience and my boyfriend and I are HOOKED! Your shrimp, crab, lobster, or craw fish is ordered by the pound and prepared to your specific taste (the whole shebang is the best with medium spice). When they bring you your bag of yummyness you're set loose to dig in and get a little dirty! . . This is one of my favorite places to eat, I don't even mind smelling like a clove of garlic for a week after my visit . . THIS PLACE IS CRACKIN... it's not very big and if you go during peak dinner hours on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday be ready to wait a few hours.
