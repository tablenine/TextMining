Restaurant: Caf√© Bombay
Category: Indian
Cafe Bombay is hands down the BEST indian food in Atlanta. The menu is extensive and provides something for everyone. I recommend the lunch buffet if you haven't had Indian food and are looking to try it out. The lunch buffet is awesome! They have usually 4 veg and non veg dishes, rice, naan, pakoras, salads, deserts for $10 and it's all you can eat. The service is excellent and the owners are very friendly. I highly encourage you to try this place out.
