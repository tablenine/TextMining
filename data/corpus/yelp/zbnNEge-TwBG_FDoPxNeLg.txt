Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
When I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory it wasn't my first visit, I just haven't been for awhile, but I was given a gift card for CF and I wanted to use it.  I agree with the fact that the menu is overwhelming, I barely got passed the appetizers selection.. . My daughter and I had to wait only 20 minutes for seating.  At first, the lady tried to seat us at an end table where another guest had all their belongings in the seat.  That would have been entirely too crammed for me so I asked if we could sit in an available booth that I saw.  She without hesitation accommodated us.  That was a + in my book.. . I ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls (absolutely delicious), quesadillas and the fried mac &amp; cheese (delicious) (like I said before I couldn't get passed the appetizers).  My daughter ordered the grilled cheese (huge) &amp; fries (hey, she's four...what do you expect).. . My overall experience was ok.  This is not a regular place for me but hey since I had a gift card and I was having a mother/daughter day on the mag mile, why not.  I would definitely visit again.
