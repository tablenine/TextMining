Restaurant: Baoguette Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
I am revising my review and eliminating one star. If Baoguette Cafe wishes to operate as a cash-only business, it must stock its register properly and stop asking customers to provide bills smaller than $20 when they pay. ATMs distribute $20 bills only. Businesses are responsible for making change, not customers.
