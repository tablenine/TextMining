Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Love it! Love it! Love it! . . Pancakes the size of flying saucers stacked 3 high! Huge portions. If you can finish your entire meal at this joint I commend you! Everything on the menu looked so good. It was so hard to choose, but I ended up with a chorizo, egg, bell pepper and potato breakfast burrito with a side of home made corn chips. When you show up and see the large crowd of people waiting to be seated, don't say to yourself  "we will find breakfast that is just as good somewhere else with a shorter wait time." Just wait it out or you will be missing out. The griddle cafe is fantastic!
