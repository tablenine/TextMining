I was not the only one sitting in Little Bangkok's parking lot at 4:45, anxiously awaiting their opening at 5. Once the sign was illuminated, we made our way inside and I situated myself in a cozy booth along the wall.. . I kind of wish my apartment looked like this place. Asian kitsch to the extreme, with every wall absolutely covered in gilded traditional artwork and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. If I had an Asian grandmother, I'm pretty sure her house would have looked like this place. . . The tom ka soup was as good as everyone says and was unlike most tom ka's I've had before. Perfectly creamy with just the right amount of heat: yum. The pad thai was also a solid choice but I felt like the sauce was a little heavy handed, and it was served with white rice on the side, which I had never seen before. . . There were a ton of regulars up in here, and I can see why. Service was very friendly and on-point... I must say I enjoyed my quick meal here very much, indeed.
