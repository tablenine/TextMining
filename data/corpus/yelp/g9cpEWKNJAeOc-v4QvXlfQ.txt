Expect to be impressed.  If you need to impress someone, this is a nice spot.. . From the moment you sit down, you are showered with the constant stream of attentiveness from the waiters.  The meat never stops flowing, and your glasses are never half-full.  I was definitely impressed with the A+ service.  Service: 5 stars!. . Meat however is not much better than other churrascaria places i've tried.  Don't expect anything adventurous like alligators, quails, or duck.  Food: 3.5 stars!. . At $60 a pop, this is fine dining at it's finest.  Definitely check out the Fogo experience.  Bring your hot date here for sure!
