Had brunch here last Sunday - yummmmm. The salmon gravlax sammy on ciabatta (i'm NOT a fan of that bread) as great with chive cream cheese (my fave) and capers - i love capers . . . . The bellini didn't really taste like one - just an average mimosa - I should've tried the tequila brunch drink - next time! I had the caesar salad as my side option - seriously the best caesar dressing and croutons I have had since the days of Settimana Cafe! . Disappointed that they would not fullfill me request for deep-fried twinkies to-go since it wasn't 3pm yet - boooo
