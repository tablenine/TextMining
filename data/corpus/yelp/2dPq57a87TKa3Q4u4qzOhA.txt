Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
I've passed by Pops on the way to Weber Grill.  Pops looks expensive from the outside so I hadn't had any plans to go there until my friend got her hands on some complimentary St-Germain Cocktail vouchers.. . Champagne is typically not my preferred alcoholic beverage but hey it was free so why not? The St-Germain Cocktail is an excellent drink.  It's sweet tasting and not too dry.  It's also PINK (my fav color) and comes with a piece of edible orchid inside.  It's just perfect for the ladies.. . We also ordered the lamb and frites.  The portions are relatively small but the food is pretty good considering its a bar.  I would definitely come back for happy hours.
