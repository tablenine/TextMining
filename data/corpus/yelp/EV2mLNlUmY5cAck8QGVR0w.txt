Dear Al Di La,. . I've had my eye on you. I've been watching you for years. We have always been so close. so close indeed. You in Park Slope,. Me in Carroll Gardens.... But yet-. You were so unattainable . Always filled with other patrons. that are not me. Tables always taken . occupied by couples, families. that did not include me.. "An hour wait" they told me!. time and time again. On Friday. On Wednesday. On Sunday. Ok let's try Tuesday. You don't take reservations. No, you're too avant-garde. for such conventions. But I was too hungry to wait. So I never sampled your. "exquisite" goods. and now it's too late. You can't have me . In fact, . I would never eat your Saltimbocca Alla Romana (pork loin) Â . I'm a vegetarian now
