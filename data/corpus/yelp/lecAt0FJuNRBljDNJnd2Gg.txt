Korean food should be eaten in a bowl with rice not a tortilla!!!. . We stood in line for an hour just to see what the hype was all about!!. . Was it worth it? Hell no! You people must be drunk or high to love this crap. The pallet is not balanced at all. It's sour and bitter.. . Oh I made sure it wasn't just what I ordered. I ordered a few things on their menu. Short rib tacos, kim chi quesadilla, spicey pork burrito, kogi sliders, and the blackjack quesadilla. All had that bitter sour flavor.. . Would I follow this truck anymore. Put it this way: "I came, I saw, I conquered."
