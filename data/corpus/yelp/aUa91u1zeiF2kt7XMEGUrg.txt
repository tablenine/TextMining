Update: 1/04/08: Sat at the bar. Everything came out lighting fast- ordered all the usuals- see list below and add- creamy rock shrimp and BAKED. CRAB. HANDROLL. You must order the BCH. Incredible.. . Ok, I had the pleasure of going to Katsu,: heres the deal. . Made reservations two days in advance- 9:30 for 6 people. We got in at 10:20. That was annoying, definitely taking off at least half a star for that- no decor either- unless you count the random celebrities as decor. thankfully, the waitresses were more efficient that the seating host was . we ordered so much food- heres what stood out.. 1) HALIBUT with  kumquat and yuzu citrus  glaze.. 2) soft shelled crab. 3) albacore with crispy onions. 4) creamy salmon roll. 5) baked green mussels. 6) the fact that our waitress insisted that they don't have ANY cream cheese up in KatsuYA. . Everything was delicious,but I would go back just for the halibut-  it was the best sashimi I've ever had- amazing. With 6 people, we ended up spending about $240- 3 of us didn't drink though.  Go here to impress a date or a bunch of people.
