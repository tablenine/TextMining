first time trying this ramen place. very very good broth,  you can really taste the flavor of the pork.  The pork itself was tender and buttery but i prefer the one at Orochon Ramen a tad more.  They do give you a full hard boiled egg.  We had the Ramen and the Gyoza and everything was absolutely delicious.  The wait was a bit long but was expected.  parking can be crappy but you can always find a parking lot and pay.  All in all I would definitely come here again if i was in the area.  Glad to hear they're opening one up in Hacienda heights.
