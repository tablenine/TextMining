Food was delicious, I had a yummalicious spicy, yet subtly flavored, vegan curry with brown rice accompanied by a v. nice glass of mulberry/cherry toned vino from Down Under. My darling D. had dessert only, it was 10 PM when we popped in after a walk around the Silver Lake reservoir (and he had already eaten). He had an exquisite cheesecake topped with warm strawberries and fresh mint and a hot black hint of coconut tea with cream. The waitress was friendly and helpful, possibly rare traits in L.A. wait staff. The presentation was quite attractive, although sadly there was something a bit tired about the delivery. I did think it was pricy for the portions, particularly the wine. D was there a few years ago. He says the fees were more reasonable previously, but then they became fashionable and prices went up. Expect to spend $80 to a Benjamin for a decent supper for two, with tea/coffee and dessert. The music was erratic and alternated between interesting and annoying, and sometimes it was just too loud. May go again, but the merely okay ambience (night enough lighting and textures, shades of bamboo and cork abounded... but the pseudo industrial, and not in that hip edgy attractive way we all love, furniture left me longing for something more subtle, cool, or just plain fabulous) means it won't be any time soon if at all. Go early, if you go, and take a fab walk around the reservoir before or after. Look for me; I'll be the wild woman obsessing about story structure while looking for owls.
