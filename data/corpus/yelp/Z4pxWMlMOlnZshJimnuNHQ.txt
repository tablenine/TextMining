Restaurant: Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant
Category: Breweries
I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! This is where I eat anytime I go to a show at the Fox, you can park at GB and it's a beautiful walk to the Fox. The Southwestern Eggrolls are AMAZING. Fantastic salads and pastas, burgers and seafood. The microbrew is the stuff- I've downed more than my share of Golden Export. Anytime someone asks me where to go in midtown I send them to Gordon Biersch- the food is always superb, the service is so friendly, great bar scene and people watching. It's the best!
