Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
YUMMY YUMMYYYY UMAAAAAMIIIII!!!!. . I was so excited to try this place after all the hype! I came in today for lunch with a couple friends. My first impression of the place was bad because they ran out of Diet Coke! What an atrocity!! So I reluctantly ordered a Coke. However, they made up for it because they sold it in those cute glass bottles! Ooh~ I was starting to like the place!. . Now for the EXCITING part! I got the SoCal burger which had butter lettuce, oven dried tomato, caramelized onions, Â american cheese, and their delicious spread. The buns were perfectlyyy toasted and the meat was oooozing with juices!! I was in love after the first bite! I also tried a bite of my friends' Umami Burger and Triple Pork burger. I personally liked my SoCal burger the best because I'm not a personal fan of mushrooms which the Umami burger has a lot of, and the Triple Pork burger was a little TOO crazy flavorful for me. Definitely has a fiery KICK! . . The burgers are a little on the smaller side but I thought it was the perfect portion! I felt pretty dang full afterwards. Guys, on the other hand might wanna order two! Burgers range from $9-11 so it's a tad bit on the pricey side.. . We also shared a side of their malt liquor battered onion rings which came with a side of ketchup. I expected this to taste a lot better but unfortunately, it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it to be, and the taste wasn't really there either. Meh. Disappointment!. . As for parking, there is a small teeny little parking lot in front and the spaces are kinda hard to get into and out of especially if it's crowded.. . But despite that, I would definitely come back again! :)
