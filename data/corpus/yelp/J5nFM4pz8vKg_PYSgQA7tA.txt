This place was recommended to us as a good casual lunch spot with a great outdoor patio seating. . . All the orders are taken at the front cashier and a number is given to be placed on your table of choice. Very similar to Cosi, but the menu and ingredients are MUCH fresher and MUCH more mindful of the caloric intake. . . I ordered the grilled salmon salad and b got the cobb salad with lobster. Very simple and clean, but well done with great layers of flavor. Great portions and even better fruit smoothies. There is plenty of outdoor seating to accommodate everyone, but also a smaller section inside (in case the weather is too blistering.) . . Negatives: $40 for lunch.....for good salads? I'll give because it was really good...but really?. . Advice: Parking is in the back (duhhh). We actually drove around looking for side street metered parking, when we should have driven by slower to notice the sign that says "parking in the back." Also, tip is shared by the entire staff and left in the front in a jar. So tip well, because they are attentive and share all tasks from cashier, to server to cleaner.
