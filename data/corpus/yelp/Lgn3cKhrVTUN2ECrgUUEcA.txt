I've only been for dinner but I agree with others...the food is okay (not bad), but the check definitely is more impactful than the food itself. . . The menu looks good. The setting is nice. I love the feel and decor of the place. It feels really comfortable and unpretentious. The first time I walked in, I immediately felt like I could easily hang out and drink and talk for hours with good friends. It has that feel to it. Very European in a way. . . Unfortunately, the food doesn't necessarily shine very brightly. We had the flat bread appetizer to share. That was okay. I've had better. I had a burger and that was okay, too. Food-wise, everything seemed to be just okay. My dining crew also felt the same way. No one was wowed by their meal. No one was angry or sick but it was still only okay.. . For how you end up feeling about the food, you notice the price, so most people are going to think this place is slight overpriced (maybe $2 too high per dish).. . I honestly cannot remember how the service was. No impression good or bad was made on me. Take that for what its worth.
