Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I found a whole new meaning for champagne room! . . Be very careful when going to this restaurant, especially if it is your birthday. Basically you provide the cake and Manna will provide the champagne on your guest of honor's head! Its quite entertaining, especially after all the soju and beer. . . Otherwise the food was good, not great. AYCE price of around $16 definitely makes this place a deal. . . Caution: . * This place has a thick layer of grease on the ground from all the bbqs. Be careful if you don't want to end on your back. . * Be aware that the grease and smell of the bbq follows you home!
