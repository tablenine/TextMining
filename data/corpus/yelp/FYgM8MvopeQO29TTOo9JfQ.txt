If you want a good meal and good beer, this is the spot.  The selection is great and service is usually very good.  The fish and chips are awesome and their crab cakes are killer!. . If you get there in the evening, the deck has a great view.  Though the deck may not be for you, if you are not a smoker.. . Be patient, as this is a popular place, parking is limited and there is usually a line.  I suggest people to try it out for lunch and then walk around Oakland Cemetery to walk off their meal and beer.
