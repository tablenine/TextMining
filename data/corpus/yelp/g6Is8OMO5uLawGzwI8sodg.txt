Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you come to LA, you must come here to try a hot dog. At anytime of the day there is always a line. The line goes by quick though, so don't be discouraged. I always come when I'm in the neighborhood and I even tried the one in Vegas, it's not the same...I like the one in LA better. There are so many types of hot dogs to pick from and they have some crazy names. . . I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. The fries here are good as well, and it's open late night so thats fantastic. Oh, and it's cash only...so just make sure you have enough.
