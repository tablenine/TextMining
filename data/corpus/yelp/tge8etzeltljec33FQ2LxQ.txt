Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
My dad and I love this place. He used to come here back in his younger days and now we go here together when we are in the area. The service is friendly and fast. Free pickles while you wait! The pastrami is delish. Greasy and messy. But the onion rings and fries are pretty standard. It is a little pricey, but I can never finish a whole sandwich anyway.
