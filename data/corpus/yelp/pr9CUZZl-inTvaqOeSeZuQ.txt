I'll admit it right now... this is one of my favorite places in the universe.  It's the only spot where there's more than just one thing I ever order.  Everything I've had on the menu has been excellent.  The only constant is that I always always always order the plantains.  My God... the plantains.  Absolute perfection... transcendent.  As incredible as any of the main dishes are, there isn't one that I don't rush through to get to the plantains...
