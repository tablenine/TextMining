I don't think Canter's needs another review, but I wanted to have it on record for my own sake since I have a love/hate relationship with Canter's since moving nearby years ago. That means this is the first time I've uttered Canter's name on Yelp. . . After coming here after a screening at Silent Movie Theatre Sam and I came here since it was walkable and open late. Being seated in the booth area near the bar was a great start considering we were only a party of two. And being served by Charmaine was a treat. She's pleasant and efficient and made sure we ordered the good stuff.. . I can't remember exactly what we ordered, but I think it involved a turkey dip sandwich with fries and chicken noodle soup.. . You may go for the history, the kitsch, the bar scene or the late-night diner convenience. Do go, but may be not too often. ;)
