The good... . . Food. . . The annoying!!! . . Piss poor interior space design. . . Hey, I love sitting "right-next-to" some hipster/ rock-a-billy fool booting in the bathroom while eating my burrito"! . . Stupid bar design!. .  Who said, "hey" lets put a five foot long bar in a venue that serves one of the most drunken neighborhoods in the south east ? . . Crowd is fine but... . . Again, the trendy PBR swillers... . . Somehow these people do not realize they have been corralled into some keen ass stealthy mass marketing.. . Honestly, who drinks this swill for the taste?. . If you drink trendy beer because it is"cheap" perhaps you have other problems that need to be addressed first? . Or. . Just admit youre trendy, and enjoy your liver while you still have something that resembles one.....
