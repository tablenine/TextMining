If you are looking for a huge slice of greasy pizza after a night at the bars, you have now found your spot.  They serve pizza by the slice, or by the pie (only extra large).  The pizza is awesome and they come up with some crazy toppings which they rotate throughout the week, homemade meatballs anyone?  The subs are okay, but take forever.  The good news is that they serve beer while you wait.. . My only problem with the place is that I don't think I have ever been helped in under 5 minutes.  It's not like they have a line out the door, they just don't have anyone acknowledging your presence until they feel like looking up from making the pies.  . . All in all, the food is good and they have a perfect location for a late night slice.  Enjoy!
