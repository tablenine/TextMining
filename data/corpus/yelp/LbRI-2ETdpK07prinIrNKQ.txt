As a foodie, I can't really resist the call of what has been dubbed by the media as "the best burger in America."  So, I made an afternoon of it, and on a Saturday headed out to Anne's.. . My wait for my Ghetto burger was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  About an hour and 15 on the patio, and the remainder inside.  I had a light lunch, and I felt like taking on the challenge of eating the whole plate of fries before the burger arrived.. . The burger was as expected: huge, and delicious.  About two-thirds of the way through the burger, I felt like that was about the right amount of food, but that would have been admitting that the fries got the best of me, so I pushed on and finished it.  That's a decision I will not be repeating in the future.  The chili really adds a good flavor to the burger.  Definitely worth going there once, as the experience and the burger is well worth the trip.. . But, best burger in America?  Sadly, I think it falls short of its reputation.  Off the top of my head, I can think of 2 other burgers I've had in the Atlanta area that I think are better: The Tap Burger at Highland Tap, and the black and blue burger from JR Crickets.
