LA, this is the best deli we got.  The pastrami is what brings 'em in, but there's more.  Their rye bread, double baked just before service, is fantastic.  Their tongue too, may be the best in LA.  It's nicely shaved and not too fatty, and quite well cured.  While I'm not a fan of the corned beef (sort of like a pastrami that was forgotten before it was finished), I think that their roast beef and brisket are under-rated.  In particular, the brisket french-dip is much better than that which is found in certain other downtown LA french dip establishments that shall remain unnamed.. . But for serious, I'm all about the #10 (pastrami, swiss, rye, and russian dressing) as it's an essay in deli simplicity and balance.  And I'm not too keen on cole slaw, otherwise I might order the #19, which I'm told is excellent.  The #44 (pastrami, sauerkraut, swiss [never get that 'nippy cheese' it comes with] grilled on rye) gets high honors.  The #54 (tongue, pastrami on rye) and the #6 (chopped liver and pastrami on rye) get the oh-my-god-i-can't-walk-now award, equally distributed between their massive selves.. . Depending on who makes them, the chocolate egg creams can be either spectacular or somewhat ordinary.  Hit or miss.  The kishka is good, though nothing amazing.  The home fries and chili cheese fries are excellent, the olives not so much, and the pickles are great (mind you, I don't mess with new-pickles. ). . The decor is classic, the location is an essay in contrasts (staying positive here folks), and the staff is wonderful.  Shout out to Barbara.
