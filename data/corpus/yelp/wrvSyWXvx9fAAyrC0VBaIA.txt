My best friend Tracy and I get dolled-up and visit Seasons 52 for the extensive wine list and tasty stuffed mushroom appetizers.  You need to dress business causal or "dressy" for this location.  The staff is very friendly and attentative.  We never have to wait long for either a bartender or waiter to serve us.  Love the ambience; stacked stone, dark wood, soft lighting, deep booths to sit in around the bar.  In the winter months, we sit by the fireplaces in the lounge chairs and sofas.  Other customers will wander over (usually men) to chat.  We've always had a great experience.   The only negative was the piano man who sang.  He played piano perfectly, but the singing should've never happened.  He's meant to play piano - not sing.
