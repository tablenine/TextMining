Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Great fish tacos that you don't have to head out to East LA (or Mexico, for that matter). The menu is cheap &amp; super simple - fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and drinks. They cook the fish or shrimp right when you order, so it's fresh &amp; hot. You get to top your tacos as you like them, there's a bar with cabbage, salsa, crema, etc. It's easy to eat way too many tacos. Plus, the Flight of the Conchords had tacos there and wrote a little song about it!
