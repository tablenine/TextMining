Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The only problem with this place is that there usually is a long wait time to get seated because everyone who comes here knows what's up. The Griddle is by far the best bang for the buck. Prices are reasonable if not on the cheap side for the sheer amount of food you get and the food is good yall. My favorite is their version of the eggs benedict (i think they call it the poached y papas).
