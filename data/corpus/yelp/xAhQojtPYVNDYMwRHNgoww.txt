I woke up Saturday morning with a ridiculous burger craving. Rather than going to a local joint, my friend suggested we come up here. What a great idea! I ordered a burger that turned out ot be bigger than my head, and that was the smallest size. I got all the toppings I love, SWEET POTATO FRIES AND ONION CURLS, and everything was perfect. You have lots of different choices (veggie, turkey, chicken, beef, whole wheat, white, english muffin, etc) and the burgers are grilled to perfection. My medium rare burger was actually medium rare. I wish they had a choice of bison burger, but oh well, we can't have everything. There was about a 20 minute wait for a table, but we found seats at the counter right away. A+
