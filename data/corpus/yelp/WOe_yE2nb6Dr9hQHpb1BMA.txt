Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I came here again, under the influence of sticky icky oowee. I dont know why I did the food still sucks. WHat boring bland Mexican food is this? and WHY WHY WHY do people line up for it. I can see the woman's eyes as she handed my my tacos. The look that said "This gringo probably thinks this is real Mexican food" Please dont think I do I know what this crap is and it sure aint Authentico!
