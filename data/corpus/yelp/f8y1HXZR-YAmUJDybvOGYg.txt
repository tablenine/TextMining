Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Dear Tito,. . I loved your tacos. I thought they were delicious and I will come again. I didn't mind the people in line, that just means the more the merrier. I say ignore the haters and "play on playa!" . . To be completely honest, I am not a huge fan of Mexican food, but you had me at first bite. The tacos were delicious and the shells were crisp with no cilantro in sight. I promise to come back and see you soon. Thank you for letting me enjoy my taco. . . Respectfully Yours,. . Susan. . P.S. Can you pretty please start serving orange bang? I would heart you ten times over!
