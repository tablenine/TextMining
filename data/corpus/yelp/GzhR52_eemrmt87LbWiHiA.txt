I just love this little restaurant! . I had the most excellent dinner back in January, so I was so looking forward to my dinner here on Sat night. Unfortunately, they have taken the fresh monzarella cheese of the menu. I sure hope it comes back for summer!! I love the fact that you can get the pasta dishes as a entree or a smaller version, as a appetizer. My husband and I enjoy ordering several smaller dishes and sharing them. . After trying the beef short rib on Sat night, I think we will stick to pasta dishes on our next visit. The short rib was horribly over cooked and the potatoes were so hard and undercooked. We really should have sent it back. I did mention it to our server and he apologised and brought us a free dessert. Even with this mishap, I know I will be back to enjoy some more of their wonderful pasta dishes. Plus I just think this is such a cute spot!
