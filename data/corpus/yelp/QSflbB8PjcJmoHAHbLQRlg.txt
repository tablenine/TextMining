Given the other options around, I think I'd skip this place.. . We had a reservation, but still had to wait a long time for a table.  And the bartender wouldn't let us sit at the bar because we had a child with us (we were not drinking at that point).  This was odd because we've eaten dinner at the bars of restaurants and have never had a problem before.  The hostess, clearly overwhelmed, kept coming back and telling us, "just a few more minutes".  . . When we finally rec'd a table, it was in an archway and really dark.  And loud.. . The food was generally good... I liked the prosciutto-wrapped fontina (although I would have preferred the fontina had been more melty) and my husband liked his fried calamari.  I don't think I'd order another martini there though... too many big chunks of ice.  Maybe the mean bartender shakes the shaker too hard.. . We all had pizzas for our main course.  They were fine, but nowhere as good as Sapore di Napoli or Spacca Napoli.  . . In the end, I'd say that the food was good (maybe 3-4 star), but I was so grumpy by how the evening began that I couldn't enjoy it.
