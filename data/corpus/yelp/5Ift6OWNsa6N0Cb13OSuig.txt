This is a great neighborhood joint. I am always taking people here (and I think it was actually the first Chicago restaurant I ever ate in. awww.) It has such a great feel inside and the prices are right. I am a big fan of their fried tofu appetizer, pasta dishes and fish specials. But, as others have noted, the deserts here are the real tour de force. Just superb. I had a Peanut Butter and Jelly Parfait here once that was truly one of the best deserts I have had in my life. I used to attempt to recreate it but always failed. All this is to say: go to Bite for dinner and save room for desert. It is a special place.
