This is the best pizza in Atlanta.  As with any popular spot, you have "reviewers" on here who have visited the place once and are suddenly an expert, or who are natural born haters and just want to give the place a bad review to make a point or make themselves feel large.  But here's the truth.. . I have eaten here close to 20 times, and there is no better pizza in Atlanta.  Does it get crowded?  It sure does.  Does the pizza suffer if you take it "to go?"  Of course it does - for the love of God, eat the pizza there.  Is parking a hassle and can seating be a hassle and is the fact that they don't have a wine/beer license a hassle?  Yes, yes and yes.  And has the pizza been perfect every single time I have been there?  No, once the crust was overly bready and the middle of the pizza was soggy but hey, we are talking about a $20 pizza here, we're not talking about bellying up to the sushi bar at Masa in New York for a $500 sushi dinner - maintaining some sense of perspective is a virtue - and in any event, it is way way way more consistent that other places like Varasanos where the pizza has been less than great about half the times I have been there. . . You go here with full knowledge of, and despite, the inconveniences because they have the best pizza in Atlanta.
