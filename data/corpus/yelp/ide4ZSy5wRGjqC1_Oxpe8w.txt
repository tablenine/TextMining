Mmmmm... I had a great first experience here the other day.  I was a bit nervous walking into The Vortex after reading several negative reviews about the "extremely rude service."  We chose a nice two-person table and patiently waited for our server to approach.  Of course, to fit the image of "The Vortex" she was covered with tattoos, many of which I admired while giving her the dreaded "water" drink order.  Even at some fine dining establishments, you'll catch attitude when ordering a simple water, but she smiled and proceeded to take my friend's pain-in-the-ass pink lemonade and sprite drink order.  She came back with HUGE glasses, which is always awesome because it deters waiting for refills.  She also gave us the perfect amount of time to order- for me, the Bleu Shroom Burger with fried zucchini, and for her, just a simple cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.   . . The food came out in a timely fashion (ten to fifteen minutes) and I could go on for twenty minutes on how DELICIOUS these burgers were.  My burger was excellent; the perfect ratio of bleu cheese to burger.  Her burger was awesome as well--and for those of you who say that The Vortex is only good because of the toppings, you're wrong!!  Even the simple cheeseburger was so amazing, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The patties were so juicy and full of flavor, and the topping on mine definitely did not hurt.  My fried zucchinis were to die for, I am officially an addict.  . . Not only that, but the famously "rude" servers were so nice and laid-back, I loved it!  Nothing worse than servers that try too hard and won't leave you alone... The best part was when we got the bill... it's good to know I can eat an awesome, inexpensive meal during these unstable economic times.  I will definitely be back for more mouth-watering burgers.
