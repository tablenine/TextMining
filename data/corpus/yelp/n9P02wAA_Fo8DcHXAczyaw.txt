I finally got to meet Al, and though we just dropped in to take a few falafel and gyro sandwiches to go, Al gave us a small plate of hummus and two other dips alongside a small dish of cut up pita for us to eat while we waited. That's the kind of hospitality one encounters in middle eastern countries that I've been to.  Thanks Al, we really appreciated it.  I will gladly say that this place by far makes the best gyros and falafels that I've had in ATL- because it's just  true!
