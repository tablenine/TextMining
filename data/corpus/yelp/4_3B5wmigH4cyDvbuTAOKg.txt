Restaurant: Luckie Food Lounge
Category: Lounges
Been there a few times.  In the daytime for lunch, it's a definite restaurant with a light crowd.  The food is just okay, the few items that I've had were not bad.  The drinks were cool. The dessert was a let down when it made the table...didn't support the fluff description in the menu, I'm big on a good dessert.  On a friday night, the scene may run those just looking for dinner and cocktails away.  Atlanta has this way of turning their swank little restauants in to an overcrowded, pay to get in to pay to eat and drink, type clubs.  Depending on what mood I'm in Luckie may work out just fine, or it may be a turn off.  Overall, it's nowhere that I'd make it my business to be.
