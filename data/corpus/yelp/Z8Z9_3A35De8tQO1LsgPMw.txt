Yiiiiikes.... . So the hipster waiters/waitresses have the worst attitudes ever. "I'm-too-cool-to-be-serving-you-these-fries" ..really? Oh I get it.. you're an ACTOR, and this is just your night gig, right? *shakes head* . . The food here is really decent, tasty, and not expensive. I liked what I ordered (french toast) but the service was terrible. . . To test how bad it was, we ordered a side of pickles. Do you know how long it took to get said pickles? 25 minutes. Shifts changed when we arrived, and our first waiter didn't let our new waitress know what was going on... so we never really saw her. She came over once to "see how we were doing." . . The bathrooms are really neato looking and funky designs painted on the walls.. it's open 24 hours so that's convenient too... but, um... . yeah, we'll pass.
