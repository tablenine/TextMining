WA WA WEE WA. So delicious, so fresh, so amazing.. . Mama dragged me out of bed on a Sunday morning to come here and thank God she did. Started out with FRESH FRESH FRESH guacamole. They roll out the cart with all of the ingredients, ask you how you want it prepared (mom requested it mild to medium) and then make it there right in front of you with a fresh avocado and all the fixins. Served with warm chips.. . Mom indulged in the Tamirand Chicken dish - served with what she described as "an amazing Mexican BBQ" sauce. Looked delicious, and the chicken was huge. She took home half of it after leaving stuffed! I wasn't super hungry so I was completely satiated (and then some) with my gordita appetizer. I'm not a fan of corn tortillas, but my gorditas were delicious nonetheless thanks to the meaty braised pork and savory sauce.. . Will absolutely be back, and will absolutely order a larger meal. However, I will be sure to request my mojito with rum because apparently, as my mom (surprisingly) discovered, they make theirs with tequila! Woops!
