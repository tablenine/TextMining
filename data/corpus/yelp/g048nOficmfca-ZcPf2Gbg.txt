Two words: HAPPY HOUR! . 3-12am on Monday during NFL football season. . I'm a HUGE football fan. fanatic. I yell, scream, get frustrated and angry if my team isn't doing well or loses. =) So I love that Yardhouse has numerous televisions and are nice about changing the channel to suit your desires! ++ for me. . . This place never fails to get me satisfied but it is a chain so it is nothing phenomenal! However, it seems to hit the spot each time we wander into that place.  Warning: This place is usually extremely packed.  So prepared yourself ahead of time.  . . Food: I love the ahi tuna sandwich when i come for a regular meal.  The cheeseburger there was quite heart attacking! Yum! The ahi salad is extremely tasty too!  I like my raw fish! . . Happy hour: tower of onion rings, sliders, pizza, chicken nachos, wings, and the ahi pokie stack!!  (Yeah, i like them all) . . Beer: hundred to choose from. However, I prefer the normal blue moon or hefs.  I haven't been adventurous... maybe I should start! Lately, I haven't wanted to drink my calories because I want to save room for the 1/2 price appetizers!
