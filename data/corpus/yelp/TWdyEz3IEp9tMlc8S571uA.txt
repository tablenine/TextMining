I came here for a girls night out and we pretty much ordered everything on the menu and it was delicious!!!  We had an awesome server and a beautiful view.  We were there for hours and even if you don't have room for dessert, order the strawberry filled donuts, it is to die for, your tummy will make the room for this yummy dessert.
