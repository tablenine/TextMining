I'll make this review short...this place is frickin' awesome for both Breakfast and Lunch. If you can go on a weekday, you'll be in heaven because it's not as crazy it sounds like it is on Weekends. Both times I went on a Monday morning/afternoon and there were tables-a-plenty. The Apple cobbler french toast is both delicious and ridiculous (honestly...who can eat that much), and their chili (I had whatever their spicy one was that day) is a delicious greasy treat that serves as a great way to have something meaty and a crazy-good piece of corn bread (again...the piece of corn bread was the size of a brick). . . It was one of my favorite places to eat while I visited LA for three months...unfortunately I didn't get to go their that often (curse that city and the need for an automobile!)
