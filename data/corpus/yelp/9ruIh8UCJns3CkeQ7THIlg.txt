Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Just like everyone says, Tahoe is better. The meat is really of a completely different quality, the bulgogi, though tasty seems artificially so, as if the marinade were 50% msg. The kalbi might not have been kalbi based on the texture and the sides aren't as good either, the kimchee was like bizarrely bitter.. . in any event people's complaints about the service are, atleast in my opinion unfounded, maybe they didn't know you have to press the button on the table to get them to come because once you hit that sucker they come quick.. . the only reason they're not getting two stars is that every so often this really loud korean techno song comes on which i think is a sign to drink and thats always alot of fun.
