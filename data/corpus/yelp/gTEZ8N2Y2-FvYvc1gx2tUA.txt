In about a two-week stretch, I've tried two of the most highly rated sushi joints in the Little Tokyo area and I've had very different and yet eerily similar experiences at both.  Unlike Restaurant Komasa, we were promptly seated here (table for 2).. . Several nigiri were simply top-notch and we actually ended up ordering more to finish our meal. These were:  . . - Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp, bodies nigiri-style with the heads deep fried, mm-mm good). . - The Yellowtail, Konpachi, Unagi, and Scallop Nigiri were all very tasty.. . Much of the other nigiri was just okay, nothing earth-shattering (like the Salmon, Tuna).. . The  Oyster (wrapped with seaweed, blech) was one item I actually had to force down and would not recommend.  There was also another roll that we got that was just not very pleasant.  I also don't think that I would order the Spicy Tuna Roll or Uni again here.. . The impression I have right now is that Sushi-Gen has more variability (taste-wise) in their food (more highs and more lows as well).  The stuff that's good is really good, but there is just stuff that I didn't care for.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'd drive out for either of them.
