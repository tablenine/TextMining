This is not the place for those who are counting calories.  This is the type of food you want to eat after a night out so that all that grease can soak up the alcohol.  Fortunately, this place is open 24/7 so you can satiate that need for grease at any hour of the day.. . The food is pretty decent.  I usually go for the Reuben -- either with corn beef or the pastrami.  I can't complain with the choices.  It's pretty tasty, fills me up, but you do leave feeling a little uncomfortable digesting all that sodium and calories.  But at least, I'm digging my own grave on this one.  The best part is the refillable pickle plate -- those are some tasty pickles.. . Service is pretty good but it depends on how busy it is.  As with all places, you'll wait more during busier times.  Duh.. . One of my favorite parts of the restaurant is the ceiling with the tree patterns -- it's so psychedelic looking.  It's the type of ceiling that you look at when you're really drunk that sends you spinning in circles.  Awesome.
