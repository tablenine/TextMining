Really what more do you want on a Sandwich.  There is alot of meat and yes there is a little fat as well.  I have tried other Pastrami Sandwiches and found that without some fat the meat is dry and the sandwich taste kind of like lunch meat.  The chilli fries here are huge.  The sandwich is big enough to split.
