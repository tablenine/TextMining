Category: Delis
I rarely order pastrami, and almost never order a sandwich on rye. However, #19 has a special place in this roast beef/salami/honey roasted turkey on sourdough lovin' gal's heart and stomach. Complete with an egg cream, this meal comes close to perfection. Mmmmm! . . Additionally, I tried the cheese blintzes, thanks to stephy s's enticing photo. Yum! They were very rich, and great for sharing. Also sampled the corned beef hash. It was pretty good but a bit drier than I would have expected. Still delish, though! . . Another fabulous Langer's memory is Evangeline, a very cheery waitress! I just felt happier just for having met her. . . There's a parking lot across the street and up a block, free w/ validation. . . Overall, a great experience here! It's not a fancy place by any means, but it feels homey and the food is comforting. 5 stars.
