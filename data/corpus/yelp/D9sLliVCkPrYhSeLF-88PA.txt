I was so happy to find a place like this!. . I haven't had a lot of luck with thin crust by-the-slice in Chicago.  The odd choices on the menu are fun.  I had the mac n' cheese pizza as well as a slice with beef, bbq sauce and french fries.  I'm going to have to go back to try some of the burrito pizza and I'd like to see how they do more standard slices.. . The staff is very friendly and the price per slice is cheap.  Try to avoid going to this place anytime near a game at Wrigley, because this place will fill up fast.  When you're inside, take a look at the artwork.
