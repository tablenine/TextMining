3.5 stars.. . Like the feel of this place with the high ceilings.  Feels like you're in NYC when you eat here.  We shared the clam pizza, eggplant caponata, beef carpaccio, and fried portabello mushrooms.  Eggplant was my least favorite, it was just ok--it was too cold or something.  The fried mushrooms are a must try.  The pizza is thin crust and a good size to share.  The wines are very reasonably priced.  The macaroons were a bit of a disappointment.  I'm thinking the ones I bought may have been old because they tasted very dry.    . . Parking situation sucks.  Either find a meter or pay to park in a lot.  No need to valet, you can self-park in the same lot for $1 or 1.50 less.
