Restaurant: Top Flr
Category: American (New)
Top Flr formerly held the spot as my favorite place in Midtown.  I've eaten there easily 2 dozen or more times.  Prices and portions were right, the food was good to very good, and the atmosphere was cool.. . I'm not sure what happened.. . Our last few visits have been horrible.  Wrong food, wrong wine, horrible service, no service, rude service, overcooked food, bland food, too salty- you name it, it got messed up.. . I don't know if they went through a change in management, cooks, or what, but around Dec. it started on a downward slide and never came back.  I've been 4x this year, wanting it to be good again, and it is still in its rut.  . . This had the magic formula for awhile, and I'm not sure what happened, but it is gone.  This place was great.
