Unfortunately, another sushi fav on sushi row that has bitten the worm.  . . They're just not getting the same quality fish as they were in 07 when I lived right up the hill from them - and so I go back now hoping for that same, oh my tuna god experience, to be bummed out  anymore.  . . And the prices are only going up, along with everything else, but I just don't find myself dying to go back anymore.
