Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I love their pork belly! Like everyone else, I agree that their service is amazing and their food is good. I actually didn't like the beef brisket as much as I wanted to but everything was great. They cooked everything for us. Parking is definitely not fun. I came during lunch so there was a space right in front of the restaurant. They even had a flat screen for us to watch TMZ on. I brought a friend from New Jersey that has never had authentic Korean BBQ before and he loved it. I told the waiter there this and he kept coming back and suggesting him to try different sauces and eating the BBQ with some of the wraps in the banchan to change it up. My friend loved it and really appreciated them. Good food and service. I'll definitely come back. Check our my blog for a more detailed account: . http://ate-ate-ate.blo.... /
