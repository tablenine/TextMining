A great spot for a quick and casual bite to eat.  The best quality food you will find in the price range in LA.  Can't go wrong with any of the menu choices, Chipotle Chicken salad is awesome.  Recently I tried the chicken and the tuna in a sandwich for the first time, ciabatta bread is very good and not too doughy like it can get over at Larchmont sometimes.  Also, as a side with the sandwiches you can get roasted vegetables instead of one of their house salads if you'd like, you just have to ask.
