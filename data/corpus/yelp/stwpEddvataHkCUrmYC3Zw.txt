I feel like I was a little mean to Silver Cloud before. The service is always great, and the drink menu (from microbrews to mimosas to cocktails) is always diverse and usually pretty good. The food is just okay, but it will fill you up cheaply (if that is what you are looking for). Take our brunch, for instance. The first arrivals of the day, we had our pick for the patio. Coffee is decent, the $6 mimosa is pretty much two mimosas (with the extra champagne and juice they give you!). Not a bad deal. Egg sandwich with extra tomatoes for $7, the standard eggs, toast, and potatoes for like $5. It's not great, but when you want the old standbys (two eggs, toast, bacon), this is where to go. That's what my boyfriend likes. I, on the other hand, would much rather have a pork belly egg sandwich from Bristol....but sometimes you have to compromise...because you never pay;)
