Ozzy Spicy Dog.... all the way.. . I waited on the dang line for FORTY-FIVE minutes to taste one of these badboys. Worth it? ehhh... maybe, sorta, on occassion when you just really want one. Love the million options you can pile on top.. (guac!) but the toppings are all generic, out-of-the-cans that you can get at any market. So what makes them so popular? the combos? the dogs? i don't know. Maybe I can make my own at home..... ok now i'm rambling.. . Pay the meters on the street for your cars promptly. The meter-maids are vicious.
