Enough reviews about the food to see whats popular and that patio seating is a must. I want to talk about the people here.. . Staff is usually hella busy and fast service but if you catch them when theres time to breathe, theyre quite chatty. Kudos for the service as they do work it out here to keep it going.. . I somehow meet people here often out of all the cafes about town. Once I asked this faboo gay about the flavored licorice they sell here  and he was munching on. Soon enough, he's stuffing a orange one in my mouth and talking about the neighborhood and he's dogging on my flavored "crapuccino". I come here with brother and friends and sometimes people next to us get talking...a few times we've pulled tables together and mixed up. Someone once put a flower in my long hair (I was growing for Locks of Love) and said I was beautiful and walked on with their day. It's in my old neighborhood so childhood friends sometimes see run into me here. I've had people sit with me when I've eaten alone and ate with me. It's a place where I can walk up to Mandy Moore and say hello and she'll chat a bit.. . I do enjoy the food and will come for that, but this place is more than that. This place feels like being in someones home garden......meeting these random people makes it home.
