Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Con: A long line. Pro: Talking with your friends in the Long Line . Con: Your legs getting tired from standing . Pro: You can do squats and burn off calories while in line. . . Just Kidding. The line is long, but who cares--its long because its good! . Lots of quirky hot dogs, toppings, and fun on the whole menu. . . Be careful where you park, we got a ticket the first time we came here. Still, I really liked the hotdogs and the staff was patient--nice for a short order place. Long Live Pinks!
