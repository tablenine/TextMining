It's been a while since I had lunch there, but the awesome chicken salad has been in the back of my mind since then! The restaurant is very clean and well-organized, and the food impeccably presented. The only reason I'm not more emphatic about my recommendation was the service. A friend and I met there and we sat for a while, but it was over half an hour after I finished my coke that the waitress even asked if I wanted a refill (which I desperately did!). I saw other staff being helpful, though, so it doesn't seem like a chronic problem.. . If you go, I highly recommend the chicken salad sandwich-- it's phenomenal! I would definitely try it for lunch first, though, because it looks to have the possibility to (and I've heard locally does) get expensive. . . There wasn't outside seating, but there are so many windows and the ceilings are so high that it doesn't feel at all claustrophobic.
