First Yelp review in like a month. Oye. Bossa Nova... Really good, chill, laid back and not too pricey. I've been hearing things about this "hot spot" for awhile and it did live up to the reviews and fanfare. The menu is pretty large and features some pretty interesting dishes. As I waited for a seat I could not help but notice the appearance the dishes passing before me. The portions were massive the food looked vibrant and fresh and of course everything smelled really f*!$&amp;#@ good. . So a few minutes go by and my friends and I are seated. The menu is daunting. Do I want the Avery Salad or the Goat Cheese special... hmm no maybe the pasta New Orleans, eh? BBQ Bacon Burger? Choices, choices and big time decisions. Once the dust settled I went with Giovanna's pasta. It was creamy, delicious and packed with chopped prociutto and chicken (I recommend to creamy white sauce pasta lovers this world and over). Anyway I was satisfied. No complaints at all and I am looking forward to the next visit.
