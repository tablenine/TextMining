Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
My fiance took me and my parents to Yamashiro.   After ordering food and drink, he held my hand and asked if my parents could allow him to marry their daughter!   Perfect restaurant for special occassions like this, or simply take your date there for a romantic night.. . Besides the view and atmosphere, food was just so so and overpriced.   You are paying for the environment and service, not the food itself.
