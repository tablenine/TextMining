Even snottier staff than Montana location, which I wouldn't have thought was possible.  It's a shame; the burgers and setting are great and this could be a centrally-located go-to for me and my friends, but after being reprimanded for 1.  coming in the gate the wrong way to join friends who already had a table, 2. eating some cookies someone brought ("no outside food!") and 3.  asking for ice in my white wine ("I can give it to you in a separate glass."), I'd probably vote against this place next time friends plan a relaxing afternoon out.  I've never gotten the whole "Soup Nazi" thing of treating your customers like shit, but if that's what you're looking for, these guys have it down.  If you'd rather not be treated like a four year-old who keeps running afoul of the lifeguard, find another spot.  Sad thing is, they've got no incentive to change.  Yet.
