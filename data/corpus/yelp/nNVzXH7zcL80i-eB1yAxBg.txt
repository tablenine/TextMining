Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
A bit pricey, but consistently satisfying. I can't speak for their ribs, as I'm not a big meat-on-the-bone person, but Smoke Daddy's pulled pork is top-notch. If you're there for dinner, I'd advise sitting out on the patio. You'll still be able to hear the live music inside, but you'll also be able to converse without screaming at the top of your lungs. If Jacob's your server, ask him to tell you about their sauces...he's an absolute wealth of BBQ knowledge.
