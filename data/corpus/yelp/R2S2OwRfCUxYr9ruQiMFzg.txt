OooOoooh...their flank steak sandwich is scrumptious and the spinach hazelnut, and goat cheese side salad for $10 ain't bad!  Off of a tip from another yelper, I also bought the black cherry pop, which is I think my favorite!  Great place to go to, except AVOID GOING THERE AT 12 NOON!  The line is ridiculous!  We got there just 10 min prior and there was no line, but as soon as the lunch clock hit, BOOM!  It was like a hollywood bar on a saturday night.
