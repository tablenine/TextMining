Still a great salad place. After having tried all of their salads, I have a final top 3 big salads list:. . 1. Tuna Nicoise. 2. Chipotle BBQ Chicken. 3. Grilled Flatiron Steak. . If you happen to notice the Lamb Osso Bucco Salad is their salad of the day, ORDER IT! The lamb isn't super gamey or fatty and it falls right off the bone. Drool. Also, 2 new salads have been added to their official big salads menu that are imo ok: Sexy Sprouts Salad and Grilled Prawn Salad. . . Not big on salads? Their protein + garlic mashed potato dish or sandwich with your choice of protein are really, and I mean, REALLY good too. I know the bread on the sandwich may look unappealing and dry, but it's anything but.
