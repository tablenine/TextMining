Scrumdidlyumptious.  A cuban bakery?  Amazing!  Any pastry with chocolate is worth trying.  The dulce de leche latte must have crack as a secret ingredient!  I can't get enough!  There are so many tasty treats here, i don't even know where to begin.  The steak salad is good, paninis, too many things to list!
