Great spot on a Saturday morning to chat with friends and relax on a peaceful patio with delicious food.  The iced coffee is super delish (Inteligista), as are the Classic Eggs Benedict and the Brioche French Toast with Bourbon Pecans and Vanilla Bean Cream.  . . The waitresses are adorable as well as attentive and laid back.  I will be visiting this place again and again, especially in this great weather!
