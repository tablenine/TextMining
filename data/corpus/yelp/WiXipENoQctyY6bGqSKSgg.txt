oh wow, this place was amazing!! we went here for sunday brunch, and the spread was incredible... in particular i loved the french toast, and the creole blackened chicken. being born and bred in boston, i had grits for the first time here, and it was quite good. everything was fresh as the cooks kept coming back to refill the trays.. . the waitstaff was great too, we came with my baby nephew and niece, and they were very accomadating... i still can't get over how nice people in the south are!! . . the buffet was 15.99 i believe, but worth every penny!
