I went there for dinner tonight and it was just okay. I wouldn't say it was the best ramen I have ever tasted in my whole life. . . I really like the pork in the ramen but the soup base was too salty for me. Also, the noodle was also too chewy for my liking.. . Overall, I didn't think it was justifiable to be charged 8.50 for a bowl of "okay" noodle. In addition, they also charged us 15% gratuity although our party of 7 were split between the bar and the table that were even remotely closed to each other. I don't know if the gratuity is added for everyone or just because we were a part of 7. Either way, it just doesn't work for me.
