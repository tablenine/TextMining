I am very impressed by this spacious coffeeshop that opened up in my neighborhood. The staff are friendly, the drinks are reasonably priced and the place attracts a lovely crowd. Free wi-fi and lots of sunlight during the day make this a great place to work and study. . . I am also writing this review, because of the below comment made by one Mary C. I quote, "the culture at New Wave seems to attract angry hipsters who still miss Filter, but shun anyone who bought a Shins' album AFTER "Garden State" came out.  I've only rarely felt so uncool." Lady, you have embarrassed yourself with your unctuous, superficial, self-satisfied diatribe about people you know absolutely nothing about. Angry Filter loving hipsters?? WTF?  I certainly have yet to meet these angry Filter loving hipsters while at New Wave Cafe. Your insults about the staff who are extremely friendly, attractive, and nice and your perceptive comment about the coffee shop being made for people born in the 90's (that would make the patrons of the coffeeshop between the ages of 10 - 19) show you to be a radically unaware smug individual. Please stop doing reviews for Yelp; for your sad, damaged, and ignorant ego affords you no expertise to comment on anything.
