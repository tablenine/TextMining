Looking through other reviews, it looks like this place can be hit or miss. When I was there with a small group, it was a hit. Great service, the food was fantastic (seafood fresh, meat cooked to order), and the bread was impossibly,wonderfully garlicy. . . Only thing that takes this place down are the prices. Not out-of-control expensive, but definitely high for the waiters to be in t-shirts and the bussers to be so aggressive.
