Now, I'm a fan of bar food, but I do have a discriminating palate.  Go to graveyard.  Their menu is normal bar food turned elegant.  The fish &amp; chips were out of this world!  The fried pickles were excellent as well!  I've eaten at Graveyard 3 times and each time everything has been immaculate, from the food to the drinks to the darts and pool.  I highly recommend it for dinner!
