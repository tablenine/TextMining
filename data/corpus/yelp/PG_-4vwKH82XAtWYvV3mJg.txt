Restaurant: Bonnie&#39;s Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
I have a theory that everything at Bonnie's is hot and spicy. I have drawn this up this theory from two observations: One, everything is spicy; two, it says "Hot &amp; Spicy Bonnie's Grill" on their menu.. . But the food is great and it's an excellent diner-style atmosphere.
