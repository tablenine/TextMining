This is one of the better ramen joints in los angeles.  The noodles have a strong consistency and texture which complements the broth nicely.  In the dead heat of summer what business does anyone have sipping hot soup in a poorly ventilated room you may ask?  Well if you can stand the ridiculous wait and cramped booths, you will enjoy a solid bowl of ramen.  The rice bowls are excellent as well, particularly the ones of the pork variety.  However it turned out to be quite a bit of food.  I recommend a large bowl of their kotteri with a healthy dollop of garlic mush and call it a night!
