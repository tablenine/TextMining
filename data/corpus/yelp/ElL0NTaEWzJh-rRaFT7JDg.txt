Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This place gets 5 stars for the ambience. The food actually gets 3 because its just not all that. Back to the ambience- once you enter the door- you feel like you've left LA and entered a garden in the South of France. Romantic candles everywhere, ivy and flowers hang above you, cool music playing... and beautiful people dining! Really a wonderful date spot.
