Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I was walking down La Cienega with a female friend, and she wasn't in the mood to goto Koi since she had already had Sushi a couple of days ago.  Ah, so I busted out my trusty iDouche ---errr I mean iPhone, and using the Yelp app, came up with Taste.  The reviews were good so we walked right over.  That's right, we walked in LA!. . Based on Desiree's review (and a few others) I went with the Cumin spiced Pork Chop with the fancy pants Mac n Cheese.  I must admit it was the thickest and juciest pork chop I ever done had, and the cumin flavor added a unique spice and Middle Eastern vibe that just set it all off right.. . Not sure what the deal with nouveau cuisine Mac N Cheese in LA is as of late, but it worked.  Very creamy and light cheese sauce with a crusted/baked cheese top, with Shell pasta instead of real deal Mac underneath.  Definitely worked well with the chop.. . Taste also adds a charming decor, though it is on a quieter part of Melrose.  You can't go wrong using this place as a romantic date spot. and the open air patio is divine even this time of year in November.. . My friend had the Salad with Goat Cheese and Pomegranite Seeds, which was quite nice.  The Chicken Tortilla soup was nothing to write home about, but you can't go wrong.. . All in all, an easy going spot, sweet decor, sexy vibe, and good eats.  Thumbs up!
