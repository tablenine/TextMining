OK. I tried a very boring mild Miso soup thing.  . . I went here cuz I saw it on Man Vs Food, and i wanted to be somebody for just one night. lol. . . The service is pretty nice, they refil your water, and the food comes out pretty quick. . . I wish I had a spicier broth...........cuz the Miso one Mild is BLAND BLAND BLAND.  I didn't like it after a while, I kept puttint flavoring in it. . . i tried my friends littles spicey one, and I wish I had ordredd that instaed it tasted really good. . . JUST THE SOUP IS ENOUGH TO EAT I GOT SO DAMN FULL! . . It bowls are huge. omg! If someone wants rice, GET ONE ORDER AND SHARE IT!. . They take Cash or Card. :) I would just bring cash here. . . The bathroom is nice. :) . . The place is nice and near a book store. :) . . So order soem spice. you wont regret it. :)
