I really wanted to like this place-I really really did but it just didn't happen.  The food is okay, service sucks and atmosphere a little confusing.  I'm not sure if they're trying to be a bar or a restaurant but both doesn't work, esp. the way they have it set up.  I have to say, their rooftop view is incredible!!  I'd come back just to hang out up there. (therefore I went for the 3 stars opposed to 2).. . What I did find interesting was the popcorn shrimp comes in a popcorn bucket with real popcorn around.  Also, the cotton candy comes out in a mini shopping cart for everyone to share.  I give them props for being unique.. . Overall, come here with a group of friends for a casual bite if you want but I think most people prefer coming here for the after hours scene.
