When I worked in West LA, this was one of my go-to lunch spots.  The food itself isn't too special, but their offerings for the most part are reasonably priced and tasty to boot.  The atmosphere isn't much, but I thought their food was for lack of a better word, comforting.  I wish there were someplace similar in Santa Cruz.. . Plus, it beats getting pizza for lunch or a host of other fast food eats.. . Parking can be a bitch; the lot is small, and there isn't much in the way of street parking.  Pray that the force is with you.
