Decent but a bit expensive for such small quantities.   Not worth the wait in line.   Cash only.  You can easily spend $20 here and not be full.. . 1. Kalbi Tacos - Expensive at $2 but very good.   I've tried it with orange sauce instead and it's too sweet.   . 2. Pork Tacos -  Not as good as kalbi but still tasty.  Kimchi coleslaw provides a good crunch/texture.. 3. Blackjack quesadilla -  Soggy.  Overly stuffed and kept falling apart.  The flavors just didn't blend well.. 4. Sliders -  Too much bread, not enough kalbi meat.. 5. Kalbi Breakfast Burrito - Very good and filling.   Keeps well if you want to eat it the next day.. 6. Tres Leches - By far, my favorite thing here.  Cake is light and not overly sweet.  Love the tapioca and milk surprise in the middle along with the toffee bits on top.. . The entire menu consists of either kalbi, pork, chicken or tofu along with kimchi coleslaw stuffed into tacos, burger/hot dog bun or tortilla.
