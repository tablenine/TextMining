I love how many beers they have available, but the ONE that I wanted they didn't carry anymore. I was pretty bummed, so I hope they reprint their menu to take that one off. BOO. . . The food was pretty good, but I have to say that the wings were just okay. I say this, because the sauce was kinda blah, and when I asked the difference between mild, hot, extra hot, etc., the answer I got was BS; they said it is the amount of sauce that they put on. BOO! The sauce is pretty good, but it resembles a hot sauce, more than a buffalo sauce. . . The place is pretty macho too, I honestly can't believe there are that many TVs in that space, but there are! And there are tons of sports on... so, if that isn't your thing, I would go somewhere else. Also, there is a patio, but it is smoking. Yuck.
