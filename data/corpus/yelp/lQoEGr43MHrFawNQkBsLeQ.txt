Hmm, can't believe I never wrote a review on this place.  If its not so expensive, I'd come here all the time!  Their garlic noodles inspired me to cook it at home!  It is on my top 10 list of best dishes I've ever tasted.  No wonder they have a super secret recipe and a super secret kitchen to cook it in.  They must put crack in it or something!!  It's so good and addicting, especially for a garlic junkie like me.  I've tried the tiger prawns and the dungeness crab, both are finger licking good.  . . The original restaurant is Thanh Long in SF, there is also a Crustacean in SF too.  I've tried both of them, and I think both SF restaurants seem to taste slightly better for some reason.  They are less fancy than the BH one and the prices are lower too.
