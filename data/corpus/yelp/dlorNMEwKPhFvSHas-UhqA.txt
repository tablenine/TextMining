I remember when this place first opened, I was so happy to have a closer Mexican restaurant to offer when some charlatan suggested we eat at Garcia's.. . The people there are some of the friendliest in Chicago, with an obvious family run theme. Â . . Food has always been great when I've went, haven't been there for awhile so I won't comment on the particulars.
