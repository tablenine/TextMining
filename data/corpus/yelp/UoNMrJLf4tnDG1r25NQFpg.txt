Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I didn't really know much about Milk before I tried it; I just knew it looked awesome from the street. The gimmick is upfront and pervasive - dairy. They specialize in milkshakes and ice cream and other deserts but there is also a nice long list of lunch items, like salads and hot and cold sandwiches. You order from the counter, get a number, and grab a table. Unfortunately it was fairly crowded on the Saturday afternoon I went, so no outdoor tables for us :( I had the prosciutto panino which came with a mixed greens salad and a little dish of this quinoa-like grain mixture. And a latte. Both were great. I was initially under the impression that this was a sit-down restaurant, but the service was fast and the prices good. . . Fancy malt shop and bakery that does lunch too.
