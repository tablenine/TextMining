Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
We decided to come to Roy's because of Restaurant Week.  I will say, I was really impressed with variety of food they offered on the prix-fixe menu and it was really good to see a restaurant that wasn't going to be cheap jerks about things.. . I liked the menu a lot.  The food was fresh and tasty, and generally just GOOD.  I didn't think anything was particularly unique or inspiring, but everything sounded good, and you couldn't really go wrong.. . The service was great, and they even dealt with my super silly/crazy boyfriend as he continued to heckle and harrass the people working there.  . . Nothing stood out in my mind, but I wouldn't say NO if someone invited back there.
