Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
Pretty good.  Brought my girlfriend here in our ongoing quest to explore the eateries of Druid Hills.  . . I started out with the spring rolls - light, crispy, and delicious.  After poring over the menu's more expensive (and tasty-sounding) offerings, I settled on a more basic dish - green curry - and my girlfriend went with the Pad See U.  My previous Thai experiences had me expecting a bit more coconut milk in the green curry, but instead I got a heavy blast of fresh basil - I didn't mind.  Great flavor, and the waiter kindly kicked it up a notch in the spice category upon request - comparable to "hot" or "thai" level at the other places I've been to.  The Pad See U was fine, but could have used a bit more soy sauce, I'm told.. . Cocktails were definitely on the weak side, as mentioned by Tris C., but a polite word to the waiter fixed that problem in the second round.. . I'll definitely be going back to sample more of their menu.
