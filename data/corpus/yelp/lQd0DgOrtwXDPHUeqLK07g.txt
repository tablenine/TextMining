I know some people have complained about poor service and food, but I have been here four or five times, and I have never had anything to complain about.. . Besides, they make awesome guacamole, which has been mentioned about a hundred times on here, but that's because it's true. Also true: they have the world's best margarita mix. Why is that? Because it's freshly squeezed lime juice with sugar in it. That's it.. . Another drink I love there is this beer drink called, I believe, a Michelada. I can't remember if that's the right name for it or not, but it's basically mexican beer mixed with something that sort of resembles bloody mary mix without the tomato juice. Then they rim the glass 1/2 with salt and 1/2 with chili powder. It's really good, especially with the guacamole.. . I also think their coffee is really good. Which sounds weird, I guess, but whatever, it's awesome.. . Plus tequila flights, chocolate tamales, ceviche... what is there to complain about?
