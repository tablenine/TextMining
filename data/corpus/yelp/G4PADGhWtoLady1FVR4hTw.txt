Based on fellow yelpers reviews, went with my sis and cousin last wed and loved it! We made sure we were there 615-630P. By 730 there were about 15 peeps outside waiting for a table. When we got there, we got lucky because we got a table right away by the glass window.. ( not so good later, since peeps were staring at our food from the outside =(. We ordered the ff:. Seafood with bean curd soup . Clam with black bean soup. Shrimp with walnuts. Beef ( french style) = with onions and pepper . They were all very tasty!  The waiters were all very friendly as well, Even with all the peeps waiting outside, we weren't  rushed to pay or anything ! i will def come back... will def try the lobster dish next time.
