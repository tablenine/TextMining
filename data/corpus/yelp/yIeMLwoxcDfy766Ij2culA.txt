Full thumbs-up on this place.. . I called in an order and picked it up 20 minutes later ... the meal was boxed with several fortune cookies, several pairs of chop-sticks, and a plentiful meal+steamed rice.. . As others have said, you'll pay a little more - mine was $12 out the door with tax... but there is enough for two people OR leftovers.
