One of the best happy hours downtown.  Cheap mojitos and small bites that aren't typical greasy bar food.  The menu changes seasonally, but usually has the same spin with different ingredients.  My favorites have always been the quesadilla with a side of spicy crema, any kind of empanada, carnitas and you can't go wrong with olives and almonds.  . . I have been known to have 3-4 drinks plus share 3-4 plates and the total bill for two is $50-something.  One perk is that we had made friends with the bar staff early on moving here 3 years ago and got a good neighbor card for a discount on meals.  . . Make sure you take your patient pills before walking in, as the bar gets pretty crowded with downtown button-up types ready to wind down.  One strategy is to show up on the later side, like 6:30 (Happy Hour ends at 7), and stay past the post HH exodus.. . If you decide to eat a real meal here, the patio is nice at night.  The service has always been impeccable and pleasant and the food cooked to perfection with wonderful Latin flavors heating your mouth and tummy.
