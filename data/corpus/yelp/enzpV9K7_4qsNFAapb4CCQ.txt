I've converted into Soy Sauce Soup-ism in the past few months. . . So good~. . . I just noticed that I eat here every week. HOWEVER, the last time I went, which was about three days ago, the Jap man that usually calls out the names of people on the waiting list, you know, the one that hunches forward and has a sloped nose, freaked me out! . . "Jay mee! Taybel ub foh! Count-tuh, ok?". .  I said, "No, I want a table." . . He looked at me all freaking perplexed as if he were doing me a favor by giving me the countertop to sit in when clearly, I did not want to. I can tell that he drank himself to oblivion the night before because his hair was scrambled, his face was paler than usual, and his eyes were bloodshot RED. His eyes are pretty darn bulgy too! What's worse, he questioned back with a "NOOO?!!!" . . I was so shocked. So so shocked. I mean, I have a bad temper... If anybody raises their voice at me for any reason at all, I'll give them hell. But this time, in all this shock, I replied quietly, . . "Uh... table please?" . . "COUNT-TUH!" (All the while pointing at the damn counter as if I didn't understand.). . "No...". . "NOOO?!??" (In a WTF kind of tone.). . My balls shrunk. I played everything off by quietly asking my best friend if it would be okay if we sat on the countertop. She said it was fine. So, the rest of my friends and I sat on the countertop.. . Fucking ass. I would never go back if the ramen wasn't so damn good.. . But it's okay... I took it all out on the waitress. :)
