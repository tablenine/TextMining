Restaurant: Top Flr
Category: American (New)
So, here's the thing..... . Top Flr is chic but effortless, while the restaurant is bathed in mod wallpaper and sexy nooks and crannies, its not overdone, and is seamless. A contrast of sublime dark booths and open airy windows, a true treat for the eyes. . . I met a group of friends for preparty nosh, I had decided on the cheese plate before hand, and when I arrived it was waiting for me, 3 varieties of semi-hard cheese and accompaniments, not particularly stunning, but decant, and for 5 bucks, I had no complaints. . . The real winner had to of been the mac and cheese, a small portion of decedent and creamy mac and cheese, ribbons of spinach, a yummy melty gratin top, the things dreams are made of. . . Everyone's entrees looked fab, our server was helpful, none of my requests ever had to be repeated, and I stayed hydrated and happy the entire evening. . . Points for their own parking lot.. . Just a genuinely laidback atmosphere, totally chill vibe, good times I say, good times.
