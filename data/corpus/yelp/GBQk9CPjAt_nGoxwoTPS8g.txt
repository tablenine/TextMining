I went here for dinner and was able to use a Groupon for it (our server was actually excited when she saw the Groupon - this was fun).  . . We started with the mussels, which were tasty but not that remarkable. . . For my entrée, I had the grilled mahi-mahi sandwich with the house chips.  I also thought this was good although a bit messy.  My dining companion had the hanger steak with house fries.  He didn't love it.  He did eat all of it but said it was just OK.. . At the time I went, I remember thinking that there were not a lot of things on the menu that sounded good to me but, after looking at the menu again, I don't know what was wrong with me that day.  There are actually a lot of things that sound good to me, although maybe not good enough to make me rush back.  I would return but I think I really need to find the dish here that I love and would be excited about coming back to get.
