Made a special trip just for their double chocolate croissant pudding with Jack Daniels sauce as well as their coffee toffee ice cream sandwich. SO YUMMY!. . I had them pack the pudding to-go and, since the dessert comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, they put that in a carton for me, too. Mmm, I'll nuke the pudding later and drop the ice cream on top so it'll be all nice and melty.. . But at the store, I plopped myself on a not-too-comfortable metal chair and enjoyed the coffee toffee sandwich. Twas perfect. The best ice cream sandwich EVER, including homemade ones I used to make.. . The cookies sandwiching the ice cream weren't overly sweet and didn't overpower the coffee toffee ice cream. And they weren't too soft where they would fall apart but still so moist.. . The only thing is that there always seem to be intimidatingly long lines out front. So you have to ask yourself, "How much do I want it?"
