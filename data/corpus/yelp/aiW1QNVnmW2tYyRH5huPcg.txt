Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
mozza is really great. the food was amazing and the service was wonderful as well...except for the bar/bartenders. we had to wait for a few minutes before our table was ready (i can accept that), so we decided to get a drink at the bar. first of all, they dont have any brands of vodka or gin that i recognized for my martini. what's with that? and the bartender acted like i was not even worth his time, no hint of a smile or friendliness at all. luckily, that was all forgotten once we sat down and ate - between the delicious food (especially the pastas....i could have done without the entrees) and the attentive (but not annoying) service, all memory of the bar incident was soon forgotten. also, while the mozzarella was indeed amazing, i thought the tasting menu was a bit much - what do 2 of us need with 3 huge chunks of cheese? 1 or 2 would have been plenty.
