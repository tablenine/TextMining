Restaurant: Mexicali Cocina Cantina
Category: Mexican
People don't come here for the food, they come here to pick up on someone, which is almost always a guaranteed success. People say the drinks are good, particularly the margaritas, but again that's for the purpose I first mentioned. It's hard to call this Mexican food I'll call it something to munch on while you are trying to pick up on a hottie. Mexicali is a place to see and be seen and is more like a frat party gone bad, annoying men and all, than an actual restaurant. If I'm not getting the point across, check ot Chloe D's review. I'm just sayin. You may ask, why did you ever go there? Great question. My friend Tom was a waiter there and I was supporting him and getting free stuff. He's gone now and I haven't been back. We'll both keep it that way. I'm just sayin.
