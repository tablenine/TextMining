Restaurant: Sushi Go 55
Category: Sushi Bars
Dined here a few times during dinner hours, on a weekday, and it's fairly empty. Hence, there's no wait, no need for reservations, you'll get your food quicker, and plenty of attention from the staff!  =D. . Taste &amp; Freshness: 4.5 stars!. . The toro, wild salmon (darker/richer color), hotate sashimi, and uni sushi were very fresh and delicious!  They also have tairagai which is a lil' more expensive than the hotate.  Taste wise, I prefer the hotate over the tairagai for it's sweetness and tenderness.  The sweet shrimp was good but the freshness does not come close to the sweet shrimp served at The Hump, in Santa Monica.  . . Pros: Sushi chef was very nice and answered all of my questions, so I recommend sitting at the bar. ^_^  Friendly and attentive staff too. Above average quality and reasonable price for the freshness of the fish &amp; seafood. . . For 10% off dinner coupon go to: . http://www.japaneseres.... . .
