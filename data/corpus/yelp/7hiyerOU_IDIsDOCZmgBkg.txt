I was so apprehensive about trying this place. The reviews for this place seem to always go up and down. I remember the LA times review just being okay. That's what really did it for me awhile back. Even my roomate insisted I go, but I said no. I really like the classic burger, and someone trying to mess with that, was just making a mistake, I thought. But finally after some time, I wanted to try it. And I liked it. I ordered the FO Burger Medium rare, and I can say, it's definitely the way to go. My friend ordered hers medium well (I know. Who would do such a thing?), and it really doesn't do any good. I just have to say when you order it medium, the burger is juicy in a way that's different from other burgers I've had. The sweet carmalized onion thing on top, I didn't like so much. It was too sweet. And you know what I think  is missing in the burger? Ketchup. JK. Sweet. Salty. Bitter. Sour. Umami. You get a perfect balance of this, and you get something that taste great. And the burger has everything else going for it, except sour. Sweet, from the grilled onions. BItter from the arugala leaves. Salty, from the blue cheese. Umami: Burger. Sour:Ketchup. JK.  For beer, I ordered something citrusy and the bf, asked for something like Stella. He always get lucky this way. I always like the beers he orders more than mine.  I loved how the sweet potato fries were fat. I found the garlic dip addictive, even though i normally wish my sweet fries come with something sweet.. The place is tiny I might warn. I thought it would be big, considering it is in the Helm's building. Wonder if MoFo, Mobile FO, has started parading the streets yet. Anyone heard anything?
