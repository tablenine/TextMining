Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
45 minute wait was not worth it for this over-hyped hot dog. i didnt know there were so many ways to top a hotdog and overprice it. it was just aittttttteee but nothing special to me. wouldnt be back again, especially not with the wait.  may be its the inner city mentality i grew up with, call me old fashioned but when i'm craving a hot dog, i'm craving a dirty water NYC hot dog from a cart in manhattan with just the simple good ol' ketchup and mustard and sometimes Grey's papaya.  iono what it is about these average food places in LA that attract these long ass lines, but i'mma stop giving into the hype of these places cuz they not even all that
