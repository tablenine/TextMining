A decent, safe, Silverlaked-Vietnamese restaurant.  . . Meaning it's safe to bring your parent's here and they won't be seeing goat's testicle paté served with pickled ballsack on the menu.  . . Then your parent's can go back to their trailer park and tell everyone that they went to a Vietnamese restaurant and it was sooo good.  They will feel special right before the slip into a wine-in-a-box induced coma while watching the bug zapper on their porch.. . The place is cheap and consistent.  Everything is good.  Now that I've tried a lot of stuff over a few trips, it all seems like it kind of tastes the same, which is a semi-bummer... I said, bummer, not boner.  . . It seems like everything has that sweet, pickled, peanuty taste.  This is not a bad thing, but if you order a few things, try to mix it up.. . AFTER DINNER TIP: Go across the street to Cha Cha, drink ten beers and then watch the Chicken Pho come exploding out your nose.  Trust me, it's fun.
