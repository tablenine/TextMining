i was teetering between 3 and 4 stars but opted for 3 just cuz it didn't live up to the hype...or maybe cuz i missed out on the monkfish...but that wouldnt be their fault since i came here for lunch.... . ok ok so let's just say this review is just for lunch. i'll update a dinner review if i ever come back.. . ANYWAY...i think lunch really trails dinner in the menu variety. i kept reading about monkfish this and monkfish that. i really wanted to try the monkfish!! but it is not available on the lunch menu. sad times. another annoying thing is that the menu descriptions are a bit vague. for example, they group sandwiches and entrees together so it's hard to determine what is a sandwich and what is an entree. appetizers and salads are grouped together too. just confusing!. . moving along, i got the chicken royale + avocado (chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, gruyere cheese w/ avocado which was an add-on). my coworkers all got salads that seemed to be well...salads. no big. . . but there was ONE HIGHLIGHT: fresh mozzarella on roasted red peppers. think caprese without the tomatoes...but it was seriously the BEST mozzarella i've ever tasted. the BEST!!!!! super fresh and the peppers added a great smoky flavor to the bite. i think they also had some sort of sweet balsamic vinagrette sauce that was drizzled on. OMFG. to die for. please order that if you go here (for lunch).. . overall, service was attentive. the desserts were mehhh. my latte was exquisite though. haha. and the bread they give u is yummy.
