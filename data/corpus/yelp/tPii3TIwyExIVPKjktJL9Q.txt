My favorite pizza joint in Atlanta. If it was closer to us we'd go once a week. Its as close to NY as you can get south of the Mason Dixon Line. . . By far the best part of their pizza is the cheese. I don't know what they use but I can honestly say no other pizzeria I've tried in Atlanta comes close to the flavor in this whole milk mozz.
