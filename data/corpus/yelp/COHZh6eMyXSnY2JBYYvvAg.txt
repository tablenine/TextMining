OK, so I must do a follow-up review for Flip. We went here a couple of times shortly after it opened and it was good, but needed improvement. Those improvements have been made and I'm happy to say it's earned another star in my book!. . I got the Turkey burger with pomegranate ketchup and a beet and goat cheese salad on the side. I am thrilled to see Richard has added other options for sides. Â Of course there's the sweet potato tots, french fries, and vodka battered onion rings - BUT there's now tempura battered asparagus, fried okra, beet and goat cheese salad, and many other options for those that want to feel a little less guilty for eating those creative little tasty burgers.. . I apologize Richard for not giving you more time before I reviewed, but you have satisfied my desires and your milkshakes rock as well ;) I recommend the krispy kreme shake!
