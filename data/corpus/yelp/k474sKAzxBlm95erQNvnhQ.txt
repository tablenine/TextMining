pizza and beer automatically get two stars.  i heart any pizza and any beer. pizza with actual (literal) lumps of crap on it?  sure!  watered-down, pee-flavored beer?  eh, why not?  even the worst pizza and beer is still satisfying.  . . but thankfully, crust earns its extra stars for having neither crap pizza nor watered-down beer.  the beer list, while not ridiculously long, boasts some of my favorites - and while my school-girl glee was momentarily crushed when i learned they ran out of three floyds robert the bruce, my waitress (nancy?) recommended two brothers french country ale in its stead and all was well.. . suitably liquored - onward, to the food! started with some starters: balsamic marinated brussels sprouts with crispy bacon and tapanade.    both were yum.  the flat bread accompanying the tapanade was the perfect carb - wasn't too heavy but held up well to the sauteed peppers, onions, capers, olives, roasted garlic and goat cheese. and the brussels sprouts and bacon?  it's brussels sprouts and *bacon* - need i say more?. . from starters we transitioned to main: italian sausage pizza.  sausage and pesto and fennel, oh my!  the flavors complemented each other perfectly.  plus, the house-made italian sausage really wowed.  . . we didn't stick around for dessert because we're cheap and it started drizzling, but i bet i would've liked that, too.
