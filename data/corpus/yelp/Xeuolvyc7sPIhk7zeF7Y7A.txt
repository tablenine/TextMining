Restaurant: Shaun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
Shaun's has been a fave of mine for a couple of years now, but recent visits had left a little to be desired (usually because of service issues). Tonight's visit; however, definitely made up for any recent disappointments.. . We were dining with my husband's mom, who is on a very strict low-fat, low-sodium diet. So we basically asked for that, a grilled chicken dish but with appropriate sides that would fit within her restrictions. The kitchen was kind enough to accomodate, and my MIL, usually a very picky eater, remarked several times at how delicious her meal was. She completely cleaned her plate.. . Hubby and I followed suit; there wasn't a bite left of his schnitzel (his standard order, which he fortunately always shares with me, as it is amazing!) and my crab cakes. . . We unfortunately didn't save room for desert this time, but have enjoyed their various ice creams in the past.. . Extra points are deserved for their awesome patio. WAY too hot to eat outside tonight, but on nicer fall or spring evenings it makes for a really nice setting.. . Definitely one of Atlanta's finest restaurants; can't wait to go back!
