Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
I really like the vibe in this place. Great place to take your date, wife, girlfriend, lover, etc. Excellent choice before dinner after dinner or without dinner. May I suggest a champagne dinner. Ouch, you will feel that the next day.. . The appetizer menu is okay but the the champagne selection is awesome. The staff is really helpful directing you to great tasting selections and pointing out the best values. . . Great location and great place. Price/value all depends on what you choose to drink.
