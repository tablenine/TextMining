I had good meals here 3 or 4 years ago. However, the past 3 trips here have been very unimpressive. My first thought was that I was ordering the wrong things, but I simply think the kitchen isn't firing on all cylinders. The pastas, fish and meats all missed the mark. At least they didn't screw up the salad. It's always a bummer to throw a hundred dollars into a dinner and walk away unsatisfied.
