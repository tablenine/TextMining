Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
Roy's is a beautiful setting in the hip River North area.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Our reservation was honored immediately as we were ushered to a table for four on a frigid winter evening.  We shared salads and were happy to see that they were plated in the kitchen with ample portions per serving.  The three fish sampler is a beautiful display of ahi tuna, butterfish, and salmon.  Each has a tasty sauce and a bed of tender rice is provided with the salmon.  The mahi is served with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable.  Everything was hot and well prepared though the portions are small.   We passed on dessert but could see many diners enjoying the chocolate souffle which the server recommended-twice in fact.  The manager is personable and makes the rounds visiting with diners.  He even showed us where the Obamas sat.  Roy's is pricey but the food is top notch.  Must go back in the summer for an outdoor experience.
