Went here for lunch yesterday and had a pleasant experience.  Sat quickly, order taken quickly, order filled quickly.  A theme emerged, but I think some of that had to do with me being one of the first ones there for lunch.  Regardless, I'm not complaining.. . I had the grilled pork fresh spring rolls which were tasty and clean and had a crispy roll of fried something inside it, which was nice.  It seemed to be a tuile of the crispy spring roll wrapper.  Whatever it was, it was new to me and a nice addition.  The peanut sauce was lighter in color, flavor, and texture than I've had before, which was also welcome.. . I ordered the combination clay pot (squid, octopus, beef, pork, chicken, tofu, veg) thinking it would be like the 'clay pot rice' I've ordered in other Vietnamese places - with the rice cooked in the clay pot to a crisp with veg and meat on top.  Here everything except the rice was served in a hot clay pot and the steamed rice was served on the side.  Everything was good, but it was not nearly as good as the sort I've just described.. . That said, the seafood was really tasty, the beef and pork were very tender, and the tofu had a nice texture.  Also, everything was served super hot (temperature), a plus.  It seemed like more of a Chinese takeout meal though.  Not bad, just not what I was hoping for when I looked up 'clay pot' on here.  I'd go back.
