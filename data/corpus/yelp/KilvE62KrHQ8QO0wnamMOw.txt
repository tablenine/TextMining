Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
This is pretty much the happiest place in Atlanta.  Best spot for a beer in town, best prices, best selection, best ambiance, they've got it nailed. Example: $4.50 for a half liter of Spaten Maibock, a seasonal German brew...complete with matching glass!  The employees and clientele are generally laid-back and unpretentious (with a few exceptions).  Any true beer-lover should get acquainted with Brick Store.  I hear the food is also quite delicious, though I've not tried a meal there (pretzels were pretty tasty though). If I could I'd give it 10 stars.
