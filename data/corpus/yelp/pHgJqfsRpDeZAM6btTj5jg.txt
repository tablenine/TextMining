Where carnivores and vegetarians unite.. . I love a good salad.  But sometimes I'm in the mood for a nice cut of beef or some juicy chicken.  I still want my veggie goodness with fiber power.  I'm obsessed with fiber by the way.. . Tender greens has a great selection of meats and a yummy salad.  It's a little pricey but I'll pay it for some quality meat.  The vibe is very cafeteria style with oodles of outdoor seating.
