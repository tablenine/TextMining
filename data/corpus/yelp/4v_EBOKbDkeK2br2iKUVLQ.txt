Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Crazy good, crazy fattening, and I certainly am crazy to want to go back there. This is soul food time so don't try to order light, non fat this or that. Go there to eat! and if you die, you'd be soooooo happy! My husband just salivates when i say roscoes. Â The chicken and waffles is great!!
