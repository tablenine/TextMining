Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Rated as one of the top places to get your French Dip on, Philippe's is one of Los Angeles' oldest restaurant that was established back in 1908.  If you find yourself in downtown or around Union Station and got some time for a nice meal, be sure to stop by and order a French Dip with your choice of meat: beef, pork, ham, lamb or turkey.. . Or gather some friends and share to taste all the flavors! I am a fan of the beef and a lot of others were fans of the lamb.  Be sure to ask for it double-dipped if that's your thing.  Like another Yelper said, don't be intimidated by the lines.  Just pretend that you're in a food truck line but you actually get somewhere to sit! Complete your meal with sides like coleslaw, potato salad, and some dessert like custard and tapioca (because I'm a champ like that..ha).
