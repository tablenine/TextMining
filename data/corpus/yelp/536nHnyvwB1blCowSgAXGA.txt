Category: Burgers
Perfect place to meet up with friends - busy but not so loud you have to shout to be heard at your own table. Â No super fancy drinks, but quick service and full bar in a nice setting makes this a safe go to in the Murray Hill area.. . In the Summer: Head up to the Rare View the rooftop bar. No food here, so if you a jonesing for that delicious burger or french fry sampler, you'll have to take it downstairs. . . All other Seasons: For a drink and a snack, this is the perfect place! Getting a table in the bar area can be tricky during busy hours but during the week, I've never had to wait more than 15 mins for a spot to open up. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries in the sampler with the maple sauce - it is tasty! Is are the other waffle and rough cut fries and the 3 other sauces (curry, ketchup, and a spicy tomato).
