Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I still don't quite understand the big hub bub here.  Maybe other Bossa Novas are superior.  Maybe I ordered the wrong food.  Maybe they were having a "bad night".. . There was one occasion where I actually ate at the restaurant.  The place was quite crowded, but fortunately my friend and I didn't have to wait for a table.  He ordered the chicken with rice, which is the only thing he ever orders from this place.  I ordered Aurelio's favorite, which is mozzarella, basil, and tomato on italian bread.  I have to say the sandwich was light and delicious.  But I can't be impressed by this lil number, because it is a simple sandwich.  It's kinda hard to screw up a cheese sandwich.  Bread, cheese, bread, voila!. . Second occasion, I ordered pizza delivery.  I chose the spinach cream pizza.  The crust was drowning in the cream sauce.  I didn't know if I was chewing or slurping the damn thing.  I tried to keep the leftovers, but the next morning I just stared .... enamored with the fact that the unappetizing mush was once a poor attempt at a pizza.  Needless to say, this gem was not worth repeating.. . So if for some reason, I can't think of any other place to go... I guess I would return to Bossa Nova in high hopes that I would catch them on a good night and order a good dish.  Maybe there's a reason why my friend only orders chicken with rice.
