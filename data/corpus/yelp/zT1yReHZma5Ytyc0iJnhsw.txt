Truthfully I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, despite the fact that I grew up eating 3 or 4 times a week.  When I go to a Mexican resteraunt that specialiazing in charging $10 for a taco, I expect it to be inauthentic, and underseasoned.  So my expectations for Adobo were very low.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The guacamole here is by far the best I've ever had.  The margaritas were also tasty.  The entrees were nothing special.  I would go back here because I liked the ambiance and the guacamole.  The main courses leave a bit to be desired.
