After rave reviews from my family members who decided to dine at this place without me, I went with some friends on a Tuesday night.  My cousins kept telling me how busy this place was, but when I went, the 10 of us were seated right away.. . As soon as I entered this restaurant, my jaw dropped.  It is gorgeous!! High ceilings, check.  desserts/pastries stacked beautifully for all to drool over, check.  cute little market, check.  open kitchen, check.  friendly staff, check. hottie in a suit, check.  and the list goes on.... . What we ordered:. - portobello fries - YUM. - modena salad - it was good, but not great. - burrata with grape tomatoes - YUMMMMY....but i LOVE tomatoes. - roasted beets with goat cheese - YUM. - calamari - nothing out of the ordinary. - beef carpaccio - OK. - fettuccine belmondo - was a little on the salty side.  . - mussels &amp; clams - it is what it is. - french fries - YUM. - asparaugus with fried egg - tasted like an asparagus w/ a fried egg. - chicken carcioffi - chicken was tender. . I visited this place again 2 more times shortly after.  I'm a nut:. - penne gamber - YUMMMMMM. - ravioli - YUMM. - trenne - eh, didn't care too much for this one. the pasta tasted like french fries.. - pasta fagiole - my bf and sister Loved this soup.  Its just beans!!. . Now for the sweet and simple:. . Pros:. - delicious. - great decor. - cute manager guy walks around in a suit.  talk about eye-candy.. - servers were friendly and efficient.  my water glass was never empty. . Cons:. - none so far. . Tip:. - they have valet, but there's a parking lot across the street for a flat fee of $3.  street parking is also available, but sometimes hard to find.. - I think it would be a nice place to have a bday party.  Its spacious and the food is good.  For our party of 10, I paid $33, but we also got a bottle of wine)
