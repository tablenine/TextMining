I went a couple of months ago...end of August. We had a great table outside, on the 2nd level balcony...the atmosphere, was great! 4-5 stars, the service was good too about a 4, the food I was not that impressed with...low 3 (I was torn between a 3-4 rating). I will go back here, to give it another try probably because I loved the atmosphere so much, even inside looked like a great dining experience. I was a little turned off when I passed a "Le Colonial" in New York, that by the way looked identical from the outside...(I did realize it was a 'franchise' of some sort, prior to my dining) it just takes away a little of the special. I'll give it another try, sometime soon.
