Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The best burger I've ever had.  Need I say more about this place?. . Absolutely yum.  I've heard many times from my coworkers about how great this place is and their "no ketchup, no modifications" policy to their burgers.  Father's Office has truly amazed me with their quality of food and service.  But let's start with the restaurant itself.. . This new location is brighter, bigger and more swank than its original location in Santa Monica.  It's oddly, yet appropriately, situated in the furniture district.  The warm hues of the wood interior decor provides a comfortable and inviting atmosphere to enjoy the food and drinks with friends.  It's a bar first and foremost, with at least a dozen beers on tap.    If that doesn't get you in here, the burgers will.  Oh and it's 21+.  Sorry kiddos.  This is an adult's burger joint.. . I ordered the original "Office" burger ($12) and oh man was it good.  At first glance, it doesn't look like any ordinary burger as it's presented more like a sandwich.  The beef was so tender and juicy, it stands apart from anything I've eaten.  F.O. doesn't allow any changes, modifications, deletions nor additions to their burgers.  Ever.  Their rules...let's let them keep it simple that way.  Ketchup?  Don't even bother.  . . Fortunately, you won't have to as the burgers have so much flavor with each bite, you'll realize why they've made it to perfection.  Melted cheese, caramelized onions and special sauce bring out the sweet sweet flavor to match the juicy beef.  Add some greens and sandwich it inbetween a buttery bun and you've got burger bliss.  Top it off with the excellent sweet potato fries and call it a perfect meal.. . The prices may be a bit steep but for the quality and taste of the food and beer, it's totally worth it.  I know I'm coming back for more.
