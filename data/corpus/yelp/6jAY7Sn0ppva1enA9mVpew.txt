Restaurant: Co&#39;m Vietnamese Grill
Category: Vietnamese
Good Solid Vietnamese food in a cute clean setting. I had the broken rice with beef it's called the com special plate, and it was pretty good, with great prices as well.  This com special plate is made up of grilled meat( you can choose from pork, beef or chicken ) it comes with this steamed egg, and a fried egg, veggies, and fish sauce.. it's definitely yummy.. and very filling.. what is nice is the place has quick solid food, and they give alot.. I was too full, I could not even finish the plate.  This place can accommodate large parties, and for a Vietnamese place, it can be date friendly- alot of Vietnamese restaurants are low key, so I would never ever say it is date friendly, but this one is.. the decor is classy and nice, and the waiter can speak English, wowsers.. Definitely a place to take Vietnamese food newbies since it's not seedy and the waiters are nice.
