Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
Cozy wine bar in Bucktown, perfect for a date on a cold Winter's night. Low lighting, lots of brick, wood, and soft leather menus. All of the wines I've sampled at Bluebird have been outstanding, but kinda pricey. Judging from the awesome dessert I had (decadent chocolate mousse cake) I'm sure the other food is exceptional. If wine isn't your style, they also have a first-rate beer menu. I tried the Uerige "Doppelsticke" and was blown away. It comes in a fancy little bottle, but don't worry about the size, this brew is a potent 8.5% alc.
