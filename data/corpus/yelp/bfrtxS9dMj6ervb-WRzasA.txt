Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
$60 parking ticket aside, Geisha House is not a bad place for sushi and food...and maybe for some celebrity/socialite spottage.. . Overpriced though...say...$18 a roll overpriced!  Like other Yelpers have mentioned, I can probably get the same quality sushi for half the price elsewhere.  I guess since they're on Hollywood blvd, they gotta make ends meet for their high lease.  Like I said, the sushi isn't too bad...it's good but overpriced.. . For a party of 6, we had a hard time hearing each other in the loud and dark restaurant.  The service was okay.  Oh and not like it matters, but their hostess looks like Jade from the Hills, but prettier.. . Did I mention that I got a $60 parking ticket?  Be careful with those metered parkings...I almost got my car towed because there were so many restrictions on parking.  It might be even worth it to just pay for parking.
