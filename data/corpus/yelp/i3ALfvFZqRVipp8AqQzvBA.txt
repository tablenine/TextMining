Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Great authentic Thai food with good portions and at a great price! . . If you love spicy, you'll love the food here. I highly recommend the BBQ beef, Pad Thai, Spicy "anything" soup, chilli with holy basil, and the Panang.. . Dunno exactly which nights but they have a Thai Elvis impersonator who's pretty entertaining along with other singers/performers. . . Great place to go with a group of friends. They have kinda like cafeteria style seating where you literally can be sitting an arm's reach away to a whole other party unless you get lucky and get one of the tables by the window or on the bar's side. Â It gets pretty rowdy and busy on the weekends but wait time isn't usually more than 20mins.
