I enjoyed my visit to this place.  It's a great find for burgers, shakes, ice cream, and desserts.  They have these killer butterscotch oatmeal cookies that you must try and they have a unique cake--the blue velvet cake.  Moist and a new personal favorite.  I ordered the citrus float and loved the blood orange sorbet and lime sorbet.  You can see the zest in the sorbet, which I love.  Their milkie way shake tasted just like the candy bar.  It's another great find.. . Overall, great dessert, good prices, and the fact that it's inexpensive and no long lines makes it a nice find.  . . PS: They have pints to go, too, so you can grab and go.  Give it a try!
