We came here recently because I had a craving for udon.  We were greeted with  a very friendly staff and seated immediately.  The booth seats were dated and worn out so that there was a hole in the middle, but that was okay...I just moved away from that spot and I was fine.  I tried the chicken udon, tempura, and tonkatsu.  Before the food arrived, we had sunomono, which was fresh but not as vinegary sweet as I preferred it to be. There was plenty of chicken in my soup, which made me happy. The broth was wonderful and I loved the udon noodles.  I couldn't finish it because it was bigger than I thought it would be.  Minus one star for the tempura.  It was not the best I've had, but it was fine for dipping in my soup.  The tonkatsu was delicious, I loved it.  My husband ordered the pork udon and we found the pork to be absolutely delicious.  Great environment in Little Tokyo, nice staff, and yummy udon...we will definitely go back.
