I HATE MANNAS SALAD. . Truly. Why? It has a funky sour taste. Some people love it ... and some people don't. I don't know but eating large quantities of meat without salad is difficult. Oh, but you can get the salad dry but I don't like asking for it because.... I don't. I'm a weeny!. . That being said I have had better side dishes and more side dishes for the same price at other KBBQ places.. . You sit, they give dishes, water, and meat, and you cook. . . To get their attention push a button on your table. Hopefully they come. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. . . I steal water pitchers from other tables and sometimes chopsticks.. . Very smokey atmosphere and some people smoke cigarettes. Something I totally love with my barbequed meats.. . For birthdays this is a fun location. Read other posts for information on that. If you go for a birthday prepare to get a bit wet. :( . . For some reason this place is the most popular KBBQ place. . . To each his own.
