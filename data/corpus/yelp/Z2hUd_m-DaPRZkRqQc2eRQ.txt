Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
TGI Friday's meets Davey Jones's locker. I can be quite cynical at times but I think when I came to El Barco tonight I knew what I was expecting and embraced oversized book-of-time menus and all the crazy crap on the walls. If it was an actual chain though, I'd probably want to barf. . . Our waitress was sweet. I'm glad I split the "regular" sized Snapper w/ a friend and we still had a ton of leftovers. I took a little pleasure in being able to show off my filet skills from when I was a server in a fancier restaurant. You know a fish is cooked right when it easily comes off the bone - which this one did. Overall, broiled fish and veggies, that's pretty healthy and ok w/ me. Good price for the quality and amount of food.. . Definetely a place I'd only want to go for a fun night w/ a group of friends. If I went on a date here I'd probably get embarrassed and dunk my head in my goblet of sangria to hide.
