dumpling dumplings. what a good day. my stomach is grumbling. thus i'll be looking forward in eating you in may:). . dude serously, i dont' know why i like this place so much, but I DO!. The xiao long baos, yumyum SOo juicy. I seriously have not had xiao long baos in like 4 years, and my first time eating xiao long baos in four years was here. I love the xiao long baos here and the ginger sauce that they provide for you to use. OMg, they also have RED BEAN dumpling, and or course being the experimental eater I am, I had to try it. It was pretty good except for the fact that i remembered i don't like red bean. :x lol. but still, i think it's the skin that they used that made the xiao long baos so good and yummmmmy.. . What sucks about this place is parking and the wait time! We waited for 45 to an hour and we only ate for 30 minutes. How sad, but it was worth it!:) now they need one in norcal:!
