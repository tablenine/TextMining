Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
hadn't been in years and i wondered why.. . i can never decide what i want and the menu's organization is somewhat disturbing.  but once you zero in on whatever combination you like best, it's all good.  i finally settled on Carole C's Special: 1 breast and a waffle, onto which i tacked an order of greens and a coffee.  wow, why did i wait so long to come back??. . the greens were slightly bitter and so flavorful.  the coffee was great, which i didn't expect; strong but not burnt, just shy of perfect.  i had it all.  the sweet syrup over a rich, buttered waffle mingled with the spicy rooster sauce and crunchy, fried chicken that was juicy inside.. . i can't wait to get back and get some chicken livers, maybe some mac &amp; cheese, some thick country gravy and a big fluffy biscuit with butter and honey... guess i need to eat again.  life is good.. . btw, the service here is just fine.  our server was prompt and pleasant.  anyone that says otherwise: go tap your foot somewhere else.
