Went for dinner on a Friday night and man was it busy!  The line was super long (hour wait at least) and parking...good luck with that.  The sausages were a little pricey for the quality. For example, the Alligator one had a really rough bite to it - almost like a dried out jerky stick. The original braughtworst was actually pretty decent, but nothing that I couldn't make at home.  I am a big bread person and as I dreamed about the sausages I would be devouring later in the evening I imagined a scrumptious french roll of sorts encasing my sausage - sadly it was just a slightly bigger hot dog bun.  The ordering is really rushed so make sure you know what you want because you do NOT want to get back in that line if you forget something and you can't order from your table.  There is a large beer selection and they serve it up in the appropriate glasses which is pretty cool. . . I was hoping for mouth watering deliciousness, beer maids, and some "roll out the barrel"...sadly this is more of a trendy spot than anything else.
