Go anywhere but here, if you need post-bar food in WP/Bucktown. This place is just disgusting, and the clientele I usually see frequent here makes me wanna puke. Not to mention, it's also disgusting to the point where I don't even wanna admit I've been here in the past.. . Too bad this place is just like the diner Clarke's(on Belmont) is, in a too-convenient + centralized location that'll make it tough for some to successfully talk others in a drunken state outta going here. I still feel bad to this day that I didn't speak up(but more shook my head in shock, than anything else), when I once overheard a cop suggest to a regular guy who asked him for a nearby place to eat, to go to Flash Tacos. *sigh*
