Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I came here the other night with some girlfriends when we were cruising LA. I was starving and remembered hearing about Geisha House before, so we popped in. The decor is really nice and interesting- low lighting, bright red fireplaces, and posh pictures plastered on the wall.. . I understand it's more of a lounge than anything else, but if you are touting you have a master chef and have super-high prices, I expect something delicious. Only two of us in the group ate, so we both ordered a miso soup. I ordered the Ocean Dragon roll, she ordered the Over the Rainbow roll.. . The food came out lightning fast. We weren't even halfway through our soup when our food came, so kudos to that. The soup was okay, but I'm not going to nitpick on soup.. . The ocean roll consists of shrimp tempura and crab, topped with fresh water eel, avocado, gold tobiko, and eel sauce. Good texture, but the sauce was way too salty. Eel sauce should have a nice balance of sweet and salty, but this was like eating pure salt. . . The over the rainbow roll has crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with salmon, yellowtail, tuna, albacore, and shrimp. The fish was fresh, the rice was a little soft but the overall roll was good. Not amazing, but standard.. . The rolls are priced 15 dollars and up so expect to pay more than your local sushi joint. . . Ambiance= 4 stars. Food= 3 stars. . I could get better sushi at my local spot, but the atmosphere here is really nice. Didn't have drinks, so I can't speak for those. I'd come here again...but not for the food.
