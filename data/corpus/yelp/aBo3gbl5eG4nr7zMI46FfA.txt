27 reviews... add me and that makes it 28. ive only eaten here once and the food was decent -- that uber SPECIAL dumpling in a soup that you have to order before 11am or else its all sold out. i tried it and to be honest ive forgotten how it tasted -- thats how memorable it was. the steamed buns themselves were perfect... moist buns. good filling, juice flowing out when you take a bite so you know its fresh. good quality stuff for sure.
