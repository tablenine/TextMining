Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I think their burgers are a little overpriced but honestly, I can't get enough of their hickory burgers.  They are hands-down the best burger I can eat in a few bites (I take really big bites...).  Yes it's a bit expensive and yes...you can get "better" burgers elsewhere.  However, at apple pan, the burgers are pretty simple....and just great tasting.. I understand the complaints about the steak burger.  When I first got it, I thought the abundance of lettuce completely masked any flavors from the rest of the burger.  However, I actually like it now and eating the abundance of lettuce makes me feel less guilty about indulging in burgers.  Plus, the lettuce makes me feel less gross since it mitigates any greasiness in the burger.. . I've had their apple pie once (w/out ice cream) to go and I gotta say that it wasn't very impressive.  It was kinda weird actually.  There wasn't much flavor and the crust (which is a must for me) was pretty dull and non-crispy (soft crust).  However, I'll try it again while at Apple Pan to see if it's any different.. . Nonetheless, as others have mentioned, Apple Pan is often packed.  It IS a bit overpriced.  However, when I just want a relatively simple burger...done quickly and done well, I go there.  And I don't really leave Apple Pan feeling gross (which I do when I try to get burgers at other restaurants...because of all the things they put in...too much sometimes).  And when I DO wanna feel gross, I just get a steak and hickory burger and scarf them both down at once.  It's worth it.
