Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
Everytime I've been to this restaurant, I have left happy, knowing that I'd be back because it is consistently delicious.  I've had to wait for anywhere between 30 minutes to 1 3/4 hours to be seated, but I didn't think it was a big deal because there was beer and my friends and the atmosphere lends itself to hanging out and just having a good time.   I think the pizza pot pie is fantastic--I get it every time I come here and have never been disappointed.    . . The only minor complaint I have is the cash-only policy but that's because I'm irresponsible with cash.
