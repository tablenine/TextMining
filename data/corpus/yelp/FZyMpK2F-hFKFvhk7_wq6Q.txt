Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The wait is excrutiating.  And it isn't like they are working as hard as they can.  It seems to me the cooks are just taking their time.  . . And the food isn't that good.  The chili is like Tommy's and the dogs aren't specially made, at least they don't taste that way.  . . I'll wait for excellent food.   I won't wait for something I could do better myself.. . Heck!  The chili at Weinersnitchzel is better than this.  . . I also detest places that draw more tourists than locals.
