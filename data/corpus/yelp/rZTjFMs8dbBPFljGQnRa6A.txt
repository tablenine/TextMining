Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
So, I went to Roscoe's for the second time yesterday...and took a disbelieving first-timer (my doubting sister) with me. "Chicken and WAFFLES? Ewww.....at 10:30 am?" You're damn straight, at 10:30 am. I got the Carole's C special (1 chicken breast, 1 waffle)....how sinful. So did my sister. I made a believer out of her....the chicken was perfectly crispy and moist and tender but not at all greasy--I don't understand how people can eat KFC. And once you've spread the butter and syrup all over the waffle and then cut into the chicken--DAMN! Somehow all the sweetness and saltiness come together for one totally sinful mouthful. We got the cornbread (nice and warm with butter on the side) and biscuits and gravy (good, but nothing knock-your-socks-off) on the side. Everything was wonderful....and they make a damn fine cup of coffee. Enjoy. Your arteries will curse you but you won't notice as your taste buds come alive.
