Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
I tend to yelp on a relative basis. How good is this place and what's the next best, and convenient, alternative? I grew up in Houston, which, surprise surprise So-Californians, is the Vietnamese food capital of the US. Would this restaurant stand up against any of the dozen Vietnamese restaurants back home that I love? Not a chance. Still, within a 30 minute-radius of my home in LA, how does Pho Cafe stack up? Let's see.... . -Tasty beef in both the beef vermicelli plate and pho, which is more than I can say for the KTown Pho places. . . -Not huge portions but good enough to make you feel like you actually ate something (vs. Viet Noodle Bar in Los Feliz, the OTHER hip, cash-only, sign-less Vietnamese restaurant) . . -Expensive compared to restaurants in OC Viet-areas but within my radius, it's on par with KTown restaurants and cheaper than Gingergrass (never eaten there) and Viet Noodle Bar. Yes, the cash-only policy is a pain (if you can''t carry 10 bucks with you).. . So in summary, good quality Vietnamese food, fast service, inexpensive, serves Asian beer &amp; sake, and located in a cool part of town. Now, if they can make a Banh Mi Thit Nuong for under $4.00, you would see me here quite often.
