After all the crazy hype and amazing reviews I read about this place, I think I expected toooo much. Tastewise, it's good but not AMAAAAZING hence the 4 stars! But they definitely have a very unique and exotic flair. . . I came here with about 30 other people and we had a little room reserved in the back with 3 tables. Dark, minimalist, cool ambience. . . They have a very wide selection of German and Belgian beer as well as unique non-alcoholic bottled beverages. I had a German beer called the Reissdorf Kolsch. It was light and crisp, just the way I like it. . . My friend and I shared 3 sausages and we put caramelized onions and sweet peppers as our choice of 2 toppings on all of them:. . 1. Mango Jalapeno - unique and yummy! . 2. Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers - the best one!! I loved the flavors! Very exotic and juicy, and a little spicy too. Popular choice for sure. . 3. Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers - I was really disappointed by this one. I thought it'd taste really crazyfunkyweird but it tasted like... chicken. Pretty plain... nothing too memorable about it really.. . The sausages were about $7-8 each so it's a little pricier than average. Portions are also pretty small (for a guy especially) so it may not be completely worth the money if you're not a big sausage fan but hey, the different sausages are so exotic and unique! Where else are you going to find a sausage like that in LA? Come here for an experience, but not if you want to just get full for cheap.
