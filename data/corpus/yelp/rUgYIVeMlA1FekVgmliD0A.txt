Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tacos are simple, and this place makes one of the better simple tacos in all of LA.  If you go here expecting the best Mexican food of your lifetime you will be disappointed, but if you are looking for a great quick and easy taco this is the place.  Both the lines and the ordering proces are daunting the first time you go, but it never takes as long as it first looks and is always worth the effort.
