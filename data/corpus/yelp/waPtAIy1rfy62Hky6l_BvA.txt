Like others, I really wanted to love the fare here. While there's no denying the great flavors that burst forth from my Truffle burger, there was also no denying the greasy oiliness, too. Drip, drip, drip -- all over my fingers and plate. . . While tasty, every bite was so grease-laden, something that didn't sit well with my stomach after the meal at all, ugh. Was the bun sprayed down with oil, too? Â I felt the kind of gross you can only feel if one chugged a quart of Mazola. It might have helped to offer some greens/lettuce and tomato to help cut the richness of the burger but it was just slick meat and slick bun.. . I can understand and appreciate the concept of elevating this lowkey American staple into a fancier version of itself with some unique flavor twists, but at $9-$11 a burger and $3 for a side of fries and just one free condiment -- it's a bit insulting when you have to pay $2 to park too. Like, really? I don't mind paying for great food, but this time, didn't feel the meal justified the near $40 tab.. . Glad I got to try it -- again, enjoyed the flavors (the guy liked his Hatch burger with the four kinds of chilies, though it didn't pack much heat at all) ... and the onion rings were OK, as were the very scant but pretty steak fries. But factor in all the grease &amp; the tab and we probably won't be back.
