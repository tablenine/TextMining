As for the food, AMAZING.  I'd highly recommend the flat-iron steak.  I also tried various rolls that my friends got, but my steak took the cake.  I made a reservation for 8 for my birthday and when we arrived, the table was ready, but one person wasn't there yet and in order to be seated, we all had to promise to order food equivalent to having the whole party there...I tried to explain that they'd be there soon, but whatever. . . We were seated right by one of the fireplaces and let me tell you, the interior decor is gorgeous.  And since it was my birthday, I ordered several drinks.  All tasted delicious, but could have been stronger.  . . Had the chocolate cake thingy for dessert and loved it...could have easily eaten 3! . . Overall it was worth it for the ambiance and that damn good steak.  Could have gone without paying $8/bottle of water though...they should really make that little tidbit known.
