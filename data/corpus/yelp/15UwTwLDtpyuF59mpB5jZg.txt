Good deep dish pizza, but after I finished, I felt like I had just eaten a rock. . . Be prepared for a long wait and a super heavy meal. Don't exercise or try to fool around with your significant other afterward - it's just not happening. . . I liked the spinach broccoli over the pepperoni. The vegetable-cheese-sauce ratio just seemed more on target. The pepperoni's were few and seemed not to fit the "deep dish"-ness well.. . I thought the individual portion would be too small for 1 person - but wrong! It's too big. I couldn't finish more than half of it. My mistake was ordering cheesy garlic bread in addition to the pizza. I felt extremely guilty wasting it, but frankly, it just wasn't going to be eaten.. . I'd definitely venture to try alternative deep-dish pizzerias before returning to this one again.
