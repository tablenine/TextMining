You've gotta love the mojitos here.. The food is good too. :). . Seriously, I've been here a bunch and I've had a great time every time.  The service has been good and the food is delicious.  The chicken just falls off the bone and it's just so darn irresistable.  And did I mention the yummy mojitos?. . It gets really crowded on weekends (and sometimes during the week too), so go early, especially if you're with more than 2 people.  I don't think they take reservations unless you're with a large party (6 or more, maybe?) -- don't quote me on that, but I think so....
