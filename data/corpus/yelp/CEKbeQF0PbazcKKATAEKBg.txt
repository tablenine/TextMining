So it's 7:00am, I dont have to clock into work until 8:30, what the hell do I do??? Ding ding ding, Philippe's 9 cent coffee!!! So you see that guy over there in the corner with a cup of coffee, a bowl of oatmeal, and his eyes lost in the daily issue of The LA Times, yup thats me!!! Everything here is pretty good, the dips, the chili, the beef stew, oh and be careful for that spicy mustard, that mutha sucka packs heat yo!!! Yea and I dont know why but this joint always reminds me of that one place in Roger Rabbit where Eddie is hiding Roger because the bad dude wants to put him in dip and every time the train passes it shakes the whole place, but no trains here, just the toy ones in the back!!!
