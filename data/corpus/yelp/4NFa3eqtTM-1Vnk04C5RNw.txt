Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
So on my third visit to Louie I came with friends for a late night dinner.  . . Mind you it was Friday, but I have never been in such a loud, packed restaurant.  The wait was too long so we had our pizzas at the bar/cafe.  Drinks were good, pizza was gooooood, service was great.  I still couldn't hear anyone, though.  Our waiter (Frank?) was great and removed items from the bill that weren't satisfactory.  This included the clam pizza that my friends ordered without realizing clams were the main topping.  ... really?   . . I continue to love the Pizza Bianca and the Moscow Mule.  Louie on!
