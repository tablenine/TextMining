Went there in Nov 2009.   Contemporary business casual atomosphere.   Steak is great although I get much much much better steak meat in Japan if "Marbled" is the requirement.  Side dishes and all other stuff are too salty for me to the point I could not taste the taste of the ingredient itself.   Good for Hollywood celeb siting.
