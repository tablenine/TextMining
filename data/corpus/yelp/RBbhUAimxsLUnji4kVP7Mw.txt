Cute little spot in a cute little area! Found a table easily but, the place definately got packed as the night went on. Interesting mix of families and after work crowd. Food came out fast, really fast..almost the scary way. But, it was good and the portions were nicely sized as well. The Guac is a must try with huge chunks of fresh avacado! I tried the BBQ taco and the special of the night - Philly taco. The bbq was good and the Philly was alright. But, I give this place a thumbs up based on tasty margarittas EXCELLENT service and atmosphere.
