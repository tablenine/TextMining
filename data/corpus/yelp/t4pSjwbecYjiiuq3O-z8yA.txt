Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Apple Pan, without a doubt, serves one of the best hamburgers in SoCal. Possibly California. . . However, if you are expecting a casual, slow, sit-down experience, this is not your place. It's usually quite crowded, and there is always a short wait to sit down. . . Apple Pan first opened it's doors way back in 1947, and operating continuously ever since. The menu choices are simple. So simple, you should only need 30 seconds or less to decide what you want once you're seated at the counter. The time you spent waiting to sit down will suddenly compensated by fast service that will leave first-timers spinning. Let me quote briefly from the book 'LA Bizzaro' (if you don't have a copy, get one pronto): . . "..A no-nonsense waiter slams a menu and a blank ticket down on the counter in front of you, and glares blankly in anticipation of your order crumbling under the pressure to make a snap decision, a quick Â look at the menu (a quick look is all you need anyway) prompts an exchange between waiter and customer- The apple Pan rite of passage- which usually goes something like this: . . "WHAWOULDYLIKE?" . "Um...I think I'll have a Hickory Burg..." . "CHEESE?" . "No thank..." . "FRIES?" . "Yes Plea..." . "COKE?" . "Ye..." . BAM!- the paper cup filled with ice and coke hits the formica. . BAM! an order of perfect fries " . "KETCHUP?" . "Yes, plea..." . BAM! a small brown paper place filled with ketchup. Seconds later, a perfect burger wrapped in wax paper.." . . The goal of Apple Pan is to get you in, feed you, and get you out. Nothing else. And if you linger long after your meal, you'll be told to order something else, or vacate your seat for another paying customer. . . This is the Apple Pane dining experience. It may sound rough, rude and rushed. But the burgers are so good, that it doesn't matter.
