Let's just say it's always crowded but for a good reason... the sushi is great.  . . Good-sized portions, very fresh, excellent quality, and not too expensive.  I tried the Seared Ono and it was fantastic.  Sushi and Sashimi is best at a place like this, but if you have to get a Cut Roll then I would suggest the Scallop or Spicy Scallop rolls-- very fresh.
