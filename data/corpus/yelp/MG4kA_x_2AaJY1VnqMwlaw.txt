Restaurant: Gato Bizco Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The BF and I are on a mission to try new restaurants in town instead of sticking to the old standards.  So, of course, I turned to our trusty Yelpers to find a new place for Brunch this morning.. . Intrigued by the name, and the fact that I must have seen the sign a million times and never realized that it was a restaurant, I arbitrarily decided that Gato Bizco would be our first endeavor.   The BF didn't even ask where were going until we were almost there.  Ah, adventurous Foodie spirit!. . We had to wait about 15 minutes, but it was fun standing outside staring down the line waiting at Flying Biscuit.  . . We were seated at the counter.  Bonus!  I was pretty set on ordering my standard biscuit, soysage, and side of potatoes, but while waiting to order, I saw two breakfast sandwiches come out for a couple of diners at the counter and knew that's what I had to have.  It's like an omelet with your choice of meat inside.  I had them add mushrooms and biscuit as my choice of bread.  What a wonderful decision!  The thing was the size of my head and so good I ate the whole thing.. . I really liked the feel of the place.  Very low key, wait staff was attentive but not in your face, fun catty decor, good coffee.  It was also like having breakfast theatre watching the cook serve up the plates.. . Trying new things turned out well.  I might just do it again.
