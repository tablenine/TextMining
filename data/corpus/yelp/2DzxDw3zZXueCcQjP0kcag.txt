I will start off by saying that the service here was pretty good. Our guy was on top of things and very polite. The place was pretty busy...Friday night during Restaurant Week hey why not.. . We had a reservation, but waited about a half an hour for our table. Annoying? Yes. Were we cool about it? You betcha.. . The prices here are very high the quality of fish we got. Not worth it. The oysters we ordered for an appetizer were good...but they're oysters so not much preparation needs to happen there.. . We did the prix fixe menu since again, the prices here were eye-widening. The lobster bisque was really, really good. I don't like bisque, but the salad options did not appeal to me so I went with it. It was great, almost licked the bowl clean.. . I got the mixed grill...which is almost $40 on the regular menu.. . With it came:. . One small scallop. . Two small shrimp. . One small crab cake. . One small (and pretty dry) salmon filet over whipped potatoes (very good).. . Two mysterious sauces. . Needless to say I was underwhelmed with what I got. Â I would rather a small selection of fish if it meant a bigger size for any of them. The scallop was about the size of a nickel...eh...maybe a quarter. Fish didn't seem to fresh to me for some reason and it was just overall lacking.. . I tried my friend's OPAH as well...which was pretty good. It was breaded with a macademia's and came with asparagus...not bad at all.. . The bar scene upstairs might be the way to go...the appetizers looked pretty good and the drinks weren't bad.... . Just eh for me.
