Yum! So good to have another great restaurant in the neighborhood. The prime rib bowl is sooooo good, and the pork rice bowl isn't bad either. Food is served in paper bowls and the place is small, so get there early or get takeout. Turnover is very quick though, so even if there are a lot of people, the wait wouldn't be long. Prices are low and the menu is simple but delicious.
