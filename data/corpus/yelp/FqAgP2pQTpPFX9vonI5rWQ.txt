Don't let anyone ever tell you I don't know my wontons, because I do, and there are some seriously tasty spicy wontons at Sinbala. It is worth the trip all the way out east just for the spicy wontons alone. . . Let's take a closer look at the spicy wonton, class. In Mandarin it's called "hong yo tsao sho," roughly translated to mean "oh my god my mouth is burning!" It's pork seasoned and wrapped in a thin skin that should be al dente rather than soggy, and then drenched in red chili oil and chili flakes, topped with some peanut sauce. all for about $4! . . hello, heartburn! SO worth it!
