Ditto to all the homies who praised this place.  I had the pastrami #1-comes with coleslaw and russian dressing. Sandwich was kinda messy with the coleslaw stuffed into the sandwich, but you bite into that sucka and it just melts in your mouth. next time i prob get the pastrami w/o the slaw. if you short on time, phone in your order, drive up and they bring it out you. what more can you ask for.... I had cantor's and jerry's deli. the pastrami here is in a  different league.
