I'm no expert on what's authentic or not, but this is an awesome place for soup.   There's nothing better than to go here on a cold or rainy day.  . . Ramen is their staple dish here.  And they give you a lot of options.  You have your choice of over a dozen toppings and you can customize the strength of your soup base, the amount of oil in your dish, and how well-done your noodles are.   I usually choose "heavy" soup base, "medium" oil, and "normal" noodles.  I don't usually get extra toppings, but i think that bamboo is a good addition.  If you finish your noodles and you want more, you can get a second serving for only $0.95.. . For the cynical among you, you may be wondering why it's worth driving this way for Ramen.  Afterall, Ramen is what you may have survived on in undergrad, right?  Well...that's where you'd be wrong.  Although the noodles are good, what is awesome is the flavorful pork broth.  This is definitely not your cup o' noodles.  I'd actually recommend shying away from going overboard with "spicy miso" and all of the toppings - it all overshadows the depth of the broth.  . . Other than the ramen....their appetizers are actually pretty good, but they give small portions.  I really enjoy their gyoza (dumplings) and I usually eat a half order.  If you come here for lunch, they have inexpensive lunch specials in which you can get an appetizer along with your order of Ramen.. . It can get busy and it isn't that large of a place.  It's ideal with a group of 2-3, but  I"ve been here with as large a group as 6 people.  . . Anyway...this is definitely a place worth checking out!
