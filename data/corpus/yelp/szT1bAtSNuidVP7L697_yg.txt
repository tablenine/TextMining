Yummm!  Let's start with the complimentary starter of papadams "chips" served with 3 dipping sauces -- 2 of which were typical but good (raita, green chutney), but the third, a peanut and coconut "salsa" with cilantro and chili, was something I've never seen before and was sooo addictively good.  Thank god for seconds!. . The drinks -- all sounded great and one day I'll try them all, but for now the "maha"rita &amp; shankar sangria -- dangerous because they are so tasty you won't be able to stop drinking.. . The main entrees - mine was an indian take on a burger (lamb &amp; beef with tomato chutney on naaan) -- beautifully done; tender and tasty; and my husband had the rogan josh.  A tad heavy on the cardamon, but still good.. . We also had an app of fried julienned okra.  No breading and no trace of slime at all -- simply tender, crispy and flavorful.. . I think the chef excels at using Indian ingredients in an inventive way, so the non-traditional dishes were more successful than the traditional ones (for which you should  head to Devon Ave anyway).. . Services was slightly  air-headed but no major problems.  The food made up for it.
