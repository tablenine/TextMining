These guys are pretty clean and the service is nice.  The people who work here don't speak much English but they'll try their best to accommodate what you need.  Also, the food here is pretty consistent.. . Highlights: taiwanese sausages, pumpkin noodles and chicken rolls.  YUM!. . lost one star: cash only!
