I guess this falls under we didn't know what to expect, but it was a bit pricey for us and had a different twist of what we thought was cuban food.  We also didn't know that is was BYOB, so were a bit dissapointed we couldn't have a drink with our meal.  Not a terrible experience but not fantastic either.
