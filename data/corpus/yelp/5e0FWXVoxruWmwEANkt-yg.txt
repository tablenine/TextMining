Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Breakfast served all day and open 24 hours... what else can you possibly ask for?. . Boyfriend and I have been planning to visit Canter's for a while now and even more so determined when we saw it featured on Entourage.  After a couple of set-backs, an opportunity came when Marlon H. and Meghan J. wanted to meet up for a late dinner.. . P.S.  I was actually hoping to see Vince, E, Drama and Turtle.  HA HA HA. Anyway, why do I give this place only 3-stars?  Most people would agree that it's at least 4-stars, but here's my reason...  I know this place is better known for their sandwiches, but I couldn't help looking over at their breakfast menu.  After all, I LOVE breakfast food.  So naturally, I opted for a Belgium Waffle and snubbing the myriad choices of (cold or hot) sandwiches.  Even their entrees (i.e. Thanksgiving Dinner Plate), I didn't bother with.  Although I was satisfied with my waffle (it was crispy, thick and golden brown to perfection), I wished that I ordered something else after seeing what others ordered and how yummy it looked.  According to them, it was mighty tasty.  Next visit (yes, there will be a NEXT), I'll try to avoid ordering breakfast.. . P.S.  I was hoping to see Vince, E, Drama and Turtle.  HA HA HA
