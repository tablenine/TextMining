Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
Why do I love Holy Taco? Well, a few reasons but the first and foremost reason is that the staff rocks. Not only are there a few of my favorite people who jumped from the sinking ship that is Derek Lawford pubs but there are bartenders I've not seen elsewhere who are attentive, friendly, and...wait for it....HAPPY TO SEE YOU!. . I've been here more times than I can count. Sometimes I sit at the bar, sometimes I get a table, sometimes I go with small groups, sometimes with big and they are always consistent with the level of service and with the deliciousness of their food.. . The food...let's talk about the food. I absolutely love their salsa verde. It's hotter than anywhere else I've had it (more jalapenos) and that makes me happy. I am not the biggest fan of their chips. I kinda wish they were thinner and less greasy but I'd drink the salsa verde so no chips needed. They have really, really, really good fish tacos and shrimp tacos. I want to like their brisket tacos but they just don't talk to me the way the fish tacos do. That's ok, because I'm happy eating just fish or shrimp tacos from Holy Taco for the rest of my life.. . Moving onto drinks. Their margaritas are wicked good but just the other day I tried the red sangria and holy taco batman it was kinda brilliant. They also have a pretty decent beer list if that is what floats your boat. Have I mentioned their super nice bartenders? Yes?...well, they are worth mentioning again.. . Finally, I love the patio. In the Spring time I crave sitting outside of Holy Taco with my friends having a kick ass margarita and people watching. You can see some good stuff like one of the neighbors riding around on his Harley with his poodle strapped to his chest in a bjorn for dogs . Aaaaaahhhhhh, I can't wait for Spring.
