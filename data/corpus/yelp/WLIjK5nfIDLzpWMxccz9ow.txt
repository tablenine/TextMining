First off, i know i'll probably get kicked in the face for saying this.. but i don't think there hinan chicken is all that great. It's not the best i've had, and i think Tasty Choice has much better hinan chicken.. . On the other hand, the curry is something special since the taste is somewhere in between japanese, and thai curry. The pasta is a so-so. The food is good, but not something i would personally crave everyday.. . I give my vote to tasty choice for hinan chicken. You be the judge.
