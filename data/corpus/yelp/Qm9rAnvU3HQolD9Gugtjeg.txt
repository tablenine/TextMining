Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I love Stella's!  Service is fast, and they always get your order right.  I usually go for brunch so I stick to the usual breakfast food, but I have gone for dinner a few times and have also enjoyed what I ordered.  I love the atmosphere, and the chocolate shakes are amazing!  I started going to Stella's for brunch before I lived in the city and was just visiting friends, and I now bring my friends who are visiting to Stella's.  I also brought my parents to Stella's when they were visiting (since they had heard me talk about it before) and they loved it so much that they wanted to go back the next time they visited.  Stella's used to have RC Cola, which was exciting because no one has RC anymore, but they have now switched to Coke.  I was a little disappointed about that, but it hasn't stopped me from going back!
