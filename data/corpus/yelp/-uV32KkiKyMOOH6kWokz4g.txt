My roomie/good friend kept raving about this place. She used to nanny for a certain famous person's child and she would take him here on their weekend stomps around LA. . . Definite hipster joint with a hefty waiting time 25min to an hour. Very small dining space and loud as hell. If you want a nice tasty, intimate breakfast with friends, fam or loved ones, then pass on it. We were tempted to order to go but they weren't offering that cuz it was so busy. . . I tried to venture out and order the apple cobbler french toast but I didn't realize they would dip it in cereal. I was not too keen on that idea even when I scoped them out online. They also had to have mixed some peanut butter cereal on my order accidently cuz half of my french toast tasted like peanut butter instead of apple cinnamon. The servers denied that there was anything peanut butter on my order or that they serve something with peanut butter (hello! there is a peanut bubba french toast??), but I dropped it and just ate the one slice and took the rest home. . . The saving grace is that my friend ordered the regular french toast and it was very good and she even shared a few bites. I ordered a side of maple turkey sausage which was good too. Both of us paid around 20 bucks a piece for meal, tax and tip. Ummmm.. there has to be better breakfast spots out there for less damage to the pocket book right?? For that much, the ambience could be better. . . My friend was very bummed that my experience was not stellar but I may try it again with her if the day/time is convenient. That breakfast burrito looked insanely good so that may be my next order if we do...
