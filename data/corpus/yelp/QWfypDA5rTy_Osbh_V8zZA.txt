Ate here a while ago when I was back in high school. From what I remember, the sushi wasn't really that great in that most place I've been to before could have made the same dish but a far cheaper price. The atmosphere was nice though and it was a great place to take a date. The only problem was that date ended up costing me 130 bucks with tip and valet.. . My opinion is that Yamishiro is much like Ivy. The stars occasionally choose to eat here and so people do the same. The price and the quality you get are just not worth it. I'm going to have to second the "OVERRATED" that the previous post put up.
