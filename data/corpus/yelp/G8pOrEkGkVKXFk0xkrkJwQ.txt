Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I really, really want to give Umami 5 but I just can't!  My friend had been raving about Umami for days, weeks before my visit and I was so, so excited to take my first bite.. . Beforehand, we stocked up on 3 bottles of vino for the BYOB.  We were disappointed to be told that they were no longer BYOB nor did they have a liquor license and did not serve any alcohol at all.  I swear, I heard hearts shatter and livers jumping for joy.  My friends were bummed x 219032. Fun LA fact: BYOB restaurants are sparse unlike in Chicago (where they are a dime a dozen).  So this is a real treat for the Californians.. . We sat down and ordered onion rings to start.  Food consoles the soul.  I eat my feelings.  The onion rings were yums; however, only 6 come in an order?  Not enough to satisfy.  I proceeded with the Truffle Burger (Italian Truffle Cheese and Truffle Glaze) and an order of big, fat hand-cut fries. MMM yeah.  The burger was cooked to perfection.  The meat seriously just melted in muh mouth.  It was a damn good burger.. . I'd go back to Umami.  In a heartbeat.  But I'd love a reason to give it the 5th star...  something was missing and I'm not quite sure what it was.  Man, I sound like a John Mayer song right about now.  I'll end it now.
