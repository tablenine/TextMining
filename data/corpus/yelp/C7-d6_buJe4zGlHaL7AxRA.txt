Womp Womp. . I read so many reviews, looked at all the pictures on the site. It didn't live up to my expectations.  I went for this chef selected hors d'oeuvres thing they were doing with . http://evite.com. . Couscous, bruschetta with the toast points separate from the topping, and melon. My party and I were unimpressed and felt we were suckered into just getting us in the door. Should have known right?. . We decided to just sit at the bar and order from what we thought would be a better selection of appetizers.  Womp womp. The appetizer list was ultimately disappointing. We ended up ordering the Shrooms and Calamari. The shrooms were stuffed with Alaskan crab and cheese or something. The crab had lots of shell and cartilage pieces in it. I was pulling hard pieces out my mouth the whole time I was eating it.  My drink was the Charlotte Fizz, which was good but this one bartender with an unwarranted attitude with us made my second one and it wasn't even the same color right along with tasting like crap. When I told the first bartender what the drink was and it was terrible, he took one look at it and said "That's not a Charlotte Fizz."  He was kind enough to remake it correctly. His name was Mike and he was very cool.  I stuck with him. . . The interior is glitzy but it gives you a false idea of fabulous. I might go back, but I'd walk right back out if Mike wasn't at the bar.
