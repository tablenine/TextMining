met some friends up for a late-nite dinner. didn't want to hassle with street parking so i sucked it up and spit out the almost $10 for valet.. . interior was LOUD! in the good-i-can't-intentionally-listen-in-on-your-conve rsation sort of way. we started off with a few appetizers (passable) fried squash and mussels. the main event was worth the wait. i'm not usually the hugest sausage fan (insert dirty laugh here), but that sausage fennel pizza was nice. the flavor permeates your nostrils and envelops your mouth as you sink your teeth in. the magherita pizza was basilly alright, but the sausage was my clear favorite.. . i think the valet guy was nicer than our waiter. i definitely spent more time with him.
