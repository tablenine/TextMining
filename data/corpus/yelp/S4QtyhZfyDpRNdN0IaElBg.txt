Having a husband who is lactose intolerant, I was slightly nervous upon walking up to the line (which was, of course, out the door) at Milk.  I'm glad we did!. . Once I heard about their ice cream sandwiches, where the ice cream is enveloped by wonderful French-style macarons, I knew I had to go.  I was under the false assumption that they were made freshly, like at Diddy Reise, where you pick your ice cream.  Not true.  They were pre-packaged in the case.  Still awesome!  The selection we went with was he Coffee Toffee.  Toffee ice cream hugged tightly by two wonderful coffee macarons.  Somehow the macarons were still a bit crispy on the outside and maintained the wonderful chewiness that makes French-style macarons so wonderful!  Messy, but tasty!. . We also had a Butterscotch Banana Bar; that was even messier!  It was also super tasty.  . . I enjoyed our trip to Milk; I wouldn't drive all the way there from the West Valley, but if I'm anywhere nearby, I'm getting another ice cream sandwich!
