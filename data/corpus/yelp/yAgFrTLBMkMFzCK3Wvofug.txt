Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If you're going to have breakfast anywhere in LA or Southern California in general... you must venture to the Griddle Cafe.. . I would often drive by this small place and wonder why there would be a huge crowd.  One early rainy Sunday morning, my boyfriend and I decided to go because we thought everybody would be either asleep, inside because of the rain, or at church.  Well, little did we know that the crowd that usually waits outside decided to huddle indoors that day.. . The wait was surprisingly not that long.  It helped that there was only 2 in our party, so we didn't require huge/special accommodations.  As soon as we glanced at the menu and tables around us, we finally understood the hype.  It took a while, but we finally settled on sharing the strawberries and creme waffle, two eggs scrambled, a side of extra-thick bacon, and french pressed coffee.. . We struggled finishing the food and we were sharing one waffle.  Everything was rich, fatty, and scrumptious.  I was on a strawberry-flavored cloud.  The saltiness of the bacon and eggs balanced out the sweetness of the waffle.  The french pressed coffee was pretty good.  But it still wasn't as strong as I'd like it to be.  If you ever had cafe sua da at an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, you'd understand what I mean.. . I love this place.  The food is top-notch.  No complaints here.  Just a few crumbs at the corner of my lips and a slight tummy ache.  Now if you'll  excuse me, I have the sudden urge to do sit-ups.
