SICKENING FAUXHAWK CENTRAL.  . . Not like I let people's dumb hairstyles get in my way of pancakes bigger than my face, though. . . This is just the kind of place where you spend ten minutes agonizing over the menu, and then you place your order with a nagging worry that you might want something else... in my case, I got the banana pancakes and kept thinking about the strawberry waffles with brown sugar sour cream.  Not like you truly regret the choice, anyway, and they probably do that on purpose to make sure you come back twenty times over.  Wankers.. . I have a suspicion they use a little bit of coconut milk in their scrambled eggs.  This is definitely a good thing.
