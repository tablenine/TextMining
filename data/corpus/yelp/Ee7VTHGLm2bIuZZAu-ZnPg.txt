Bossa Nova has a huge menu with something for everyone. If you want something healthy you can get it. They have beer and wine too.. . I enjoy going for a late lunch/early dinner when it is not too crowded cause food does take a while (but worth it)  It is also a great place to pick up high protein healthy food after a hard work-out. Just be sure to call it in way in advance because it does take a while.. . The Mushrooms Appetizer is really good.. Fresh mushrooms sauteed in olive oil, parmesan cheese, garlic and sherry sauce. Served with a side of toasted Italian bread  Espetinho Misto. . I really enjoy the chicken skewers (white meat) with grilled veggies instead of rice.. Your choice of 2 grilled skewers, served with a garnish of white rice and Brazilian salsa: with choice of vegetables, chicken, or lamb.. . Another winner is Andrea's Favorite Salad. Very simple, but very good! Fresh green lettuce,. walnuts, marinated sundried tomatoes and gorgonzola cheese, tossed in honey mustard dressing with grilled chicken breast on top. . For those goat cheese and seafood lovers I recommend the. Edgar's Goat Cheese Seafood Salad (friends of mine love it). An unique salad with fresh spinach, fresh arugula, sliced red onions, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese and walnuts, tossed in a light homemade dijon vinaigrette dressing served with sauteed scallops, white Mexican shrimp and shitake mushrooms deglazed with white wine. . They have lots of great sandwiches too and plenty of desserts to satisfy your sweet tooth when you want to splurge. So call a friend you need to catch up with and have a nice low-key meal :)
