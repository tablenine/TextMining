Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
I am constantly flipping what deep dish I like the best - Gino's or Lou's. Gino's East has an excellent butter crust and there is something about the sauce that I just love - tomatoey without being pasty, real chunks of tomato. Also, it can take a while, so call ahead with your order if you remember!
