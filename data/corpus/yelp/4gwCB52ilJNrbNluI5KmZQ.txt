Been here about 6 times now and always enjoy it.  But you have to order well because I dont think everything is phenomenal.. . I recommend getting the tacos.  The Taco combo plate is awesome, pick 4 tacos and served with a plate of additional cheese, salsas, cilantro, diced onions, etc..   The habenero salsa is so good too.. . -Duck taco and chorizo taco are my favorite, but they are all good.. -salsa options are good but sometimes can be on the bland side.. -quesedillas are also good. -queso fundito app is really good but you must get it with the chorizo. -Margarhitas are good but not standout.  . . service has always been at or above par in my experience.  atmosphere is great-  built in an older house with a great outside patio and seperate rooms inside to make for a cozier and quieter atmosphere.  They also play good 80s music which is never a bad thing.  And you can walk next door to Twains afterwards and play some shuffleboard and drink some beers!
