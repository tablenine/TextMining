Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Let it be known: I cuss like a sailor. So it's no goddamn surprise that Papa Cristo's makes me say one thing - . . HOLY. . F*CKING. . SH*T. . This place is so good, it will probably turn your mouths all sailory too. Or your kids' mouths. When Chrys S. Chrys (owner and proprietor of Papa Cristo's) is done with you, passersby will swear that you and your family just fell out of a John Wayne movie set on an oil rig. . . Why do I curse so much, you ask? Because when I am finished with my meal at Papa Cristo's, I'm pissed. I don't want it to end. I want a Flow-B attached to that spinning hunk of lamb and beef heaven, and suctioned right into my arteries. The shinier, the greasier. And the greasier, the better. . . Everything about this place with make you sing it's praises with four letter words. I could talk about the authentic Greek grocery on premises, the wonderful tablecloths and outdoor patio, the ample parking, and friendly staff. But why? They could serve their gyro to me from a turkey baster in Tom Arnold's armpit, and I'd still come back for more.. . Try the gyro sandwich. Try the hummus. Try the spanikopita, and then try the baklava. And THEN, try not to swear. It's that good.. . Bonus points for spotting the diminutive man himself: Chrys S. Chrys. All of 2 feet zero, his moustache gets more chicks than you, and if he drops off a 'Greek for beginners' card, you damn well better take it.. . I love you, Papa.
