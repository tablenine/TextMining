I'm no expert on dumplings and soup, so it's hard for me to provide information that's more helpful than some others already have.  This is good...very good, but it's also expensive.  . . My $14 bowl of noodles may have had some exquisitely cooked pork belly in it, but it was still a $14 bowl of noodles.  . . I'll be back...multiple times, to try just about everything on the menu for sure.  I just wish it was slightly more affordable to have some lunch there or grab a quick bite.  . . Urban Belly is less inventive than Belly Shack, but appeals to me a bit more.  I'll always choose soup and dumplings over sandwiches, though.  I definitely prefer the space and aesthetics of Belly Shack, though.
