I've finally tried Kogi today!! Â Since I've found out that they'll be in Fullerton between 6:30 and 9:00p.m, I've got there little after 6pm and some people have already lined up before a truck came!. . I tried following (check out my photo!);. *spicy pork, beef, chicken tacos (beef was the best!) -$2 each. *kimchi quesadilla -$5. *limited edition blue moon mulitas (grilled onions, chicken and cheese with spicy blueberry sauce) -$4. . They were really good and it's worth trying them.
