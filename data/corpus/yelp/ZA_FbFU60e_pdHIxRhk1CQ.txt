Yummyyyyy. Their vegetarian moussaka is sooo good (better than their meat version in my opinion) and everything is so quick since most Greek restaurants cook everything all at once and keep them on heaters to cut and serve for patrons. I'm all for that; I don't want to wait an hour for my moussaka to bake, no matter how good it is. The ambiance is nice, and who can beat free valet? That's a Greek town thing, but that's just another reason why Greek town is a great place to have dinner parties.
