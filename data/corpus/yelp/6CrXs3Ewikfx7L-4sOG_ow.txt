Oh, Bossa Nova. I was pullin' for you. God knows I was. I went in wanting to love it, and I left it going "You know.. we should've just gone to Denny's or something.". . For late night eating, if you want variety, I suppose you could go to this overpriced cramped "hotspot" where they overlook you, seat you casually (or should I say callously?) forget to give you water - let alone drinks - for twenty minutes, give you undersized portions for an outrageous sum of money and subtract creativity and originality from their dishes.. . In other words, yeah, Denny's would have better service at 2 in the morning. Hell, I wouldn't even come here for the 6 o clock dinner special.. . It was funny too. Steven L. ordered a burger and I'm going to tell you this: You could've gotten four better burgers from In-N-Out for the price of that one lame, hulked up sad version of a Big Mac. That's how bad it was. The spread was entirely to one side. There was one layer of lettuce, one slice of tomato, and that patty looked like it needed antidepressants or something.. . Definitely am not coming back here. The whole Brazilian vibe was so not received.
