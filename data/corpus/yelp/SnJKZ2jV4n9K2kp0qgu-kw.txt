Stopped by this place Friday night. The hostess was friendly and I had often driven by this spot and was excited to try it out...so incredibly disappointing. This place isn't big yet it seems that the staff can't handle multiple tables. We had a LONG wait before our server came to take our drink order...then 10 minutes passed with no drinks...she returned to tell us they were having a shortage of clean glasses and it would only be a few more minutes. SERIOUSLY? The patio was empty and they have a full bar - what can't they figure out about cleaning glasses or serving water and soda out of a different glass. Their solution - coffee cups...coffee cups? Really? Am I at the Waffle House? The food was over priced and less than savory; honestly, the Waffle House would have been a better value for my time and money. Yes, I how that sounds but I meant it. To top it off, the manager saw the situation and started to come over, but half way to my table she stopped and turned around...guess she'd rather have a social chat with some other servers than do her job. PATHETIC. I can't imagine having a worse time out!! I hope this place goes out of business soon...it is taking up prime real estate that could be used for a restaurant that actually has a clue. Save your money and your time...
