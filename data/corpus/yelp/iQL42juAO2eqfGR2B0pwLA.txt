Really, really delicious french dip. I like that it's not too salty, I feel like too many places use bouillon or something for their au jus. But I guess the original french dip wouldn't be that way. I took the advice of Yelpers and ordered the potato salad. I did not regret it. Simple but delicious.. . As a tourist, I didn't mind waiting in line but I probably wouldn't think it was worth it on a regular day . . . I think the fact that it was so crowded prevented me from enjoying what seemed to otherwise be a cool atmosphere. I'm a slow eater and near the end of my sandwich I saw some lady hovering by our table. Not that I blame her but it's unnerving. . . Anyway, delicious food, my only real criticism is that they charge for pickles. I am serious when I say that's why I'm only giving four stars. Not the line. $1 for 1 pickle.
