Alright, I'm going to be pelted by my wife, but I'm giving this place 4 stars since I can't give it a 4.5 stars.  Our waitress recommended the fried squash blossoms with ricotta which was a great appetizer.  No doubt the pizza is awesome.  We had the white anchovy, tomato and hot chiles pizza and also the one everyone seems to order: the fennel sausage, panna and spring onion pizza.  The crust is nice and crispy, but I kinda wished it was less oily.  But the biggest reason, it's not a 5 star review: what's with the flies?!?  There were so many flies, I was suspicious there was carrion lying around in the back!  But enuff said, the pizza's is one of the best I've had, so I think we'll back.  . . Note to self and other yelpers: Great for lunch and if you don't have reservations, just come 20-30 minutes prior to opening and camp out.  That should cinch you a nice seat at the bar/counter where you can watch them make those pizzas or ogle the bottles and bottles of vino.
