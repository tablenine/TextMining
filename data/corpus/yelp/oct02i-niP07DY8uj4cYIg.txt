Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Went here on a sunday afternoon..... . no Thai Elvis.....only a nighttime thing..first time in this location.  staff was your typical asian restaurant semi-hurried vibe..... . food was good, but not outstanding.  had some of the thai sausage, basil fried rice, some beef dish, pad thai, soup..... . i'd go back just for thai elvis..the food...meh, just average and hollywood is too far for me.
