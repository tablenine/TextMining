My Big Fat Greek Wedding was filmed here and I've also watched Huell Howser in regards to this to this place.  As a result, a coworker and I decided to have lunch here.  I had a lamb sandwich on a baguette and it was quite tasty and something different!  And in the meantime, I've also purchased a jar of marinated grape leaves.  I had the ideal of wrapping meat loaf in them.  In addition, I also bought a half a dozen of the same thing--dolmades.  All in all, this place has character!
