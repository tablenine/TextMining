Quaint joint with the tastiest grub! I love the burgers here and the fries make it even bettter. I hate ketchup but the ketchup really makes Â the burgers and fries, along with their special sauce! The menu is very limited, but I stick to those old classics. The interior has not changed since opening, and there is seating only around the counter, making this place have real retro charm. Expect to wait around lunch time for an open seat. Service is friendly and fast, just how I like it. Be sure to have a slice of pie (a la mode) at the end to finish off that juicy meat and salty potatoes. This place will really bring you back!
