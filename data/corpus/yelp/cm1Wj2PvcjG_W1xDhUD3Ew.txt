Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Okay, I take back anything nice I said about this place. The servers are bitchy, the bloody mary came out with MEAT on it, and the food is nothing exciting. I like the patio, and I like the bar...and Monday has $3 wine...but the rest of Dunlay's can bite me. You're in Logan Square. And you have pig ears on the menu. I don't care if it's for dogs, that's nasty.
