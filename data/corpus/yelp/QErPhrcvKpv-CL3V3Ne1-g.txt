This is the Viet pho place that pretty much all the VSA (Vietnamese Student Association) and CSA (Chinese Student Association) kids of Georgia Tech go to.. . Cheap prices, huge portions, good stuff. I usually get the pho with everything (all the meat parts: tripe, meatballs, flank, tendon, etc). Add some cilantro, basil, bean sprouts, thyme, and lime, as well as some sriracha, and you're good to go. They also have good bubble tea slushes.
