BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Man, haven't been here for so long but getting reminder of Elvis brings back memories. Kind of. It's all a big blur. Bah. It's definitely one of those places you have to check out at least once in your life, especially if you live in SoCal. Thai food is almost always good (to me, at least) and the food here is no different, a little better than most, maybe. . . But yeah, Elvis is surprisingly entertaining. Get maybe a few giggles out of the whole experience. Get your stomach full. Get the hell out. Oh, and don't forget to tip, you don't want Elvis to get mad at you now, do you? Good.
