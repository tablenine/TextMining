Casablanca burger was yummy.  It's a lamb burger with preserved apricots (sweet), and arugula.  But not being a burger fan I wouldn't come back.  It's a bit pricey but I think they use quality ingredients.. . It's a small joint.  You would need to get valet parking because it's hard to find parking in the side streets.  It's in a ok neighborhood, you should be on guard of your surroundings.
