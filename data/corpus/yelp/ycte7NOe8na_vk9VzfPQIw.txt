I seriously don't understand why people are raving about the sushi here. Fish was just not fresh at all when I was there on a busy Friday nite. You'd imagine fish must be fresh for a busy restaurant. NO--it looked dull and not fresh at all.. . Skip the sushi and just order the small plates they are good at. Â We had the foie gras. The sauce was awesome! Had the seared halibut with jalapeno as well. It didn't taste exciting as we expected. . . We'll return-just for the small plates.
