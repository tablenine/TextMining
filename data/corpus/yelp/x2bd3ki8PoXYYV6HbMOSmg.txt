Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Best dumplings this side of the Mississippi.  Unless your mom knows how to cook them better.  In which case, I'ma see you at your place!. . Prices are very reasonable.  Two hungry people can chow down for $~50 including tax.  . . One order of pork+crab dumplings is about 10 juicy pieces.  Enough to wet one person's whistle.  Add a beef soup, comes with a large handful of fresh spinach in it, very tasty and fresh!  . . Service is incredibly fast.  On a bustling Saturday night, the time it took to get our food to the table after ordering was 4 minutes.  I gotta give daps to the homeys in the kitchen.  K pasa!. . Come down.  It's an experience that will enlighten you to the true dumpling experience.
