Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
When I am not feeling well, I head to Tank for a big bowl of chicken pho.  Toss in some fresh bean sprouts and Thai basil and there is really no better cure-all.  Sorry Mom, but this definitely beats your Lipton!. . I also stop in for bubble tea.  There are plenty of places in the neighborhood to grab one, but Tank puts big chunks of fresh fruit in theirs.  Great summer treat!
