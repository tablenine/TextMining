Talk about the most flaky soft creamy baked to perfection cheese rolls. Bite after bite, this little treat will knock your socks off. I am really in awe about how there is just the right amount of sweetness that this pastry presents in flavors. You will experience an explosion of heaven in your mouth each and every time you take a bite. I am not joking when I say I go through a whole box by myself because it's that addicting. My favorite pastry in the world was baclava... not anymore because of Porto's!
