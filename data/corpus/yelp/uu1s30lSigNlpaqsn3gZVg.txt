So last week after being stuck in traffic for 45 minutes, I arrived in my neck of the woods and was met at the corner of Zelzah and Chatsworth across from the Jack N Box by the trendy Kogi Truck.. . I braved the cold, weirdos and general foodies for 45 minutes to 1 hour for 1  beef black jack quesadillia, 1 chicken burrito and 1 beef burrito. The quesadillia was delicious. The beef was sweet, tangy and spicy and very much Korean BBQ esque. I only had the beef burrito but my mom said  the chicken burrito was very much satisfying. I usually steer clear of chicken dishes at most places, because for some reason or another people always seem to mess up chicken, where is beef rarely can be bad if seasoned somewhat properly. . But I digress,  I would of enjoyed my meal  and had a five star moment if i had not been as hungry as a  heman hulk and did not freeze my tush off.  But the biggest drawback was the fact, egg was incorporated in my burrito, I understand it is Korean BBQ minus the rice but egg only belongs in a breakfast burrito. And with that said, I will be following the truck to a neighborhood near me this week as well. I figure I now know what to expect and can order with more finesse.
