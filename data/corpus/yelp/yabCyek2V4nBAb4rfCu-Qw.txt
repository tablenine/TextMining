A great place to take a date. Too bad I didn't have one. The ambiance is definitely great. The food, it's mediocre. You can get better Japanese or Japanese fusion food for cheaper elsewhere in LA. For me, I'd rather go to a top notch sushi place. Just know that you are paying for ambiance, not the food. I ordered the "Sushi Plate - Adventurous". The fish was alright, but not the freshest I have eaten. And who wants to pay $6 for a bowl of miso soup?? For that, I can get a whole combo meal from McDonalds, and an apple pie!
