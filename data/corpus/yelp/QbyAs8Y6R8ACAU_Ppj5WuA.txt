Squeezed down here for lunch yesterday and I'm surprised to say I was not happy.. . Our server, a gal who looked like she just rolled out of bed (with a temperament to match), was just 100% not interested in what she was doing. Sorry, at least be cordial with customers even if you don't like what you're doing.. . Gilbert's used to have a nice mix-and-match menu for lunch, but that apparently has gone away in favor of the dinner menu with a few specials here and there. Cheaper? Easier? I don't know, but we need custom choices for lunch or else there's really no point for me.. . My co-diner Jason ordered a Newcastle that was barely cool, and our cheery server said she couldn't replace it because "they're all that temperature" in the refrigerator. If that's true, you're gonna have a lot of unhappy beer drinkers.. . This was disappointing because Gilbert's has really set the standard for a midtown walking lunch for me in the past. But this experience was definitely sub-par. Bummer.. . Not sure if Hob Nob is stretching the staff and management - but my advice is don't let Gilbert's, a midtown treasure, languish in the shadow of that place.
