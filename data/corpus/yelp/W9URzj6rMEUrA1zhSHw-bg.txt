Awesome place to bring friends visiting from out of town for brunch. . . We literally ordered everything...I remember us all ordering different omelettes.... I had the spinach and mushroom egg white omelette. . We had a lot of Bellinis and Mimosas. . We had the Eggs Arribiata. . The Smoked Salmon. . The Eggs Benedict. . The Tea Sandwiches. . Even the Portobello Fries and a Prosciutto Pizza. . . I mean it. Everything there is great. I really like this place and enjoy the experience. It's fun just to see what the folks next to you order because the presentation of the food is fantastic! Highly recommend. . . One thing to note: The place is LOUD.
