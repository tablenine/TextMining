Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Stopped in here one day on a lark, as I was told it was the inspiration for 90210's Peach Pit, used in the pilot as the location.. . The burgers were pretty good and I really do enjoy the much-mentioned "minimalist" menu. Â Keeps things hopping.. . Sadly, I'm not an apple pie fan, so no a la mode for moi.
