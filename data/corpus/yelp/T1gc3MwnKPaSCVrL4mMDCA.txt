I went here to meet a handful of girlfriends for a birthday dinner.  The birthday girl was late...errrrr...traffic!  So, myself &amp; a few of my girlfriends sat at the bar, and enjoyed one of there signature cocktails, the Peachtree Ice Tea.  The cocktail was good (a little too sweet for my taste, but good).  The bartender was great, and told us all about the different flavored syrups that he makes for the cocktails, and was very friendly &amp; helpful.  As soon as the birthday girl arrived, we seated immediately.. . The waiter was nice, and informative.  He had great suggestions, and knew about the menu items.I ordered the beet &amp; goat cheese salad, which was delicious!  For my main course, I ordered the special of the night, the Grouper.  Also, delicious!  Most of the girls ordered the highly recommended Scallops dish, which I got the opportunity to try...YUM!  For dessert we ordered the Icecream Sandwich.  The cookie was a little too crunchy, but overall, the dessert was good.. . I look forward to going back, and trying some of the other dishes on the menu...Tuna Tartar for sure!
