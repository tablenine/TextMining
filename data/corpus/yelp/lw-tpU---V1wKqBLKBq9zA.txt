I love the atmosphere of the Beverly Hills Crustacean.  The fish tank/walkway is a nice touch, and the decor is really cool.  You kind of don't feel like you're in Beverly Hills (until you have to deal with the snobby hosts).. . I came here last Thursday night.  We had reservations, but still had to wait a bit.  The guy at the front desk told our hostess to take us to our table, but she just walked past us without saying anything, and then when she realized that we didn't follow her (uh, because she didn't even look at us), she came back and told us to follow her. . . Other than that, the service is excellent.  Our glasses were constantly refilled, and we were asked plenty of times how our food was.  Our server was pretty cute too.  . . Food:  Asian fusion would be the best way to describe it.  I normally just get the roasted garlic crab and the garlic noodles.  They were excellent, as always.  We also tried the shrimp toast as an appetizer.  I loved it!  I have to say, however, that the food at the San Francisco Crustacean is better.  The garlic noodles there are just addicting.  &amp; the crab just seems tastier.. . You need to make a reservation, there's a dress code, and it's pricey.  Go for the atmosphere, the roasted garlic crab and the garlic noodles.  You will not be disappointed.
