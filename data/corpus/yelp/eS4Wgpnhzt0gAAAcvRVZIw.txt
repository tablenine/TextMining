We came here earlier than the rush so we didn't have to stand in line to get in.  Plus we got a table which was a nice since it got a little crowded.  The people were not too young and casual, not too dressy.  Our waitress knew what everyone had to order in our group of 10.  It was easy to pay our bill.  I heard they were known for their french fries, which were good, but not WOW.  Plus there was another level for the bar.  The middle level was for eating and the floors were very slippery.  Nice outside seating.  Good atmosphere and good service.
