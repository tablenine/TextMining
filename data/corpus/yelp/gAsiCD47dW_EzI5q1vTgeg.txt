Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I went to here with my boyfriend for a late lunch.. We didn't have a reservation so we opted for the pizza bar.  I would choose this seat over any other in the restaurant.  We got to see pizzas and appetizers being made.  It was awesome!. . We ordered: Arancine, Caprese, Garlic Bread, and Fennel Pizza.. . The arancine was a pass.  I think I could have done without them.  Next time I'm going to order the squash blossoms.  . Caprese- AMAZING!  I wish I could order 10 orders of this!  We ate it with our garlic bread.  Match made in heaven! So delicious.  The cheese was so goood and the bread was toasted to perfection! . Fennel Pizza- Can I have another!?  OMG!  So good.  I am definitely ordering this pizza again and will probably try the Bianca as well.  Sounds awesome.. Can't wait to go back!
