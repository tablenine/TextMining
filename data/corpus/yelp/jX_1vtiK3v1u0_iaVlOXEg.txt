Restaurant: Dynamic Dish
Category: Vegetarian
After 3 visits to a restaurant, either the axe murderer finally appears and tarnishes forever the original attraction, or boredom sets in, or (if I'm lucky) the adventure continues. Dynamic Dish is the rare adventure.. . It's my business to know a lot of chefs. Most of them are emotionally invested in their work. Only a special few have a spiritual affinity with their food - something that transcends mere kitchen wizardry - a connection between heart, soul, ingredient, earth. . . I feel connected to the origins of the food when I eat here with my partner, and we sense that the staff is connected to the food as well - and that's magical.. . Highly recommended.
