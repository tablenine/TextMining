You know how sometimes in movies, during dramatic, emotional moments, the frames slow down, the borders blur, and Ray Charles' "I Can't Stop Loving You" starts playing? Well that's exactly how I felt (I attribute the first two symptoms to the sangria) until the dude behind me flicked his jacket onto my head. That's what happens when you sit next to the door in a cramped restaurant where patrons are crowded around your chair waiting for you to finish.. . But that chicken. So... incredibly... delicious.... I don't know what seasoning they use when roasting that thing but the slightly smokey/spicy flavor still sits in my mouth a month after I visited. It's mind boggling how good the chicken was. Everything else was good but not mind blowing, except the tostones, which in fact went the route of dry bland and cold. Great food, fun atmosphere sans dude who kept shoving his jacket/butt into my chair half of the night.. . 4 stars for delicious chicken. . Revisit? Yes please!
