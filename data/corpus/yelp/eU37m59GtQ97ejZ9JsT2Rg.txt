I'll be honest, parking sucks ass but then again, it's West Hollywood. I find it very funny that you'll find nice ass cars such as Porsches, Bimmers, Benz's parked in the ally way.. . However, i come here for one thing, their green apple martini. hand's down the best in the west. unless someone can tell me where i can go, i won't deny the fact that they have the best martini selection. Â trust me, I'm coming from orange county, the home of the bubble to drive all the way to West Hollywood to have martinis. i might sound like a tool but hey, it's the best.
