Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Waffles definitely cure broken hearts! The best comfort food in the world!. . First off, parking is pretty good. They have a lot that warps around the entire restaurant.. . The place isn't too big, but not super tiny. Not the best looking, but the food makes up for it.. . My waiter was scary. Sad face. Really, the only downfall.. . I got a #2 and split it with my sister. The waffles were the best that I've ever have. It comes with lots of butter and the syrup smelled really good. The chicken was a bit dry, but it was white meat. Cornbread was on the dry side, but it was late at night. Mac and cheese was good, but not my favorite.. . They have lots of side dishes you can order, but get the waffles for sure!
