Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Being new to the city, Gioradano's was a welcome introduction to Chicago deep dish stuffed pizza.  I highly recommend the "special" pizza with sausage, mushroom, pepperoni, and onions.  Even my parents who aren't big fans of pizza were impressed.  Note: this location can get extremely crowded.
