Sometimes a place is so part of your regular routine that you forget to yelp it.  Maybe it's the fact that this place already has hundreds of reviews to its credit already that I've managed to skip over it.  Time to give props to Philippe's and their simply delicious dips.. . Just the history behind this place draws you in.  It's stood there for a hundred years.  In that very spot!  Serving french dipped sandwiches since they went for a quarter each (point goes to 1908).  It's been through the prohibition era, the GREAT depression, two world wars, the golden years of Hollywood, to now.  To their credit too, they keep as much of that classic old feel as possible--the way the counter staff dresses, the photos on the wall, sawdust on the floor, and even the candy shop.. . Well, a few things have changed.  I'm sure they didn't need two parking lots back in 1908 - ample free parking just about anytime of the day.  They probably also didn't have big screen TVs showing Dodger and Laker games (point awarded to 2009).. . If you're new to Philippe's, you'll probably be inclined to get the beef dip.  This is a classic choice for your first foray into french dip territory.  After coming here a few times, my meal of choice is a double dipped lamb sandwich (yes double), side of coleslaw, and two of their lemonades (they're 60 cents, but small glasses).  There's seating all over the place to supply the masses, and boy they can get massive lines on the weekends.. . Their mustard is another thing I like about this place.  Be careful with putting a lot though, cause it's surprisingly hot.  They also serve breakfast, wines, and beer.  Good place to go with a group.  The stuff also travels well for picnics and tailgates.  Cash only (what's a credit card in 1908?), but they have ATMs on site.
