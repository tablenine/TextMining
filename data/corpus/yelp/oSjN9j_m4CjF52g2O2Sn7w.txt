The best steaks in LA!  The Wagyu is amazing and the texture was something special.  Everyone should try this place.  The lobster appetizer was probably one of my top 5 favorite appetizers of all time.  So why only 3 stars?  It's very expensive!  And my wife had to return her steak to get it cooked a little more.  From reading the other reviews, it seems like it's a problem to get the steak cooked just how you want, which is strange coming from a world class institution.  I would go here again, but only if someone else was paying!
