Used to come here ALL the time. The food is great here. I'd rate it as one of the top 3 Taiwanese "little eats" in Southern Cali.. . I've tried quite a few dishes here, but the ones that stand out would be the fried chicken leg over rice (name is deceiving it's more like a breaded chicken fillet cut up for you), Mei Cha Pork Rice (fatty pork belly with stewed veggies), Sausage with pieces of garlic (reminds me of the good ol' Taiwan days), and the Fried Radish Cake (the sweet/garlic sauce is amazing).  . . If you go on a busy day be prepared to wait for a good 30 minutes. Sometimes I get lucky and can sit down right away.  Service is very good never really had to wait to get my drinks or order.  . . Watermelon juice is a great way to balance out the sometimes oily/fatty foods. Haven't tried the shaved ice yet but heard it was pretty good as well.. . *thumbs up*
