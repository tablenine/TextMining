Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Every time I make a left at La Brea and Melrose to visit my friend in West Hollywood, I see Pink's and its long-ass line and yell, "IT'S JUST A HOT DOG!" My husband thinks we should roll down the window and yell this AT the line once before we leave LA.. . Seriously. . . It's. Just. A. Hot. Dog.. . Thank you, good night.
