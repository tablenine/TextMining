It's pretty crazy that everyone in L.A. doesn't know and love Alcove, but I'm glad they don't because the current crowd for morning-til-night visits is just manageable. My friend and I practically live here, because the food, the waitstaff and the oh-so-cozy outdoor environment are just so perfect for casual meals that are certain to please. The pastry selection is the BOMB, no kidding. The prices for the pastries and cakes aren't cheap, but I can guarantee they can be shared by two (sometimes still with leftovers) and theyre awesome. Look for the cute little house with the brick wall enclosed front yard with all the happy people eating under fairy-light decorated trees. Sadly I don't recommend the onion rings (which used to be perfect until they changed the recipe) but order sweet potato fries OR even better, the apple-pear slaw as a side dish to your sandwich order. I love their burgers, BLT's, roast beef, turkey, or tuna salad sandwiches. YUM! Great cappuccinos too.
