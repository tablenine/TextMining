The first time I witnessed the Thai Elvis impersonator I got tunnel vision and felt a little ill... it was so surreal for me, I don't know if I just read too much into it or what or if I was just tripping... it somehow epitomizes "everything LA". It's fantastic and horrifying at the same time. He needs his own billboard.. . The food is good and it comes really fast because the waitresses put your order through on these headsets. It's what I imagine it's like to being served by the P.A.'s from the movie set of "Ong-bak Thai Warrior"... so that's kinda weird too.. . i like weird. . . weird.. . (great for large groups / group ordering / group dining)
