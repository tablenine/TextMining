Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
square one is priced similarly to nearby but trendier los feliz breakfast/brunch joints (e.g., the kitchen, home, the alcove, fred 62s). for what you pay however, the quality is far superior. i arrived here after a reading an LA times review praising its fruit salad and muffin combo. the fruit salad switches up ingredients depending on what's in season. when i was last there, it comprised of pummellos, tangerines, pink lady apples, persimmons, you get the gist. i also really enjoyed my banana ginger muffin that came with. all in all, the food isn't perfect but considering the price, you don't really care. i suspect square one offers such an awesome deal because of its bizarre location next to the scientologists...
