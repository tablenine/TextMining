I passed Gloria's probably a hundred times before I realized it was there, and once I set foot in the door I don't know how I could have missed it.  It's been packed both times I've been there.  Sangria is good, service is extremely friendly but slow, and the guacamole doesn't taste homemade (or fresh, for that matter).  So I'm giving Gloria's three stars, but I'll definitely be back to try it again.
