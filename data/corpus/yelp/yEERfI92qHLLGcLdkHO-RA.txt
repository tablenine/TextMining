5 stars = I have been going here for about 11 years! Eeek! It's open 24 hours so I have been here plenty of times after going out. I love the pickles, and avocado melt and they have green tea! Â I usually leave with a pastry or two! best part of the experience. I have yet to go to the lounge. I love diners and the ceiling is awesome! I had the waffles with strawberries whip combo last nite. Don't try the thanksgiving dinner! ;)
