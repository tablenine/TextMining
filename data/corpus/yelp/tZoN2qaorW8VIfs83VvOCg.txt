Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
After being completely food teased one night by watching an episode of Iron Chef America with Batali where the secret ingredient was "the king of cheeses" Parmigano-Reggiano, I commited myself to the quest of eating at Mozza the very next day. Luckily I had a day off in the middle of the week, so my strategy was to show up 15 minutes before they opened. Much to my surprise, I was not alone in this idea, but I did manage to secure a place at the bar. I had a decadent lunch. An afternoon is always made better when one has glass of Prosecco. I ordered the arancini to start and then the porcini pizza. I had planned to save some of the arancini to bring home for my husband to try, but alas the arancini had other devious plans. The crust on the pizza is thin, crispy, and indescribably delicious. The porcinis were a work of art, huge with excellent flavor and texture. Really there should be a separate genus for Batali's pizzas, so far removed and above are they from what we traditionally think of as pizza.  .    There are 2 drawbacks: the small size and the deafening noise. However these are to be endured for the exquisiteness of the food.
