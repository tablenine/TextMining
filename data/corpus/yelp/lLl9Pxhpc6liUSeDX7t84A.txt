Went there with 2 girlfriends for our annual holiday dining extravaganza celebration.  Our reservation was for 7pm, but we showed up nice and early to sample the famed libations at the bar.  While we were sipping and chatting, we'd smell this incredible smell of fatty fried something or other.  We didn't know what it was, but we vowed we would find out, order and eat it.  Turns out it was the duck fat fried potatoes.  HOoo boy those things were good! I could have eaten pounds of them.  Or it could have also been the bacon/pear/blue cheese flatbread.  Ay yi yi, you MUST order this dish.  Anything with bacon is lovely, but this one is the king of bacondom. . . The hostess and front of the house staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.  At the end of our evening, they called a cab for us and friendlily wished us a goodnight. The cocktails are inventive and delicious, and the food is super tasty.  I had the cobia, my g-friends had the pork chop and the veal rib.  We also ordered the pork rillets with the fig jam and I forget what other stuff for our apps. We gluttoned our way through the evening and loved every second of it. I think our waiter could have been a tad more on-the-ball, but we weren't there to be pickwarts.  The atmosphere has a cool vibe, the decor is elegant, and it's a good place for either a nice date or dinner with a group of friends.
