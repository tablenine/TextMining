Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
The best sandwich on the West Coast hands down. . I can't believe my recent trip was my first in over a decade. Back in high school my buddies and I used to ditch school and drive 25 some odd miles to hit up Phillipes. . There is so much history associated with Phillipes. There are conflicting stories but apparently this place created the first french dip. I believe it, because the food is so bomb. Seeing as how I am not as carnivorous as I was ten years ago I ordered the Tuna dip (just as bomb). . The best part is the 75 Lemonade. EPIC. .  Harry may have met Sally at Katz deli but..... Bread met Butter at Phillipes!
