I was not impressed with this place. I got the ribs which were more bone and sauce than meat and the meat that was there was tough.. The macaroni and cheese was like a cement block and the greens tasted like they had sugar in them which I cannot stand. . We ate inside and watched baseball on this huge floor model TV that's in the middle of the room and there was all of this old memorabilia on the walls....I was not impressed and couldn't wait to leave.
