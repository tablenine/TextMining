Cheese Rolls yummy.  Yes, the wait in this place could make your hair grow an inch, but it's so worth it.  Before you have to take number as soon as you enter the door, but now you just enter the line.  Make sure you are in the right line.  One line on right (shorter one) is strictly for cake only and the other line (very loooonnggg line) is for the pastries.  I always love the cheese rolls, florentine cookies, black forest and chicken pie (or smtg like that).   As far as the comment about the wedding cake, not sure about that bcoz I never order any.  But, the service I always receive is always good.  Yesterday especially, the lady who was helping me was so energetic and friendly.  I bought two cakes and she helped me put a happy birthday on top of it.  She appears to be an expert to do it. The writing was so neat and fast.  Would recommend to family and friends and will always come back :). Ps.. -when ordering cheese rolls, I was told to order the party tray, rather than dozens bcoz you will get more pcs and a bit of break.. - For dine in, there's a Porto's cafe next door. Make sure only for dine in. Coz, they won't let you order take out. :(
