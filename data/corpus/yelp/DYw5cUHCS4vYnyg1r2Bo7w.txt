This place looks like fairly casual dinning as far as sushi goes, but the prices say otherwise.  I ordered the sashimi and the cuts of fish were super small.  The chefs  took a really long time to get to my order even though they had 3 sushi chefs and a restaurant that was 1/2 full.  I was not impressed.   I've had quicker service in fuller restaurants with less chefs working.  I don't know what the problem was.  The rice seemed different than I'm used to, but maybe it's just a different style (bigger grain and more like uncle ben's).  But I'm not a sushi expert.
