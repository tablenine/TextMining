Category: Hot Dogs
Blah blah LA.  Blah blah Hollywood.  Blah blah movie stars.  Blah blah landmark.  Blah Blah great hot dogs.  Blah blah long lines.  Blah blah overrated.. . Edgar already said what I was planning to say (confound you, Edgar!):  If you have 30 minutes to kill while Jiffy Lube is doing questionable things to your car, WTF else are you going to do?. . Everybody has to do it at least once...and if you are reading this, you probably haven't done it yet.  Just go ahead and get it over with...and remember to savor every bite.  You will have earned it.
