OK, I've just upgraded this place to 4 stars.  I went back recently on a sunday night and had a REALLY nice meal.  Oysters were fantastic as usual but the scallop spaghetti special I had was so memorably good I have to up the star-age on this one.  . . **************************************************. 3.5 stars. . I agree with all the yelpers that seafood and ambience is great.  Cute decor &amp; a lot of outdoor space.  Started w/ half dozen oysters - that lime chili sauce in totally addictive.  I thought $24 for a lobster sandwich was excessive so went for the Mahi &amp; haricot verts.  Veggies were surprisingly cold but mahi was nicely done.  My dining companion had the codfish on pea risotto &amp; carrot puree.  I was jealous because the carrot puree tasted like pumpkin soup (one of my faves) and made the dish really flavorful.  . . Our server was nice but didn't care for the hostesses though.  We checked in for our reservation right on time.  After about ten minutes, they seated us which would have been fine if they gave us any sort of estimate or clue what was going on.  I couldn't tell if they'd forgotten about us or what.  Not a great way to start off, but rest of dinner was fine.
