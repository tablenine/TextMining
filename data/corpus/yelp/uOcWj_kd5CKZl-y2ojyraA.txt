Restaurant: Canton Cooks
Category: Chinese
This is hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant in Atlanta. It's Cantonese style flavor is definitely distinct and worthy of merit. As a matter of fact, this is where all the Chinese restaurant owners go to eat after they close their restaurants for the night. .       Their salty duck egg on pork (xian dan cuo ruo) is the best tasting in Atlanta. It's hard to find seating at night because it's usually packed full of customers, so be ready for a short wait. They also do take-out..       All the dishes here are great, and whenever it's my turn to choose which restaurant to go to, no one frowns or complains when I suggest Canton Cooks. .       This is a must try for everyone that hasn't been there. There is also a special menu for those literate in Chinese. If not, have no fear - ask your waiter for some suggestions.
