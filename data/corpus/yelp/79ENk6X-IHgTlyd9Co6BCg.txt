Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I am not sold on this place. The food was tasty and the side dishes were very well prepared but I just didn't taste a DRASTIC difference in the quality of the meat. Maybe my taste is not very well honed for Korean BBQ, but I've eaten at other places and it seemed on par with this place and a substantially lower price as long as you can stand a little smoke and a little more self service.. . Pros: Clean, not all too crowded, service is good, salad is good, servers help you cook. . Cons: Kind of expensive for me to go out of my way to eat again, for four guys you are looking to spend over 100$ for a good experience, had to ask quite a few times for refills on things (they seemed a little frugal). . Bottom line: If you don't feel like stuffing yourself and are okay with spending about 10$ more than you would at a typical all you can eat KBBQ buffet to get better quality meat and service, then this is your place.
