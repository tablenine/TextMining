Restaurant: Einstein&#39;s
Category: American (New)
What a disaster. Quiet patio space? You are kidding me. Maybe in 1954 it was a quiet patio but there is a busy highway running the length of the patio, a dusty busy noisy road. There is a high rise building under construction directly across the street. Not enough noise for you? No problem, the restaurant pumps annoying rock music out through cheap speakers onto the "quiet patio". And the manager does not care, when I asked about indoor seating, she said to me, "It's even louder in there." And you should also know about the slow service, mediocre food, and impolite, uncaring staff. Sorry Einstein, I call 'em as I see 'em....strike three and you are out Einstein.
