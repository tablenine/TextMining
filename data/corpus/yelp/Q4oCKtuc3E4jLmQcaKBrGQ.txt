Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place always has a line and I had not had to opportunity to eat here in about 20 years. I was in the area, had time and was mad hungry so we went. Still a long line, but that's ok.. . The food was amazing, almost as good as I remember it being. We each got 2 tacos, I got a burrito and we shared some rice. Everything was absolutely perfect. I loved every bite. I know it will not be aother 20 years before I go there again.
