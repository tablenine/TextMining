Best. Chinese Food. EVER. (did I mention EVER?). . Their staff is VERY friendly and they are magical at remembering names. . . The food is SOOOOO fresh and tasty! I used to go here several times a week when I lived in Atlanta - I'd always bring friends here, too. . . It's so reasonably priced, the food is terrific, and I just love it. Everything is good. No, really....everything. . . Dang, all these Atlanta reviews are making me want to go home.
