Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I just walked out of Umami Burger. I was by myself and they sat me at the "bar-" a depressing dark little cramped room where you sit facing a dark blank wall.  Not my idea of atmosphere, so I walked back out and asked the guy behind the counter if it was okay if I sat outside, and he replied very snottily "I'm helping another customer, I'll be right with you." So I left and no one there seemed to care. . . I'm tired of these trendy gimmicky places in LA that are so successful they feel like they can treat their customers as if they are lucky to be there.  Well, Umami, you should feel lucky to have me because now I'll tell all my friends and all of yelp what jerks you have working there. For my money, I'll go somewhere without the attitude.
