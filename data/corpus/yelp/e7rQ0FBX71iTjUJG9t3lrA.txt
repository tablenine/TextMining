Restaurant: So Kong Dong
Category: Korean
With 47 reviews already for So Kong Dong, there's not too much more I can add. This was my first experience with Korean food, and I thought it was AWESOME. The highlight of the meal is definitely the free appetizers. Everything was delicious: the fried fish was piping hot and fresh (watch out for the bones!), and the kimchi had the perfect amount of crunch and spice.. . I ordered the seafood tofu soup, and my mom opted for the Korean BBQ and bibimbap combo. I enjoyed the soup, but there wasn't much seafood in it. There was a TON of tofu, and I actually had half a bowl of nothing but soft tofu left after I finished the broth. Next time I'm definitely going to see if they can put less tofu and more soup broth. Because I didn't eat the entire pound of tofu, I didn't leave overly stuffed, and I'm grateful. My mom's combo was ginormous, but she raved about it: great flavor of the meat and delicious sliced veggies and crusty rice at the bottom of Â the bibimbap hot dish.. . Our bill came out to around $20 for dinner - a steal!!! From the outside, I did not expect such a pleasing, clean interior, and I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. Our server spoke good English and helped explain several of the dishes (menu descriptions are minimal). . . A big thanks to all of the Yelpers for their helpful reviews of So Kong Dong. I knew exactly what to expect, where to find the place, and what kind of menu items to try. I highly recommend this restaurant, and Korean has become a fast new favorite of mine!
