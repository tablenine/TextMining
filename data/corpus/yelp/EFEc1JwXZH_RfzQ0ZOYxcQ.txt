A trip to the ATL isn't complete without a stop at the Dirty South's best Chinese. As a New Yorker we think it rivals - and often outshines - Chinatown's best (and far pricier) options. Order off the menu and grab some Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Sauteed Pea Shoots or Pan-fried Frog Legs. The short ribs are redolent of slow-ccoked 5-spice masterpieces of China 'Yore.. Down side is the brutally bright overhead lighting and potential long wait.
