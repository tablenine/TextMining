Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
If Father's Office didn't have a seating policy that I fear will one day incite a riot, or just a really good fist-fight, it would be four stars. But as a person who isn't typically competitive, standing around waiting for a seat and watching more competition pour in through the door is pretty much my worst nightmare.. . My boyfriend, who's from New York and is more accustomed to bullshit like this, didn't seem as bugged as I was. I always resent tap-dancing for my meal, though, because nearly nothing is that good.. . Eventually, a kind stranger offered his seat. And.... . Father's Office is not THAT good.. . Don't get me wrong: the burger was delicious and juicy, the sweet potato fries were crispy and I'd like to bathe in the blue cheese dip. It's solidly delicious food.. . But is it worth all the trouble we had to go to to get it? No. I can go to the Bowery on Sunset and get their blue cheese burger, which is infinitely better, and I don't have to fight anyone for a table to get it.. . Glad to cross it off my list, and I'd be back if I were in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
