Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
i can't tell you how much i love the alcove... i love the outdoor patio... the mimosas... the desserts... it's just such a wonderful place to go to experience sunny southern california. . i have 2 issues with alcove... . 1. it sucks to wait in a long ass line in the hot sun.. 2. the breakfast sucks. the potatoes really suck and the eggs are ALWAYS overcooked... as in brown crispy parts. yucky. . but if you have enough mimosas, you won't give a damn... . then move the party on down to the ye rustic inn... what a blissful day...
