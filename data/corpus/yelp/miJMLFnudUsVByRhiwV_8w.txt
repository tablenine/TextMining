Upon entering this restaurant, I really enjoyed the decidedly masculine decor throughout the restaurant.  Modern, clean lines... stone... dark wood.  We were led downstairs to the lower level and were taken to our table.  I was impressed that although we were seated relatively closely to two other tables, the music that filtered through the room was at a level just loud enough to keep you from listening to the tables next to you, but quiet enough that I never felt I had to raise my voice to be heard.  In other words, the music created a feeling of privacy in a room full of people.  Well done!. . Then there's the food.  As soon as we sat down, a server came out with biscuits, fresh out of the oven still on the baking sheet.  The sweet butter for the biscuits was perfect.. . We decided to go with the prix fixe menu.  You get a soup or salad starter, with a main course and dessert for $32.  Not a bad deal at all.  My friend had the scallops with asparagus risotto, which I tried.  While they weren't the absolute best scallops I've had, they were pretty darn good.  I had the crab cakes... and I would have to say that they may have been the best crab cakes I've had.  They came with two sauces, which were very good, but honestly - I only tasted the sauces a couple times because the crab cakes themselves were so fantastic I didn't want to mask the taste at all.  . . Our server, Kelsey, was fantastic - and I'm so glad she recommended the crab cakes, because I was about to go with the filet mignon.  I'm sure the steak would have been good, but seriously - I've never had a crab cake this good.  . . I'll definitely be back!
