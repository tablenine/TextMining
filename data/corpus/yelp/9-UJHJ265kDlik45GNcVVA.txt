DAMN FINE EATS! First of all, it's ard to me NOT to love any meat product, but whether it's slicing into Lala's Entrana steak (so delicately marinated), or devouring their Suprema Napolitana chicken cutlets (smothered in  melted cheese) - then even with my lactose intolerance I'm as close to extasy as mere food allows.. . I also suggest sampling their empanadas - tasty pockets of beef, chicken or spinach...  I'm looking forward to going back ;)
