Restaurant: Zuma Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Ever since moving to Inman Park I have been a big fan of Zuma Sushi.  Though they stopped the all you can eat sushi lunch I still enjoy coming for lunch and dinner alike.  The seafood they use always tastes fresh despite being five hours from the nearest ocean.  The wait staff is always friendly and eager to assist.  The decor is a dark red and black which sets for a calm and relazed enviroment to enjoy yourself.  Ya like sushi ya like cool asian decor ya like Zuma.
