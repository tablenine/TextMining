Restaurant: Mary Mac&#39;s Tea Room
Category: Southern
A staple from my youth - the meat and three lives on even now with Mary Mac's.  The no frills, down home country cooking restaurant has been around for more than 60 years.  . . The wait staff is full of southern hospitality, but it can be sporadic.  Personally, I take this in as part of the place's charm.  The walls are littered with historical pictures of Atlanta and the tables are spread out and they can accommodate a large party.  If you are in Midtown and you are looking for some Southern fare, stop on in.  Sweet Tea is served in a non-stop flow of sugary goodness, but they keep unsweet on hand just in case a freak like me should happen in...but usually by the end of the meal, my waitress has seen fit to start pouring Sweet to the whole table to ease her pain...I don't mind.. . My favorites are the Country Fried Steak (or Swiss Steak it was called in my youth) along with some fried okra and mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  On the side you can get little corn muffins and Parker House rolls (that never seem to quit).  If you are up for it, have some Fried Green Tomatoes to start.  Skip the mac 'n cheese and go for some squash casserole or black eyed peas.
