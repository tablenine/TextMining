Look, I realize there's some dispute on the matter here. But allow me to state, categorically, this place does not deserve a line every night. . . It is PASSABLE Cuban food that is considerably overpriced with an ambiance that lies somewhere between Sharky's and El Torito that just finally got their B back out front.. . Okay fine, one star for the energetic waiters in white. And another for the decent Cuban beer. But that's where I stop. Cause when it comes to the food, frankly? It's just not that good. Their sandwiches are half as good as Porto Cuban bakery and their pork can't hold a candle to places in the valley.. . So it's my considered opinion that other people standing on line must be there for something other than Cuban food. Maybe it's puppies. Or human growth hormone. Or Blockbuster coupons. . . That's the only rational answer. Otherwise, it's just admitting that, in a city with tremendous discretion when it comes to Mexican food, we just can't somehow tell the difference when we say the rice and beans are from land of Ricky Ricardo and not Pancho Villa.
