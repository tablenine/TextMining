Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Visit: 4/23/09 - Had Dinner.  Ate the pork dumplings, shrimp fried rice and fish dumplings.. . Shrimp Fried Rice was good.  A little salty and pricy.  Pork dumplings were okay.  I had better at my local Chinese restaurant.  Don't eat the fish dumplings.  It's like eating cardboard.  No taste at all.  I couldn't tell that I was eating fish.  . . Service was good.. . Price here is expensive for dumplings that taste like cardboard.  I suggest going to have dim sum some where would be much better.. . I will not come back here.
