Apparently being a chronically late whore has it's downfalls.. . My group got there around 6 and I got there around 8. There was a freakin line! I assumed that the line was for a table so I walked up to the bouncer and said.... . me: Oh. I don't need to stand in line. My party is right there. (do you know who i am?). bouncer: You still need to stand in line. Â . me: ........what do you mean? you see that white boy waving me down? That's my table. (let me in you prick). bouncer: yea. ok. everyone else in line has friends inside too. we're at capacity.. me: ...........(i hate you and i hope you burn in hell). . epic fail.. . Luckily the outside line went fast and I was able to order a nice juicy burger medium rare and sweet potato fries with zero bar line (maybe hence the reason for the outside line...ohhhhhh.) . . The outside setting was cool. The heat lamps worked yO! I couldn't even tell that I was outside. The patrons are young, hot, and professional. You could pick up a dick or three. . . The food came quickly and OMG... the burger was good. Simple but good. I only had sp fries at the Counter and I was highly anticipating the infamous shopping cart fries esp since i knew our party brought ketchup which brings me to epic fail #2.. . me: where's the ketchup?. eli: oh. we ate it all. here's some mayo packets.. me: ............i'm not white.. . Somewhere down the line. someone commented on how cute the shopping carts were and how much he/she wanted one. So my brilliant ass devised a plan.. . me: OK. Since we're sitting on the balcony. let's drop the cart on the ground.. *drops cart on floor*. others: ....... and then what? . me: oh. ummm. i didn't' think that far. :( i was just hoping it'd roll down the parking lot.. . F A I L.. . I suck at life :-/
