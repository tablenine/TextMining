I ordered the soup of the day which was vegetable soup and a chicken caesar salad. The soup was alright but they could have done better with the salad. How do you mess up a caesar salad? Well if you put too much dressing and over- spice the chicken, you can mess it up pretty bad. My friend ordered a New York strip medium well and got medium rare instead. I give this place 4 stars for the decor and excellent service.
