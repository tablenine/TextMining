Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Good food + Crap service =  go somewhere else.....  . . I hate to say it, but sometimes things are not as good as the original.  I went to Jerry's about 30 days ago and really wanted to write this review back then but have been putting it off. . . We walked in and all the tables were full. We  were seated in about five or ten mins.  We placed orders for beers and looked over the menu which seemed to offer a bit too many choices in my opinion.  We ordered our lunch and waited for our beers to arrive.  In the course thirty mins the server kept coming over to tell us that the Belgian beers are on their way. (from Belgium I assumed) Literally forty mins and we had our first  drinks and after another forty our food was brought to the table.  The server again apologized and told us that they are so busy and don't have enough help.  He also said  the beers were on him.   . . At what point does a manager make a decision to seat as many people as the place can hold and provide shi**y service rather than seat only the amount of people you can serve well?  (restaurant management 101) . . We did want to order a second round of beers, but we were afraid that there weren't enough hours in the day left.
