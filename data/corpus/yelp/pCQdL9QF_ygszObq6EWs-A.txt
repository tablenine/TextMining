The food here is good maybe a little overpriced.  The mood is fun, kinda loud and not really college, rowdy loud but more like the parents get a night out loud.  The beer here is why we go.  The beer selection is very good and the staff is very knowledgeable about what they serve.  Just ask the waiter/ waitress questions about their large beer selection and it's hard to make a bad choice.  . . The one in Newport Beach sports brighter lighting and the location in Long Beach seems to attract a party crowd.  . . Cheers!
