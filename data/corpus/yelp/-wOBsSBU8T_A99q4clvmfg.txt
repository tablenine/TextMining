FINALLY got around to hipster sausage. Bfs bday, and he wanted rattlesnake. OK!! . . Waited in line for half an hour, I got the mango jalapeno sausage and an organic edel weiss (best beer ever!!) And fries with pesto mayo and blue cheese bacon. . . Beer was like... tainted or something. Bartender agreed and gave me a new beer, no q's asked.. Sausage was yummy but I couldn't really taste anything under all those onions n peppers. Next time ill get em on the side.. Fries were BOMB. Esp with my friends chipotle aioli and the bacon blue cheese. . . Service was great, but you're really just kind of on your own. Its really busy, packed and LOUD. But fun and yummy ;o
