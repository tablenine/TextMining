as one reviewer said we did wait quite awhile for our burgers, in their defense they were quite busy and being open for only two days i imagine they are still working the kinks out.  when the food did come my burger came first with the promise my wife's was close behind.  i was a little annoyed at first, but we had agreed to share our two burgers (truffle burger and stilton and port burger) so we just shared the truffle one first.  5 min later two more burgers came, the waiter apologized for the kitchen mix-up and comped the 'extra' burger.  . the quality of the meat was amazing, some of the most flavorful ground beef i've ever had.  it was juicy, cooked perfectly and the bun was easily the best bun i've ever had on a burger.  we also ordered the hand cut fries and the sweet potato chips - both very good.  the house made ketchup was also great.  and for dessert those of you who are not familiar with cake monkey should get familiar right quick.  amazing cakes and cookies.  add to that nice touches like the mexican coke and i thought it was fantastic.  sure i would have liked my food quicker and at the same time as my wife, but the food and the apologetic staff really made up for it.  i'll be going back for sure.
