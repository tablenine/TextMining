Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Nothing but good things to say about this place. It's a Gem. I came here last night to try their taco's and damn they are addictive. I ended up eating six fish tacos and drinking two drinks of Jamaica. Their salsa bar is awesome and I recommend the "Pineapple Kiss" salsa it's really good. In my opinion the fish tacos here taste better than Rubio's, Baja Fresh, and even Wahoo's. It's the most authentic fish taco you can get here in Los Angeles without having to cross the border. . . If you're craving fish tacos, this is the place to go get your fix.
