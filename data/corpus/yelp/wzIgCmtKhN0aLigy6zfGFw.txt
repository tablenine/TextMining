Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
We had reservations at 6:30pm however we were caught in the rain and traffic so we had to adjust our reservation for 7:00pm. The staff was very accommodating and was able to seat us promptly upon arrival. I requested the garden area and it was just as magical as I had imagined (even with the closed off ceiling due to rain). If your looking for a good sushi roll I would recommend the Hawaii Five O roll the flavors were unique and light; simply delish! The restaurant does not have a dress code and valet is only $7.50 on a sat night. The view at night was spectacular...the city lights illuminated the horizon and Yamashiro had a front row seat. I would definitely go back during the day to explore their outdoor pagoda bar. A must see in the Hollywood Hills.
