We came in not knowing what to expect. We stood at the door waiting for a host. . And the waiter told jokingly welcome but you need to find a seat wherever the hell you see a seat. We order to start the chili con queso. I order the rib-eye special which come on a sizzling skillet with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms. My roomie had the Bacon cheeseburger with fries.. we order a drink it vodka citron with sprite. ..WOW IT WAS SUPER STRONG...we know they not stingy with liquor. This place is the bomb the staff was extra friendly. I will be back. The flatiron sizzling steak special they offer it everyday for 13.75 but they only have so many the meat comes in fresh everyday so if they run out ...then its out. She told me they only get in about 5 steaks a day, so the meat is fresh never sits a day to resale.. I know if it was not for YELP I would have never ever went into this place,, I would have thought it was just a bar, since I not a heavy drinker I would not have visited this place. Certainly I would not have thought this was place that serve good food., but in reality it serves awesome food.
