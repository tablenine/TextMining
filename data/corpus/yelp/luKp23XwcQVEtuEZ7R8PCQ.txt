Restaurant: Rodan
Category: Nightlife
Rodan for brunch is great- interesting menu, fast service and super reasonable prices. The only downside is that is usually reeks of the prior night which isn't exactly pleasant first thing in the morning.. . I don't really care for Rodan, the bar. It was so loud the last time I was there I was hoarse from yelling to be heard. Or maybe I'm just getting old. The mirrors in the bathroom were pretty cool, though.
