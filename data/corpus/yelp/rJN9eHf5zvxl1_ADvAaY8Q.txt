Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This place is not just a meal, but an experience. The Old English theme makes the meat taste even better. You start off with a Spinning Bowl Salad, which has the most delicious dressing and mix of greens, I could eat three of those. The Yorkshire pudding is also great, goes well with the leftover juices from your Flintstones sized steak. I'd suggest Creamed corn and spinach as your sides, but delicious. And for the Meat..... . SO TENDER, JUICY, AND FLAVORFUL.. . The best prime rib I've ever had, by far.. . (PS, don't get filled up on mini meatballs)
