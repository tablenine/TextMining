Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Food:  good but not super.  overpriced.  you have to wait too long to get a seat here.  the name of the restaurant has a lot of power.  take that away and i think this place is clearly just ok 7/10. . Service:  not the best. . Parking:  ok. lots of parking spaces everywhere but also lots of people everywhere so it can get hard
