This is one of the places I always miss when I go away to college.  After a few weeks I get severe cravings for something from Porto's.  I'm always amazed by how well trained the staff is there, they know where all the pastries are and they can memorize all the things you want to buy and they'll box it up and your order will be ready in no time. . . The only problem is the line.  You can wait over half an hour if you go during a busy time.  But believe me, the pastries and the sandwiches are worth it.  (The pastries are much better than the sandwiches though)
