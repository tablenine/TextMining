I am going to have a Golden Girls moment...picture it, Inman Park Festival, rainy weather, need for a coffee, hour wait and two cup of coffee the entire brunch!. . I am having mixed feelings about my mixed review.  The food is always spot on at this place but the service/overall experience was so bad that I am not sure what to do (of course, this is not the Nobel peace prize so I should not take myself too seriously).  We probably waited a good fifteen to twenty minutes from the time we sat down until the time the waitress took our first round of orders.  After ordering, coffee took an additional ten minutes and refills were like trying to get gas during the 1973 gas embargo.  The whole room was also very dirty (the menus looked wadded up drafts of bad manuscripts that found there way to the circular file.    . . Now, drum-roll, here is the kick in the family jewels...they added an 18% gratuity to the bill.  We were a party of five, not like the TV show, as much as we tried.  When we saw the gratuity already in the bill, I asked to see a menu and there was NOWHERE that indicated that there would be a gratuity at all, let alone for tables of five.. . The food was good, not excellent.  The fruit plate was awesome and a different for Atlanta.  I had the breakfast burrito sans all the good stuff that makes it worthwhile (cheese and yokes).. . We got there at 12:00 to get our names on the list, were seated by 12:30, had our first cup of coffee at 1:10ish and we did not get out of there until 2:40...we are just lucky I was not on the six o'clock (or 6:08, 6:16, 6:24) news.
