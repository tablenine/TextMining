Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Minus one star because it didn't have the rumpus room feel like the Gower location does. Ordered the #1, tasted the same as the other Roscoe's. The only thing that really stood out to me was the maple syrup. That sweet nectar from the waffle gods made me want to finish my plate even though my pants button was on the verge of popping off. . . Please do not waste anybody's time and only come here if you are famished (or stoned).
