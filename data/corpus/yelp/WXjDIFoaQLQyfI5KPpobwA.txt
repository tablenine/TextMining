Maggie R. first took me here after talking it up for about a month.  We finally made it, and I was not at all disappointed.  The ordering was a little different, but pretty fun.  You get to pick out the type of meat you want, the bun, cheese, condiments, and any extras as well.  We also ordered a milkshake.  We sat at the bar, so we could experience all the care and devotion it takes to pump out an amazingly delicious milkshake.  Each one is hand-prepped, and takes about 5-7 minutes to make.  It is SO worth the wait though...mmmmmmm.   We started with fries as an appetizer, and they were a delectable tease to what we were about to experience with our burgers.  Mine was heavenly.  Maggie R. loved hers too.  They were super messy, but that's what utensils are for.  I cannot wait to go back.
