Restaurant: The Nook On Piedmont Park
Category: American (Traditional)
There is really only one word for this place  (The NOOK = DIASTER). The patio is crowed and always noisy/loud/and full of obnoxious drunk softball/kickball players. The food is at best mediocre. Who wants to go out and eat tater tots? If I wanted tater tots I would have stayed home!!!  The current owners are the same ones that tried SUTRA. Look where that is. Do yourself a favor, stay home and cook your tater tots yourself. This place looks like a double wide trailer from the outside.
