This place is such a pain to get into because it's always crowded and you have to wait at least 30 minutes unless you're super early.  But once you're in, the tapas are great, so I GUESS it's worth it.  The paella was really good, wish I could've had a bigger portion.  Don't forget to bring your own wine.
