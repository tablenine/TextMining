Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
Oh, how I love thee! Italian food is my favorite and Alfredo's did not disappoint. The aroma of garlic greets you as you enter the restaurant. There is a small bar area when you walk in which can cause a bottle neck if it's a busy night. We made a reservation for 8p on a Friday night and it was a packed house. We were fortunate to nab a couple of seats at the bar when a couple near us was being seated. I enjoyed a class of Estancia Cabernet which I thought was reasonably priced. . . When the other person in our party arrived, we were promptly seated. From that moment on, everything was wonderful. The garlic bread was warm, buttery and slathered with garlic. Yum! I ordered a house salad, eggplant parmesan with a side of pasta and two meatballs. I was in heaven! The eggplant was tender, but firm and the sauce, or gravy as my Italian friends call it, was thick and flavorful. I enjoyed every last bite. The meatballs were also excellent. Just the right amount of seasoning and they were moist. For dessert, I ordered the custard over caramel - it was okay - should have went with the spumoni which was again, excellent. . . I love the unpretentious atmosphere; the friendliness of the staff; excellent service and delicious food. Alfredo's won my heart for down home Italian dining.
