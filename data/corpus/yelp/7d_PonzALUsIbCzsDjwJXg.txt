For the amount I spent on two entrees, I could have eaten about 5 decent meals at a lot of other places. I don't see what the big deal is, unless we're talking about the dessert. They have a $10 chocolate dessert that was DIVINE (but still, $10? I don't know about that).. . Other than that, not impressed. I went for just dessert with a friend, but ordered take-out to bring home to my boyfriend, and they brought the take-out BEFORE THE DESSERT! That's just ridiculous, considering I wanted it at the end of the meal in order for ultimate heat retention to be achieved.. . And then the food itself wasn't all that great. Sweet and sour chicken was at least 3x more than it would have been anywhere else, but 3x less good (okay, that's an exaggeration, but it definitely wasn't as good). Kung pao beef was a little better, but $19?!?!? Are they serious? At those prices, and with the decor of the place, I was expecting a lot more. Although, after looking through these other reviews, I shouldn't have been expecting much more. Oh well, you live and you learn.
