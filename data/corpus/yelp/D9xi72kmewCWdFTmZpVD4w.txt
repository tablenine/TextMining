This place is delightful. We went on a Saturday night and were seated right away. They have an interesting beer selection and the prices are great. The cornbread muffins are the best I have ever had in my whole life, and they gave us seconds! . I had the crabcakes with spinach and mashed potatoes. I ate every bite and wished I had more spinach, the flavors were really vibrant and delicious. My companion had a steak and "special potatoes" and collard greens. The special potatoes were identical to my mashed potatoes but good nonetheless. All that food and two beers for $40. Not bad for a Saturday night downtown.
