OK, this place is usually pretty good, but wow, I went on weekday evening and the waitress with black/blond hair was among the the most "don't give a $h!t" I have ever encountered. If you see her, leave.  She got my order wrong and didn't care or even pretend to. What I got (and the dish my wife tried to eat) simply  tasted bad; not that the waitress would know because she didn't ask, even when I returned my meal for wrong and missing ingredients. Been here many times and have been satisfied, but this was so bad. Maybe it is the weekday evening staff. The woman with red hair and glasses and the blond bearded guy with clever t-shirts are great, but this one night with the above described waitress was truly disappointing and would have been insulting if the cook (who tended to our table more than the waitress) wasn't so pleasant. BYOB is cool and maybe you'll get better service on a weeknight if you are a bearded hipster.
