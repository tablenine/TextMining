You can't go wrong with Sunday Brunch at Over Easy Cafe. The food is outstanding. I've usually been obsessed with one Brunch stop in Wicker Park for years but I think I maybe expanding my horizons! I've just found out about this great place and will go back again. I had the Hurraches dish and I can't complain one bit about it. My friends and I ate off of each other plates tasting all the goodness this place has to offer. We shared the French Toast with Raspberry and Peaches as a dessert to our savory brunch. What I didn't like was the wait and maybe they should think about expanding. Kudos to the hostess for keeping up everyone's spirits and hunger with some cheerful chats. I did slightly feel like maybe we were being rushed out the door but with a line as long as they had I really could not blame them. I'm going back again and again!
