Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Paul and I decided to check out Ugo, this great Italian wine bar/cafe located in downtown Culver City. Moderately priced, the servings were large and well worth it. . The pomegranate juice is so fresh and delicious! We started by sharing a caprese salad. It was wonderful. I ordered the Omelet Bolognese with red roasted potatoes, I love it. I want to go back and order the same dish. and Paul had the dynamite pizza.... I recommend it, was so good.. For dessert we decide for the gelato... the vanilla crunch mmmmm. I would highly recommend you checking this spot out.
