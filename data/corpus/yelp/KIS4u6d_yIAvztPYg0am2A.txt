Restaurant: Ruen Pair Restaurant
Category: Thai
Tried Ruen Pair for the first time last night, and I plan on definitely coming back.  We ordered Won Ton Soup (5.50), Tom Yum Goong (6.95), Pad Thai (5.50), 2 Morning Glory w/ Fried Pork (4.95), 1 Beef Jerky , &amp;1 Pork Jerky.  Favorite dishes of the night were Morning Glory w/ fried pork, and the pork jerky.  Only downside is it's cash only, but they're open  super late 4AM! . . --If only there was a Ruen Pair in the valley
