I say the food was average for how much they charge per plate. Yeah, you can't really complain for $6 dishes, but I don't know what the hype is about this place. The red curry dish was watered down and not that flavorable. The pad thai was just ok, but you can't really go wrong w/ pad thai. Kind of disappointed, but we paid $23 for 2 people.
