I don't eat on this side of town too often. But hot diggity damn. The BFF introduced me to this place. Walking in and looking at the menu, the Chipotle Barbecue Chicken salad called out to me. When they brought it out, it was a thing of beauty. . http://static.px.yelp.....  When I took a bite I realized that not only was it beautiful, it was extremely delicious as well. . . I'm going to have to try some other things on the menu because the salad was fantastic and I'm sure the rest of it will be as well.
