Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Another one of those "overrated" places because it's talked about a lot but I am sure there is probably a place that isn't as clean and the food tastes just as great+lower prices. However, because the prices don't mind to me, I love this place!. . The food is great. Very delicious and it hits the right spot. BUT.. . it doesn't make me scream of satisfaction but it's good enough to make me want more and more. This restaurant is located in a safe and clean community, it's in a plaza and it's surrounded by a bakery, a dessert spot, and a tea spot. Very comfortable seating and clean. I love coming here when suggested. My parents often take my sister and I here for dinner because they love it too. One of the family's favorite spots to have dinner : ). . I'm not giving this place the complete 5 stars because of what I wrote in the beginning. My aunt takes me to a different dumpling house that is just as great, not as comfortable as Din Tai Fung but the prices are lower and the food is just as great. Let me find out what that place is called and come back to update my review so you all can try it and save a few bucks!
