I have a feeling I will be coming back again and again to this local spot - you can't beat all-day breakfast! Unfortunately they close at 3pm. The bf ordered the b.l.a.t. which was just delish. I had a half order of the french toast which was ok - a little on the soggy side, but still good. The service was friendly and the place itself is really cute/hip. I especially loved the menu layout. Glad I finally tried this place out!
