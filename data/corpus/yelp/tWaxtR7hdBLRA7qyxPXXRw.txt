I'm not really sure why there are so many good reviews for this place. I not saying the food was bad. The portions were very large, and I guess the prices arent bad, but really it was nothing special. A step above Olive Garden, but several large steps below Cafe Spaiggia. Whoever says its the best in the city probably hasnt been out of Logan Square.
