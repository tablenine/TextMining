Category: Bakeries
This Alon's location is the only reason why I envy OTPers, no offense ;). . This location is better than the Highlands location in every aspect.  First of all, the interior looks gorgeous!  I liked the warm and cozy feeling of the place.  I also realized that they offer more options for food; they even offered "Grab-and-Go" salads - which doesn't exist in the Highlands location.  But what I loved the most was their gelato section.  Seriously, a gelato bar at Alon's?  You gotta be kidding me.  Why isn't there one in the Highlands location?  Why do they make me drive all the way to Perimeter Mall area?  Anyways, they have many mouth-watering flavors, which are all equally delicious, but hazelnut flavor is my all-time favorite.. . On top of all that, they have friendly staff who are willing to help you in any way possible.  I tried every gelato flavors before I got my cup of hazelnut flavor, but the lady did not show any sign of unpleasantness.  They also had no problem describing a certain product that was in foreign languages as well.. . Only if this location was closer to my house... But then again, that would be too good to be true.  Sigh.
