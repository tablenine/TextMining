The best sushi in LA for the price- hand's down. This no-frills, cash-only establishment doesn't accept reservations and almost always has a wait. Go straight to the whiteboard by the cash register to put your name down, and designate "t" (table) "s" (sushi bar) or "t/s" (first available). . . I've never had a bad piece of fish here. The salmon is like butter and the yellowtail belly is to die for. As another Yelper mentioned, the monk fish liver is surprisingly delish. Soft and rich and creamy. And if you're in the mood for sweet shrimp, it's as fresh as it comes (the sushi chef went into the kitchen and returned with the victims- antennae still moving about). And do NOT pass up the deep-fried heads that follow. I know, it sounds horrid, but it's deep fried! How is that ever bad? Hot, oily, salty and crunchy. A wonderful follow-up to the cold, soft, sweet shrimp. . . Bring a lump of cash- I rarely get out of there without spending less than $50 for my portion. Worth every penny, though, and downright reasonable for the selection and quality. My only complaint is they aren't open late enough.
