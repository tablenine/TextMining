Came here on Thursday night with a group of five, one of my friends is affiliated with the sorority that was organizing the event.  The place still seems to be a huge hotspot in Hollywood, although I think it was just because the turnout for the event was so high. We actually had to wait around 30-40 minutes to get in because we ended up getting there so late around 11:30 or so.  The crowd outside seemed to be almost 90% Asian with a good overall girl/guy.  . . The decor inside is pretty modern, and it kind of reminded me of Blowfish Sushi, but with a much more lively crowd and much better dance-floor setup.  There is a round shaped dance-floor that has a level above which is entirely open to the dance space below.  I liked that it wasn't overly packed on the dance-floor and you'd have enough space to move around without being bumped into too much.  The bar which is on the entrance side, is seemingly big enough to accommodate the entire place.  . . I actually had a lot of fun dancing and socializing for a couple hours.  And luckily we had partied at my friends place before coming so I didn't have to spend much on drinks. The whole Hollywood experience never fails to satisfy your need to wildly party.  As far as the food goes, I have no idea but I usually steer clear from eating at restaurants that turn into nightclubs.
