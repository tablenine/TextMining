Finally came here after reading raving reviews about the Hainan chicken. My date said she's been coming here for a while. . . Our order: . . 2 Hainan chicken . 1 small garden salad . 1 chicken broth . 1 shrimp rolls . . Salad was just okay. Nothing special. I thought the chicken broth was bland. Shrimp roll is a shrimp roll. Now, the Hainan chicken was something else. SO moist and tender. Dipped in ginger sauce and a spoon full of flavored rice was heaven. It also came with chili sauce and soy based sauce. Also good but ginger sauce was my fav. . . I told my date that she was a cheap date as my bill came at $31 without tip. The service was great. Will come back.
