This place is awesome! I always get what's obviously in their title, chicken and waffles. The waffles are huge and the chicken is always crispy and juicy. Be prepared to wait a bit, especially on the weekends, more importantly on Sundays. Space seems to always be limited here but that's just because of the high demand of people wanting to eat here. Definitely coming back on back on a regular basis!
