This is easily one of my favoritest brunch places in the city!. . Everything on the menu looks AMAZING.  The prices are decent compared to other brunch places (around $10 a plate) and it's such a cute tiny little place.  It does get pretty busy on the weekends and wait times can get up to over an hour but they do offer free coffee for those who are waiting :). . El Gordito's Corn Cakes:  two yummy corn pancakes made with actual corn!, a side of eggs done your way, two thick slices of ham and a roasted red pepper sauce. One-of-a-kind-cant-find-this-anywhere-else-mmm-mmm good!. . Sassy Eggs:  this dish has almost everything you would find on an order of nachos - cheese, sour cream, guacamole -  but throw in some potatoes and chorizo and cover it all up with 2 eggs and you have yourself one of the best savory brunch dishes of all time!  My cousin ordered this and Im so glad I got a chance to try it!  Almost wished I'd gotten that too in addition to my corn cakes....but that would have been too gluttonous!  Better to just share (or mooch off someone else's plate if they aren't willing)!. . And definitely get the freckled OJ (orange juice with strawberries) - you won't regret it!. . Tip:  Ask the hostess if you can sit at the bar if the wait is outrageous :)
