My wife and I finally decided to try the much-touted 'only certified organic restaurant in the midwest' Crust the other night. We ordered takeout, so my review is based only on their food.  Since their flatbreads only serve 1-2 people, we ordered both the mexicali blues and the basilica.  The mexicali blues was burned at the edges and the shrimp had not been de-veined.  The basilica was better, but tasted pretty much the same as Panera's Crispani (cheaper and slightly larger).  The total for both flatbreads with tax was around $26 - a high price to pay for glorified personal pizzas.  Then again, you are also paying for the trendiness of eating organic, which although admirable, cannot serve as the restaurant's only selling point. In the end, we were neither impressed nor disappointed with the food at Crust. . .just 'eh.'
