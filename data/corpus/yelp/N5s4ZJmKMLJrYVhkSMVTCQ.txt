I really had the impression that this restaurant would resonate the soul and feel of the hawaiian life-i forget that it's a franchise and sits in the heart of the city. NO your not going to find freshly tanned people with friendly smiles at every corner, fresh coconut smell of sunblock lingering around you, or Â coconut drinks awaiting for you to sip, but you will discover amazing flavors, fresh seafood, and tantaliizing presentations of their dishes.. . I went here twice and loved each dish that I ordered. I forget the name of them, but I stand by my word when I say any meal you have here is DELICIOUS!!!!! Granted I only had two different dishes, but everyone that shared a table with me ordered something different and was very much surprised as well as satisfied with their order. . . They serve good portions; enough for your stomach to smile but still give you the energy to enjoy the remainder of the day. It's reasonably priced and they offer a variety of selections-for those who are vegetarians, to meat eaters, to the i don't know...what's the latest fad right now goers:)
