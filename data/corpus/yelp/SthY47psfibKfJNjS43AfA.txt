My favorite dishes to order are:. . - Teba-saki chicken wings, extra spicy (which really isn't spicy). . - Fried baby shrimp (yes, you can eat these little suckers whole). . - Hanpen cheese (a mind melting mix of hot, fatty fish, cheese &amp; salty goodness!)                                           . . - Oh, and a glass of Calpico please!. . The wait is usually long, expect at least 30 minutes.  Well worth it... but maybe not so much a good idea if you're going there on a completely empty stomach, unless you don't mind torturing yourself!  . . Mmmmmm, must... have... Furaibo...
