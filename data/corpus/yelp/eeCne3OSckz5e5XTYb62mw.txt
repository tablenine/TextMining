Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I went here with a group for my moms birthday. Definitely a special occasion type of restaurant cause the prices are very high. The service was amazing, anytime we needed anything it came right to us within the minute. the waiter takes your orders with an electronic thingy so the moment we ordered sodas they came right out. The staff definitely worked hard for their tips. The atmosphere is very nice, the decorations are great. Its definitely not boring. I ordered the surf and turf, the fillet minon was great, cooked exactly as i ordered it, medium rare. the crab was alright, I've had better. The bagna calda wasn't all that great. but for $4.95 I'm not complaining, but i wouldn't order it again. there wasn't much flavor. the infamous garlic ice cream was not bad. i dont think I'd order it, but it wasn't disgusting like you'd think. we got it for free because we had a birthday at the table. I'd definitely go here again, but only for a special occasion. the bill for a table of 5 was $380. each having ordered a soda and meal only...
