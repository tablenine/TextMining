I don't have a huge list of phobias.  Spiders don't bother me, I think mice are cute and while I don't love heights, I wouldn't way I'm scared of them either.  I am terrified of not being able to move my arms and legs (as in my brother wrapped me in a blanket and sat on me) and I HATE snakes.  Terrified of them.  When I see them in the zoo I'm afraid one might have escaped and be silently stalking me between the cages.  I'm Serious!!!!. . So, it may come as a surprise that i can make an exception.  Even though I don't necessarily approve of matadors either....  ;). . Turns out two negatives can make a big positive when it comes to food, ambiance and decor.   I've loved cobras and matadors since the day it opened its tiny little eatery on Beverly.  The little dishes are Delicious.  I always get the sweet potato fries (and they come with mayo!!! I love mayo with fries! waist line be dammed!)  I love to eat off other people's plates and Tapas is the perfect excuse.  I don't even have to ask "um... do you mind?"  I can just go for it!!!  . . You do have to buy your wine next door, but who cares. really?  does it matter where you got it when you are happily at your table pouring your third glass??  ***3/28/08 ***CORRECTION!!  I've heard that they serve wine and beer on site now, but you can still bring your own if you like. . . I've never gotten out of here in under two and half hours, and it isn't because the service is slow.  It's because I'm always having so much fun!!!!!. . Yes, you might have to wait a few minutes to be seated, it IS noisy. However, I think you'll love every minute of it.
