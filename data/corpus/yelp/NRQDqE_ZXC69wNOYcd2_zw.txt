The food is pricey but the 8 dollar margaritas are worth it. If anything, I'll probably just come back for that. I don't think my enchiladas were worth the price either, I could probably get the same exact thing at Acapulco for half the price. . . Also, I went there with one of my girl Â friends and it felt quite date-ish, which was a little awkward. Must have been the mood lighting, the candle on the table, and the couple making out at the table next to us.
