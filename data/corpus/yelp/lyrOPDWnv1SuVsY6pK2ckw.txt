Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Like Manna needs its 57th review, but dammit I will give it one anyway.. . I enjoy Manna, I do. Its nothing fancy. Its cheap Korean BBQ that is great for large parties that want to eat, drink and be merry. . . I do love the birthday parties here. Any birthday you get to celebrate with loud Korean techno music and a cheap bottle of champagne poured over your head is a good birthday in my book. . . Its all you can eat BBQ for $14.99. Its not the finest cuts of meat but I mean, what do you expect for that price?
