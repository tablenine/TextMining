Restaurant: The Water Grill
Category: Seafood
The restaurant is gorgeous, and it does feel upscale as soon as you walk inside there. I had high expectations for this place but it was only ok for me. I had the DineLA menu and I thought the swordfish with polenta was lovely. I read all the yelp reviews saying the chowder was the best, but I've had better chowder from souplantation. It was too thin. I also had some of the Prince Edward Island oysters- those were fabulous but they're quite expensive.. . The service could've been so much better. As a michelin starred place, I was expecting it to be really good, but our waiter was barely there and I think as soon as he found out we were all ordering from the DineLA menu, he purposely avoided us. He also seemed snooty too. I'm still looking for the best seafood restaurant in LA, and the Water Grill isn't one of them.
