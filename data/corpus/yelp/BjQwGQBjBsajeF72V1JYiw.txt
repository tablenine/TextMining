Great steakhouse. Here are a few tips to a better Gibson's experience...it's often packed, but check out the host/hostess outside if you want to sit outside. Inside there was a wait for 1 hour for two people--outside we got seated right away. There are heaters outside which made it extra comfortable--great people watching on Rush Street. Medium Rare is like Rare, so while I usually do Medium, I had to send it back to cook some more. Don't ever leave without trying the twice baked potato. Good service
