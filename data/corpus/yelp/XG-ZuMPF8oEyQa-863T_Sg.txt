Category: Burgers
It was a saturday.  I was studying and had a sudden craving for a hamburger.  Had heard great reviews on the ghettoburger, and my gf from cali was in town, so we had to make the trip from Alpharetta.  I saw online that it closed at 9 pm, so we left around 6:30 and thought there'd be plenty of time to spare.  We got there around 7:15 and have never felt so out of place in my life.  There were 3 couples sitting out on the patio, so I tried to ask them what the proper way to get on the waiting list was.  I think they were all in on the joke, but one person goes, "just go up and ask for ann."  Me, a tall lanky asian boy, walk into this shack of a restaurant, and Ann, an old black lady, yells out, "if you ain't on the patio by 7, you ain't getting served."  I don't think I fully comprehended what she said to me until I was safely back in my car and driving down 20.  . . Yeah, I'm sure it a great burger, but I'm a big fan of humility and good service.  So, we ended up going down to Vortex in Little 5 and had 2 great burgers.  Will never make the trip back down to Ann's.... . ok, I admit...i still dream of the ghettoburger at times...
