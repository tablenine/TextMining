So I was in the area and hungry as SH**.  I walk in and damn this place made mah mouf water.  The girl in front of me insisted that I try the The Port &amp; Stilton Burger.  Im not big on blue cheese but im down with grilled onions.   I copped the The Port &amp; Stilton Burger and it was an excellent choice.  Juicy burger very tastey...like I cant really even describe it, you just gotta try it for yourself.  I looked over to my girl to ask her how her how the socal burger was....she had her face buried in the burger and had this glow about her, i take it that was great too.  I was definitely feeling the sweet potato fries, Im for sure going to stop by umami burger again.  DELICIOUS!
