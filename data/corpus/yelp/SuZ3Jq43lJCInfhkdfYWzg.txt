I enjoyed Craft.  I wasn't blown away but it was solid.  Salad was fresh and the Oysters were good.  The horseradish they have is freshly grated but VERY mild.  I like a little kick with my oysters.. . Beef short ribs and a bunch of sides.  Baby carrots, baby broccoli, assorted mushrooms and gratin potatoes.  Everything was fine.  I love little vegetables.. . Service was good and the atmosphere is a little trendy/modern but accessible.  The bar area was nice with a more "loungey" atmosphere.. . Would I go back?  Possibly but it's not on my "To-Go" list.
