3 hours and 40 minutes in line... they run out spicy pork 2 people before I get my order... w...t...f... This is one of those experiences where you do it once in a lifetime to say that you've actually done it.  Kind of like the time I waited in Times Square New York for New Years, cool to say that I've done it but I will never do it again.  . . I was able to try the short rib taco, short rib burrito, and the sliders.  I think my personal favorite was either the taco or the sliders.  Although, when I asked the guy in the truck, he said his favorite was the spicy pork taco... too bad they ran out! ugh... . . You can totally make things like this at home...e.g. for the sliders: buy some dinner rolls, marinated korean short ribs from a korean market, and then just make little sandwiches. . minus 1 star for 3 hour and 40 minute late. minus 1 star for running out of spicy pork. minus 1 star for extra 30 minute wait after ordering. minus 1 star for the annoying girls that were in front of me... enduring 4 hours of their chatter just made me even more irritated. . bottom line: i'm sorry, but this kogi taco truck is NOT worth a 3 hour and 40 minute long wait.  it's just one of those things you do once and you learn from the mistake.  cafe alibi is owned by the same guy so you can get the same thing from them.
