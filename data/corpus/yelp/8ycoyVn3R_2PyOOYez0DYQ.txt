Last night was my first visit to Shoya, we rolled in fairly deep with a party of 8 and managed to get a table in about 30 minutes (showed up at 7:30pm).  Our first plan was to go to Bento Cafe (however it was described to us as "smelling like poop" by a friend who arrived before us, so to Shoya we went.  I was so excited to go in and eat I even managed to lock my car key in my craptastic Chevy Malibu rental car!  Needless to say with a party of 8 we got to sample a wide array of great items from the menu ranging from Sushi, Sashimi, Random bits on a stick, and various cooked seafood items.  Few highlights included, skewered and grill chicken hearts, pork belly, and the chicken wing on a stick, yes on a stick!  Tako Wasabi was great, Monk Fish livers were rich and yummy, and one of the best things we ordered was Boiled Octopus, with scallions on a sizzling plate! Pork Goyoza were yummy, and all of the sushi was fresh and tasty.  They have Ichiban and Sapparo on tap and you get get 2 liters for 14 bucks!  Also try their house Sake served warm, it was great.  They serve you green tea at the end of the meal which really helps settle your stomach. All in all great place, with a very warm and welcoming atmosphere.
