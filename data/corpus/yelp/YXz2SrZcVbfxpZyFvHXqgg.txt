I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that I thought the food was pretty good. I mean, its not gourmet... its comfort food. Still, I think it was above average for breakfast / brunch. . . After waiting about 10-15 minutes for a table, our orders were taken without requiring us to sit around for too long. The service was quick, and the food was very tastey. I had Red Eggs, which were similar to Huevos Rancheros, but without chorizo. I'd definitely order those again. My friends had Andouille Sausage Hash and Fried French Toast. Both of them thought their meals were great, too.
