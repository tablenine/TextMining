if this place was next to literati i would be totally obese.  . . mediterranean/italian/french'ish eats... sandiwches are great, although the bread is not so great (for bread, ref: Bay Cities Italian Deli).. . grab an orangina, ur mate, ur plate, pick at ur food outside and ppl watch.  laugh at the ppl waiting for a table outside toast, while you much of savory goodness - yes,  all in a day's work.. . the food really rocks, for reals
