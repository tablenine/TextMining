You've got to do the Big Fat Greek Dinner Thursday. But make sure you do it when you can show up by 7p; if you get there late that's you're loss, the food will be served whether or not you are there and be cold and picked over when you finally do arrive. The two of us had course after course of great food, a bottle of wine, AND went home with THREE boxes of leftovers! Total bill $70. LOVE IT! I can't wait to take my parents there when they are in town visiting.
