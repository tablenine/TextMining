Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Fun atmosphere that can accommodate large groups. The food, on the other hand, has gone down in quality over the years. For all you can eat, it's not too bad, but there are are better options out there. Depending on what you want, Manna's is a great place that can seat 20 ppl together for a wonderful meat-fest. Â If you want quality and more of a restaurant-feel, I'd suggest Tahoe.
