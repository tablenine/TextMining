What a bust.  Only 5 out of 12 dishes we had [before dessert] were any good.  That's not a good enough score at these high prices.  There is a great effort to create complication, but little or no attention to FLAVOR.  In general, the food is bland, bland, bland.  Take your knives and go!   The space is beautiful though, and the waitress was great.
