Recommended by a yelper, finally made it here! Everyone comes for the Hainan Chk Rice, yes it was pretty good! I guess I would have been more excited if I didn't use to have the 10-star Hainan Chk Rice back in Kansas City. Tried the curry, didn't like it, but my opinion may not be fair because I make my own curry so I'm only willing to pay for the kind of curry that I can't make. Saw other tables had the Italian dishes...wow they were prepared exactly the way they used to(or still?) in the fast food restaurants that serve western food in Hong Kong...reminded me of those days that mom didn't wanna cook lunch after she picked me up from school and we just went to pick up some fish filet rice w/cream sauce to go....I miss the taste so much! Must try next time!
