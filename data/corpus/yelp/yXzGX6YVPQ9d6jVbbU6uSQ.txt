I finished up a HUGE writing project last night at 10:30 and was craving a steak (reward) at 11. Doesn't leave many options. (Unless I want T&amp;A with my steak, but nothankyou I do not eat at strip clubs, gas station eateries or zoos.) I'd been to BD before for a party. Very swanky, very coooooool. Lovely people. But I agree with Tucker. Food is pricey and ain't all that. I had a super-fatty ribeye and it was not worth $27. . . In a nutshell: I spent $75 for two to eat sub-par food in a hip, retro atmosphere.
