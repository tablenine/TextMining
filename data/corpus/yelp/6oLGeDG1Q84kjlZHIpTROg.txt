Douche bag central. That's a fact because my first time there, some dudes asked us to move to another table to make room for the rest of their incoming party, those ingrateful bastards. But the burger wasn't bad. I appreciate its unique taste: carmelized onions and arugula covering a soft, tasty patty. But, it is definitely not "the best burger in LA". If anything, go here for the sweet potato fries. Bear in mind, you can also get sweet potato fries elsewhere. I have no comment about the service, since there is no waiter service, but the bartenders were friendly.. . Want a good SoCal burger without the overcrowded pretentiousness? Go to Tommy's.
