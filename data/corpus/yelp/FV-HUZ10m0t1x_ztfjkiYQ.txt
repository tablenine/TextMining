Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I went to Palms Thai for the first time this past weekend and I would definitely say I would come back.  A few flaws in my opinion.... kinda rude service and the parking attendants were also rude and drove way too fast in the parking garage in cars that weren't theirs.... wasn't crazy about that..... other than that I would say the food was delicious- loved the great selection of food choices which was nice!  The BEST thing about the place is THAI ELVIS....I'm in love...... are you jealous that you don't have a picture of him and I do????  Ha ha...... He definitely makes the whole experience a memorable one!
