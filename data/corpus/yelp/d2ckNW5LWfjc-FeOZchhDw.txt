Restaurant: Hatfield&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
My first real good experience with LA French cuisine was at Hatfield's. The food is traditional upscale French, but with somewhat of a Californian twist to it. On this night, my friends and I ordered the 7 course Chef's Tasting Menu. The good thing was that we each got something different, so I actually tried up to 15 different things on this night. First we started off with appetizer quail eggs with smoked trout celery root soup. The quail eggs were good, but the soup even better. The soup was hot and had a smooth taste to it. Then came the croque madame, cuttlefish w/ shitake mushrooms and celery, cranberry bay main diver scallops, olive oil poached ocean trout, slow roast chicken wing with foie gras, duck breast, beef rib, braised pork, as well as the finishing desserts of buttermilk panna cotta, citrus napolean, beignet w/ vanilla rum shake, and peanut butter choclate truffle cake with caramel ice cream.. . Out of the whole menu, most were fantastic, while some were standard tasty but not transcending in any way. The standouts on this night were the croque madame, the scallops, the hamachi collar, the beef rib, and the panna cotta dessert (which was marvelous). The others, such as the braised pork, slow roast chicken wing, and the foie gras, were good but not spectacular. But still, it was a great meal.. . In all, I give this restaurant a high recommendation. It's not THE best French food in LA, but closer than most other bad French American restaurants. The service is great here, as they attend to you always and even replace your silverware each time you finish a dish. The decor is minimalistic and simple yet classy. I think the only complaint I had was that the food portions were a little smaller than I originally expected, but my 4 star rating goes to food taste/quality only.
