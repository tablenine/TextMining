Yuca's is a great little local taco stand. They close early, so get here before 6:00 PM.. . I come here for my carne asada taco fix. Juicy and delicioso. I have had their cochinita pibil, too, which is also tasty, but was a little disappointed with the torta version 'cause the bread was a little soggy. All in all, though, good, cheap, standard taco stand fare.. . Still had to take away a star for not having horchata. Seriously, what kind of taco stand does not have horchata????
