Restaurant: Terroni
Category: Italian
So, the food would have gotten a solid 3.5 minus 1 star for terrible service, 2.5 altogether, but I'm being kind and rounding up. This was the second time I've been to Terroni, but (I'll assume) since it is Superbowl Sunday, we got the second-string crew.. . I had one of the specials... braised beef in what was essentially a ravioli. The pasta was a bit tough, but the dish was pretty good. If you ever feel like consuming 2000 calories in 15 bites, this is the choice for you. . . What was really lacking was the service. It took me a few minutes to find someone to get salt, since they don't have it on the tables. Refills were non-existent. Being one of four parties in the place, I would have expected a bit more attention.. . My main complaint is that after getting the check for $37, she gave me back my credit card with a receipt for $47. Now, a 27% tip was just not in the cards for her, and upon closer inspection, the receipt was for a different table number.. . After a few minutes of trying to find her again, I see that she is sitting down at a table with the host. Now, I've got no problem with that, if you can stop giving him the f*ck-me eyes every once in a while and see if anyone needs you to do your job. Finally, I flag down another girl (bartender?) and she has them clear it up.. . If you want good Italian food, consider going here.. If you want good service that will pay more attention to you than whoever they are flirting with, and not mess up the bill, go elsewhere.
