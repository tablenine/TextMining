Came here for vegan brunch.  Having had dinner at Fatty's the night before I definitely lowered my expectations for Veggie/Vegan food in Los Angeles, sorry LA, I still love you for Thai food!. . I had the vegan benedict and my friend had the breakfast burrito.  What we had in common was one hand constantly reaching for the salt.  Philosophically, as someone who cooks vegan/veggie food, I think it's terrible to under-season veggie food because we're already fighting the bland tofu eater stereotype.  I also objected to the fact that there were 2 types of engineered meat substitutes on my plate - poached tofu and seitan bacon.  There are so many beautiful and delicious vegan things to be eaten in the world (and many of them grow just outside of LA), and I was disappointed that more of them didn't make it on to my plate or on to the menu at RFD.
