i sorta lived right down the street, and little bangkok is a number one go to spot for yummy, yummy thai.  they are on my speed dial, and take out is quick, hot and fast.  did i mention that the food is yummy?  . . i've been slumming in macon recently, and spicy basil catfish from little bangkok totally made my night.  almost brought tears to my eyes.  delish...tons of crispy catfish, green beans, eggplant...oooh.  i'm not a fan of pad thai, but we got some of that for my five year old niece who isn't quite into spicy, and it was actually quite tasty to my tummy as well.. . for eat in diners, the service has always been great....but don't expect to be wowed by the decor.  seriously needs an overhaul, but really...the magic they work in the kitchen overcomes the kitschy 1978 look.  . . and btw...little bangkok has wonderfully cheap lunch specials too!
