We went here for brunch on a Saturday morning.  I wasn't too impressed.  However my meal was the best of the four we ordered.  I had the crab cake benedict (which was one of the specials) and a side order of sausage.  The service was really slow and one of the my friend's order came out almost 10 minutes later than the rest of ours.   This place is mediocre at best.... I wouldn't die if I had to go back here.
