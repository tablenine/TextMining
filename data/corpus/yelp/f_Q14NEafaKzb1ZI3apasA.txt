My husband and I had ourselves a lovely dinner here a couple of weeks ago.  We ordered the truffle oil &amp; parmesan fries to start, which were quite delicious.  I think the presentation is very attractive (they come in a paper-lined pint glass) but they stuck together a little more than I would have liked.  Not really a big deal though.  The pretzel roll was my favorite selection from the bread basket.. . I ordered the scallops with soba dumplings and mushrooms, and oh my god was it delicious!  The scallops were perfect - sweet and fresh and perfectly seared.  Yum!  Hubby ordered the short ribs, which he devoured with gusto.  The flavor was amazing from the couple of bites I stole.  . . To finish off the meal we shared a blueberry lemongrass creme brulee, which was great as well.  The lemongrass gave the dish a light, refreshing taste that we loved.  . . Overall, this was an excellent splurge meal for us.  We had a coupon from . http://Restaurant.com.  ($25 off, which we paid $2 for), but our bill with tip was still $85.  Definitely not an inexpensive place, but it was a fabulous meal.  The ambiance of the place is somehow both fancy and relaxing and we never felt rushed or out of place.
