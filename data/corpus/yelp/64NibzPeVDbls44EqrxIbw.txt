My friends and I love this out of the way place.  When you pull up it doesn't look like much but when you walk in it is a really rustically elegant place.  They are still building their website because they are pretty new.  We went shortly after they opened and the staff was really knowledgeable about the menu, including the wines.  I am still day dreaming about the fruit salad.  I know it doesn't sound like much but he puts a hint of salt and chili powder in there that really enhance the flavors of the blood red oranges, kiwi, papaya, and cucumbers (my mouth is watering just typing about it!) . . The $16 cheese burger was apparently worth every penny to my friend who proclaims herself a cheeseburger connoisseur and intends to serve them at her wedding (groom TBD).  Also the steak and fries was amazing.  Another thing I dream about that we had was the Lavender infused Prosecco.   I wanted to chug it but I fear chugging sparkling wine would get me kicked out of a place like that. . .  "Shaun's to Maintain Old World Charm in a Warm Yet Simplistic Lodge Chic Environment"  This means they may have family style seating (they have separate tables as well) but behave, don't go in there without your manners...this isn't Chili's.
