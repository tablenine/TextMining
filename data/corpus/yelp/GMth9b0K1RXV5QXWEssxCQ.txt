For whatever reason I had no difficulty getting a prime reservation on a Saturday night when I called the previous day...in fact, they offered me several choice times for seating.  Hmmm....maybe it's my last name?. . I have to say that the service was great and that the recommendations for wine pairings were helpful and spot on.  We were served in a timely fashion, plates were cleared, wine was poured - in short, no complaints about the servers.. . It's the food that puzzles me.  I really like Batali's "take" on Italian food and went into the experience not expecting it to adhere to the rigid confines of the classic recipes.  I've even cooked some of his recipes at home and found the flavors to be well balanced and exciting.  . . The conclusion I have to make is that there is a problem in the kitchen.. . My appetizer of burrata served over leeks with mustard had WAY too much mustard on it - this is coming from someone who absolutely loves mustard.  When the busser came to take my plate he asked if I didn't like the leeks and when I replied that someone had been too liberal with the mustard he nodded in agreement and said "yes, too much mustard" as if he'd heard it before.  My next plate of orrechiette with sausage and chard seemed to be missing the greens altogether and was too salty to eat.  . . I'm sorry to say that the high points of my meal were the amuse-bouche we were given and the perfect espresso.  I didn't finish any of my plates and left feeling hungry and somewhat let-down.  This is so unlike the experiences of the other reviewers on this site that I don't know what to think.  What I know, however, is that I won't be returning.
