This is my favorite brunch place in LA. I've had their breakfast sandwich with sausage, two scrambled eggs, frisee, tomato and aioli on toasted brioche for around $8 and that was probably my favorite. Pretty messy but oh my god so good. I've ordered the baked egg dishes several times because I wanted to try all the different combinations: frittata with bacon, spinach, tomato and cheddar and my favorite so far the one with chorizo, gruyere cheese, tomato, onions, tortilla, roasted bell peppers and salsa roja = spicy deliciousness! Its a good sized meal for $10. My friend always gets the Brioche French Toast which is insanely moist and light at the same time. It melts in your mouth and its like eating cotton candy or something! So great. Their bread is flavorful, their potatoes delicious, the out door patio is really relaxing to sit on nice day... overall a really awesome place to eat at. I still need to get there for lunch!
