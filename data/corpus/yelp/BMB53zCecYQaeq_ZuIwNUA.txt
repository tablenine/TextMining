I love seafood and i love Cajun flavorings...so this place is pretty much a dream come true for me. I didn't expect this place to be in super Chinese 626 area but hey it was only a 20 min drive from school so it worked for me. . . Get here right when they open or be prepared to wait. Also parking is 90% of the time on the street unless you get super luck and snag one of their 7 (or close to that number) spots in the lot. . . I've tried a lot of the flavors but my favorite is the whole sha-bang medium spiciy and i ask for extra limes and the salt and pepper dip. . . Yay . Cajun fries - its only a couple of bucks and the seasoning is so good! . dungeon crab - a bit of work but the reward is definitely worth it . shrimp * - the easiest to eat and a lb is a good amount for a person . craw fish * - the tails aren't that big but if you like eating the brains its has the most flavor . *i think these are probably the best bang for your buck . . boo . blue crab - you just don't get enough meat for the money and the work . . Until you shower everyone will be able to tell where ate but smelling like buttery garlicky seafood goodness, is that really that bad??
