while mantou sanmmies are not trailblazingly new nor rocket science, these things ARE damn tasty.  i had 3!  they're finger lickin good, road runner quick, and developing nation value priced.. . had the pork belly, tofu, and hangar steak baos.  go for yours!. . my friend got the fried mantou w/ condensed milk.  fatty goodness.
