Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
If you want to go to Boiling Crab for food.  Please keep the following in mind:. 1)  PARKING IS HORRIBLE.  They have a parking lot that can only park, i dunno, 6-8 cars?  Your best bet is finding parking on the side streets or on Valley Blvd.. 2)  BE PREPARED TO WAIT.  Too bad they don't open for lunch.  They open at 3pm, and even if I make a mad dash to this place at 530p for dinner, there is a waiting list going already.  Wait time is approximately 1-2 hours if you go at peak dinner hours.  And they do not sit you if your entire party is not there.. . Other than this... the place is awesome!  I will never come here for a first date because I would be too busy licking the sauce off my fingers.  (Yes... You will get a little messy at this place).  My personal favorite is their Shrimp and Crab Legs with the Full Sha-Bang.  If you want to keep the cost low, get the shrimp and crawfish instead.  . . TIPS:  . 1)  Skip the wait and order TO-GO!. 2)  Order Soda or something to drink, because they charge for water!
