OK here is the deal.  The food was all very good, fresh and definitely of good quality.  HOWEVER, the dining experience was so lacking that it really ruins everything else when your plates are either being shoved in your face or pulled out from under you before you are done.. . We waited for 1.5 hours and as soon as we sat down they were just slamming dishes out onto our table.  It was lame.  . . Here's what I don't understand. As a business owner, if you're really THAT busy at night, DON'T CLOSE AT 10:30.  It's ridiculous!!! You don't seat people that late at night and then expect THEM to rush through everything.  Manage the business better so you either aren't seating people after a certain time OR you have your staff work an extra hour.. . It just doesn't make sense to me. Your place obviously has a demand (judging by the crowd) and you obviously make the effort to have a valet on staff - so that just should say more about that understanding.. . Everyone else in my party was pissed - I at least have the graciousness to say the food was completely worthy of 4 stars.
