Came back a year later, and was equally happy. This time we made a 5 pm reservation, and we actually sat down at 5 pm ! By going in that early,  I could actually can see that they are trying to stagger people in so that there is a constant flow all night... so 5 stars.. . Steaks are as good as ever.  They have the only bone-in filet that I know about, apparantly they only get 100 per night or something like that.. . Unless you really really really love pepper, do not ruin your steak with the peppercorn treatment.... just add pepper later. I would stick with the regular baked potato instead of the double baked potato, unless you like your baked potato mashed up for you, so really they should call the double, a big mashed potato !. . If you want to be entertained, ask specificially for the bald headed waiter with glasses... he is hilarious !
