Solid, indie brunch place with a slightly more diverse crowd than your typical indie joint.. . Crowd pleasers - fisn n grits, pecan pancakes, fresh squeezed oj, daily omelette, sweet potato cakes, and the dish with the brisket pork, poached eggs, broth w/ baguette is a hit. . . Also, the waitstaff is relaxed, but I've never had bad service, alone or in a group. Weekends are slammed, but they've handled it well with parking lot cups of coffee and efficient service.
