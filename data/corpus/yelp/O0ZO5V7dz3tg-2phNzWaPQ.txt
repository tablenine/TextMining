Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
The price and location are right, and that is the strongest thing going for Tank in my book.. . The sushi options are a little on the light side in Albany Park, so when I have a hankering for some raw fish wrapped in rice I head to Tank. It used to be the best thing EVER when all maki was half priced, but since the change it's the goodest thing ever. Ok, not a word.. . I tend to go at off hours during the half-priced time (say 2:30) and the wait is minimal, if at all. I have found that the service is slow no matter what time though. I like to chalk it up to the speed of the sushi chefs (if that's their technical name).. . I usually go with a spicy tuna roll, but like to mix up the second option. I've never been disappointed. The dragon, tank, Alaskan night and ocean sundae are all quite tasty.. . Writing this made me realize that I haven't been there in a long time. I think I'll be visiting them soon.
