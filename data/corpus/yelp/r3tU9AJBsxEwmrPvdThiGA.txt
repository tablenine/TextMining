Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
I'm moving from Wrigleyville to Wicker Park at the end of the month, &amp; I have to say, I'm really going to miss this place.. . Twist is probably my favorite tapas place in the city... I've never had a dish I didn't like (the jumbo sea scallops, stuffed mushrooms, baked goat cheese, beef tenderloin in blue cheese... mmmm!), the service is always quick &amp; friendly, &amp; the sangria is awesome. I usually try to branch out with a dish or two off their specials menu, &amp; then make sure I stick with some of Â my faves off the regular menu. I prefer the hot tapas to the cold, but I think that's just a personal preference.. . Yes, Twist gets crowded. But Twist will also take your cell phone number while you &amp; your guest(s) head over to a local bar to wait... we usually hit Sheffield's for a few great import beers, so it doesn't really feel like waiting. Your other option is to go a little earlier or later to avoid the 7:00 dinner rush... but it's usually only really crowded on weekend nights.. . To top it off, almost every time I come in, I get a coupon or two for a 'buy three tapas, get one free' or something like that. Twist is simply great contemporary American tapas, at an affordable price, in a unique atmosphere. I'd keep coming back, even if they didn't give out those coupons.. . I'll miss you, Twist!
