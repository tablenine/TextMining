When i used think of cuban, i would always think, Cigars, or Ricky Ricardo, or VW Buggies... i dont know why. But that was before Portos came to glendale. i used to eat here all the time. As rarely as i would see my mother, she would always want to come here for lunch. The sandwichs are awesome. their version of the reuben is ok, but their cuban version of the carnitas sandwich is better, and its served with banana chips.....ooh wee. . . This plus potato balls, the flaky bread with cream cheese filling, and mango cheesecake, and we're on.. . The pototo balls alone are nutso, who wouldve ever thought to wrap ground beef in mashed potatos, then frying it. it is so freaking Gnarly it hurts. but damn, does it hurt sooooo good. lol.. . The best thing is that recently, i started to hangout in burbank alot. And what do you know, a Porto's happens to open on the same street where you would normally find me.. . Right on for good timing and fried mashed potatos....!!!!
