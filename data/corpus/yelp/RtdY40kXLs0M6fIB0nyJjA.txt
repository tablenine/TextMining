This place has everything I like in a resturant. Nice atmosphere, Good Service, Not too pricey, and yummy, memorable, food.. . One piece of advice I have, keep some room for the Carrot Cake. Its a huge slab of cake with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting. Best part, they give extra frosting, and some vanilla bean whipcream on the side for dipping. It was out of this world.
