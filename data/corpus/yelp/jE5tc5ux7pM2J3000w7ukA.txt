Met some friends at the bar on a magnificent Sunday to catch the Blackhawks game.  What a fantastic place!!!  . . Had a great neighborhood feel.  Max the bartender did an amazing job recommending a beer, which went well with my Inside out burger.  . . I have nothing but great things to say.  What a great place to meet up with people and hang out.
