Tried their pizza on a second visit... and it is quite good.  Thin and crispy  NY style crust with fresh ingredients, and not greasy.  A little light on the sauce, but the toppings were tasty, and definitely better than your local CPK.  They only have one size pizza (about $16), so easy to share between 2-3 people or have some good leftovers (or handout to the thankful homeless around LA, they seemed to appreciate).
