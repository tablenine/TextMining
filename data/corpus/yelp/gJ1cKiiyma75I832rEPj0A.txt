It's rare to find a great brunch-time destination without a crazy wait! I've been here twice and both times my party was seated in less than 10 minutes. Also, randomly both times, we were seated at the same table in the corner. Though the area's a bit dark, it's seclusion makes up for it. . . The items on the brunch menu are all unique. I absolutely loved my Chilaquiles, a Mexican-style egg dish. And my friends were more than pleased with the Smoked Salmon Scramble. When I went wiht my mom she tried some sort of breakfast pasta--which sounded a bit odd--but tasted great. I can't speak for the place's dinner menu, but you won't be disappointed if you make the trek for brunch.
