okok, I would never wait more than 30 minutes for this place and the fact they opened up another location within walking distance is just crazy. I'm sure there's other places in SGV that we can get the same quality dumplings for a better price or even cheaper but.. I'm lazy to find it!. . I come here rarely (I live in Redondo Beach and don't like to venture far) and if I do, it's after the mad rush. With that being said, I'll start my highly anticipated review.. . After a Vegas trip, boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on the way home. It was around 3pm on the Sunday after July 4th. Ordered the juicy pork dumplings, baby bok choy, shanghai rice cake, and regular pork and shrimp dumplings. Everything was good... except for the service. What do you expect from Taiwanese people, (hobohobo) right? I can say that w/ out being blasted because I'm Chinese, ok? That's a whole different can of worms, so don't get me started. . . Overall, good food, better when you don't have to wait and bring your own water if you don't want to die of thirst.
