The Kogi truck finally came around Northridge when i was in the area.. i think it's a bit overrated. I waited in line for about 2.5-3 hours. I got the short rib taco and it was tasty, but not really worth the long wait. i haven't tried the other things on the menu , but i heard it's pretty good so i wouldn't mind waiting again to try those.
