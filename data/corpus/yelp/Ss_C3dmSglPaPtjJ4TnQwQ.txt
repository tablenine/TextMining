Based on my experience at Aja this week, it's not nearly as pretentious or overpriced as many people seem to be saying. Not that it didn't have its flaws--the first dish I ordered, the Lamb Tikka, was way overcooked, and I had to send it back. The replacement dish, however, the Lamb Vindaloo, was delicious. Additionally, both the server and the manager came by repeatedly to apologize and check to see if the Vindaloo was better. Their excellent customer service and the speed and quality of the Vindaloo more than made up for the bad Tikka.. . Aja's space is massive and beautiful, and I really didn't find it tacky at all. The high ceiling and rich materials seemed to suit the menu and atmosphere. The menu is basically pan-Asian, with a diverse selection of sushi, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian dishes. The others in my party got the salmon and sea bass, both of which were flavorful and nice-sized portions.. . BTW, a good tip for Aja and other Here to Serve restaurants: Join the Friends of Tom (Catherall) club for notifications about specials and discounts (such as 50% of your bill at Aja!)
