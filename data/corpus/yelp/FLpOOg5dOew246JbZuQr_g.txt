Restaurant: Panes Bread Cafe
Category: Sandwiches
The sandwiches are worth it for the bread alone, though I'm happy to say the bacon is pretty darn great too--crispy and tasty.  I had the BLT, so I can't really give an opinion on any of the other meats.  My bf, though, had the Super Panes and really, really enjoyed it, so that's sort of an endorsement.  We also ordered the potato salad and the mashed potatoes, and both were good.  The potato salad is very, very garlicky--almost exactly like the garlicky potato salad served at tapas restaurants.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and satisfying, and the serving was HUGE.. . Because that's the other thing--the amount of food you get for not a lot of money is great.  There were all kinds of tempting desserts at the counter too, but we stuck with a couple of the truffles each, and they were super yummy too.  I'm quite sure we'll go back for different sandwiches, loaves of bread, and some of the beautiful desserts.
