Maybe if their peanut noodles weren't an experiment in super peanut taste--all of the dry, none of the delicate flavor; Maybe if their rice noodles with curry weren't painfully salty; Maybe if their creme brulee had either creme or brulee; Maybe if the waitress hadn't screwed up our check...twice or had even paid any attention to us I would go back. But for terrible food that's not well priced I doubt it. . . What up Jerry Kleiner? You're better than that.
