How have I not ever reviewed this place when I've been here over a dozen times???  This is by far one of my favorite sushi places....EVER!!!. . Don't let the strip mall sushi joint fool you.  Or rather, let it so it won't be so busy..... . Spicy tuna on crispy rice, baked crab hand roll (get it with jalapeno and avocado!!!!), kobe beef, salmon sashimi, rock shrimp tempura, albacore with crispy onion, baked spicy tuna/crab hand roll....really....you need me to go on?  ALL of it is delicious.  I always get stuck ordering the same things over and over again - musssst....ventuuurrre....out....... . ...drool.
