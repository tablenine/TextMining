If you're in a mood to go to a quaint spot for a bowl of ramen without wanting a million different ramen choices, this is it. As another reviewer pointed out, the ordering process is quite simple. Being there for the first time, the only thing I didn't quite have a grasp on was how hot was hot! Â I went with the miso (with extra green onion) at level 4. I probably could have gone level 3 or 2 and been ok.. . My wife did get the Special #2, which is the spiciest of spicy. They didn't want to give it to her but she finally convinced them she's been there before and it's not the first time. I tried some and I could tell you this- one or two sips are ok but there is no way I would be able to finish up that bowl! Besides, to get your picture you need to take it down in less than 30min. (I think).. . Anyway, if it's a cold, rainy day and you're in the mood for a good, hot bowl of soup, this is the place to go!
