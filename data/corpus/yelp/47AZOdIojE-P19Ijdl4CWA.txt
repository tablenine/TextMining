The chicken is amazing.. . I used to go to school near here (the red brick building across the street with the gate? yeah). I don't know why I didn't go more often. Probably to get on the bus back home ASAP rather than sticking around with the crazies on Pico.. . The chicken is amazing. It's juicy and moist. Delicious. Flavorful. Melt in your mouth kind of amazing.. . That's all. Go and you will be pleased. I promise. I swear on my old uniform skirt.
