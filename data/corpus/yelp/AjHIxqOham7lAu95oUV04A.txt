Over the years I've been here quite a few times.  Mostly to see shows but I've been here maybe 5 times or so to eat.  Normally I get the Earl Burger but this time I had the pulled pork bbq sandwich with the Brunswick stew.  Plenty of bbq on the sandwich and I always enjoy their stew.  I think my sandwich was like $6 or something like that.  I was just looking on their menu again and didnt realize they had a $14 10 oz ribeye.  I think I'll try that next time.. . Every time I've been in there the bartenders are right on top of things getting drinks and taking orders.. . Now as far as the bar area goes...there is a small patio out front facing Flat Shoals and the windows open up so you can sit inside along a counter and you almost feel like you're outside.  The bar itself can seat about I dont know maybe 15 people.  If there is a big show in the back it cant get pretty packed in the bar.  I also like to keep up with the latest graffitti in the bathroom as far as who is doing whose mom and the such.  Its pretty easy to strike up a conversation at the bar as well....probably some of the most friendly people I've experienced at a bar in Atlanta.  And I've been to A LOT of bars believe me.   Once in a while you run into a few characters like the chick that decided to bring her parrot to the bar etc but thats what makes this place fun.. . I've had some good times here mainly from seeing some pretty good shows.  But you cant forget about the food here either...its good bar food and cheap.  If you are in the area I'd definitely recommend dropping by.
