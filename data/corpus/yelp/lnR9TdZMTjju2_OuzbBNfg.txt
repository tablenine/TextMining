This review is just on one visit and I usually like to review places after at least 2 stops, so I'm sure it could bend either way upon further visits.. . I went there for lunch on a beautiful saturday afternoon with my girlfriend. Wanted to sit outside (probably like 6 tables or so) but all all were taken, so what ya gonna do. Once inside, had a very clean and nice look to the place, albeit a trendy veneer, especially with the euro-pop playing over the speakers. Not a big fan of that type of music when I'm....well anywhere, but restaurants are about food and that's what I was focusing on.. . Me and the lady started out with the "chopsticks" that are similar to crab rangoons but minus the crab and in the form of tiny egg rolls. (good and relatively cheap) Next the standard miso soup (good) and we ordered our sushi. Hamachi nigiri (2) was pretty good, Super White(2) was also good, my girlfriend is as stubborn about super white as I am about yellowtail; but i find hamachi to be a good barometer for a place's sushi quality, it's a delicate fish their care for it should represent the rest of the sushi as well. . We split 3 rolls, the samurai, kula, and the seared scallop. Look at the website for the details about their rolls. I'd say the Samurai was the best of the 3, real nice spicy mayo on it. The other two were just kind of plain, nothing amazing. I would like to go back based on previous yelper's praise of the ocean sundae roll and my girlfriend wanted to try their cocktails.. . All in all I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could, good here and there, but the price was a little steep for what's relatively a small lunch for me. Again, this is prone to change upon further experiences.
