oink oink! I love the name of this place!  so i didn't actually have any pork, but i did have chicken!  I ordered the half roasted chicken with plantains, slaw, and rice.  It was not bad.  The chicken skin was nicely crisp, but the chicken itself didn't have much chicken flavor.  It was a chicken that didn't really taste like chicken.  I'm not sure that made any sense at all, but too bad.  The garlic aoili sauce is really yummy and makes the dish come together really nicely.  I rwanted to try their burgers with pastrami in it, but was craving chicken...  My bf got the pastrami and i took a bite.  It was good, but not the best.  The Belgian style fries don't seem like Belgian fries to me.  I've had Belgian fries in Europe and they look nothing like these.  The ones served here just look like regular fries.  no lie.  thick sliced and fried!  They are especially tasty however when dipped into the garlicy aoili sauce.  I think anything will taste good dipped in all that garlic!  the food is a little over priced imo.  my chicken plate came out to about $10.
