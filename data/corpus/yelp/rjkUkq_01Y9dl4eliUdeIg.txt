Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Last February when i was asked to meet my friend at Bill's for lunch, I was unenthusiastic.  But with a stroll up the beach from Redondo I figured anything could taste good - even someplace that was probably over hyped.. . WRONG!  It was not over-hyped.  Just the aroma of the food had me changing my plan from the usual lunch fare to a full breakfast.  I could not have ask for a better first meal after having arrived from Texas thatn Bill's bacon, eggs, toast (not pancakes for me), oatmeal, OJ and hot tea.  Yes, salt air does something for my appetite, but usually it craves fish, so this was the quality of the kitchen that put me in binge mode.. . Next time I may have to stay in Manhattan Beach instead of Redondo, so I don't have to go as far to eat.
