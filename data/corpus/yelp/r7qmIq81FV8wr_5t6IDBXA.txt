Very good sushi and great GRILLED FILET MIGNON (so I'm told since I'm a vegetarian).  My friend had his birthday party here last year and everyone loved the food.  They ordered FRIGHTENED GEISHA, PINK LADY, GEISHA LIPS, and a couple others I don't remember.. . They actually have a few vegetarian sushi too - TOFU DE SHOW, VEGE TEMPURA, and GREEN LAWN.  I've only tried the first one which wasn't bad (but not great).. . Great atmosphere - DJ music and modern decor.. I recommend this place for non-vegetarians.
