Restaurant: HB Restaurant
Category: American (New)
After hearing about HB from a few friends, we decided it was time to try it for ourselves. I love love loved it and enjoyed the food, experience, Joncarl (owner), service and pretty much everything else about the place. We decided to share 3 appetizers (fritters, escargot and bacon wrapped almond dates) and the special entree (bouillon base loaded with seafood: flaky whitefish, shrimp, mussels and clams). Everything was fantastic and we had a great time getting to know Joncarl and his inspiration for the restaurant. It's a place to go with friends, family or on a romantic date. The artwork is amazing and is on display throughout the entire place. Joncarl and I shared a sip of champagne and he was kind enough to share a Polish after dinner drink with us. I can't wait to go back for round II and recommend HB without reservation.
