All I can tell you is that the Borracho Breakfast Burrito is a must try.  That's because out of our group of 5, EVERYONE ordered the burrito.  Eggs, black beans, cheese, lots of veggies in a spinach tortilla.  (It's big so you can save some for later).  . . I really don't know how we all wound up getting the same thing to eat since the menu is extensive.  Lots of veggie options available (which always makes me smile) and Leif Garrett album covers on the wall.. . Saturday brunch was crowded and there was definitely a wait when we left around noon.  I guess getting there a little earlier was a good thing.  And our waiter?  He was adorable (he wished us a splendid day - so cute).
