This place is beyond lame.  First off... what kind of restaurant has a bouncer out front? Really? Second, said bouncer pretended like we didn't actually have a dinner reservation when we did.  Third, there were at least 6 tables open when we got inside for our 9 o'clock reservation which they claimed to have lost (really I think they had decided my friends weren't "cool" enough to eat there) and were still giving us grief about seating us.  Fourth, since when do dvf wrap dresses for girls and tailored slacks and oxfords for guys not qualify you as being "dressed appropriately?"  It's Wednesday... this is what we wore to work, were you really expecting us to go home and put on like clubbing attire on a Wednesday? To go to dinner? I don't think so.  If you are going to pretend like we aren't dressed "well enough" to eat at your restaurant maybe you should try enforcing that policy with the rest of the trash dining in your "high class" establishment in jeans and t-shirts.  Finally, it was restaurant week and they tried to pretend they didn't have a restaurant week menu.  Fifth, the food was awful.  The duck spring rolls I started with tasted like they came from KFC and the curry I had as an entree was so bland it was like chewing paper. Never coming back here again... EVER.
