Restaurant: The Varsity
Category: Fast Food
Having moved to Atlanta almost three years ago, The Varsity was one of the restaurants that we wanted to visit as it has such a huge following and had been recommended by many. . . Having finally eaten there last week, Imust say that I was hughly disappointed with everything except for the onion rings which were delicious.  Our group consisted of three adults and four kids; none of us found the food at all enjoyable.  Certainly not worth the 30-40 minute drive it took to get there.  I think that I'd pass even if it was 5 minutes away.. . My Wife made an interesting comment which I think holds very true.  When you go out to eat, you expect to enjoy  something that you could not top at home.  Like I said, except for the onion rings, this was nothing to write home about.
