Fresh wasabi...live sweet shrimp...live sea urchin...need I say more!. . Okay for those of you who want to hear more, all I can say is that Sushi Go 55 is pretty damn good. I had the above mentioned items including the double stacked chirashi box for dinner. The Top Box had an assortment of sashimi, tamago, shitake mushroom, fish cake, and octopus on a bed of fresh shredded daikon. The bottom box had shredded egg omelette, toasted nori, and masago on a bed of sushi rice. It also came with miso soup and a few side dishes (sunomono and japanese pickles) that were served before the meal. . . It was definitely a lot of food, and I couldn't finish all of it if I wanted to. The sashimi was huge. Check out the pictures that are already posted.. . Sushi Go 55 is still as good as the first time I came here years ago. It was the first place I Â ever tried the live sweet shrimp, and I've been in love ever since.
