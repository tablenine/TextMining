Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I have to admit that I can't say much about their ramen here. How can I when every bite I took added oil to the fire in my mouth? Yes, I took the Orochon Special 2 challenge ... and conquered it! Definitely a fun place to be with a group of friends who are up for a challenge.. . JONASAPPROVED!
