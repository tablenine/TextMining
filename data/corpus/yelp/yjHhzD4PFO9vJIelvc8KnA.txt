i love Bobbin's review of this place. i really cant add anything more to it. . . but.... . i really would have given this place 5 stars if the quantity of food matched the price. how are you going to give me 5 little balls of pork for $12!!! are you freaking kidding me!!! the food was amazing! the yucca was incredible. i love papi's yucca but they use way too much garlic. this place uses the lemon juice to accompany the garlic, it was an entire different taste. i loved it. this is authentic yucca con mojo. . the puerco was great, it had a subtle taste of lemon and was very crisp on the outside but juicy and delectable in my mouth. . we also had this pork roast that had a sausage link stuck in the hole and cooked. it was ok, but the waiter told us we would have a piece of sausage in every bite...yeah, no. didnt happen. . . the servings here as way too small. it was a complete waste of money. I'm thinking, it's b/c of the recession, this place is family owned and they cant afford it. i left here hungry as hell and wanting more! the cuban bread that they served was so well toasted that i cant wait to taste their cuban sandwiches. . . even though this was the best latin food i have had, i cant go here on a regular for my cuban fix. it's just not enough food. i pay 1/2 the price at papi's (right down the block) and get 2-3 times more.
