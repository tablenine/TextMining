Oh dear lord! Reminds you why we eat meat and why we must maintain our position on the food chain and dominance over those that lack posable thumbs and don't walk upright.. . I've had pretty much an entire seafood tower to myself.  I like some warmth to my various crab legs but it didn't stop me it was still awesome.. . I did the rib eye medium-rare. Best damn piece of meat I've had in my life. Don't you dare put anything on it.. . Wasabi mashed potatoes were awesome. Next time I will try the lobster mashed potatoes.. . Don't ruin the ambience. Dress like you have a job or so trendy that they think you're someone special. There's nothing but old money and cougars at the bar so don't bother.  . . If you're here its a special occasion or your credit card thinks its one. Take it easy here because conspicuous consumption is tacky.. . I will continue to return time and time again.
