I was introduced to this place by the bf a few years ago and it is one of my favorites ever since. I kick myself for not knowing about this place as I used to literally live 2 blocks away (I guess I saved some money that way) . . I recommend the salads and the portabella mushroom panini. The panini is especially good. Their minestrone soup is filled with veggies and delicious. I do feel like they used to include more in their portabella salad (maybe broccoli?) but it a nice fresh salad or lite meal.  I have tried some of the veggie pastas too, the portions are nicely sized.  And the baked goods and freshly baked bread?? Cant beat it... The seating is cozy and they have little twinkly lights around, which I happen to love. In the summer they also have a few tables to sit outside. . . If you are on the corner of Wellington and Sheffield, pick Panes. Don't go across the street for Pompeii. (there are always flies there. ugh!) . . Two small vices with this place: 1) How do you pronounce the name?? (Who cares, it is delicious) and 2) I believe that on Saturday they have a special with bacon in it. The entire place smells like bacon. If you go with someone who keeps kosher (as I did) expect an adverse, kind of hilarious reaction. . . YUM Panes!
