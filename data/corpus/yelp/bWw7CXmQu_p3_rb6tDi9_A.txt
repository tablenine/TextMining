I love you Flo. I love you when I'm tired and hungover on Saturday morning and need a Mojito to go with my huevos rancheros. I love you on Wednesday night for dinner when I want some enchiladas and a margarita. . . Great place for breakfast, can get packed on the weekend but they have free Inteligentsia coffee for you to keep you out of the coma while you wait. . . Once you do get seated the wait staff is very friendly and relaxed just looking to make sure you get what you need with no bullshit. The most incredible thing I have ever had here was the tamale hash. It was one of the specials on the weekend and I left a small part of my soul with that plate of food because I could barely move after eating through the entire thing. Solid breakfast the whole way through be it huevos rancheros or huevos verde.. . I've been here for dinner as well. Potato enchiladas with red sauce brought a smile to my stomach. Every time I leave here I always have a hard time walking home because I'm so full and all I want to do is stay and eat more.
