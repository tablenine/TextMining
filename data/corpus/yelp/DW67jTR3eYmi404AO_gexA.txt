My dad took our party of four here after a 25 year hiatus from the city. It was everything we desired and what he remembered it to be: a quaint pizzeria with fantastic items.. . No reservations, cash only. Easy access from bus routes. Waited 45 minutes after being quoted 1 1/2 hours. Not sure how the host remembered us as he didn't have a list - just remembered your face I guess. Had a few beers before being sat. I saw someone else order a bottle of red wine for $19! Even if it's cheap wine, it's still what you'd pay at Jewel. . . The pot pies are the way to go. The salad was great and perfect for our party of four. We all got the half-pounders with options of mushrooms, sausage or white/wheat crust. Great service from a guy who had been working for 10 hours. Stiff wood benches but all is forgotten when the pizza arrived. Completely unique and absolutely delicious. How can you loose?. . Only four stars for the lack of reservations and the constant worry that if you weren't in the host's face, he might skip over you. We'll be back sooner than later. $88 for four pizzas, big salad, and beers all around!
