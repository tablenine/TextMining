Alright, here is the shibangbang... This place is located in Downtown LA in Little Japan. So right off the get go I knew parking would be a problem. Aside from getting there in LA traffic on the 110, 10 meet, the area wasn't crazy full of people - but it had a good amount of pedestrian traffic for a Thursday night. The wait was long, luckily one of my friends had reserved a name for us, so we ended up getting seated around 50 minutes after putting our name down. The place is really tiny, not much seating, so I could see why it took so long. This place is definitely not good for a group of 5 and above. But once seated, the staff/service was good. We had fried rice, ramen, and dumplings. I felt the pricing and food were good - so I could see why this place was so busy. But it feels like you can't sit and eat for that long, because so many people are waiting and there is so little table/seating space. It kinda forced us out. All in all, I like the food, but the location, parking, and wait are not worth it - unless you are a die hard ramen lover.
