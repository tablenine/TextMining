Awesome sushi. As for the others that complain about the slow service (three hours... really???), Â I did not find that to be the case. There will always be an inherent wait time associated with ordering sushi no matter where you go, however, I found the entire experience at Hayakawa to be a very positive one and I would go back in a heartbeat. The sushi was as fresh and tasty as it gets.
