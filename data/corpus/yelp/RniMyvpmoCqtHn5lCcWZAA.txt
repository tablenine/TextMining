Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This may very well be the best kept insider secret in all of America's restaurantdom.  The prices are waaay low, the lines are waaay long, and the food is waaay good.  (not everything on the menu is good.)  Their name is about tacos, not tamales or burritos or anything else.  Get the TACOS.  Add cheese.  Maybe get some guacamole (not completely necessary). They will pencil it all down on their waitress pads, then tally the total on a little calculator, and take your CASH.  I love it when the people in front of me order like 6 dozen tacos for their office, then try to use the company card.  HA!  Go to subway.  Anyways, if you order that many tacos, or if you only order two tacos- they give you a mountain of chips and a pint of salsa.  It is very tasty, not spicy, just tasty.  If you eat it for here, get the large root beer, sit on the back patio, and play Ms. Pac-Man. I try to eat there when I drive up the 405.  I hate the 405.
