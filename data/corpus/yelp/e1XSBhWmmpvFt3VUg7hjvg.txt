Some of the best sushi I've had!. . I've been hearing about this place for quite some time now and I finally had an opportunity to try it out and it was incredible! It lived up to all it's praises.. . The place is not cheap but quality never is. However it's not so expensive that they don't put the prices on the menus, when you see that, expect mid range 3 figures for two people, in this case it was 3 figures for 3 people! The quality was sufficient to warrant the prices though and I felt I definitely got my money's worth. . . The atmosphere is rather up-scale, I however don't let that bother me when I go out to eat. My typical dress is shorts, t-shirt and flip-flops and I've been to some of the nicest restaurants in Beverly Hills dressed as such, money spends the same no matter what you look like.. . The service was attentive and I was very pleased with everything there. They really know what they're doing!
