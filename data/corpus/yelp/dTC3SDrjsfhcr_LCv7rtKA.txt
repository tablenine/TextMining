Went here last Sunday after visiting the Vahalla's Table in Costa Mesa the day before. Expectations were high after I had gotten recommendations from several friends as well as a nomination for best mid-priced fries in LA. For the most part, Wurstkuche met the expectations (with one caveat). I got the duck/bacon/jalapeño sausage and my wife got the Austin Blues. I intentionally got the same sausage at Vahalla's Table so I could see which sausage house reigns supreme in SoCal. While Vahalla's Table was a close match food wise, other elements were somewhat behind Wurstkuche. Out of the two sausages, I actually liked my wife's better, as it seemed more juicy and flavorful. The one let down was the fries. After all the hype, I was expecting more; perhaps I just don't like that style of fries. Too much potato, not enough crunch. The dipping sauces were excellent, the chipotle mayo was great, blue cheese walnut was good, but could have used a stronger blue cheese punch and been a bit more creamy. For beer, I got the Allagash White, which was a great choice. In general, I'm excited for my next visit, although I see how the place can get crazy busy. There was a big rush right after we put our order in at about 12:15.
