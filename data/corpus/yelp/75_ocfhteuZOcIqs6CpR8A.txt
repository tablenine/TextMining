Restaurant: Mirai
Category: Sushi Bars
For those missing the hustle, bustle, and sophistication of New York, nothing in Chicago besides a good party can replace that, but Mirai is a decent substitute. Located in an amazing  modern open two story space  with cool international house music and other world beats the clientele are mostly cool lookers and  .  I'm not talking hipsters or cubs fans who consider proper Saturday night urbane dress  a button down from the Gap and extra hair gel.    . . Personally in terms of sushi I find the prices well adjusted for their creative creations and pairings, of fresh sushi. I love the spicy Mono.. . The beverages are never for lack of spirits and the wine served in glasses so big that I had to track down their origin so that I could own my own. The staff are friendly, sophisticated, knowledgeable and put together like the waitresses .  and waiters in New York who are just paying the bills while they work toward greatness in their studio or on the stage.  I prefer to dine upstairs but the sushi bar downstairs is also fun as  the boisterous Japanese Chefs are fun to watch while they preform their art and chat quickfire and happily amongst themselves in Japanese   . .  Do this!
