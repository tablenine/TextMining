Don't go here if you are looking for pizza, but it's good eating.. . We of course with with the pizza pot pies.  The half-pound is more than enough for one person.  And the thick layer of melted mozzarella cheese on top of the homemade sauce was delightful.  We also got the Mediterranean bread on our waiter's recommendation, which was dead on.. . As far as the wait, I live about a block away from this place, but the waits are usually ridiculous and they do not take reservations.  This was actually my third time trying to go here and we went b/c the wait was 15 mins.  Not sure if it would be worth the hour, but it's close.  I'd definitely go back . . . if the wait is under a half hour.. . And fyi, they don't take credit cards so be prepared.  Luckily, I had cash, but that is not always the case.  Also, the prices are pretty reasonable so that helps.
