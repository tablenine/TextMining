Great food and great prices. Good coffee too. And fun sandwiches and market items to take to go. Brunch is great - fresh squeezed juice and smoothies, good breakfast options and lots of coffee. . One downside - it's super noisy. Definitely don't go here if you want a quiet, calm evening. It gets loud and a little hectic at its busiest.. Also, recently they changed their bread - the selection is much better and fresher.
