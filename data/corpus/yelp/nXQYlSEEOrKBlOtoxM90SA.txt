Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
This was my first ever visit to Doc Chey's as I'm an out of towner. This place was recommended to me by an former resident of Atlanta.. . I went the takeout route and ordered the Dumplings and a Sesame Chicken with brown rice. Both were excellent.. . The dumplings were large and full of flavor. They were falling apart a bit but that could be explained by the extra time in the to-go container.. . The flavor in the Sesame Chicken was very good. They describe it as a spicy hoisin but I didn't really taste any heat in the sauce.. . Incredibly friendly service and great food prepared to order - that's a terrific combination.
