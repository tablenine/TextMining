yeah, I'm the 100th review of the fantastic restaurant. Went with a date; didn't so much want to impress (it's not fancy), but wanted to go somewhere fun and "of the moment." And that's exactly what this place is.. . Pulled up to a $7.50 valet (street parking's also available) and walked in. I had called earlier to see if they had any tables available due to cancellations, but the only slot they had was for 11pm, so I took my chances with the walk-in bar. The hostess (very friendly) put me on their waitlist and said it could be as long as an hour if everyone on the list stuck around. . . The decor is casual but nice; great tunes (Talking Heads all night), boisterous and fun crowd; no attitude. High ceilings, tasteful decor - all in all very nice interior.. . Rather than hang out in the small entryway near the bar, we were offered the end of a banquette in the dining room, where another friendly server offered to get us drinks. . . Wines by the glass range from $8 up to the teens - and bottles are also available on the two-sided fold-up paper menu. The whole vibe is very casual. Amazingly, we were seated in 10-15 minutes at seats at the bar. Very friendly bartender/server hooked us up with suggestions and we were off. Ordered two starters; an amazing caprese salad that uses small baked tomatoes on the vine, seated on a generous portion of locally made burrata (soft, bufala mozzarella-esque) cheese ($12). . . Second appetizer was the asparagus grilled in oil with prosciutto - also very tasty and $8. We then split one pizza; a fungi and fontina cheese delight ($14) that smelled and tasted so good I could have eaten another right away. But I didn't need to because we were good to go. . . Total bill for 2 starters, a pizza and a couple drinks; $85 with tip. Not bad!. . Definitely lives up to the hype, I'll be going back soon.
