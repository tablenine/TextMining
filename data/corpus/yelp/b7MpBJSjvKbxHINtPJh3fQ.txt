Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I go to Orochon a few times a month, its the perfect cure to a vicious hangover.  Aside from the time my boyfriend found a beansprout segment which looked way too much like a bug egg sac casing in his iced tea, Ive always had a great time here!. "shoyu ramen # 3 please, no pork add an egg...arigato". . It isn't the best ramen in the world, but it is FAR from the worst, plus I like spicy...A LOT.  I also like options, this place is amazing for both.  The prices are also pretty agreeable.  . . gososama!
