Restaurant: Wishbone
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Wishbone is #2 in my West Loop breakfast cycle.  There's a ton of seating and even though there's usually a wait-- it never lasts long. . . I would say the majority of the menu is worth ordering and that's always a benefit at breakfast.  They also serve liquor, which cannot be said for their counterparts in the West Loop breakfast game.. . I'm a HUGE fan of the breakfast potatoes-- perfectly fried w/ soft rings of onions.. for my tastes, no one does them better.  The egg dishes are great, the shrimp and grits and crunchy french toast also can't be missed.. . Unfortunately, the service is below average more often then not, but the experience as a whole is always pleasant.  You can ensure that with a bloody mary!. . (If you couldn't tell from my blatant dropping of the word "breakfast"-- that's as far as my recommendation goes.  I tried dinner once.  NO good.)
