This place is extremely small that I usually just take my food to go.  I've tried 2 items on the menu.  One is the Hainan chicken that many people have already mentioned, and the other is the steak.. . I have to agree with everyone that the Hainan chicken is just so delicious.  I don't think I've ever had anything close to it.  YUM-O~!  But the steak, on the other hand, is just yuck.  It was so dry and overly seasoned with black pepper.  The sauce it comes with was just too overpowering as well.. . I'd encourage everyone to try their Hainan chicken, but I'm not sure about anything else on the menu.....
