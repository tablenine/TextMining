Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place is probably one of the only things I miss about living in Culver City. The hordes of people outside of this place are there for a reason! Please, if you're ever in the LA area, make Paco's a stop on your itinerary. . . LA is definitely not known for good Mexican food, (sorry guys, San Diego has you beat on this!) but Paco's definitely delivers in this category. From the fantastic, reasonably priced margaritas, to the old ladies hand making tortillas, and right down to the tacky-as-sin decor, this restaurant has a special place in my heart. . . The owner is super-friendly and usually standing around by the front entrance watching a soccer game, or chatting with customers. If the wait seems a bit long, make sure to order a margarita and hang out in the waiting area with some chips and salsa!. . Highlights: . 1. The buckets of chips are still warm when they're served. 2. Portion size; always enough to share . 3. Margaritas; they have fun flavors like mango. 4. Authentic Dishes (cochinito pibil is delish!) . 5. Tortillas. Seriously, you could make a whole meal out of  a couple flour tortillas and half a stick of butter! These are  just about as close as I've found to the ones my grandma used to make when we were kids
