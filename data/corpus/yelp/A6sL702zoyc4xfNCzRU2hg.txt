Had the prosciutto, black mission fig jam pizzetta with gorgonzola and scallions, white truffle oil and mushroom mac &amp; cheese, crispy parmesan chicken paillard, and the cumin spiced pork chop. Â The complimentary hummus was the best part of the meal. It had a great bright, fresh, and lemony flavor! The flavors on the pizzetta were good, but the crust wasn't that great. Mac &amp; cheese was so-so and disappointing. The chicken paillard was bland, but the mashed potatoes were quite good. The pork chop was pretty good.
