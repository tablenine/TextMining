Everyone knows what Whole Foods is like and you love it but hate the prices.  This particular one is a little smaller but still has great selection of most of the things you find in a regular Whole Foods, including a giant salad and prepared foods area.  I tend to stop at Whole Foods if I'm just looking to get dinner when I don't feel like cooking, rather than doing my shopping for all pantry staples.. . I'm giving away some of my secrets here...value= it depends on your perspective:. - Seared tuna and salad:  Fill one of recyclable paper containers at the salad bar with mixed greens and spinach- it's light so it'll be under $2.   I got half of a container today and it was 88 cents.  Pick up seared tuna tataki in the sushi cooler for under $10.  The sauce that it comes with makes a great dressing.. - 10 pieces sashimi of salmon and tuna is $12.  At any sushi restaurant, you either get about 6 pieces for around that price, or you'll shell out $20+ for the same amount for sushi grade sashimi.. - 365 sorbet- not just in lemon, but in fancy flavors like pomegranate, passion fruit and hibiscus.  A tiny scoop at an ice cream shop would run you $3-4, but here you get a whole pint!  Heaven for the lactose-intolerant.. - 12 Bakery fresh chocolate chip cookies for under $5.  While not as cheap as a $2 bag of Oreo knockoffs, the yummy cookies are worth the "splurge", especially when you compare it to the $1-2 single cookie cost at a neighborhood bakery.. - Recyclable bag refund:  Get 10 cents back, versus 5 cents or 0 cents at other supermarkets.
