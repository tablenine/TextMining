Restaurant: Mr. Pizza
Category: Pizza
I tend to be very picky about pizza and a friend had suggested going to eat here. As we entered the restaurant the atmosphere was quite nice, kept imagining a hole in the wall. They have great service, the waiter promptly serves you and speedy food. It was pretty inexpensive for two people plus we left quite full. Overall the experience there was great, I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a different taste in pizza. They also have great hot wings, I'll defnintely be returning here soon.
