Our favorite Chinese in the city. Authentic Vegetarian Chinese dishes available... You'll probably get the hard-workingest man in Atlanta, Eddie, as your server. He's probably the friendliest server I've ever met and remembers us all by name. Back to the scrumptious food: Don't miss the Chicken Drumsticks as an appetizer, as well as the amazing Wonton Soup. The Hot &amp; Sour (can be ordered without egg) packs some serious bite.. Order if you have congestion. Keeping it authentic... Try the String Beans with Preserved Tofu. If you need a faux meat fix, the Curry Chicken (ask for "Ginger" Chicken) is great, as is the Mongolian Beef and the unbeatable Fish Filets. Wash it all down with a Coconut Bubble Tea and a vegan Fortune Cookie. Honestly, you can't go wrong at Green Sprout. Totally recommended.
