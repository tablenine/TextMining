I stopped here for a quick dinner with a friend before a show a the Largo Room down the street.  La Cienega doesn't have the widest choices at 7 p.m. on a weeknight, so this was the convenient choice.  . . Service was prompt and we were seated almost immediately.  I ordered the RFD Burger and my friend had the Vivas Las Pasta (fettuccine w/tempeh "meatballs").  My burger was ok, a little on the bland side and the tempeh patty had the color and consistency of play-doh.  Seriously, it was bright red.  I was starving so I inhaled the whole thing.  I honestly prefer Native Foods tempeh "meats" since they tend to have a more solid consistency.  The burger patty kept oozing out of my bread, which was a little too crunchy to qualify as a good burger bun.  I also had the mashed potatoes for a side, and they were dry and bland.  My friend didn't have much to say about his plate of pasta except to say that it was ok.  They did have a decent wine selection, and I recommend the Syrah.  . . All in all, it was a pretty mediocre dining experience.  I've definitely had more innovative and well-prepared vegan food than what I had here.  Their dining room is also pretty cramped, so I felt really claustrophobic throughout my meal and couldn't wait to get out of there.  Meh, I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to try this place out.
