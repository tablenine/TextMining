Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
Reza's is good food - huge portions, very tasty delights and friendly service.  I love all the kebab action.  I tried the shrimp kabobs last week and they were fantastic - garlicky and delicious.. . The naan rocks, too.  Really good with the feta and the tomato soup to start.  Love that jasmine rice!. . Good stuff all around.  Definitely check this place out.
