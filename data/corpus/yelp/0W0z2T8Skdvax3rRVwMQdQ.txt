Just as the rating machine says, "A-OK". I had the carne asada on my first visit and it was deliciously juicy but last time I got pork short ribs that were dry and mostly bone. Don't come here for an intimate event- it's one large room inside and very noisy. But if you're willing to wait for outdoor seating, you'll enjoy a better atmosphere and it's always a good time watching snoody rich people getting rude with the valets.
