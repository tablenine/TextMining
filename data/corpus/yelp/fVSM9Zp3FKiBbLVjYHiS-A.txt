This place was just OK. I was shopping in Wicker Park and needed some FAST food so I stopped in for a quesadilla. First of all, the staff has only the most basic comprehension of English - to the point that they aren't familiar with their own menu items. It was really frustrating to try to build my own quesadilla, especially since all I wanted was rice, beans and cheese. Seems like a common combo but apparently it was an impossible concept to grasp for the counter person.. . The quesadilla was most tortilla and very light on the filling. Had I known I'd be paying $8 for a flour tortilla and a quarter cup of refried beans I would have assembled it myself at home!
