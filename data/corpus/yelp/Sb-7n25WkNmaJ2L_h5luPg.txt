I loved my experience at Flip.  We arrived at 11:15 to avoid the legendary lines that everyone keeps crying about.  Here's a tip...if you don't want to wait, go at an off-peak time!. . The space is beautiful and cleverly designed.  I love the flat screens in the giant frames and the booths with an upside down booth hanging from the ceiling are amazing!  The tables in the center of the room are close together, so you have a retro communal type feeling.  . . Now on to the food...I had a traditional bacon cheese burger and it was great.  Perfectly cooked and I have to say for all you bacon lovers out there...the bacon is insanely good.  My by and I shared the fries, which were really flavorful and crispy.  He had the Flip burger but added the homemade pimento cheese and said it was great.  . . They also have a great assortment of retro bottled sodas --even Cheerwine!  We both ate to the stuffing point for $21.90, which we thought was fair for the quality of food and the great atmosphere.. . We'll definitely be back!
