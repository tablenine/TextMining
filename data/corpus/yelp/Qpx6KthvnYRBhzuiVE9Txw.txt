I don't get it! I seriously don't get it! . . The place has characters, the pretty auntie behind the counter looks cute for their age, but ..... . Wet sandwich is just .... gross! I stood in line for 20 mins expecting somewhat an amazing french dip. I've had better, less gross, french dip sandwich before. . . I ordered the beef sandwich, french dipped. Some people ordered a double dip. Really?!. . Serious, the only thing I like about this place is their pink pickled eggs, $0.10 coffee and a can of sprite. I'm sorry, I tried. . . Maybe I am just not a wet sandwich kinda gal.
