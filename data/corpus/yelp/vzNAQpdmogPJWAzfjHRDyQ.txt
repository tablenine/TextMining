This place should be ashamed to call itself Vietnamese food.  I have eaten at many Pho places around town, and this place is mediocre at best.  All the hipsters in Silverlake don't know what they are talking about when it comes to good Pho.  Try Absolutely Phobulous instead.  That place is tasty.  This place is just... meh.
