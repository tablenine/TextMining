Restaurant: Feed
Category: American (Traditional)
Feed might otherwise be a 4.5, thanks to its relative distance from what some might call the "beaten path." However, the wall of framed prints from the book "Extraordinary Chickens" tips the scale solidly back into 5 territory. . . Coupled with extremely friendly service, no wait for weekend brunch, and some devilishly delicious pulled pork hash, Feed is a great spot for some breakfast that'll stick to your ribs.
