Went there last Saturday, since Adam C mentioned on his radio show. The menu is set, do NOT fill up on the salad bar, just enough salad to cover the plat if all spread out. Get some tomaote slices and heart of palm. Don't eat the bread, though very good, it will fill you up too quick. The meat was great and they kept it coming, i had to flip to red just to finish a conversation. Bacon wrappen filet, pork ribs, filet mignon and baby calf?? Â maybe, all I know is it was nice and red, and not over salted. I pass on the sausage, chicken wings, pork loin. I think B Real was there or another dude that looks exactly like him anyway. It's 56$ a head for dinner, don't go unless your starving, otherwise it is a waste. My GPS pointed me the wrong way for some reason, it was a few blocks south of the Mall, the GPS took me to the mall. . We always go to Agorra in Irvine, but I think the meat is a little better here, but the price is a little better at Agoora.
