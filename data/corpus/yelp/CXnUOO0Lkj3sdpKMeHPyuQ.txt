Thank goodness I read the reviews on Yelp &amp; knew ahead of time to bring cash.  Last night my friend &amp; I got here just in the knick of time - 6:45.  It was crowded, but not nearly as crowded as I expected it to be.  I was looking for the white board, but didn't see it.  Thankfully, the waitress noticed and pointed to it and minutes later, we were seated at the sushi bar.  THANK GOD.  Because the crowd rolled in shortly after.  We would've had to wait for a long time, had we not shown up when we did.  . . Not knowing what to do, who to give our order to, we waited for almost ten minutes before one of the chefs gave us that "look."  He didn't  say anything, he wasn't even standing in front of us, but the "look" was enough for me to know - "give him your order."  So,  I started yelling my order in English to him.  He gave me a puzzled look which made me question, "Should I have ordered in Japanese?  There are Japanese names next to the fish.  Damnit, how rude, I hope I didn't offend him."  . . We tried almost 7 kinds of fish &amp; each piece exceeded the last.  My favorites were the Spanish Mackerel (damn, forgot the name already) and Toro (fatty tuna).  Mmmmmmmmmm....My co-worker &amp; boss warned me that since Hide closes at 9, this might not be the best place to sit around and talk b/c they will probably try to rush you out.  But my dining companion &amp; I did not feel that way at all.  We left b/c we wanted dessert.. . It was a great meal and for $50 between the two of us (with tax &amp; tip), I left feeling very satisfied.  I will DEFINITELY BE BACK.  Finally, I've found another place for good sushi.  . . (Oh, &amp; I guess I didn't offend the chef b/c as we were getting up to leave, he said good-bye and gave us a slight smile.)
