When I went, it was a really good day for tuna. Anything tuna tasted crazy delicious. The freshness of their fish is definitely something. . . However.. . Minus one star, because it is overpriced, the wait is insanely long, and their parking lot is always full. . . Minus another star, because the sides that came with the sushi combo were really really really bad.. . I left my meal a little unsatisfied, a little unfulfilled.
