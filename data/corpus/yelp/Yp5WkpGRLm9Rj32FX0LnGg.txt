Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I had heard about this place as a classic landmark lunch spot, so I tried it.  I'm not the biggest pastrami fan, so take my comments with a grain of salt...  . . The pastrami was fatty, the burgers and fries were greasy.  I was disappointed.  The sandwiches were expensive, and there was nothing there that I couldn't get somewhere else, cheaper and less greasy.. . On the plus side, if you like kitchy, greasy spoons, I suppose it could be fun.  If you like people-watching, the wait-staff (all women) and the cooks (all men) were characters worthy of notice.. . Two final warnings: you can't pay with credit, and you can't eat outside by yourself during lunch.
