Came here for a late lunch and still had to wait in line!  At least the line was indoors and not yet outdoors.  Waited less than 30 minutes from the time I entered and the time I got my food.  Thumbs up to the fact that they use recycled napkins!  They had a variety of cool but overpriced sodas ($3.50 cucumber one was good).  My friend liked his Rattlesnake a lot - he didn't even need to put any sauces on it.  I didn't really like my sausage too much, though, and prefer a regular hot dog with no wait any day, though the sausages here are definitely quality.  Guess I'm just not a big fan.  Prices are also not cheap, although it's def better than an $8 hot dog at the Coliseum!  . . -Rattlesnake and Rabbit (w/ Sweet Peppers and Onion)  - I had been prepared for the worst, but I actually liked this sausage better than my own!  It had a mildly spicy flavor but was very tasty.  Would never have guessed it was made from snakes and bunnies!. -Rabbit, Veal, and Pork (w/ Onions) - Eh.  Had a strong pepper taste that I didn't like.  It was very juice, however.  Got this with a double serving of cooked onions.  . -Large Belgian Fries - These were the thick kind, which I normally don't like, but they were much crispier than regular fatty fries.  Didn't love them but I'd recommend them.  Got the Curry Ketchup (gonna make myself some of this delicious stuff next time) and the Pesto Mayo (somewhat flavorless).. . Had no idea the room in the back existed.  Another reviewer complained about not being able to order beer back there, but you can now.  They had two bartenders.  I really liked the back area - it was spacious and reminded me of a woodsy cafeteria.  I think they had some seating outside, too.
