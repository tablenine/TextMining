The most delicious sandwiches in the world. This place gets crowded before Laker/Dodger/SC games but even at its peak the wait isn't too unmanageable (maybe 20-25 min). The pork sandwiches are awesome, double dipped is too soggy for my taste, but to each their own. They serve surprisingly good wines by the glass if thats what youre into as well...
