It is a very interesting place to eat where we can try different kind of sausages. I tried the Rattlesnake and the Alligator. The rattlesnake is good and quite salty. I am not the fan of the alligator though :(. . I think the taste of the food here is only okay. It does not taste any special. The portion of the bread is too large for the sausages. I bet it will taste better if the sausage is bigger. and I think it is quite expensive for the portion. But, as it used different kinds of exotic ingredients, I can understand the price.. I would still suggest to try this place just to try different kind of exotic ingredients. But, don't expect too much since it taste nothing special except if you imagine you are eating snake rabbit buffalo etc. ;)
