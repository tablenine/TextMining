Love their garlic noodles...crab is good too...EXPENSIVE though... I don't know, I'm in a bit of a dichotomy.  I mean, I love the fact that its "upscale" and has a strong "American" fan based, but what happened to the good old days when you can get really good Vietnamese food for less??  Don't get me wrong, I love this place, but I think they're a little overpriced for what they serve.
