Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
You know how you're at work and you get a craving for Thai food?  But it has to be really good Thai food?  That happened today.  It's cold, rainy and a whole lotta miserable outside my office in the West Loop.  Three of my coworkers and I decided to order some food 15 minutes before our lunch hour started.  Butterfly said it would take 45 minutes to be delivered.  It was actually delivered in 27 minutes.  Awesomeness.  Everything was piping hot (except for the sushi, as that would be wrong) and did I mention inexpensive?  Most of the entrees were in the $7.00 range.  Large portions, delicious food and quick delivery service.
