Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
Its a restaraunt!. No, no... its a bistro!. No... its a coffee shop!. Nuh uh!  Its a bakery!. . Well... its all of those things actually.  Until recently I had my doubts that a place could be so many things at once and pull any of them off credibly.  But we had family down for a visit and the sweet tooths won the day.  . . Ok, a word on sweets.  Forget sweet tooth.  This place is for sweet FANGS.  The big razor sharp predatory ones good only for tearing flesh from bone.  Except its sweets.  But it will still give you that satisfied feeling I imagine the sabertooth tiger had when it sank those mouth daggers into the side of a gazelle... with lemon filling and a powdered sugar top.. . Of course, for you nonpredatory types, Cafe Selmarie is an excellent grazeland as well.  It doesn't get any more Lincoln Square than actually being in the SQUARE part.  In the middle of summer, with the fountain just a few feet away, you can graze to your hearts content on bistro deliciousness and watch the local wildlife.. . Just stay out of my way when I'm hunting for lemon bars.
