Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
2.5. . Long story short: Eh.. . The Good:. -atmosphere outside. -it's in culver city. . The Bad:. -the food was really sub par- Â it was like I was waiting for goodness the whole time, and it never appeared. not that this place is that expensive, but for the money there are FAR better places, such as Il Forno (the one on ocean park, next to the Counter, not il fornaio). Far better food, same or lower price...though I guess it's not really in a cool area or anything.... . Basically it's not worth going out of your way for. it's only good if you're there and really really crave sit down italian (if you're cool with order-at-the-counter italian in culver city, check out Victor Jr.'s.
