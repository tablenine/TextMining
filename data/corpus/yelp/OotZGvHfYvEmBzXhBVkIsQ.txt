Fried Mac &amp; Cheese Balls!. . Just do yourself a favor, grab a seat at the counter and order up a plate of them.  Delicious mac and cheese rolled in bread crumbs and deep fried to a gorgeous golden brown.  Good Lord, they're good.  I've been known to make a meal out of them at all times of day and night.  mmmmm.... . . Great pancakes, grilled cheese, fries, and shakes too.  Its a little pricey for what you get, but totally worth it when you're hungry at 3 a.m.
