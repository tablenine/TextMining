Great food with a Hawaiian flavor. The fish was excellent, we were celebrating my girlfriends birthday and they even wrote out her name and a Hawaiian Happy B-day on the plate in chocolate without making an embarrassing fuss of her. The tables were a bit cramped by the window but it looks like there are some other options.
