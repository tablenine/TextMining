Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Living in LA for the last three years I have never been to Roscoe's. I know, how sad huh? Well I finally got to go! I was so excited. I sorta starved myself knowing that I'd be facing a pretty heavy dinner. The funny thing is that even though I never had chicken and waffles, or any combination of food that resembles it, I had strong cravings for it at random points in my life. So, I finally decided to give my mouth some satisfaction.. . Upon arriving at the restaurant, I immediately felt hella thin. Nice and unexpected ego boost! I ordered the 1 chicken breast with 1 waffle and a side of mac and cheese per yelp's suggestion. I didn't get to finish everything but it was still very satisfying. The mac and cheese was kinda soft and soggy. Now, I have no clue what GOOD mac and cheese is supposed to taste like, since my only exposure to mac and cheese is through kraft's mac and cheese that I make at home. Is it supposed to be soggy and lumpy? If so, then yay, they had the best mac and cheese. Â The chicken was good. Now i know what people are talking about. the seasoning and the crispiness was definitely part of my daydreams. however, the dry inside made me a little sad so i take off one star for that. the waffle was good too, but not as good i expected since i actually had better waffles at a college dining hall. so i take off one star for that as well.. . otherwise, i would definitely go back again, especially when im sad or hungry.
