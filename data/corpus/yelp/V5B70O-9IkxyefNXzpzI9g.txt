Hey, I just realized this place is actually pretty good, and the food is more than just alright. It's right in my neighborhood, it's clean and open, and has plenty of outdoor seating. It's friendly and the menu is interesting enough for my tastes. I don't know what my problem was before, but I'll be back more often. Especially since Lula's is always busy, and my experiences there have been hit or miss. This place is like your couch on a Sunday afternoon. And if you complain about gentrification, yuppies, hipsters and yuppsters in the area, just move to the South Side. Inglewood, not Pilsen.
