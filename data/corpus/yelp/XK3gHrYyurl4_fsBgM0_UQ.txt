I have been to Nava twice.  Once for lunch and the other time for happy hour.  Lunch was excellent. I had the red snapper, which is a very generous portion along with some mashed potatoes in a mole sauce...yummy!  They first start you off with some warm cornbread, which is awesome.  Happy hour....their sangrias were really good.  I like the ambiance as well.  Although both times, I have sat outside to enjoy the nice fountain.  It's also quite romantic.....
