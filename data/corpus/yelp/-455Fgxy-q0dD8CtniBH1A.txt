burgers, fries, beer.  those are what you come here for.  all the other stuff on the menu just aint that good.  well, its not that its not good, but its nothing special.. . ambience is good, beer selection is GREAT!!!!. . i cant say its the best burger in LA, but its among the best... its different... perhaps overhyped.
