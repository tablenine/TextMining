At a suggestion of one of my BF's friends we met them here for a birthday dinner. The service was amazing and the prices are very fair. I had the lasagna which was made with homeade spinach pasta and as far as Italian goes this was amazing!!! My BF had a steak dish and it was cooked perfectly and super tender! I will eat here again... often!
