Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The only thing that worth mentioning is probably the skin of the xlb. It's thin but chewy. For the rest of the dishes, go to J&amp;J. The crab xlb is way better.. . One thing I can't tolerate is the service. I know it's a Chinese place with a line of people waiting to be seated, but do you really need to bring out the check together with the order? I mean, seriously?!. . Having tried the Din Tai Fung in Beijing, for me, this one looks like a slump reconstructed after WWII.
