Once again, reviewing a chain place because the service is always TOP NOTCH at this location! The hostess stand could use a little work, but if you aren't shy and speak up, it's fine. Once I'm seated, I know the service is always up to par. The servers are always on hand to make a little conversation before you order and if Happy Hour is about to end, they ALWAYS check up on you so you can get your last drinks in before it ends. . . Happy Hour, fantastic!. . Almost always packed, so be prepared.
