Everything about it made me want to like it better than the original. Especially since the only reason why I wouldn't give the original a 5 is because it is so crowded and finding a seat becomes an episode of wild kingdom. BUT the burger wasn't as good and the crowd / vibe wasn't the same. It was pretty and spacious. It was like you were dating someone that's prettier but seems to be a little empty somehow. Maybe it will take some time before it gets a culture of it its own.
