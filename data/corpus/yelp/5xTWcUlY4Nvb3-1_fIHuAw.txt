The food is really good! I ordered the caesar salad and an iced chai latte. Really simple but so delicious! The croutons in the salad were really cheesy and crunchy...yum! My sister got a burger which was really moist and juicy. It looked really delicious. We got our food really quickly and they have friendly service. They have amazing looking desserts. The cupcakes, cookies, and ice cream sundaes looked amazing! Unfortunately I didn't have any dessert but next time I'm in town, I will definitely try all of it! I really liked the location of the restaurant, close to the Beverly Center and cute boutiques. The restaurant is on a corner, which is nice for people watching when you sit outside. I will definitely be back!
