Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Don't believe the hype. How Philippe's became an institution, I'll never now. The idea is great, the food is not. If you like grade D over cooked roast beef, Philippe's is your place. The french dip at Houston's is FAR superior to Philippe's. . . With that said, it is cheap and the kitch is great. You will be transported to another era when you enter but, like I said DON'T Believe the hype!
