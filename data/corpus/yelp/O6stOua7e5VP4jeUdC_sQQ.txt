Category: Pizza
We went on a recommendation from our friends and it was worth it.  They have individual pizzas that are perfect size.  Not too much, not too little.  We had a sausage pizza and the Lou, both with the butter crust for an extra 75 cents.  TASTY.  Crust is not super thick and crispy.  The flavors are fantastic.
