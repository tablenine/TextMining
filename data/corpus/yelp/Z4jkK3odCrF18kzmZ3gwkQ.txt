This place is great. Dare I say the Jim's Steaks of the West Coast -when you want a delicious hot meat and bread style sandwich. And they even share in their militancy. (Philippe's with the money being put on the trays). . . Must get beef or lamb double dipped or wet to truly enjoy the experience.. . All they nay sayers tell me where you can get a better sandwich?
