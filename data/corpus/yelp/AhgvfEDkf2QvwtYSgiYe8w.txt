I came here with high expectations. I expected it to be so much better than Pink's in Hollywood. I ordered the char cheddar dog and cheddar fries. I was not impressed by the cheese sauce. I thought it had a weird flavor to it. I really like the toppings at Pink's better but I thought the dog itself is better here.
