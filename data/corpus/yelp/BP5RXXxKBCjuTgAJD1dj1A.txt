I love the yu xiang eggplant and pork.  I've had it twice and both times, the dish was just delicious.  What I particularly loved about it was that, in spite of the very tasty and slightly spicy sauce, you could still taste the flavors of each individual ingredient (the succulent, tender pork, the juicy and plump eggplant, the crisp, mellow bamboo shoots...).  The parts all came together to create a harmonious dish.  The hot and sour soup was yummy, too.  . . I think it's really hard for any restaurant to get everything right.  With that in mind, I do not really recommend the pad thai.  I tried my friend's and was not impressed.  Pad thai is actually quite difficult to make correctly, and those who make it well know what they're doing.  The pad thai here wasn't bad, it just wasn't that great.  . . The wait staff are attentive and friendly.  I'll definitely be going back for more.  :)
