Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Now I know where all the unemployed actors go to eat lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The place looked like an audition with good-looking people standing around waiting for good-looking food.. . Still, while this particular Father's Office resembles one of those velvet rope Hollywood clubs with people standing around holding their drinks, the menu makes it worth a non-rush hour lunch stop with friends who can hang out.. . Dare I say that the "no substitutions or changes" burger does live up to all the hype as one of the best in town!  Mind you, I love ketchup and pickles, and I've never been a fan of bleu cheese.  And yet, this burger melts into your mouth!. . Next time, I'll have to try more of the mouth-watering appetizers.  Although I can't imagine how insane this place must be for dinner on the weekends...
