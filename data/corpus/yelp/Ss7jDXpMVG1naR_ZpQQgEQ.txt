So I don't get to this side of town often, but when I'm headed to Doughboy's, I always stop into this little bar first! The wrestler theme is like no other bar I've ever seen, and there is a real sense of pride in the decor. I especially love the masks in the skylight, keeping watch over the patrons, as well as the paintings lining the walls. . . I've never had the food, since my only reason for venturing to this area is for the banana pancakes next door, but the atmosphere is definitely cool for a drink or two, or three.
