Restaurant: Adobo Grill

I hosted a baby shower at Adobo Grill and I can't say enough about how great the staff was at every step. I worked with George, their event planner, and was able to secure a private room, with my choice of table set up, and a great menu that was lunch oriented instead of brunch. (Though they have a brunch, a dinner, and a cocktail appetizer menu as well.) Â It was the cheapest prix fixe menu I found, and of course, Adobo's food is delicious. Everyone had a great time. I highly recommend them for a baby shower, a cocktail party, or just a fun birthday party. It was really easy and fun.
