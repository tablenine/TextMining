You should probably bring an extra pair of underwear with you, because you're going to splooge yourself when you taste the:. . True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef, Rib Eye Steak . . You'll remember it forever- which is a blessing and a curse, because no other steak will compare to it. Save up some money ($160 for 8 ounces) and enjoy!
