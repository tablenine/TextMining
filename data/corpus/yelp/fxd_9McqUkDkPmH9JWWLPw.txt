Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I only give this place two stars because it's historical and an LA landmark.  I'm a diehard LA fan, so I agree that if you haven't been, you should hit this place up.  It's a good spot to try out before Dodger games.  . . HOWEVER, the french dip sandwiches ARE NOT the business.  They're pretty small, the bread is not very fluffy, nor fresh, nor tasteful, and it's basically a cafeteria-style looking spot.  Peanuts on the floor, wooden tables, pretty nostalgic, but nothing special with the food.. . I NEVER crave going back to Phillipe's, but if I'm with someone who really wants to try it out, I'm always down.
