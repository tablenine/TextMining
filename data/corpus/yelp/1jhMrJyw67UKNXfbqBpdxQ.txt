Let's bump you up to four stars. I got the pork fried rice.. similar to the pork chop fried rice but without the bone. I think I don't eat as much or something because last time I ate here I only felt 70-80% full, but this time, I was perfectly satisfied. Did I drink more tea this time? Did I arrive on a not so empty stomach? I don't know.  The pork fried rice, though, wasn't that greasy. On previous visits, I've felt that their fried rice was made with a lot of oil, but not this time.  The pork itself was fine.  The portion was ample. I'd probably order this again next time I come.
