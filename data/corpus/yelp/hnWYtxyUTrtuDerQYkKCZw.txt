I don't really eat pastrami, though my boyfriend swears theirs is divine (I've sampled a bite here and there and I can't disagree).  What I'd like to tell you about is the smoked whitefish.  Wonderful, moist, and with great accompaniments.  Exactly what you would expect from a NY deli.  Langer's does not disappoint.  Even if you aren't a pastrami eater.
