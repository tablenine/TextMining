Was subjected to their horrible attempt at replicating Spanish cuisine approximately 4 years ago.  Needless to say, I haven't yet been able to eliminate this experience from my memory.. . I ordered the paella, not only was the flavor profile warped but it contained about 3 pounds of meat and only a handful of rice.  . . I don't know why this restaurant is so popular and always full.  I suppose its patrons only have drinks.
