Homeslice Justin hooked it up with a free sample of the delicious-sounding (despite the name) Oinksterade.  The only thing missing from it was some good quality vodka.  Or just some Taaka.  . . Justin and the 'ade were my favorite parts of this place.  He was excellent service and made Ericka L. and I laugh.  . . I had the pastrami which was okay.  I was raised on the Hat's pastrami so I'm kinda biased.  It wasn't better than the Hat's pastrami in my opinion.  But what the hell do I know?. . I know that the gossip catch-up session I had with Ericka made this place way more enjoyable than if I had gone in alone.  . . And I know that I'm not the only one who can come up with clever 'ade names.  Loverade anyone?  ;)
