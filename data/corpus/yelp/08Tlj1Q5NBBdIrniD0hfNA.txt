Went out with the wife for a quick lunch on Saturday and decided to give this place a try.  I pass it every night while I am working and was always curious about their food.  I was impressed with just about everything at this place.  The decor was nice and it has a nice open feel despite being located underneath the el tracks.  I had the meatball sammich thing and it was AWESOME! Delicious and filling and not too expensive.  My wife had the Korean bbq kogi and it was also quite good from the 2 bites I was able to get from her.  We shared the bacon choclate chip soft serve for desert.  It was good but not great.  The soft serve was really good, I wasn't crazy about the toppings though.  A good solid place for a quick meal.
