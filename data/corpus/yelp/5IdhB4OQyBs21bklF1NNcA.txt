Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
The decor was certainly interesting and the months of waiting I think built up some serious expectations. At the end of the day this place looks and tastes  like Ping Pong, albeit with a slightly cheaper price point.... That basically means that this is one of those restaurants that tries to coverup extremely average and thoughtless food with decor and hopes that no one notices. I found myself getting extremely annoyed by the reframing of standard, banal, appetizers like calamari and shumai as "Thai Tapas" and with the exception of the prawns, the food lacked any sort of taste. . . Some specifics: the ducks crepes was flavorless and the sesami chicken tasted worse than something I would get from a mall food court. The prawns were good but hardly filling,  and the calamari was fine.  . . This place felt like 2 stars while I was there, but I think I'm being a bit unfair. The food and ambiance combo really are a welcome addition to the neighborhood given the prices and it's temporary BYOB. That said, there are some things that can be done to make the food flavorful and actually somewhat indicative of Thai cuisine rather than random-ass pan Asian.. . UPDATE: They seem to be downsizing their portions, maybe because of the economy. My seaweed salad was enough for maybe three bites and I get very annoyed when they hide huge amounts of cucumber under it to make it look like more than it is. The size of the sushi rolls are also demonstrably smaller. Why pay these prices when I can can go to one of the many establishments other on broadway that offer virtually the same thing?
