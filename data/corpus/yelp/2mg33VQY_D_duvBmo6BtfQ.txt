Super cute place. Very authentic Italian feeling. There is ALWAYS a wait here, so plan to stay for a while. When you walk in, don't be confused that there is not a hostess. They only take "names" by remembering your face. The food is excellent. The pizza is good and the sandwiches are amazing, but HUGE!
