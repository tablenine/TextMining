I really like that this place exists.  It's perfect if you want to go out for dinner, but feel like you were went out and did something more exciting than dinner.  When you walk in, it has a very loungey/clubby atmosphere, and the bar to the left is hopping.  Then to the right there's lots of tables for sit down dining, but the lounge atmosphere carries over nicely.. . The menu is very interesting, sort of Asian, but with lots of twists.  My group decided to order a series of appetizers, instead of meals.  The big standout was a sushi crunch role that was amazing.  Everything we had was tasty though.  It's not cheap, but the atmosphere doesn't lead you to believe it will be.  . . When the time is right, I will definitely go back.
