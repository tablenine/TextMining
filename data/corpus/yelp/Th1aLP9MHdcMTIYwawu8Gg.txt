I've been meaning to come here for a while and I'm glad I finally did. I came here on a weekday morning for breakfast but I hear the weekend brunch is amazing. This place is usually packed during lunch and dinner, so I guess a weekday morning is a good time to come. It was still bustling with business, serving customers who either sat down and ate, or bought pastries and coffee to go.. . I had the New York Egg Sandwichm, which was 2 eggs, bacon and cheese sandwiched in a roll. I'm not a fan of bacon but the sound of runny, fried eggs and cheese really tempted me. It was a tasty and satisfying breakfast. I love, love, love runny egg yolks and the eggs in this sandwich was made perfectly. I hear the coffee here is really good, but I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't really comment on that.. . On days that I have a little more time, I'll definitely want to come back for lunch or dinner. I just hate driving around downtown and their one-way streets though.
