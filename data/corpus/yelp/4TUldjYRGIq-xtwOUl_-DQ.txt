I liked this place the first time I came because the seating and service was quick since there weren't many patrons. I would have given this place a 4 if it wasn't for the service the last two times I went.. . This place needs to start taking reservations. It should realize that it's not the Cheesecake Factory. Everyone would enjoy themselves a lot more if they didn't have to wait a 1 hour to be seated when they were initially told 15 minutes. Plus, since the restaurant is in Downtown where everything is closed at night, people can't even mull around in stores but have to wait in the restaurant. . . They have a nice deli and dessert display which looks delicious. As for samples since you will definitely be hungry during your wait.. . The food is decent. small portions - definitely not meant for family style though we tried.. - Portobello mushrooms fries - 4 stars. -
