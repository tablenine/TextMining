It's quite pricey for sausages, but it's really good. I always get the vegetarian chipotle with spicy peppers and grilled onions; plus a side of fries glazed with truffle oil. Yummy! The cucumber juice is refreshing, but I'd pass on the dessert (ice cream sandwich)-- it's not worth the price. I come here often and it's a great place to meet new, young people and have a conversation about art, current events, or whatever. . . BTW... the chipotle aioli is the best sauce.. . Simple. good.. . Don't forget to say hi to Elijah (I think that's how you spell his name)! He's super sweet and wears the cutest outfits -- rock the suspenders!
