Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I can't believe that I have never written a review about Tank. Tank is my favorite sushi spot...period. I have never had issues with freshness, service, or wait. Â Sushi is always an expensive meal, so I will say that I am that cheap bastard that waits until the weekend for their half-price menu to go into effect and it is ALWAYS worth the wait. As others have said, the Ocean Sundae and the Latin Heat are not to be missed. They are super fantastic. I'm a veggie so I appreciate the number of rolls they have for me AND the variety. I'm not relegated to some short section on some last page of their menu. They actually have really good, creative, vegetarian rolls. Yipppppeeeee! . . Yes, Tank is "trendy" which by definition means that they have low ambient house music pumping through the restaurant at all hours, that you pay like $3 for a mini coke in a glass bottle( this aint Applebee's folks, no free refills) and that seating is relatively "cozy" (tables are VERY close to each other..like keep your voices down when youre talking about STD's, that big heist youre planning, or how your husband is about to leave you for that new hot piece of ass at his office..I can hear you!), Despite that, Tank remains to be my most favorite place to eat. Not to be missed- the edamame (always fresh), the chopsticks (appetizer) and the veggie tempura roll. Mmmmmm...
