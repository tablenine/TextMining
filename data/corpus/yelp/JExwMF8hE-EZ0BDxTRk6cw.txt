This place gets four stars mainly for the menu.. so many burger options!  You have your steakhouse burgers (kobe, filet mignon, ny strip, etc.), your organic burgers, and then their 100% grade A american chuck beef burgers.  They also have a cheeseburger, and the cheese is handpicked by Murray's cheese team weekly.  So many topping choices too, ranging from truffled butter to a fried egg.  I had the cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and was very content.  My fiance had the M&amp;M burger, which is a burger flambéed in whiskey, topped with caramelized shallots, cheddar cheese, and apple smoked bacon.  This was better!
