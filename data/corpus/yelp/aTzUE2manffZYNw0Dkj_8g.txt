Our waiter provided exceptional service. The food was so-so, but I guess they change up the menu. Â The prices weren't that high. The menu seems to be very limited...There were probably about 5 entrees to choose from...and the same number of appetizers. . . I tried the strawberry pancake dessert and it was orgasmic. If not for the dessert, I don't know if I would go back again.
