Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Not that great.. . It took the server 20 mins to even realize we were there.. . The food is way over priced for fried chicken and a Eggo-ish waffle (it's not a good Belgium waffle at ALL).. . It's fun to say you've been, but the food isn't anything great. You get average chicken, with gravy, and a poor excuse of a waffle. A beware, you might have to walk to the kitchen window to ask the servers who is supposed to be waiting on you.
