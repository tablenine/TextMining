I'm always looking for fun new places to eat for lunch in Hollywood and this is absolutely one of them.  The menu is eclectic and varied which means many return trips to try all of the great sounding food.  . The wait staff was exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable about the chef's food and happy to make very good suggestions.  The food itself was innovative and very "yummy".  The best part of our lunch - the complimentary dessert the chef sent to our table "just because"...we appreciated his excellent food.
