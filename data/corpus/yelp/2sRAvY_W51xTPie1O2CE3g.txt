Veerasway is a great addition to the Randolph Street restaurant scene, but is still working out the kinks. We had a 7pm reservation for the community table and were seated promptly. It reminded me of Avec, but you are even closer to your neighboring diners. . . The scene is earthy, yet modern. They turned down the lights at around eight to give it a more romantic feel, but it didn't do it for me. The service was pretty good, but not great. One of the servers accidently spilled water on my date. . . We started out with cocktails. I had the drink with passionfruit and basil seeds. I don't recommend it. It's hard to have a conversation when you're sitting there trying to chew on the seeds of your cocktail. And, it wasn't that tasty. He had the pomegranite cocktail that had a hint of chilli pepper. It would have been perfect if you were going to have just one drink, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. We later both got the Veeralasse... a mango lasse with cinnamon on top. It was PERFECTION. . . For dinner, I went with the scallops. It came in a precious plate swimming in a coconut milk sauce and dried curry leaf. Perfectly cooked, but nothing spectacular. There were a few spices missing in my opinion. Also, it didn't come out with anything! I think they should probably include some sauteed vegetables to balance out the scallops. My date had the chicken tikka masala. It was very good, but not quite authentic! . . There is a lamb dish I want to try here... next time :). . I will definitely be back to give it another try in a few months. This is a great place for girl's night or a casual dinner.
