Restaurant: JCT Kitchen &amp; Bar
Category: Southern
We have only eaten here once, but really loved the food. I was sorely tempted by my Southern roots to try the fried chicken, but settled for the veggie plate instead. I also asked for 1/2 order of the truffle-parmesan fries because the couple at the next table had shared a taste with us and I was instantly hooked and in need of a small binge. These are the world's best fries. My plate had a nice assortment of perfectly steamed vegetables in a buttery sauce. They were mixed together in a colorful pile on the platter, rather than sitting in separate heaps in the usual southern restaurant fashion. My husband had the shrimp &amp; grits and loved them. JCT serves decent bread, but the whipped butter has some added ingredient (sugar? Splenda?) that gives it an off taste. They only  give you one slice, not a basketful, so if you want more, you have to ask. . . Which brings me to: Service.  Not the best. Our waiter, while charming and knowledgeable, was not attentive. When we finally got the check, he never came back to take the credit card. I saw him criss-cross the room many times, but couldn't get his attention. I thought of calling the restaurant on my cell and asking them to send him to our table, but the number wasn't on the check or the desert menu. Finally, I got the busboy to get him. The busboy became emotional, taking my hand and begging forgiveness! WTH?. . The other reason I withhold full approval is the noise level. Why do trendy restaurants believe that patrons must shout and repeat themselves during dinner conversation. Is this a method of turning the tables over faster? We almost were screaming at each other. JCT is certainly not the only offender, but it's really, really bad.  I long for the old days of sound-baffling design in restaurants.
