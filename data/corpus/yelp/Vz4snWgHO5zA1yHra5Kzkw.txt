Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I went to The Stinking Rose my first night in town for a vacation this week. My friend and I had the garlic soaking in a whatever appetizer which was absolutely delicious. I hate when restaurants have amazing bread to start with because then I am forced to gorge myself...so of course I was full before I even received my meal..    We shared two entrees the shellfish pasta with tomato sauce and black linguine, actually it also had salmon and halibut in it so I may be mistaken as to what it is listed as on the menu. This dish was delicious and I recommend it to any seafood lovers that dine here because it is such a melting pot of seafood, you really get your moneys worth..    The second dish that we shared was garlic braised spare rib? it is the beef one, not the pork one. I just drooled on my keyboard, excuse me for a second...yeah, it is that good. This was served with garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach which both were quite delightful. .    If you don't dig garlic, you're still able to accompany friends to this place, there are a handful of dishes able to be prepared without garlic so that's good (even though garlic rules) The super cuteness of this is that these options are indicated by a little dracula on the menu. Also, there are several vegetarian options which is nice to find at a place, too many restaurants are neglecting the veggies..    To finish off our meal, my friend and I shared garlic ice cream. The only way I can describe it is a rich garlic cream sauce taste with a hint of sweetness and no saltiness. There is a rich, thick caramel mole sauce served on the ice cream that is just amazing. I have been craving garlic ice cream all week long now..    I love this place, please go here.
