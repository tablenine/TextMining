I have been eating here for a long time.. . My mom loved the hand carved Lamb Sandwich and it is still the sandwich I order.  Eat it there!  Sides of cole slaw, macaroni salad and a red beet egg are great choices.  So is dessert of cheesecake or banana cream pie.. . Love the booths and the communal tables depending on what mood I'm in.  . . Weekends are very convenient from Silver Lake for the great cooked-to-order breakfasts.  They even have a massive Breakfast Sandwich with eggs and a huge ham slice which I have been meaning to try.. . I don't often get anything but the Lamb Sandwich but when I have the Beef Stew and the Chili are great.. . The place is a part of Los Angeles history.  For that alone it is worth a visit.
