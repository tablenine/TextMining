For late night grub and great entertainment, this place has it!. . Well first let me say that I've never been here sober nor during daylight hours, so my review may be biased, but this place is awesome.. . On any given night after the bars close (two waves at 2 &amp; 4), it gets flooded with drunks of all kinds.  The staff will hurl insults at the inebriated indeed, but as much of the entertainment comes from other drunk patrons.  . . A good example is once I saw a guy ask to borrow a drunk gal's cell, then when she was busy licking a cheesefry off her friend's shirt she had dropped it on they txt'd her parents and confessed she was feeling "oh so horny".  Very immature certainly but when you're three (or more) sheets to the wind this is funny shyt you can't buy.  The callback a few minutes later made the ordeal all the more funny, you can only imagine.  One time I came with foreigners and didn't pay attention that they had to pay when picking up their order.  The  verbal diatribe from the staff attempting to remind them of that was priceless as well.  There is a similarly humorous example every time I've visited.. . Drunken shenanigans at their best and the food's not bad either.  This spot is a winner if you accept it for what it is and have a good time.  It just sucks that Yakzees lost their 4am license so I guess that second crowd might be a lot thinner these days.
