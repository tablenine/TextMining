The first couple of times i tried to eat at this restaurant, we either came too late and couldnt get seated or the wait was waaaay too long prob around 2 hours or longer! So one day we decided to go right when it opened around 3....We got there at 3:15 and the wait was still 45min to an hour :/  On the good side, we were able to wait at the bar and have a couple of beers, and before you know it, it was our time to be seated :) I recommend doing this if you have a party of no more than 4 due to the fact that space is limited at the bar and its first come first serve..   .         So we finally get seated. There were only two of us so we ordered one lb of shrimp with the whole shabang sauce and corn, catfish with cajun fries, and sweet potato fries!! The shrimp was grrreat!! My favorite part was licking the sauce off of my fingers mmm sooo good..The corn came in the same bag as the shrimp so it was drenched with the same sauce which made it soo yummy. The catfish was really tasty.... It kind of melted in your mouth and the pieces were pretty big. The cajun fries were good and spicy and the sweet potato fries were okay....The bill including the two beers from the bar came out to about 32 dollars excluding tip :) ......I really recommend this restaurant.....trust me, I was a little unsure about waitin but once u try this place, the wait is well worth it :)
