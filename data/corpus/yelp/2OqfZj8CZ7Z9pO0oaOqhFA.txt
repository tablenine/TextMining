I don't think it helped this place that I went to it for a Fat Tuesday party, after spending a weekend in 'Nawlins for Mardi Gras.. . It bills itself as a Cajun/Creole place.  It is, but if you're a true cajun, used to something like Mr. B's, Galatoire's, or Commander's Palace it's not.. . I had the gumbo, which I found average.  . . It's a place I think I'll enjoy in late summer, when I'm craving the cajun spices, but it's not a replacement for the real thing.
