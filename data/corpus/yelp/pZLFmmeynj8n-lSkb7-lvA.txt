i was introduced to this place when my friend jhi brought me some red velvet mini cupcakes.  they were quite delicious.  since then i had been meaning to check it out.  today, i had dinner there with a friend.  she had the roast beef sandwich and i had the BLT, we switched off one for the other so we could try each of them.  man were they delicious.  they were small and came with a salad and was 9 bucks each.  a bit pricey for a sandwich, but everything there is so cute and they sandwich was smushed and warm the way i like it.  i left with some red velvet minis and a few blueberry mini muffins.  i drooled at the other items but i vowed i would try them next time i go, and yes, the next time will be soon.  very soon.  :)
