Nothing too special, but not objectionable, either. The insalata caprese was rather bland (how 'bout some bufala mozzarella, folks?). I had the mushroom ravioli, which in and of themselves were unexceptional, but they were served with a nice assortment of julienned veg. My dining companion had some sort of eggplant ravioli which was much better, but still not jump-up-and-say-goddamn good. Soft drinks were served in little glass bottles, which was cute.
