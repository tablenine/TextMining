I am revising my review, originally 2 stars.  I was in Mary's recently and had outstanding service.  They have clearly addressed the staffing issue, which meant overall service improved significantly.  With that said, it is a great neighborhood place with decent burgers and a good time.. . The food is OK, but the service is horrible.  We were sat soon, but the server never came.  After 15 minutes, I approached the hostess and requested for the server to at least stop by.  He arrived, and then it was the same throughout the evening.  . . We sat waiting for the check and when the server finally arrived, he began venting about being sat too many tables at one time.  I live in the neighborhood, and really want to support this place but the service has to improve.
