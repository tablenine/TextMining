This place rocks. It is like a found jewel cradled in the warehouse part of downtown. The people working there are fun. The space is hip. The rattlesnake/rabbit sausage was awesome. Eating French (Belgian) Fries with Blue Cheese was an interesting twist.. . The only thing missing after this heavy meal with something light and fresh like an orange juice, fruit, even a little salad leaf would have been refreshing.. . Apparently, they have a DJ set up and when it is crowded people start eating on the floor!
