Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you're the impatient type than this place is NOT for you.  It's all about the experience.  Make sure you go with people you like and can talk to for a while.  Standing in line moves pretty quickly and it's fun to see the ladies behind the counter work.  Their memories are pretty awesome.. . Their hot dogs are awesome; they have this pop to them that make them different.  You can't really go wrong with the chili cheese dog but all the other permutations are awesome too.  My cousin really likes her dogs with sauerkraut.  They also offer polish hot dogs and hamburgers, though I don't think I've ever seen someone order a hamburger.  Their fries and onion rings are amazing too.. . There's a parking lot right next door which has always had room whenever I go and it's free.  Great place to go to on a weekend afternoon or late night.
