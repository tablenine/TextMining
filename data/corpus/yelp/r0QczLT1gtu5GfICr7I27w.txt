I am really torn on how to review this place, which I am sure is excellent for Korean food, but as it turns out, Korean is not my cup of tea (or bowl of rice...). . We went with someone who highly recommend a few dishes to try, including the table cooked marinated beef dish and a pork dish, however, I absolutely hate overcooked meat, and that is what this was.  The meat is thinly sliced and then cooked until dried out - although not the fault of the restaurant, as I think this is how it's done....it was making me think that I need cheese whiz and bread, because the only other time I have had meat cooked like that was on a philly cheesesteak.  I just didn't find the food that tasty, and left smelling of garlic and beef (the downfall of the interactive, cooked at the table, beef jerky). . Oh well, fun to try, portions are huge, ridiculously cheap - and overall, one of those places that I could go back to, but really not my favorite kind of food.
