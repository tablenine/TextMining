Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Since it was my first time at Boiling Crab, I didn't expect much. I never thought I would get my fingers/hands/wrists all dirty. It was my first time eating so sloppy. I always thought that all they had was crab because after all... the restaurants name is called Boiling Crab.. . When my friends and I got there, we ordered a shit load of food. different types of shrimp, crab legs, calamari, oysters etc... . -The oysters were pretty good, I didn't know that you can just swallow it and didn't have to chew.. -Crab legs were bomb but i think they put too much butter in there but it was still good.. -The different flavored shrimps were the best! They were the best shrimps I have ever tasted! I also put lime on the shrimp and it tasted even better!. . The wait was very long but the food was worth the wait! That is if your very hungry and craving for seafood. My friend ended up spending 200 dollars that night.. . I would definitely go back and order lots of food when I have the money.
