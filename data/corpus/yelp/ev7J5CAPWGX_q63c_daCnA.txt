When I walked in LottaFrutta I honestly forgot that I was in Atlanta.  I thought I was somewhere in Puerto Rico, or at some Brazilian health food bodega.. . The energy was great in this small shop and the service was fantastic.. . We bought one of the fresh fruit cups for a client meeting that was that morning.  It looked soooo amazing.  Filled with strawberry, banana, watermelon and an assortment of different fruits, the cup looked so FRESH.. . I didnt get to actually taste the fruit, but I plan on going back to this place to try a few things out.  . . Reasonably priced, and healthy for you.  How can you beat that?
