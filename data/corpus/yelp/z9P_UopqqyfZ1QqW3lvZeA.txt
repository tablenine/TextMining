Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe

I agree with my friend: I love their small wooden table. We went there on a Friday evening for dessert, and loved the gelato. The guy behind the gelato bar made cool recommendations (yes, the chestnut flavor was too plain, compared to the hazelnut). Loved the prune and pear tart. The virgin cocktail my friend had looked pretty but didn't have a particularly cool taste. . . Overall, it was a nice experience, and I loved how it wasn't too noisy (mostly because we got there before 8pm). Desserts tasted much better when you're enjoying them with a good friend.. . Parking is not a problem. Culver City has a couple of parking structures. First 2 hours are free, then $1/hour.
