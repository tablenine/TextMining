I had my birthday dinner here with 10 friends and really like the food. I was informed Lebanese food is served tapas style only because everyone is encouraged to share. I do agree with other reviews in that I wasn't too please with the service. When we first arrived the server was attentive but after a short while she disappeared and I'm not talking Â a small wait, I was actually annoyed by that. The restaurant was moderately crowded so I wouldn't necessarily say that this was the cause in the delay. But overall I did think the decoration was a bit different and I liked the dim lighting because it gave a more relaxed feel to the crowd. Food was delish!
