Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
You must try the grilled scallions (to die for) and the frozen mojitos! LOVE all the tacos! The best one is the crispy pork belly taco. Also- the queso royale is prett awesome as an appetizer!. . Great food, great service, and great managers! I've been several times and I totally disagree about the price. VERY affordable!
