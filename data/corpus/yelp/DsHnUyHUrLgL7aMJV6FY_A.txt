I LOVE this place!! I admit that not everything on the menu is great(I don't like the bowels), but the Save the Chicken Wings, If Chickens Ran the Ranch Burger and the BTA are great!! I also suggest the carrot cake for dessert...moist and delicious! Everyone(including all of my ethically impaired a.k.a. carnivore friends) I take here loves it.
