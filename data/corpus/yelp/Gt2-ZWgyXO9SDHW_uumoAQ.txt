i'm giving this 5 stars because of the Thai Elvis that performs here...everyone has to see him cuz he's awesome!. this place gets packed and it's first come first serve...you will have to be waiting for a while if you come during the dinner rush so try to get there a little earlier so you can get seated right away. Â the food is good and the price, pretty cheap what more do you want?
