Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Now, I know that most people get the "specials" of the week or add as many toppings as they can, but I think the Grilled Cheese Truck highlights the simplicity of a solid, well-made grilled cheese sandwich at its best.. . They totally nailed the perfect bread-to-cheese ratio in their formula! The bread's crispy level is just right so that it doesn't scratch the roof of the mouth, but counterbalances beautifully with the gooey cheese of your choice. Whatever they use to brown the bread--be it butter or oil, the sandwich is delightfully non-greasy. Their choice of bread (only sourdough or wheat for simple grilled cheeses) really puts the spotlight on the flavor and texture of the melted cheese...so whether it be gouda (my choice) or brie, you can really enjoy it.. . I have tried many things on their menu (including the "specials" and with toppings), and hands down, their simple grilled cheeses is the item that blows me away every time! In fact, this is called the GRILLED CHEESE truck, not Special Melted Cheesy Sandwich Truck or anything...so for those who wrote the truck off, try the simplest melt on their menu and it might just win you back.. . I'm just sad they don't come out to Pasadena area and I have to drive all the way out to get my delicious cheesy fix. Come visit us please!
