Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
I really, really don't like the food at Taco Cabana.  I feel kind of bad giving it only one star because I respect the fact that they provide another late night option.  And I also sort of WANT to love them because they serve alcohol.. . It's just that I've never had anything GOOD there.  The margaritas are on par with the rubbing-alcohol ones served at places like El Azteca, and the food is just...  bad.  I get that it's cheap and all, but there is no excuse for low-quality, gristly chicken.  . . If I were drunk enough to enjoy this level of food quality, I would just have someone run me through the Krystal drive-in.  Sorry, guys.
