Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Suprisingly, this place closes at 12am daily.  I went there about 10pm at night and i still had to wait 20mins just to sit at the bar.  The place was dimly lighted and very sophisticated, it reminds me of a New York restaurant.  The service was good, the waitress was informative.  I ordered the fried squash blossoms with ricotta for appetizers, it was good but a little to greasy for me.  Then i had the fennel and sausage pizza whcih was good, the pizza dough tastes very different compared to alot of pizza places ive been too.  i would definitely come here again.
