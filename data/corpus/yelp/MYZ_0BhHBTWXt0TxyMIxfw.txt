Swirlies - Good!. Service - Good!. Food - Not so much, There was nothing wrong with the food, just nothing that great, just a big quivering mass of mediocrity, staring at me from my plate. I got the rainbow trout special with cilantro, and it was pretty mild, not not spicy mild, but bland mild. Pretty boring food for a not cheap price, save your money for just drinks and chips.
