Good food for very good value.  All their dishes are about $10 and you can either get  a large salad or combo of entree with salad or as sandwich with side of small salad.  When you get the combo, you also get side of mashed potato that is so creamy and delicious.    The line can get long but the staff works like an assembly line and is very efficient and FAST!   I had the flank steak with arugula salad which was delicious.  Generous in portion.  After the meal, my sister and I both got coffee.  A big pot of french pressed coffee, good for about 4 mug sized cups came freshly brewed.  It was not only tasty but only $2.70 for it!!!  Now, that's a deal!
