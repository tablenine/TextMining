While I am not a vegetarian, my fiancee is, and this new-ish little vegetarian joint in the city made both of us very happy to have chosen it.  The space is cozyl, and we decided it had a feel that evoked Amsterdam.  We mentioned this to the bartender/server, and funnily enough, he said the owner loves Amsterdam and that she had been there at least a dozen times.  The European, more intimate vibe is quite inviting and works well there.. . As other reviewers have pointed out, there are only a few tables, and there are about 12 seats at the food bar, where we ate.  I'm usually not a fan of sitting at the bar, but the ambience made it that much more palatable, and the dual-tiered bar provided plenty of room for our drinks and plates we ordered.  . . The food was outstanding and fairly inexpensive for the quanity we had.  Everything at least tasted good, but the highlights were the mushroom saute over polenta and the pumpkin ravioli.  I had a few glasses of the boxhead shiraz and also found it to have a refined sweetness with a subtly refreshing finish.  . . We'll definitely go back, although I'd recommend going on weeknights or before 6 pm on the weekends as they do not take reservations.  A great addition to Chicago's ever-growing list of solid vegetarian options!
