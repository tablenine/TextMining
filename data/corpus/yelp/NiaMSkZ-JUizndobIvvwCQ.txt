I've been to Spacca a number of times and while I've always enjoyed it...the pizza special last week took this place from great to outstanding. Porcini mushrooms and truffled provolone and fresh mozzarella and some more truffle oil. WOW. Top that off with good service, a killer bottle of wine, and the baked ricotta dessert and heaven cannot compare to my meal. Yum, and I say again...Yum.
