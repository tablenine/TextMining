Whenever someone talks about this restaurant they always talk about the garlic chicken. Personally I think the garlic chicken can be a little dry but is still extremely tasty. I love the fact that it is served with yummy plantains (fried bananas). I also like the fact that the portion is huge and I always have leftovers for the next days lunch. . . Parking can sometimes be an issue over here on a weekend at the prime dinner time but you usually find parking on the street.
