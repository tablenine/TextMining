I heard nothing but good things about this place before I went, and it definitely lived up to the hype.. . The menu is extensive and I really enjoyed my stuffed chicken and it was perfectly cooked. The portions were perfect and reasonably priced.. . Service was okay, my waiter didn't bring the correct dessert then made me wait 10 minutes to see him again to have him correct it. But despite this slip-up, I still enjoyed my meal.
