It's pretty good, overall.  Efficient service, very clean, affordable and food is consistent, not mind-blowing but consistently solid.  They speicialize in pho dishes, egg rolls and spring rolls so don't expect a menu beyond that.  Beer and sodas are also available.  The parking lot is small since the Cafe shares the lot with a liquor store and Rambuthan - be prepared to park on the street which isn't usually a problem.  Good for take-out too.
