Wow, 210 reviews. Since I'm not blind, I won't be writing this to rave about the Hainan Chicken Rice. The two things I feel are worth mentioning is the fantastic seafood salad, and the bread. . . I don't even like salad, but I can gobble up a huge plate of their seafood salad. They don't skimp with the seafood, there's quite a lot, and it's a big plate if you get the large. The dressing goes nicely with it, and this is the only salad that my salad-hating tongue loves. . . The bread comes in little cut crunchy-soft squares of goodness, both slightly sweet and salty at the same time, made with some sort of herb-spice/sugar-salt. I wouldn't be surprised if little elves made it in the kitchen because it's magical. . . You can get extra bread (I used to do it all the time), which they'll wrap in foil so you can toast it up at home later. Tastes just as good. Awesome!
