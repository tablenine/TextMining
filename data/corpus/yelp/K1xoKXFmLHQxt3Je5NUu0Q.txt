The service at Clarke's is horrible, but that's just something you come to put up with once you have one of their omelettes!  This is another childhood haunt since my dad and I used to frequent the Lincoln location after a few good hours spent in the Children's Book Store (anyone else remember this place? It was only the best book store EVER). . Aside from fancy schmancy gourmet or specialty places, Clarke's has the best all around average buttermilk pancakes ever.  I don't know if they put crack in them or what, but they're delicious.  They also have the best omelettes that I've ever had!  I'm really picky about omelettes, but Clarke's are almost always just perfect.  My personal favorite is the Zorba, no onions please, with a side of fries and pancakes instead of toast.  All that at no extra cost!  . . Another favorite breakfast item are the eggs flourentine.  The spinach is fresh, not frozen, and very very tender.  The hollondaise is also very good.  When I'm not in a breakfast mood, I almost always go for the tuna melt with bacon on an english muffin.  Very filling and they have excellent tuna salad!  . . The thing about Clarke's is that they are exceptional quality for the price and for the area.  Everything is fresh, you can get healthier options, and everything is home made.  If I ordered eggs flourentine at the Golden Nugget, I'd get canned spinach on white toast probably.
