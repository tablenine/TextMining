Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
This is not real mexican food! We have to call this Californian/Mexican.. I have to give it to this viejito ( The old owner ) alot of credit. He is a great host and the service was friendly. I have to be honest and say that the real burritos in Mexico are thin and the flour tortillas are hand made. The fresh tortillas make a real burrito not factory made super thin tortillas. There is a trend that in California that the Burritos have to be at least a pound and better if bigger. I have to dissagree with that because that is not the real burrito in Mexico. It might be in California but not Mexico. They dont sell big burritos in Mexico or fake enchiladas or any other Mexican American dishes. If you want real Mexican food go to Mexico and order a real Chile Verde made with fresh pork, tomatillos, green serranos or jalapenos, garlic and lots of time and love. Manuel's special is was made for overweight football players not for a real mexican. This is not real mexican food TAmmy and just because you are from San Diego and you are close to the border that does not mean that you know what real mexican food is or that there is acrooss the border Â a manuel special restaurant. No taco bell either acrooss the border ok : - )
