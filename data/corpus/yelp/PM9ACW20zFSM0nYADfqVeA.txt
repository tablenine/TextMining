Classic Midwest Mexican. Meaning - it tastes nothing like real Mexican food. The food isn't bad, per se. It's just not good, authentic, or worth the money. The chips are very light and airy - I ate a ton. The guacamole is actually also delicious. Â The tacos were classic imitation Mex - lots of lettuce and tomato. While passable, I wouldn't get them again. Worst of all, at $9.25 for a taco platter, $7 for a margarita, and close to $20 for many of the entrees, it's not a bargain either.
