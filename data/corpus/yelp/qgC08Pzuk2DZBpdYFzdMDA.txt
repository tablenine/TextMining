I went here for a friend's birthday a few months ago. I think there was about 10 of us and they seated us at a great table and we were all comfortable. Our waiter was very accommodating and described everything to us. Some people got the prix fixe menu but my fiance and I tried items off the prix fixe menu. The Kobe beef roll was to DIE for!. . I would like to come back when the weather is warmer. I love their martinis too, very tasty :)
