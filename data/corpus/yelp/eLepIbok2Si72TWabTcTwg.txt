I hate this place.  Passionately. . . The service is awful, the food is substandard, the clientele is obnoxious.  Who cares if it's open 24 hours?   . . Still, I'd let my friends drag me in here every so often, until my (brand-spanking-new-just-bought-it-that-day reasonably expensive Kenneth Cole) purse was stolen while I was sitting in one of the window booths.  I had set it down on the ledge in the window next to me, and since this place has a policy of seating homeless people (which, I'm sorry to say, is just gross), a fellow 'patron' reached over and grabbed it without me noticing, and walked out. . . When I told the manager that my purse had been stolen, he was all like, "Yeah, I thought it was weird that that guy left in such a huge hurry.  Oh well..... wouldn't be the first time that's happened here." . . Seriously. . . And to make matters worse, my digital camera had been in my purse.   . . While I have to take some of the responsibility for what happened (placing my purse in plain view wasn't such a great idea), I'd like to note that I have lived in this city for my ENTIRE life and this was the first time that anything like this had happened to me.  For as gentrified as this area is, it's still not very safe.  Take my advice and avoid at all costs.
