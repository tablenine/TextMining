I went on a weekend at lunchtime when there was no line, no crowds- basically my friends wanted me to experience the legendary food.  The burger really is as good as they say- nice and juicy, complemented by the gourmet cheeses and carmelized onions.  Plus, I love flavorful greens, so the arugula is a huge upgrade from generic iceberg lettuce.. . The sweet potato fries were great, too- and gotta love the little shopping cart it comes in.  Get it?  Fries a la carte?  I wish I hadn't just had coffee or I would've had more room to try one of their many beers on tap.. . I can't comment on the scene since I went in the daytime, but if anything, come for the food.
