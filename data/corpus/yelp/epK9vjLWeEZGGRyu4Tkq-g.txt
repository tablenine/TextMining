Restaurant: Everybody&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Service was pretty solid and I like their beer on tap selection.  No complaints there.  This 2 star review is more for the food.. . Got the mixed lettuce salad with Italian dressing, and that was good.  Got bacon bits on it -- covered the entire thing with bacon, which, I have no complaints about at all.  However, if you want it to be a bit lighter on the bacon, you should ask, or else they top the entire bowl of salad with a layer of bacon (why would anyone ever complain about that though?)  Salad with tons of bacon = win.. . The pizza was really disappointing.  I'm willing to say I'd rather go to Domino's for a pizza instead of Everybody's.  Got a BBQ chicken pizza to split with friends and it was just not good.  The crust was thick and bready and didn't taste like pizza.  The toppings were okay -- the chicken was more like it was taken off the bone and dark meat, and the tomatoes are a weird addition to a bbq chicken pizza (also made the pizza soggy).  Perhaps I just made a poor choice, but come on, a specialty pizza should have been a tried and true recipe, and this just was not it.  Also, the specialty pizzas are not cheap, which just made this worse. . . For pizza, Mellow Mushroom, or if you want to spoil yourself, Antico's.  This is a place to hang out and grab a beer, but not to eat a good slice.
