yea, guess who went last week the day that she wrote her first review bc she was craving it after she wrote the review???!! haha I convinced 3 of my Agora Virgin Friends to come along too and converted them as well . . 5 stars this time....IM A HUGE HUGE HUGE FAN FAN FAN. . everything here just tastes so good. . . the pita here is SO FREAKKINNN YUMS. they serve it toasted so it comes out warm and chewy and BITE SIZE (my fave) that goes perfect with the meza platter or hummus.. . I got the mixed super awesome spit fire grilled gyro with lamb/beef/chicken. the meat was all tender and charred to perfection...i want one now!!!. . Al was there when i went, but his son/worker/other guy thats there all the time was our waiter/cook/cashier and he was really really phenomenal!!!!! soooooooo nice and understood everything and was just all sorts of great. We were totally going to just order baklava and stuff our faces, but he somehow knew, that just a "sampling" of it would be the perfect end to our meal.
