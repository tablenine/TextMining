So it's Sunday night and Kanye West can be heard by the restaurant. Lollapallooza was going on which I covered as a press photog. Anyways, 3 course meal for under $30. Hell ya. This asian fusion chinease dinner was awesome. . . I went with the lobster spring roll. Not too dry or over fried. I really went all out and ordered the Peking Duck. The last time I had duck was when I was in Beijing a few years ago - that was oily and bland. This was just perfect. Add some flat Thai noodles, damn mmm mmm good. . . And their homemade sorbets. Oh Wow!. . Now the girls had the salmon. They said it was great! But they finished it before I had a bite of it. The shrimp and vegetables were bland. It was missing something. Maybe flavor. The veggies were slightly under cooked. . . And for Bob S. I was there that Sunday you were there, but I do not recall where you were sitting. I was in the corner with two girls and another guy there. Of course we were cursing. . .
