i want to really put 3.5 but i would rather round down than up. had the chicken and salt...errrr...i mean orange salad for lunch. not a very large portion at all and it was $14.75! Â i dont mind paying for good food, but this defnitely was not worth that kind of money. also had some coconut lime cake which was good but not great. i've been here before and had the mojito, which *is* great! if i had had one of those for lunch, i woulda rounded up fo sure! . . also, a warning: the quality of the food and drinks (esp. the mojitos) they serve at the bar for their happy hours is not the same as the real food. not very good at all!
