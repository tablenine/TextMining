After repeatedly hearing that Langer's Deli has the best pastrami on earth I had to go and try it. Despite the not so great looking neighborhood, the trip was certainly worth it. . . The Russian rye bread was great, nice soft center with a crunchy crust for contrast.  The pastrami was the best looking that I have ever seen. Nice thick slices of meat in the most perfect looking color.  Not like those other places that give you limp, shreaded, thin pastrami.  The coleslaw inside is the perfect compliment to this masterpiece.   . . The atmosphere is like something out old 80's movie (sorry, can't explain why), and my waitress was  polite, cheerful and gave just the right amount of attention.  Very comfortable place to relax with the newspaper and enjoy a great meal at the counter.. . The price is a bit steep, but you get what you pay for .  Certainly worth  the dent that my visit left in my wallet.  If you want inexpensive, barely edible pastrami, go somewhere else. This is the Ferrari of pastrami!  Unfortunately, I may never be able to enjoy as pastrami sandwich anywhere else now.
