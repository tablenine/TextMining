Real cool place for different types of sausages the rabbit was real crazy and i really liked the rattlesnake which was real good. The fries were pretty good as well. I did notice there wide selection of beers but did not get the chance to try it. This place does get busy, but I don't think a place that's busy deserves to get knocked down some stars, to me it's worth the wait. The prices are a little high, but you do get some prime sausages that i don't think i've seen served anywhere else. The cafeteria seating is a little weird due to it being like a cafeteria type thing. Other than that great place great sausage now i gotta go try the beer!
