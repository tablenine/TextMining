I liked this place, didn't love it though.  Food was good, not great.  Service was above average though.  I give the upstairs bar a solid 4 stars though.  Its  a very comfortable set up and is great for after dinner.  Not cheap though.  I had a VSOP and I believe it was $24.. Won't be running back there any time soon.
