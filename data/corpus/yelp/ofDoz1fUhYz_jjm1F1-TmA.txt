"Hey, want to join me down at "The 5", for a beer?". This is a common phrase around my office.  It's the favorite place for everyone to wait out the traffic on 285 and/or 400.. Personally, it isn't my favorite place.  I mean, service is fantastic and the patrons are super friendly, but I don't particularly care for the food.  . My friends and colleagues think I am crazy when I say this, but come on, why would a restaurant serve calamari that is fried in Tempura?  I love calamari and this was such a disappointment.. Despite my disappointment in the food, I must admit that I enjoy hanging out  at "the 5" during "happy hours" for the exceptional bar service and fun atmosphere.
