Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
I really enjoyed my first visit to the Counter.  Our server was very attentive and the managers were buzzing with energy, and made sure that everyone (their staff included) was having a good time.  The decor is inviting.  The windows that open in front add to make this place even more inviting.  . . The food is good too!  After being seated, you are given a clip board to create your own burger, turkey burger or chicken sandwich.  You then have several choices to customize your burger.  After you check the boxes of bun choice, toppings and sauces, you are all set!  Fries are ordered separately.  We tried the half and half, half sweet potato fries and half regular fries.  The regular fries are good and sweet potato fries are great!  The turkey burger was delicious.  After all, I did customize it!  The meat is good quality.  The hamburger bun was ok, nothing special.  . . Overall, very convenient location, fun atmosphere, good food and a low price!
