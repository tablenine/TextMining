Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Eat It OR Beat It?. **EAT IT!!**. . Manna Korean BBQ isn't quite the place you want to bring on a date, nor is any Korean BBQ place unless of course you want to smell like galbi all day. Nevertheless, Manna tasted alright. The meat quality wasn't the best I've had and the service, fair. the ambiance is a bit tacky in for my taste. Certain parts of the restaurants were roofed by tents; I felt almost as if I was in southeast Asia grilling meat on the side of the street. Valet parking is a must for about $5. . . The side dishes weren't as great either. Seemed like it had been sitting around all day. My friends and I went for their All-You-Can-Eat dinner for about $15/person. It's definitely one of the cheaper Korean BBQ places around but definitely not the first go-to BBQ. . . CONCLUSION:. The food was not completely terrible, but I've had better before. I recommend coming to this place if you have a large party and are in the area. Nevertheless, I recommend going to the new location at the Fox Hills Mall since it's newer.
