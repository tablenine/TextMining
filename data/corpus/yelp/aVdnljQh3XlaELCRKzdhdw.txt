After all of the glowing reviews about this place I had to try it out. The place was great. Lobster was really tasty as was the beef dish that we ordered (don't remember the name but it is the special). The only thing I have issue with is the wait but it is worth it. We went on a Saturday night so it was probably the worst time to go.
