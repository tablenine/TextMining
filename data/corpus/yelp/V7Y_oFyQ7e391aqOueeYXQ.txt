Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
I have been going to Waikikie since it opened because it's just up the street from my house. I am a big fan of casual dining because it is cheaper, and you can linger with friends after you eat without feeling like you are "camping" in a server's station.. . I always have a good experience at Waikikie. The staff (including the owner) is always friendly, the food is always fresh and well-prepared, and the portions are perfect. I like going to places where the staff remembers you, and they do here.. . I get an Udon Beef Noodle soup that is excellent. (It's on the menu as ramen noodle, but you can substitute udon noodles for a buck.) The broth, meat, veggies and noodles are all delicious, and I am so full afterwards that I slosh home.. . I like the chicken Katsu, too, and I often get #16. I don't particularly like macaroni salad (though theirs is excellent), so I get an extra dollop of rice instead.. . The fried dumplings are very good, too. And I have never had the shave ice, but the green tea ice cream is lovely.. . Don't forget to take your chopsticks!
