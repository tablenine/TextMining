Yum.  I wish I could still eat pizza with cheese because it looked and smelled fabulous.. . We had an absolutely fabulous waitress!  She was very accomodating with my vegan subsitutions and brought me soy milk for my coffee.  SO... I am a coffee SNOB, big time.  I would drink their coffee any day!  Their decaf- I could do without.. . I had portobella mushroom sandwhich with no mayo- instead I put mustard &amp; A1 on it.  Got a side of mustard vinegrette and had it on my backed potato, which was oddly brown on the inside, but tasted yummy.  While the veggies on the sandwhich weren't farmer's maret tasty fresh, as a whole the sandwhich was very good.. . We had these tortilla chips with guac and salsa. They were greasy in all the best ways.  The guac and salsa, as the hummus we also shared, were a bit pedestiran.
