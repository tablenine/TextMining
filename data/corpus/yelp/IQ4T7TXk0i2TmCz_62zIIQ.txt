Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
My favorite Â restaurant overall of any kind. I go here every special occasion and just because. Nothing tops this. The absolute best there is. I have been to other Brazilian places and none comes close. I have taken all my loved ones here and everyone luvs it. It is a cozy place. You can sit in or outdoor. You sit yourself and grab your own menu most of the time. Lunch is a bit cheaper than dinner. You get free bread- my fave bread at any restaurant! You MUST try the following: coxinhas, yucca frita, traditional grilled chicken boneless skinless with rice, beans, plantains, salsa &amp; farofa, and to drink the maracuja. Its my usual. They give you a lot of food, I always have enough to take home and eat like 3+ meals. I can eat this daily and would not get tired of it! LUV IT!!!!!!!!!! :p The lot is small and free, but at night it is valet only or the ST.
