A Los Angeles landmark! . . This place is like... an old fashion diner-ish looking place. A 'feel good like you're almost at home' place when you walk in. . When you walk in... you'll see this whole aisle of home made bakery goods like their cheesecakes. On your right, is the deli area which you can buy to- go if you like. . Then you're kindly introduced and get a seat. The place is mainly booths where your group of 4 can sit down and be ready to chow down. The waitress was this nice, old lady who served us. I got the steak sandwich with fries and colslaw on the side. Their colslaw is awesome! The steak was perfecto, and the fries were crispy. My friends got the Tuna Melt which she thought was a no-no, and the other got pesto __ pasta, which was nicely flavored. But I liked my sandwich a lot! . The prices here are pretty decent, &amp; if you buy their 'dinners' on the back of their menu, they give you a ice cream serbert on the houseeee. . This place is pretty laid back restaurant where you can just walk in and chow down since their service is pretty fast.. . Also, this place is open 24 hrs!
