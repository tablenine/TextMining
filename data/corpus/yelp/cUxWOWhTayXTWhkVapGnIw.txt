Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
I like the open airy feel of this restaurant. The service was polite and prompt. THe food was reasonably priced and quite good. I ate a piece of jalapeno that was in my food and ended up drinking half my water, eating half a bowl or rice and chugging some of my then bf's coffee too! Very spicyyyy. Not that it wasnt good food...just don't overestimate your spicy food eating abilities ^_^.
