Restaurant: Craft
Category: American (New)
Two negative experiences at Craft which is too bad because we wanted it to be good!  First experience during the Restaurant Week (and the respective Restaurant Week menu)...there was just nothing special about the food or restaurant, except the decor and setup was nice.  The service was average at best and I get annoyed when waiters/waitresses ask "Are you finished enjoying your meal?" when they prepare to clear the table.  I would like to reply with 'the only reason the plate is empty is because I skipped lunch to give this place a better chance to succeed.'. . The most important part though, food:  Craft failed my wife and I.  In general they will present dishes in cute cast iron places, do nothing special in preparation, and call it good food.  The vegetables were boring and  the meat was not cooked well at all whether it be fish, venison, or any red meat we were served...mainly it was overcooked (as I would never complain about undercooked, as long as it was fresh!).. . The manager attempted to right the first wrong when we contacted her and invited us back on their dime.  And although that is encouraging to have a restaurant pay attention to patrons and their issues, we will not be returning to Craft again.  It is even more disparaging because we are huge Top Chef and Tom Colicchio fans.  We had high expectations the first time, very low expectations the second time...and both were quite disappointing.
