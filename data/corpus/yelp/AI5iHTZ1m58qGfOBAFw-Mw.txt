Bring your own wine?  Sign me up!  We actually didn't know about the wine part in advance, so when we found out, we rushed across the street to the grocery store and grabbed a couple bottles.  We went to town on all the meat we could in this tapas bar, but got some veggies in as well.. . The setting is fun, with corks lining the walls and darkness predominating the room.  Very relaxing, but not quite romantic - a bit too noisy for that.  Feels pretty cozy, like the sort of place you want to spend a rainy night in.
