Completely agree with others about large portions, small flavor. (But not that huge). Got one of the burritos as takeout and took it home to eat with g/f and once we finished it, we were still hungry, mind you we were already really hungry.. . The buritto was way too generic and the salsa has almost tasteless.. I don't think, i'll be going back there.
