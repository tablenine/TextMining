LOVE LOVE LOVE. I have a Cuban friend and even she says this is the next best thing to her Mom!  Everything I've ever ordered is delivious.  Favorites are the Southwestern Steak Salad, Feta Sandwich and the Potato Ball.  Chicken Empanadas are great too!  ARRIVE EARLY, this place is NOT a secret!  . Save room for dessert!
