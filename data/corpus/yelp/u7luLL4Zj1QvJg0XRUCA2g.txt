This is the worst food experience I have had in at least six months.  I'm not sure why this place has been recommended by numerous friends but it is churning in my stomach as I type out this review.  I feel compelled to save others from repeating my experience.. . While the extensive menu was cited as a bonus by at least one other reviewer, I believe that some of the evil can be attributed to the sheer number of choices the kitchen promises- can a restaurant of this scale really make over a hundred dishes from fresh ingredients?  Not bloody likely and this place sure as hell didn't- nothing that touched my palate tasted like it had seen the outside of a freezer in a long long time.. . Ill-advised as it now seems, we started with two seafood appetizers- shrimp on a sugar cane and the mussel fritter.   I choked down my share of two shrimp but noted the "funkiness" but I had to draw the line  at the mussel fritter- it tasted as though bits of rock (shell perhaps?) had made their way into the batter.  My husband thinks it tasted like "fried crap dredged from the bottom of the ocean."  . . The main dish we shared was pad see eiw- I'm glad it wasn't terribly adventurous, I might be dead right now if we'd ventured any further from the familiar.  It was bland, greasy, spongy, devoid of any and all flavor and the vegetables were scarce and sad.. PS I gave this place one star because the waitress was nice.
