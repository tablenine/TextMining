Only after the fact did I hear that some people liked it and others didn't. I have to say that we walked by initially and we definitely wanted to put this on our list of places to try as I was visiting and my friend lives in Chicago but never comes to this area. I enjoyed my sandwich which had bacon, chicken and the bread was really good. My friend had the hamburger that had egg on it. The presentation on the mini wooden trays was cute and I loved the fries. The drinks were made well and the atmosphere was fun. . . I love the white interior and with a roofdeck, main area, sidewalk cafe and patio, I could see this place being worth another shot if you weren't pleased before. Our waitress was very sweet and I would suggest trying this afterwork sometime.
