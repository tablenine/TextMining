I had dinner here with my friend Jen, which consisted of a few small plates and rolls rather than an entree each. So I've only dined here once, but I think I got a good idea regarding the food.. . We tried the crisp chopstick rolls (kind of like mini-egg rolls with a shiitake and cream cheese filling), edamame, stir-fried somen, an avocado roll, an asparagus roll, and an order of tamago. The chopstick rolls and somen were the standouts, with everything else being pretty darn good.. . I balk at giving them a higher rating than 3-stars, though, because the maki were a tad messily rolled and I think the prices are a bit steep. Servers were more than friendly, though, and I would recommend the place if you're in the area.
