3.5 Stars . The chopped salad with feta was wonderful - light and fresh. The mahi mahi with streamed spinach I shared with my bestie was fantastic. We had a great meal and enjoyed sitting in the patio in the nice weather. . I only rated this place 3.5 because they need to figure out how to serve white wine. By no means am I an aficionado, but when 2 different glasses of white wine are served at room temperature in barely chilled glasses there is a major malfunction. We informed the kind waiter that our wine was bitter and warm, to which he offered us a glass of ICE!?! Seriously? We returned the wine and asked for it to be removed from the bill, which they did. Could have been a perfect meal if the wine was cold.
