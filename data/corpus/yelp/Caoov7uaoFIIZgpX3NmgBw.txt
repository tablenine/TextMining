Ooooh, I was so excited to see this place the other day on one of my excursions that I had to stop. I remember this chain quite well from living in the southwest, so I knew I'd be happy ... and I was. Carne asada tacos to die for with all the fixins I might need. Chicken nachos that leave you struggling to undo the top button of your pants for some much needed relief. Plus, the salsa bar is always a winner. . . And I completely agree with Lori S ... it's sooooooooo much better than Taco Hell on a late night.
