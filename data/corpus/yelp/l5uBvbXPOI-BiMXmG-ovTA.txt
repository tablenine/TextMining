Restaurant: FLIP Burger Boutique
Category: Burgers
Loud, lively, and very crowded, FLIP burger boutique is a fun place to get a great burger and do some serious people-watching. . . THE GOOD. 1) The burgers. My favorites are the steak tartare, the southern, and the flip with cheese. Also, the onion rings. And the milkshakes. Especially the coffee and doughnut.. 2) The wait staff. Everyone - the hosts, the bartenders, the servers - is friendly, efficient, and eager to please. Added bonus, they're easy on the eye. Where do they find these people? Central casting?. 3) The vibe. I love the energy at FLIP and the mixed crowd - hipsters, families, students, friends, old and young and all ethnicities. . . THE BAD. 1) The french fries. Ours were a soggy mess and flavorless to boot. The smoked mayonnaise was a nice touch, though.. 2) The parking. The small lot fills quickly and the spaces are quite close together. Additional parking is located across the street, but then you've got to navigate Howell Mill without benefit of a crosswalk. . . THE UGLY. 1) The wait. Actually, it's not too awful, because the place runs smoothly, and you can peruse the menu and scope out the scene. However, once you've secured a table, DON'T LOOK BACK at the ones left behind. I made that mistake, and so many of them looked sad, just standing there stony-faced and silent.
