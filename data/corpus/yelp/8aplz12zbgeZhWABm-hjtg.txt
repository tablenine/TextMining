Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
This is my favorite Thai in the city. The food comes really fast. I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes the service is just ok, but the food is worth it.   Its also cheap and has great serving sizes. . . Pad See Ewe: Best in the city!!! I get it with tofu. I had never had tofu before I had this dish for the first time and I don't eat tofu any other time; however, in this dish its delicious. Its also really good with chicken. The dish has wide egg noodles and a sweet soy sauce. Its light and so delicious!!   I haven't found anything close to Joy's pad see ewe at any other Thai place in the city!!
