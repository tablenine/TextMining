Loved our meal at Urban Belly last night! My first time and the community tables reminded me of eating at "Good n Plenty" in Amish Country, PA as a little boy, only the food is a great mix of flavors blending Puerto Rican and Korean traditions! So fun. Amazing apps and my friend and I both had noodle bowls with soup. Both bowls were alive with strikingly different tastes all at once. Great service, quick and friendly. I'll definitely be back!
