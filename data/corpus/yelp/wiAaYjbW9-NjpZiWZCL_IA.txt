This is a cheery little Mexican restaurant in the Lincoln Square area that is a step above your standard joint. It's a family run place, and you are made to feel welcome here. It seems everyone knows everyone else here. We received some chips and salsa as we decided amongst the menu choices, which all looked good to me. Ironically we ordered the two specials not on the menu. My steak came with beans, the namesake cactus, and a red pepper standing up almost as a firecracker candle. The tilapia special came with rice and was beautifully prepared with the tricolor of red pepper, white jicama and green cactus. I would be interested in trying mole chicken or one of the combo platters someday. The horchata and the tres leches cake were fine, with the dessert showing a bit more of a chocolate/tiramisu turn rather than the more typical strawberry touch.
