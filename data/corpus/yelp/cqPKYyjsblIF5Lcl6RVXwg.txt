Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
West Hollywood, the land where liberals and progressives roam freely without fear or repercussions. Also, the land of many great restaurants. Among them, one stands out: Bossa Nova.. . Despite the name of the restaurant being a Portugese term meaning "new trend", the restaurant is actually Brazilian in nature. I was told by locals that all the dishes where meat is involved are very good. Their fish is also supposedly delivered to them daily.. . I had their grilled salmon. The course also came with fried bananas, black beans, yucca, and rice. The fried bananas were good. The yucca was also unique. Didn't blow me out of the water as some claimed it would. The black beans were so, so. But! The salmon was grilled well. Definitely a lot of flavor. The tang that included diced tomatoes added meshed well with the salmon and rice. Â . . My friend had the steak skirt salad. The portion size was so large that he could not finish it, and had to pack it in a box (Note: we came here for lunch).. . There's valet parking at night, but not during the day. The best part? This restaurant is open until 3AM. If you're in the area and need good food past midnight, this is where you want to go.
