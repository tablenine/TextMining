Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
The words heavenly, ambrosial and scrumptious come to mind when I think of Blu Jam! Again, I am very bummed to move from that area- since Blu Jam was one of my Sunday brunch places! They have a great menu, and very congenial servers. Their coffee is delicious! I always have a favorite dish wherever I dine- and the Mazatlan Scramble is wonderful, their fruit is very fresh and goes well after such a wonderful meal. Their Salmon Hash is also delightful! . Minus one star- and it isn't their fault because it is truly a great place- they become quite crowded on the weekends!
