this place is actually really good for lunch (granted you call ahead for a table, or just so happen to be there on a not so busy day). The food is really good and the service is pretty quick. If the food isn't spicy enough to begin with, they've got a number of different hot sauces and chilli powders on each table and along the wall. The Hurricanes are made just strong enough. I definitely live by the gumbo and their jalepeno cheddar corn muffins. Not sure about dinner, as I've only been for lunch. So I'm giving it a modest 3 stars...we'll revisit this when I hit it up for dinner.
