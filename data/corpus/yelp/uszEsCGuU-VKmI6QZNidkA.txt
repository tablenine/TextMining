Restaurant: Taqueria del Sol
Category: Tex-Mex
So, I've been to multiple TDS at 2 different locations. The food was definitely worth the low ass price. But the service, and rudeness in general is just ridiculous. I understand your concept, seriously the guy behind the counter made a girl cry the last time I was in here. The food is not that great, there are plenty of badass Mexican restaurants all over the fucking place in Atlanta, and the food is just as good if not better and they aren't assholes to you. I have been treated like I was privileged to buy food from them, when the opposite is exactly the case. Not too mention there is an constant ass parade of people that have only eaten at TDS or taco bell.
