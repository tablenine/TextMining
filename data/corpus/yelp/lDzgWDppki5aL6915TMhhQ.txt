Being Healthy isn't Hard at R Thomas - Just Ask the Parrots.. . You can always count on this hippie filled outdoor diner to fill you up with all the organic nutrients you need whether it be 4 in the afternoon or 4 in the morning. . . If you are ever starving after a late night movie or concert and don't want to clog your arteries with the Wendy's Drive Through, pull you car next to the neon lit sign reading "R Thomas" off Peachtree and do your heart a favor. . . The menu is all organic! You can order smoothies with organic bee pollen and dates, ham filled omelets, tasty tofu pasta dishes, portabella burgers, butternut squash, curried quinoa, hot tea, etc. But don't fear if you are picky; I have friends who when they hear the words "organic" or "healthy" they freak out because they think it implies raw veggies and stoned waiters. And although you can get those here, my friends are surprised when they can order a natural range beef Â burger with a side of smashed potatoes with shitake gravy and agree it's all good. . . Also, this is a perfect first date place because of the interesting atmosphere. So, when you find yourself in those awkward silent moments, you can always comment on the unusual decor of the colorfully lit porch filled with whimsical wind chimes and earthy pieces of art. . . And, don't forget to check out the live parrots as you leave. You wouldn't want to miss out on Atlanta's own mini parrot zoo.
