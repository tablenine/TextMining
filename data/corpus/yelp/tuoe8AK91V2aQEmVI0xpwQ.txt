i love this place. sooo cute inside. really great place to bring a date. low lighting with twinkling lights around. open air dining in the front which is good for warm weather and the host is even the owner! it's a hidden gem that's not so hidden, so make reservations.. . the rack of lamb is about the best piece of lamb i've ever had. no one does lamb quite like the Mediterraneans do it. . the "Mezze" Assorted Mediterranean Appetizers is awesome. just make sure you have at least 4 people to share it with since it's a monster of a plate.
