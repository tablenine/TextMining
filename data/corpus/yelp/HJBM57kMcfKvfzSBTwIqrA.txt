Restaurant: Fortune Cookie Restaurant
Category: Chinese
I don't quite understand what all the hoopla is about here. It's pretty standard and relatively tasty Americanized Chinese fare. They do give you a ton of food for the money and judging from the looks of the clientele, it's much appreciated. They're also very quick here and the service, as mentioned in other reviews, is undeniably good. . . The main thing that Fortune Cookie has going against it, is that it's awfully close to Buford Highway's smorgasbord of more authentic, and perhaps less generic Asian cuisine. But if you're in a rush and want something dependable, this is your spot.
