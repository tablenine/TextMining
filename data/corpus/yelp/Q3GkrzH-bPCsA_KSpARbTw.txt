What a BYOB gem!  Quite surprised at the quality of the food considering that most BYOB sushi joints have so-so quality sushi.  Not so with Butterfly!  The sushi here is top notch with generous portions with their rolls.  . . Ambiance here leaves a little more to be desired and can be quite cramped, especially if you need to head over to the restroom.  If you are headed that way when they are busy you are sure to have to ask at least 5 people to move before you get to your destination.  . . Service here was acceptable but I was a little put off by the host that took our reservations.  We made reservations for 7 on a Friday for that night and they said that was fine as long as we leave by 9.  Nine times out of ten that is more than a sufficient amount of time to eat but when making reservations it has never been a prerequisite to leave by a predetermined date.  Not very classy.  I'm willing to accept this as an isolated incident due to the tastiness of their sushi and its BYOB status.
