Yes you will wait 1-2 hours essentially every time, but what you are waiting for is an almost  fanatical dedication to quality. You may find other shabu-shabu joints that reach maybe 75% of what they do here in terms of quality,  but the last percentages are what it's all about. Highest grade beef sliced nearly paper thin, a refined ponzu (the secret recipe the owner has refused to sell but I hear it involves extended aging, perhaps a more methodical method of utilizing katsuobushi, the fermented tuna) and a consistency in all aspects of the experience that is unwavering. Excellence honed upon doing just a few things extremely well, and to hell with everyone and everything else. The owner, dubbed mostly affectionately as the "Shabu Nazi" has a penchant for mellow country music. It's his joint, so he dictates the muzak. Such a delightfully incongruous mix of elements. The price, after all this, is very fair.
