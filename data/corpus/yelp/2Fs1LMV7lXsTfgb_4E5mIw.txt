I'm really disappointed with this place.  After looking at their website I had high expectations for this new burger joint but they all fell flat.. . First off, this place is way overpriced.  For $20, I got a 1/3 pound burger (their smallest size), a small shake, and a side of sweet potato fries.  And they were nothing to rave about.  I would have rather gone to somewhere like Rockit or Viand and fork over a few more dollars for something just as good if not better where fries or something come with the order.. . The service is atrocious.  Either they hired anyone who could say burger or their training is awful.  First of all, while all of the other tables got their drinks and fries before the main course I got my whole meal at the same time.  I was dining by myself and felt completely ignored by the staff.  Also, it would have been nice if the waiter had let me know they had alcohol for sale.. . There's a lot of hype about the atmosphere and I don't understand why.  The decor is very very very similar to Chipotle and this place is loud with lots of screaming kids.  . . All in all, this place has some serious problems with service and for the price, I felt ripped off.  I'd rather head to a neighborhood pub or fork over a few more dollars for a good burger. Think of this place as an overpriced Red Robin, where food at the Counter is even crappier.
