Ok I give it 2 stars because I have truly experienced better! OMG...went to dinner for a friends birthday last Saturday night 10/17/09...We got seated upstairs, it was SO LOUD, with a non-stop singing bar crooner, I couldn't even keep a thought in my head let alone carry on a conversation...the service was average...and I was not impressed with the food...Do not get the chopped salad..waste of $10, The Nnocchi was pretty good but cost $25, and so were the Lobster mashed potatoes but also cost $34! Had the Pepper steak which was pretty good but also being $44 was questionable, the Wasabi Mashed potatoes $10, were dry and not as good as everyone raved on about...my bff's chilean sea bass $44, literally tasted like a Filet-o-Fish from McDonald's...all in all it was pretty disappointing considering it was a first time for many in our group... Later we found out our friend's said that the Mastro's in Costa Mesa and the Mastro's Ocean Club in Newport Beach were 10 times BETTER food and service wise...Le Sigh...but now I'm wary of trying it...considering this was one of my top 10 places to try...I was very bummed it did not meet even the basic standards...to top it off the Chocolate Pudding Cake $9 was a major disappointment too, but the creme brulee was pretty good...$120 later...I wished I never went...I can only chalk it up to an interesting experience...
