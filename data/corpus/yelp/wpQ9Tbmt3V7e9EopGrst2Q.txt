Thursday night was our first time to eat at DBA in about two weeks. OMG it was so...... good! Might be because I learned that Jason Hill from Wisteria was in the kitchen "helping out" his buddy Matt. New things on the menu...smoked wings and pimento cheese deviled eggs. We had the deviled eggs for apps and I ordered my usual smoked turkey salad which has been changed and even better. My boyfriend had the smoked wings and his favorite, the babybacks ( which he thinks are the best in the city). And we can never pass up their mac'n cheese and creamed corn. Delish! Turns out Thursday is $2.00 drafts, the boyfriend is fine with that! Â I tried the wine cooler of the day strawberry something which was perfect on a hot summer night. Can't wait to go back!!!
