Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
If you have grown up on the westside than there is something wrong with you if you have never heard of or been to Tito's. I admit to a new comer it might not be the best tasting food on the planet. But i have been going here for decades and it is like comfort food to me. I just stick with the crispy beef tacos which are giant, and full of cheese and lettuce. I smother it is salsa and guac and put a little bit of the green spicy chilies on top. The chips are good too. If you don't mind a really long line and your food in a paper box than try this place.
