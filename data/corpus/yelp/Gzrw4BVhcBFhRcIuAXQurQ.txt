Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
You know how Dave &amp; Busters is like Chuck E. Cheese's but for adults? Ugo is like the Dave &amp; Busters but for wine lovers. Instead of putting money on a card to play games, you put money on a card to drink wine and lots of it. It's a genius idea, I tell ya. . . Sometimes I wanna drink for cheap, but I don't feel like paying 10 bucks plus tip for ONE drink at a posh bar or club. That's where Ugo is genius. I can put just 10 bucks on the card, and end up tasting several different wines by the ounce. You just slide your card and push the button on the dispenser for the wine of your choice and voila! There's a brief description indicating the wine's alcohol percentage, origins, taste, and appropriate food pairings. You can also gauge if you want cheap or expensive wine since the description indicates the cost per ounce and per bottle. . . While you're getting your wine buzz on, chances are that you won't remember the names of the wines you actually liked. This is where Ugo, again, is genius. They supply you with little note cards and tiny no. 2 pencils so you can jot down wines or scribble some drunk doodles and give them to your friends. If you like light white wines, try the 2006 Caymus Conundrum. My friend hates white wine but actually loved the sweet, light crisp taste of this one. Find it at the dispenser along the brick wall and close to the front door. If you like expensive and potent wine, try the 2005 Quinta de la Rosa Lot 601 Ruby Porto. It's strong--19.5% proof and pricey--$43.99/bottle! My friend got a bit buzzed off a couple ounces of that, so you'll definitely get more bang for your buck.
