LOVE this place.  Very elegant, and they have the best darn sake I've ever had.  I went there on a warm, balmy evening and there was a full moon out.  I left Yamashiro in such a tranquil, Zen state of mind, it inspired me to write this haiku:. . ``Tiny brown moth,. . Trapped behind glass,. . Yearns for the moon.". . (The only negative thing I have to say is:  I wish they would play Japanese koto music rather than contemporary music.  Contemporary music spoils the atmosphere.)
