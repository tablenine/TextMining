This place reminded me of a mix between Pink's Hot Dogs and Hodori in LA. It's where everyone goes after they've had their night out on the town... except the staff is rude (on purpose?) and the drunk people who come are even worse.. . If I had to rate the Chicago-style hot dogs, I would have to say they are pretty great. I had never had one before and after seeing what went in it I was concerned. However, the ingredients worked well together and I was pleasantly surprised.. . I would come here for the experience (I didn't get to order a Chocolate Shake), but Pink's or Wurstkuche is just as good!
