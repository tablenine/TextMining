i would give it 5 stars but that would be an insult to anyone who's actually went to Cuba and know what an authentic Cuban sandwich and potato balls taste like..... . bottom line is i love the food here and I would Â go out of my way to Glendale just so i can grabe a bite here.... . . place is simple, upbeat, clean, and food is top notch quality at a very reasonable price.. . dessert is great. . this review does not include their cakes cas i've never had it. and i don't consider the design to be all that special.
