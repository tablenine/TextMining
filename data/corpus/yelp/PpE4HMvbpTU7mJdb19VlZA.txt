Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Went for the dineLA menu. . . I had mussels for appetizer, marinated bistro steak for entree and squash bread pudding for dessert.. . My eating companion had shrimp salad (squid was not on the menu) for appetizer, pork cassoulet (brisket salad not available) and ice cream w/bacon for dessert.. . We were satisfied w/the meal and the service was perfect.  I plan to go back to try the regular menu.. . The atmosphere is flawless.  I love the vibe.. . As an added bonus, my dining companion, who is a star-struck person, saw Benjamin Ford twice and that absolutely made her day.
