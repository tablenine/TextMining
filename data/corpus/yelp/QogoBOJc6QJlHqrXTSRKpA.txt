Just happened to try this place out for dinner before heading over to the fox. I didnt get chance to try of any of the pasta's which looked really tasty by the way... . . I had the chicken cesear salad... and a Magirita Pizza which are really basic items... but all really tasty, it was a not expensive at all I ate there for tax and tip for understand 25 bucks... My waiter was very helpful... and they had quick services....
