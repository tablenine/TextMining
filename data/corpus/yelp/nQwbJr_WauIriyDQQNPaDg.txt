Went there this weekend! During the middle of the Inman Park Festival... My hubby was at Highland Cigars and I was starving so I walked down to Zaya and ordered the lamb, beef, and tomato open faced pita. It was ok once I put some salt on it :-) I wasn't a fan of the balsamic vinaigrette... It would have tasted better with a different sauce in my opinion. The soft pita bread and spread they brought to the table for starters was different but it grew on me after the 3rd bite :-) Will I return? . . Yes during the week because I really wanted a sandwich and they don't serve them on the weekend.... I'll change my stars after I try one :-)
