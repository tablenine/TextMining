The following review is courtesy of a traveling San Francisco yelper:. . This was a pretty cool thai/small plates spot that my friends took me too. Loved the vibe, reminded me of Lime back home, and really like the BYOB policy, which apparently is not that uncommon in Chicago. Easily cut the bill in half. Food was delicious, only complaint is that it is exceptionally noisy, so perhaps not the best place to catch up with friends you haven't seen in a while. But we made it work.
