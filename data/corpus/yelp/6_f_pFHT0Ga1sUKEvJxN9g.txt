3.5. . A-OK.  Roasters is a decent casual place to grab an inexpensive bite.  There's nothing they do that's very special, but it's just a nice alternative to the usual suspects in the same price range (i.e. inexpensive, casual chains).  They can get pretty crowded, so I try to avoid peak hours.. . I like their cornbread and rolls, and I like the variety they offer in side dishes.  Not all of the side dishes are executed to my taste, but it's still nice to have a wide range to choose from.  More than anything, I like that I can get something decently healthy here if I so choose.  Their barbecue doesn't stand out or anything, but it's good enough.  I wouldn't come here if I was specifically wanting barbecue, because there's a lot of better options.  Mostly I appreciate that I can get a decent, inexpensive and relatively healthy meal here with some variety.
