Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's Tacos are alright.  Sure, this place seems to generate tons of hype, but ya know what, their Tacos are not bad.. . Yes, the crowd sucks, the parking sucks, the lack of eating area sucks, but once you get your hands on some of Tito's Tacos, it's worth munching.  But they aren't that cheap, at over $2 a piece.  I mean, nowadays you can get dollar tacos at your local fast food joints. . I remember seeing one of their TV commercials during late night when I was flipping through the channels.  Haha - it was a cheaply done commercial, but it got the message across that people heart Tito's Tacos, and that the only thing better than Tito's Tacos is Two.. . Which, I guess, is true.
