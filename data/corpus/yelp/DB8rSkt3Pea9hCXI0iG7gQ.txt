Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
Give me NACHO TOTS or give me death!!!  . . I visited the vortex twice while on my recent trip... . . The first time I had the pulled pork on Texas toast (with jalapeno cheese on it).  with a side of tots, of course...  and a few really strong tom Collins...     the sandwich was pretty good.  not wow whose grandma did you steal this pork recipe from good, but good.  . . on my second trip I went in late night after a drunken extended after work drinking session....  I needed something to stuff my face with, and the very greasy sounding NACHO TOTS was just the thing...  I sat at the bar and ordered them with a sweet tea...  tator tots covered in chili, jalapenos, cheese, sour cream, beans, and probably a lot of other high calorie things I was too drunk to notice.  MMMM MMM delicious, better than any nachos I've had in a long long time.  (they remind me of something I used to order from the Taco John's chain restaurant)...  Well worth the price of admission, which in my case was a 7 block round-trip drunken stroll while avoiding the prostitutes and homeless of Peachtree Street.. . The atmosphere was pseudo-hipster, but inviting.  (as any past-its-hipster-prime-hangout should be).   I successfully drank something other than a PBR and avoided getting any evil eyes.. . Time to go on a diet.
