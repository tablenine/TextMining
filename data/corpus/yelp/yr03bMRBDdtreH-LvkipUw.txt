VENTING PART:. So went to Kogi last night or should I say was forced into going to Kogi against my will. It was freezing cold, the line was long, and I was miserable. But my friend Guzzy insisted and must have been really craving a fucking Korean taco because despite all my protesting he stood his ground and even kicked me out of the car to stand in line while he looked for parking. Â After standing in line for 30 minutes and ignoring Guzzy for most of the night we finally got to order.. . REVIEW PART:. I ordered a kimchi quesadilla, 1 pork taco, and 1 short rib burrito. (Yeah I ordered way to much but there was no way in hell I was standing in line again) The taco was the best of the bunch - light and tasty with just the right amount of spice, I wish I had ordered 2 more of them. The kimchi quesadilla was interesting, not sure I would order it again. I didn't like how there were whole pieces of kimchi in the tortilla. I would have chopped them up a bit, it was awkward to eat. The short rib burrito was probably my least favorite; it was too sweet for me and really heavy. Also I took a bite of my friends spam slider and thought that was pretty good, I had no idea I was eating spam. . . REVIEW &amp; VENTING CONCLUSION:. Waiting in the freezing cold for a fucking taco Korean or Mexican is not my cup of tea. For the winter months if I'm ever craving a Korean Taco I'll head down to the Alibi Room in Culver City were I can sit down and order the same shit. In terms of the food, my conclusion is stick with the tacos but order a bunch of them. Finally, if they ever make a Korean/Mexican hot god I swear to god I'll shit my pants.
