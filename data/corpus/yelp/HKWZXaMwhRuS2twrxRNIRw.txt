I stayed in the W but was a little afraid to visit Spice Market based on many negative reviews.  I am glad I decided to try this take on upscaled Asian street food.  Almost all the dishes I had here were very enjoyable.  Service was quick and attentive as well.  Decor in here is trendy and unique and a definite positive.  I felt like I was in southeast asia.. . This is not a place I would go back to often because it is not necessarily a great value.  However, the place is moderately priced and definitely worth trying out to make your own decisions.. . I had the tasting menu and it was way more food than I could eat by myself.   If you have two eaters that aren't pigs, it is probably enough food to stuff two people.   . . I had breakfast here as well and it was pretty good.  My favorite dish here was a coconut tapioca pearl soupy ice cream like dessert that was served in an ice bath.   Neat presentation and tasted great!
