Tourist spot:  I always make it a point to show this place to friends visitin L.A.. . Whenever I feel like eatin here the line is ridiculously long, but when someone treats me for lunch, the line's ridiculously short.. . The pricing is reasonable considering the area and its place as an L.A. landmark.  Never seen a movie star, but I was in the background when someone was filming an interview (whoopty-frickin-doo).. . At any rate, good dogs...but I'd have to be in the mood for it.
