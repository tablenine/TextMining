Okay let me preface this review:. After we went to ikea I HAD to try out mi barrio.. but after getting lost for about 30 minutes downtown ( yes I'm OTP!!!! lol)....imputing the wrong address in my GPS . and my boyfriend having to well.. ahhh go from drinking to much h20 post workout...we finally found mi barro!!!!! BUT they were closed!!! *tear runs from eye* we decided to go home ... but ahhh had to make a pit stop on the way back... sooooo..We stopped at OK cafe....Ohh the three cheese mac and cheese! very yum!!! The burgers ( with fried pickles to boot on the side) they serve are "organic" and hormone free which I guess why the $10 price for the burger applies... I was a lil shocked at $33 bucks for 2 burgers.. the dinner menu was a little limited.. but if you like comfort food and middle aged women in little white uniforms this is the place to go :) Â Perhaps next time I'll try their breakfast!
