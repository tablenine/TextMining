Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Pretty solid good Vietnamese food! We had their banh xeo and pho and both were very good. . Coming from CA where you can find a Vietnamese place around just about every corner. I hate that in Chicago, I have to drive across town to find a Vietnamese restaurant to get some good authentic food, but this place is good. They are fast and it is cheap. They are pretty friendly too.. I only gave them four stars because their sanitary condition may be a little questionable. Of course we did go for a Saturday night dinner at 8pm and they were totally packed, but their floors were nasty with food an trash everywhere, I just tried not to think about the kitchen because I was craving some authentic Vietnamese food and had not had any in five months. I will be back and I love that they have such a wide array of items on their menu.
