Love love love this place. It's my favorite Thai food in the whole world.. yup you heard me and I've actually had Thai food in Thailand.... THe place not only opens till 4am but it opens early as well... . . I would recommend the Papaya Salad with Cooked crab, Tom Yum Soup, Pad Ka Prow with Pork, and many of their other dishes.. delish.... . of course Cash only and now some lame parking guys are trying to make a buck or two in the plaza.
