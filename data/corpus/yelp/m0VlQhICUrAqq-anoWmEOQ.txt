Ok .. Deli's in the city unite!  Don't let your good name go down in flames.  Many delicatessens in the city offer a better meal than what this restaurant offers as food.  The menu and decor suggest something playful and interesting if executed correctly.  The food is just plain executed... worse yet ... assassinated.  . . The Reuben fritter is a shamefully weak imitation of the original with none of the character.  The so called cheeseburger spring-roll can be bettered by any beef roll in your local grocers freezer. The fish tacos are simply a flavorless embarrassment. The entrees come straight from the culinary school student programs and lack any originality in presentation and flavor.. . Service was so so but the waiters were earnest if not skilled.
