The only reason I couldn't , in all good conscience, give this place 5 stars was because the parking is horribly inadequate as is the entry area. Watch your elbows if you stand near the front door while waiting for a table. Enough  negative talk  about this otherwise little slice of Thai heaven.  You owe it to yourself to start off with the spicy seafood soup and some nau num tok. After that, close your eyes, point and basically anything your finger lands on will curl your tosies with delight. One of my favorite mild dishes is the avocado shrimp. If your tongue wants spicey, go for basil beef...but just go! You'll find yourself ignoring the hookers cruising through the parking lot to eat here time and time again.
