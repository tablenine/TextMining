Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
I am from Taiwan and this place has the most authentic Taiwanese food I have found in LA so far. . . They are famous for their Sinbala sausage. It's less fatting and more tasty than normal Chinese sausage. We had sinbala sausage with pineapple. It was very yummy. The price is great as well, of course, not as cheap as Taiwan, but it's great for LA. We ordered a few different little dishes and fried spare rib rice plate. The portion was generous and yummy. . . My personal favorite was their shaved ice. A lot of toppings to choose from. Only $4.50 for a large 5 topping shave ice. I couldn't finish, so I had to take the left over to go, they even offered to top off the to go container with more ice and sugar water. I know ice is cheap, but not many restaurants do that. . . Great experience, will definitely go back.
