Just to clarify, the burgers are 5 stars but the wait and having to find a table sucks.  The Culver City one is better if you are claustrophobic, but if you want the real FO experience, go to Santa Monica.  For some reason, the burgers just taste better there.. Some of my friends seemed disappointed when they finally tried it, but I wasn't surprised.  They fall into the best burger in LA is In N Out category. (Nothing wrong with that!)
