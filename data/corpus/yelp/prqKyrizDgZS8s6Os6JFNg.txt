Thanks to Lindley for inviting us to this great asian-hybrid-cuisine place. They are excellent at using spices and the dishes are VERY imaginative. The small selection but high quality approach is great from the traditional American approach of making many dishes mediocre... applause for deciding to focus on making a few dishes stupendous!. . Bill was also at the register and he's a cool guy. Yvonne is also very friendly. The place was packed and talking to locals outside a woman said, finally a good restaurant in Albany Park.. . Word of warning the portions are decidedly un-American. You won't overeat here. It's good if you are health conscious. Most of the dishes are meat based but I went with a vegetarian friend and we still enjoyed delicious food.
