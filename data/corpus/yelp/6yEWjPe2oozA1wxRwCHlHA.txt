This is a wonderful restaurant. It's small and quaint. The best is in the summer, sitting out on the patio sharing a bottle of wine eating delicious crepes. . . The bananas Sara is the best dessert crepe. All the dinner crepes are exceptional as well. Prices are average. The front room is great for lunch. the backroom is great for a group of friends, but the best romantic spot is outside in the courtyard during the summer. Excellent wine selection and beautiful Parisian decorations. . . We've enjoyed dinner here and have even just come for wine and Bananas Sara
