Service!  Seriously, service sucks!  Look over the bad reviews and they all say the same thing about the service!. . This place sucks!  So much better before they moved.  Now they highlight the show even more, which is great, but they're rude.  Went here with my date, to see the show.  Showed up, and was seated 30 minutes before the show started.  Ordered a lot of food, like I always do, and proceeded to feed the belly.. . The show was about to start, and they started to have a big line outside.  The server came over and told us we needed to go.  What?  We weren't even done eating.  I tried to order dessert.  The girl said, "We don't have any".  I said, "what about ice cream".   She says, "we ran out".  WHAT?@!  Then she tells us we need to go.  . . After being forced out, I thought back to the time when this place wasn't as popular, and they cared more about their customers.  Why does this always happen to places that get more popular?. . List of places that you should go to instead:. . Anywhere.. . Service sucks.  Service sucks.  If you read this review, and still go during the show, remember this.
