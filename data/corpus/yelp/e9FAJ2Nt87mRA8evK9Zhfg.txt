To be honest, I dont remember what I ate there or how good it was, but I do remember hanging in the lounge on the side and having a good time. Ghostbar upstairs is ok too but it's a little old. Since I cant recall the food (seriously, it was a long night), I'd have to say go for the drinks and ambience
