I work down the street and have been to this place a few times now. LOVE the exotics. LOVE the beer selection. The music is good and the staff is attentive and helpful. Parking is a bit of a pain depending on the time and day, but the food makes it worth it.. . Recommend: Duck+bacon hot dog w/ caramelized onions, bleu cheese-walnut dipping sauce with your fries.
