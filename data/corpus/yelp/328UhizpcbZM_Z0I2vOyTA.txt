Pros:.        The food is tasty..        Great for lunches..        Portion size is descent. Cons:.        Very Americanized..        Slightly expensive for portion size..        Unfriendly staff.. Price: $8-$10. . Favorite Dish: Pad Thai. . Description:.         This is a good place to grab lunch in Tech Square, but its too expensive to be a regular.  They have weird weekend hours (they are closed from 3pm-5pm).  I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner.
