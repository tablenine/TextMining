went here for the first time on my bday last nite and i had a really great time there. my friends and i had smiles on our faces the whole time.   if you are invited and have an invite card, it's $30 at the door and you are required to have dinner.  we did not have to eat dinner since we were walked in by one of the magicians, so i won't be able to give any info on what they serve, but i do know that plates range from $40-90 per plate.  the drinks i do know were about $12.50 each for a grey goose or any top shelf drink.  it is a very upscale dress code. guys have to wear a coat and tie and ladies have to wear a cocktail dress or some sort of equivalent.  it was fun getting dressed up and having a a nite out with a bunch of friends. . . this is a perfect place to bring a date. you and your date will not have a dull moment. all of the magicians that we saw were friendly, made us laugh, as well as amazed us with all their slight of hand tricks.   i read some reviews from people who gave this place bad reviews, and i think those people in general don't have fun anywhere they go, and are probably negative about everything they rate, so don't pay attention to them and go have the time of your life at this place!  i definitely will be coming back here again. it beats going to some bar or club where you have to pay $20 or $30 to get in and pay the same amount of $$$ for drinks and get no entertainment value.
