Not that this place needs another review but . . . here goes nothing.. . I was a bit hesitant when the hostess told me it would be a 45 minute wait and just took my name down . . . no buzzer, no #, no nothing.  however, i was reassured that once our table is ready, someone would come up and get us.  low and behold, 40 minutes later, one of the hostesses came to where we were sitting in the bar area and told us that our table was ready.  KUDOS to the hostesses.. . while we were waiting for our table, we ordered some small dishes to munch on - portobello fries and meatballs.  Portobello fries are DELICIOUS!  I love the chewiness of the portobello mushrooms and the crispy outer layer, aka, the batter.  The meatballs were good but I thought the marinara sauce was a bit too tangy for my taste.  only gripe while we were waiting was that it took FOREVER for our drinks to come - i think ordering directly from the bar would have been faster. . . now, onto our dinner.  my boyfriend and i shared the pork chops w/ apple sauce and the bianco pizza.  pork chops were surprisingly tender and juicy and paired so well w/ the apple sauce.  the pizza had a good balance of garlic and white sauce that complimented the strong and bitter taste of the arugula.  . . overall, great dining experience and i cant wait to go back.  there are so many small dishes that i still want to try!. . OH and one more thing - i LOVE LOVE LOVE how you get the option of sparkling or still water . . . all at no extra charge!
