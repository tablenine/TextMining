Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
Pretend you are a fondue eating, jazz loving pirate with pet alligators. Now picture yourself at Dante's Down the Hatch. Amazingly, it's the same picture.. . This place is probably one of the quirkiest ideas of anyone who opened a jazzy nightclub/restaurant in Atlanta (something normal maybe at Disneyworld).. . You are treated more like a captain here than a steward. The eye patched wait staff is helpful as they lead you across the live alligator filled mote, through the maze of deck's (upper, lower, and poop) till you reach your own personal cabin.. . Order a bottle of wine, and swoon over the live jazz band playing versions of your favorite tunes.. . Feast on a selection of fondue. You can choose Chinese dumplings for an appetizer, and a Swiss cheese fondue to complement the Mandarin Fondue (1/2 lb of different meats and sauces to dip). I would go into detail about how delicious the food is, but your mouth is going to start watering. You really need a special celebration to spend this much on dinner. . . The last time I visited Dante's was right before I left for Europe where I had the opportunity and tried traditional fondue in Switzerland; my experience at Dante's was so much more enjoyable and delectable. My Swiss waiter ended up spilling the fondue oil all over me, and I smelled like a piece of meat the rest of the weekend. Luckily the Billy goats and cows didn't try to lick me on my hike the next day. This of course will not happen to you at Dante's (the servers are much too nice), and they have no Billy goats, only alligators to lick you. Right... . . But really, this place is classy, exciting, fun, and delicious! . . So after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean, continue the pirate theme date and dine at Dante's Down the Hatch. Just remember to save two dollars for the valet.
