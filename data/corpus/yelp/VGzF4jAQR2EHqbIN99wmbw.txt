A perfect place for a tourist. The view is spectacular for a restaurant. Now, let's talk about food. You could probably get better quality food from a local vietnamese, chinese, and japanese restaurants around your house for 1/4 of the price. The food is absolutely a joke. I had spring rolls and eel for appetizers. what a waste of money. The spring rolls that you can get from a local asian place is 10x times better. And the eel?!?! I think they are the frozen-packed ones from chinese market. o yea... the service.....the waiters and waitresses think they are the customers.....
