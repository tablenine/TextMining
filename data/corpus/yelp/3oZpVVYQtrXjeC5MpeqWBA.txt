This place is packed! Better come at an off time, because you're going to be waiting out the door!. . I would highly recommend the rattlesnake braut, which has a hint of spicy and good body of flavor. . . The beer to recommend has to be the Belgian beer La Bouffe! It has a light crispy, fruity flavor and for an $8 beer, you kinda have to expect something special. This beer is special.
