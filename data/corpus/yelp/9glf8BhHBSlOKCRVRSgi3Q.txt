Restaurant: Tamarind Seed
Category: Thai
To me there are certain foods that should be cheap...always.  One of those is Thai food.  I just think that you can get great Thai food on the cheap, and thats just how it should be.. . Tamarind Seed, on the other hand, is a bit too expensive, and not good enough to justify the expense.  Its like the kid in class in school that got last seasons polo shirt for 75% off and tries to act like he paid full price.  Dude, the shirts from 2 summers ago!  . . Thats how I feel about Tamarind Seed.  I wanted to stand up and yell, "Dude, its just Thai food".. . The food was average, too expensive to justify, the service was pretty good though, it sits right on peachtree, and is a nice spot to hit at night.  I could see how one might view it as a bit romantic too.  . . Doubt  I'll hit this one again.
