Mmm.  Who doesn't like fried chicken? I ordered the Lord Harvey and opted out of getting waffles this time, but I did get grits and a biscuit.. . The chicken here is delicious. By itself, the chicken (I specified dark meat only) is juicy and seasoning is full of flavor. I love the gravy and I usually get in on the side instead of having it smothered over the chicken.  It's perfect for dipping the chicken and the biscuit in as well.  On a hot day, the Sunset (Lemonade &amp; Fruit Punch) is a great drink too.. . There is usually a 10 minute wait regardless of the time of day, but there is plenty of street and lot parking.  The place has a diner feel too it and the service is okay. Expect to spend at least $10 per person and gain 10 pounds after eating here.  Everything is on the greasier side, fried, made with butter, super tasty, etc.  . . All in all, you're going to love it or hate it, but if you like fried chicken as much as I do, you can't go wrong.
