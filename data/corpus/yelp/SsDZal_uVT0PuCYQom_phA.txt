I feel the hate for the "no cards policy", but it doesn't overcome the fact that everything else seems to have been done "right". Big Star was clean and polished, the drinks were good, and the snacks, salty/tangy/spicy, definitely hit the spot.. . There are a few large booths along the side, but most of the seating is around the bar. We walked in at around 4pm on a Sunday, freezing cold outside, to find it packed, and getting packed-er, some great classic country music playing, and ate half a dozen tacos, and two fancy drinks each for ~$50.. . I think the key to full enjoyment, from reading other reviews, is to show up at a random time on a miserably freezing day, after getting a haircut. . . ps. Thankfully they had the common sense to burn the Pontiac bathroom to the ground before rehabbing the rest of the place.. . pps. The margarita is delicious, don't let the smokiness warning turn you off.
