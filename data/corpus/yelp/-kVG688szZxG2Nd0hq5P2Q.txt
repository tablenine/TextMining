what is the big DEAL about this place?????. i have lived down the street my WHOLE LIFE and have had to eat this crap on many occasions for whatever reason....and i just dont get it. . everything is gross. didnt they close down for a while in the 80's because they were serving up dog food or something?. whatever....the point is the food sucks, the lines are just RETARDED. its just a bunch of lame ass hipsters trying to be "scene" by going to titos so they can say, "yea bro.....im so full...just got back from TITOS...you know....". seriously...gross. that whole entire corner of restaruant is just gross. . you want a bomb buritto? go to "la playita" on Lincoln just north of rose. THATS some good mexican fast food.
