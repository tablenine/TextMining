BEST BURGER IN LA. . hands down! i never understood why people went to Pinks. I personally don't think they are THE BEST or worth the wait. however, I do think that this place is THE BEST and worth the wait. I had the hatch burger. although it wasn't spicy like I was informed and expected, it was still delicious. their buns have this sweet taste to them. a bit oily but it makes the burgers better. fries were ok, nothing special. . . if you havent tried this place, GO!! it'll be worth your $9!
