I was seduced by this restaurant not because of the menu, but because of the patio seating. The setting is definitely excellent. But sadly, the atmosphere of the whole place is the only reason why I would give this place its 1 star. . . First off, the food was not just ok, it was horrible. I came in for brunch, and the eggs benedict was very bland. There was not enough hollondaise sauce, and the canadian bacon wasn't that great. The potatoes were ok, but still did not make my dish any better. The brunch menu clearly stated that each plate comes with banana bread, but I had to ask the waiter if I could have my banana bread after it did not come with my plate. . . My friend got the steak and eggs. Not only did the dish not come with steak, but instead a slice of beef that had no resemblance to a slab of steak. Why did the waiter even bother asking how he'd like the steak done if it was going to come out well done on a thinly sliced piece of beef?. . I would definitely not come back 'cause the atmosphere is definitely not worth the horrible food. I'd walk those 6 blocks to Cafe Orlin.
