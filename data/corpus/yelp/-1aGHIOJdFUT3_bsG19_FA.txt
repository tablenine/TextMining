I could go to this restaurant everyday...that is, if I had bills overflowing out of my pockets.. . We started off with the chopped salad, which was unconventionally pleasant and yummy.  Texture, flavor, color was matched only by the perfect balance of the mild tanginess of the dressing.  We moved onto the meatballs which were heavenly.  It seriously melted in my mouth.  The proscuitto and rucalo pizza was SOOOOOOO good.  I can't think of words to explain the experience...mmmmmmm~. We finished off the evening with the butterscotch budino...i think i squealed after a spoonful...and proceeded to lick up every last creamy goodness.. . The food was absolutely amazing...ambience was nice.  Unfortunately the wait sucks, and service is definitely not Michelin standard...not horrible, but just not noticeably great either.
