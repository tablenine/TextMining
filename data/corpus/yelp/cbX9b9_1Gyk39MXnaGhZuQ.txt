Husband and I came here after seeing John Williams at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (omgwtf awesomeness). The place was poppin'. . . Service was a tad on the slow side, but that was sorta expected at nearly 11pm with a bunch of people there for drinks, dinner, and dancing. Plus, we were still on a high from John Williams so we didn't mind too much.. . We ordered the ceviche sampler and the n27 combination platter. The platter, imo, wasn't worth it (you only got one dinky piece of everything), but the ceviche platter was HUGE for two people and it. was. DELICIOUS. . . Shrimp &amp; scallop, hamachi verde, rainbow coctel, and ahi tuna &amp; watermelon. Yum. My two favorites were the rainbow coctel and ahi tuna &amp; watermelon. My husband liked the other two so it worked out perfectly.. . The dancing started with Sergio Mendes (love the guy) and before we left, we were mesmerized by this amazing couple on the dance floor.
