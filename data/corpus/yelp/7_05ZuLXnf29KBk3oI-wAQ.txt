Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
there are 2 schools of thought here at Titos,. the first one is "the best since forever and like greatest man!". I am not from this school. . I was intrigued by the long lines, all these people spending so much time waiting for Tito's tacos, you could build a pyramid with all that time.. . So on a whim I pull over and give them a shot, 30 minutes later,. Dude! this is like jack in box with a following!. I guess people love Celine Dion too.. . Not me.
