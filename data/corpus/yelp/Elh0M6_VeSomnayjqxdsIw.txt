You dirty, hipster housing bitch. Milk, I fucking love you.. . Despite the too-cool-to-get-a-job crowd that clusters up under your shady umbrellas on Beverly Boulevard. . . Because of your soup and half salad combo that fills me with fresh veggies, warm deliciousness and a sweet feeling of satisfaction.. . Despite my addiction to your perfectly chewy molasses cookies and seasonal agua frescas, like nectar from Valhalla. . . And, most importantly, because you are within walking distance of my office.
