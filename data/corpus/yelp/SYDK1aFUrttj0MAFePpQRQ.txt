We just had a good dining experience at Sticky Rice, and we would go back again when we want some Thai food. I really enjoyed their Massaman curry, the tofu in it was firm and tasty. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly, and I liked that they had pictures of all the different exotic fruit they serve there. . . As said before, there is a HUGE menu, so it's enough to go back to try some of the other dishes that look interesting. I was a little disappointed in the pot stickers, because whatever meat they used inside was minced to such a fine paste it was unrecognizable. Also the yellow curry could have used more spice, but wasn't terrible.. . Good food, friendly staff, overall satisfying experience. :)
