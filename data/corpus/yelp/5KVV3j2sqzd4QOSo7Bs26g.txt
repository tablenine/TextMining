Another overrated "LA mustgo" restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I love garlic - I would kiss someone who smelled garlic-y. We ordered: . . 7/10 - Garlic Spinach Fondue - mmm cheese, can't go wrong with that. :D. 3/10 - Forty Clove Garlic Chicken - With so many garlics in the name, why was it so tasteless, dry and shabby? first fail. . 3/10 - Roasted Shrimp on Skillet - the shrimps were swimming in oil. I had to resort to my asian ways and dab the shrimps individually with my napkin to do some damage control. . 8/10 - Rabbit - best dish of the night, it was cooked perfectly! . . They really didn't do garlic justice all in all, which is why I'm giving it such a low rating. . . Parking valet is 6 dollars. Cough up, its Beverly Hills. You'll just get a ticket if you park residential. (Lesson learnt the hard way unfortunately..)
