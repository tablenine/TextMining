Only had the bulgogi/kimchi sandwich here, and I'm wishing I had the bellydog instead...I'll have to try it next time.  Anyway its a bit weird for my taste.  I understand that the bulgogi and kimchi flavors arent true as they need to be 'mitigated' to accomodate the mainstream, but my taste just couldnt reconcile the flavors...it wasnt bad...not a fan of this one though.  I'm pretty sure I'll like the bellydog tho.  I like the style of the place, clean and simple, and a fun creative menu is always appreciated here.
