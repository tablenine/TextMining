I go to this place for dessert, namely, so note this review will contain nothing about cheese or savory crepes.  There isn't a lot of room for sitting down.  Hence the minus one star.  That said?. . Oh my LORD, their dessert crepes are a foodgasm unto themselves.  The dark chocolate or banana sara especially is enough to send me into orbit and then some.   Go get some sweet crepes and your taste buds will thank you.  For real.
