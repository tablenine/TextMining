I tried Kogi again for a second time and it was much better than the first. It must be that with more time, they've improved. The food definitely tasted a lot better, though I'm still not convinced that it lives up to the hype. That being said, it's certainly getting points for innovation and taste. I love street food, and Kogi's about as good as you're going to find here. The wait is long, but it's worth trying. My only problem is that I don't like how messy it gets when you try to take the taco out of the cardboard trays they give you; they overlap when they put it in, and it's a mess coming out. Redesign the plating, perhaps?
