Great cheap lunch downtown! . . This place always has a line from 12 - 1:30 or so. The line moves fast - as the pizza n@zi keeps it moving. Know what you want when he says next and it gets to you - and pay attention or he'll yell out NEEEEXT and everyone will know you're a newbie!!! . . They have a two slice one drink combo for $5.50. I usually get the spinach and a pepperoni slice with a cola beverage. Yum! I also get the lasagna which comes with a side salad and drink for I think $7 It's a lot to eat and you'll enjoy!. . Seating is sparse - I am usually good about snagging a seat outside. Next time you're downtown check this place out!
