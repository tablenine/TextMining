Okay, best pizza in L.A.? . . I waited a long time to try this place. Crust is great, blah blah blah. Okay, best pizza crust in L.A.? Yes.. . I am not a crust finisher. Their crust is wonderful. It's trOO. I ate almost all of it. Got the salad to split. The one with the dry Italian salame. It was 15 bucks, heavy on the dressing but fresh and good. My wife had the safe Margherita and I the funghi something something, mushroom pizza. Hers was very sweet from the tomato sauce. Perfect crust as I said. My mushroom one was very mushroomy, pleasantly olive oiley, perfect crust. Are they great pizzas. I have to admit yes. *sigh* I have to admit it. I would eat these pizza again any day. I don't even love pizza.. . I would not compare them to an American pizza, like the nearby Village Pizzeria which I also like a lot. There is really good American pizza and this which maybe is chef designed Italian type of pizza. I like them both. Maybe this deserves 5 stars for the best crust ever, but I don't love pizza, so maybe that's the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me...
