Belly Shack is so good and I went twice this weekend, that should show people that if its worth going back in the same weekend, that it's good.  On the first visit we tried two sandwiches the Asian Meatball and the Kogi Beef.  We also had the hot and sour soups.. . I love the place!  The sandwiches were fresh and the hot and sour soup was tasty and different from your traditional hot and sour.  The garnish was a mix of sprouts, tortilla strips and some sricha sauce to add just the right kick.  The soup was filled with chunks of chicken.. . On the second visit, we decided to go more the route of trying some of the uniquely sounding sides.  Again we went for the hot and sour soup (Yes its that good)  and tried out tostones with chimichurri, kimchi and brussel sprouts with chorizo.  I found the flavor combinations in all of the sides to be great.. . I can see me frequenting Belly Shack pretty often, especially for the Hot and Sour Soup.  It's very unique and tasty!  Price is about $20 for two people.
