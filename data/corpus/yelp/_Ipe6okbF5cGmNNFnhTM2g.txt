The slice was so big that...well it could have been a whole pizza on its own, that's how big. And amazingly it was still good. You'd think a slice that big for only $3 would therefore probably lack in flavor. Yet it was surprisingly and easily edible - so edible (I'm embarrassed to admit) that I ate the whole thing in one sitting.
