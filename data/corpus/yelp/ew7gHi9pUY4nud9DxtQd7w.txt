Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Joan's on third is the closest thing in LA to a New York style deli/cafe. Â If I didn't look at the blue sky outside, and the lack of NYC cabs -- and the lack of skyscrapers -- I think I might've thought it a rather spacious NYC cafe.. . Fresh ingredients and spritely service as well as freshly brewed coffee and thoughtfully composed sandwiches make for a great way to start a day, be it via brunch, breakfast or lunch.
