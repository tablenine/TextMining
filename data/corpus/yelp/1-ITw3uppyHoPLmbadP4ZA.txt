Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This is by far one of my favorite places to eat...I'll admit it's not the greatest portion in the world...but with $1 refills..WHO CARES?!!!...The service is so genuinely nice also...They seem to give off a kindness, that you'd probably see in Japan.... But yeah, the ramen is bomb as hell...!. I order my noodles Extra Hard, with a thick soup base, and strong oil.... I don't waste my stomach on any toppings, because I like the way the noodles taste a lot...I've frequented the place over 23 times, so I haven't been there for a while.... But everytime I go I eat 4 bowls of ramen...HAHAHA!!!
