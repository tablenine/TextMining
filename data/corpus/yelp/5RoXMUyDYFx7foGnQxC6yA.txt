Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Veggie Grill is awesome!. . I like that it operates like a fast-food joint but has healthy choices and they're great tasting! I also like that they don't have soda at their drink station. It's only tea, lemonade, and water! So far I've tried:. . Chickin' Caesar Salad ($9.50). Sweetheart Fries ($4.25). Grillin' Chickin Sandwich ($8.95). Carne Asada Sandwich ($8.95). . Everything was goooooooooooood. I usually eat a lot of Asian vegetarian food so this was something very different and satisfying! My favorite was the salad because it had little crouton crumbs inside and it tasted like I was eating a real grilled chicken salad. The sauce that comes with the sweet potato fries is also really good. Their coleslaw is kind of weird. I'm not a big fan of the purple cabbage and that was all that it was made of. The restaurant itself has a very modern design that kind of reminds me of Jamba Juice. It's clean and I feel comfortable here. The only thing is that it gets crowded and it might be hard to find a seat. Workers here are niceeeeeeee!
