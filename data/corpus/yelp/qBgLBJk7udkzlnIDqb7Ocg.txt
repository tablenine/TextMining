You've never heard hype until you've heard the hype that I've heard about this place before finally trying it. Everything from 'if it comes from the Kogi guys it must be good' to 'that pork belly was the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth.'. . And ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to report that it lives up to the hype! I was practically squealing with excitement when I finally got the chance to try this place on a recent evening. Everything on the menu looked incredible but I had to go with the famed pork belly bowl. I also threw in some of their grilled corn (the Van Gogh) and one of those super authentic Korean drinks that have whole grapes in them. . . The bowl was absolutely delicious and very unique, with unusual ingredients like cilantro and i think peanuts? The star by far was the pork belly, which is incredibly fatty but oh so tasty. . . The corn was also amazing, nicely grilled with some cheese and what I thought tasted like sesame oil on there. . . I also had a bite of the ooey gooey fries, which were strange but delish in their own way. Cheese, chilis, sour cream, and even some sweet roasted garlic on some nicely crunchy french fries! . . To make a good thing even better, I loved the service. The guy Â manning the register was super helpful and seemed genuinely excited about each of the items. We also had a nice run-in with someone I was told was one of the partners, a lovely lady who was funny and helpful all at once. Everyone had a really chill feel about them and the whole space was just very welcoming and hip at the same time. A hard combo to find in LA!. . Run, don't walk to Chego!
