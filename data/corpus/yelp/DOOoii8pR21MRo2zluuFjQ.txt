Went to Bite for brunch and it was pretty good.  Highly recommend the french toast and homefries.  The service was decent, but not really good.  I think they need to hire more help.  The two servers they had seemed to lack decent communication skills.  Makes you wonder what compelled them to go into the food service industry since they were pained to answer questions or take food orders.  Oh well, I'll probably go back because the food was pretty good and it wasn't crazy packed like other places for Sunday brunch.
