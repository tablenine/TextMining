Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Jerry's is our go to place when guests are in town. Pretty good prices, everyone from vegetarians to meat lovers can find something and their beer selection is amazing. Their sides are great, service is always good and i usually opt for a flight of beer and one of their specials... never lets me down
