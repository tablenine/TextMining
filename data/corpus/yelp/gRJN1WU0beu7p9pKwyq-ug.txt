Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
i recently spent 3 months working in thailand.  it has taken me the same amount of time to go to a thai restaurant.  today i went to "sticky rice" for the first time.  when the waitress approached, i looked at her face and began to tear.  cause i realized i missed thailand and she resembled a 16 year old student of mine whom i loved.  . we had ant egg omelet, pork cracklins, papaya salad, pork sticks, sticky rice, northern thai sausage (THE highlight) and fish ball basil.  along with 2 thai ice teas and coffees.  in thailand, it was that tea that really brought it home for me.  and drinking it there really reminded me of a place i  had not thought about that much because i'm currently getting ready to work in africa.. i loved everything i ate. i liked using the very limited thai language i learned.  the location is easy, as was parking.  when i feel like thai in the future, i will probably return to this one.  it was several notches above many of the other thai restaurants i've eaten at.  and you can get the fried worms, which is not usually on the menu at other american friendly thai joints, let alone ant egg omelet.. i'm a bit biased, as i have a special place in my heart now for thailand and this place happened to be in the right place at the right time.
