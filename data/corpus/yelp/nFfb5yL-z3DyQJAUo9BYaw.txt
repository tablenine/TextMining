super fresh, super high quality sashimi, reasonably priced. the best deal is the sashimi for lunch!! i've been eatin' here since 1982!! there is ALWAYS a long line for lunch. so, be there by 11am or just before they close. if you get there just before they close, *cross your fingers* that they'll let you in. sometimes, their waiting list is so long that they'll stop takin' names earlier than 2pm or whatever time it is that they stop serving lunch. dinner is awesome, with the small tofu &amp; beef broth appetizer that comes complimentary with each person's entree order. I LOVE THIS PLACE. . . warning: the host is a real ass but you can't blame him. he's always swamped with names and parties and people constantly asking him if they are next. GIVE HIM A BREAK!! but be sure to listen for your name and make sure your ENTIRE party is present. or else you don't get seated!!
