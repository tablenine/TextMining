Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
First of all, don't look at 3 stars as being bad.  Too many reviewers (myself included) might be a little too liberal with the 5 star review.  A Five star review should mean that the place or service is flawless.. . El Taco is a fine place.  Let's weigh the following in order of best to worst:. . Service - excellent.  Getting your name in and seated, to the waitstaff, everything here is well above average.. . Atmosphere - great.  It's a fun atmosphere a little on the loud side, but the loud probably enhances the fun.  Maybe a little noise reduction would help.. . Food - good.  Everthing I've had I've liked though I can't say one thing stands out as being great.   The chips &amp; queso are yummy, and the salsa bar offer some really nice flavors.  I like the smokey salsa that is reminiscent of Willy's salsa that I eat like it's my last meal everytime I go.. . Drink - ok.  Beers and margartias are fine, but there is no sweet tea.  At least they sell Coke products instead of Pepsi.  That would be a deal-breaker.. . Overall, I like the place.  The food can improve some, but in it's current form, it's a nice alternative in the VaHi neighborhood.
