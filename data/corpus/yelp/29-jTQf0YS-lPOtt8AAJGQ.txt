Restaurant: Sun Dial Restaurant
Category: American (New)
Spinning high above Atlanta with the city skyline in the background. With a drink in hand. . . Pretty much essential on the out of town visitor 'to do' list is the Sun Dial Restaurant &amp; View, which slowly revolves atop the Westin Peachtree Plaza.. . On a busy night if there's a major event going on downtown, the line can be long to ride the elevator up the 73 stories - so it's a good idea to get in early on nights like those.  . . Go for drinks instead of dinner - you can relax in the comfy bar chairs and time your stay by the number of rotations you make. According to their website, it takes 35 minutes to go the complete 360 degrees. . . so that comes out to be about one bottle of wine for every two rotations . . . . . Get the cheese sampler for $14.95 to go with that vino. It's a generous amount of cheese and the perfect complement to the atmosphere. You'll be able to catch a sunset view if you opt for before dinner and the glittery twilight skyline if you go after.  As the final touch, there's a jazz trio that preforms on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
