Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I ordered the ramen and gyoza combo!. It was F-ing delicious!. I have never tasted a ramen like this before so maybe my rating might be skewed, but I totally fell in love w/ Japanese ramen!  I especially enjoyed the pickled ginger in the soup!  What a tasty touch!. I have tasted authentic gyoza before and you can tell the gyozas at this spot were made fresh!. I ordered normal for noodles, oil, etc.  I really enjoyed the ramen noodles.  THey were firm enough and tasty!. YaY for SHIN-SEN-GUMI!!!
