really good.  solid ingredients, homey flair, and simple offerings.. . i enjoyed the crust.  but i think it takes a certain type of personal preference to enjoy the crust - it's much like a pie crust should be, if you were to imagine the crust of a fruit pie, but just more savory than sweet.  it felt good between my teeth.  the alternate option, i suppose, would be a more bready crust, like the way most pizzas tend to be.  i welcomed the pie crust change with open arms (and an open mouth, except when i was chewing).  it tasted much more like real food (and gourmet pizza) than the greasy crap that pizza chains serve.
