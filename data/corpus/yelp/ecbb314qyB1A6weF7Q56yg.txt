Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant

I love love LOVE Versailles.  I, too, always order the garlic chicken.  It is just signature for this place!  They do have other meats with their famous garlic sauce, but I always crave it when I go here so I can't imagine ordering something else.  The serving size is AMAZING.  You are bound to get full, even with the delicious bread they serve prior to your meal coming out.  The garlic chicken meal comes with beans and plantains (fried bananas) which are DELICIOUS.  It is just amazing.  One down side is the parking up front, but with the amazing food it is definitely worth it!!!!  Also, if you like quiet restaurants, this probably isn't the right restaurant to go to, but nevertheless, I feel EVERYONE should go and try this place out.
