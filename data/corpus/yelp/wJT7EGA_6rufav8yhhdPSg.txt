Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Tastes like a big mama celeste pizza. . I went during the summer time and they HAD NO AIRCONDITIONING.  Me and my friends were about to leave, but the fact that many people were still in there eating the pizza and enduring the heat spoke volumes about the quality, or so I thought.. . Nothing magical about this place, to me the pizza was good, but tasted like a big mama celeste pizza.  Alittle on the greasy side, but I guess most people like that about this pizza.  . . Nothing really jaw dropping about this place at all.  Just decent pizza, unless u absolutely adore the mama celeste frozen pizza's, then you will love this place.
