It's my goal in life to try everything on the Bossa menu.  OK not really, but I've never had something here I didn't like.  If you're feeling like acting out, get the Santa Fe Chicken Salad.  It's tostada shell is sooo good.  Pretty much any salad is a winner.  I love the Bossa Salad, the Steak Salad, and Andrea's Favorite Chicken Salad.  Their sandwiches are insane too, especially Chucho's Chicken club.. . Prices are reasonable and the portions are GINORMOUS.  Easily shared.
