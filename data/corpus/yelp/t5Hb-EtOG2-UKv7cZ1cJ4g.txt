Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
Biscuits were delicious! I have never had such fluffy biscuits!  This is a MUST have at The Flying Biscuit! It is served with a heavenly apple butter, I just wanted to lick every last morsel of it. . . I guess they really know how to do "fluffy" because that is the only word I can think of to describe their french toast and omelets too! The french toast is served with an amazing strawberry preserve and sugar icing. . . The only reason why I am giving this place four stars instead of five was for the wait.  When we put our name down for 4, the hostess told us 35 minutes. So we waited and 35 minutes later, there were a few open tables to seat 4 but they didn't seat us for another 15 minutes even though we were next on her list.  We also did keep asking when it was our turn.
