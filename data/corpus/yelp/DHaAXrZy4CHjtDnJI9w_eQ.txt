Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Being from out of town, and saw this place on the Food Network, we decided to try it. . . The hotdogs and sausages were good.  The hotdogs are less salty than your regular dogs.  You can have them in many different ways.. . The line at around 6pm wasn't bad.  I was in line for only about 5 minutes.  The workers do keep it flowing.
