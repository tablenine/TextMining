Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
U-go?  Me...no-go.  Unless I have to.. . Some of my friends like to eat at this place.  I don't know why.  Some of my friends say they are true fans of Italian cuisine, so they choose this place.  . . In which I say, "Ugo?  You want to go to Ugo?"  . To which they reply, "Yes, it's authentic Italian food". . WRONG-O!  . . The food here is mediocre Italian food at best.  If we were in Italy, the food here would be compared to the likes of the Autogrill.  . . (For those who don't know what the Autogrill is, it's a rest stop/fast food/convenience store along the Italian highways.  You can purchase a hot Italian meal along with a can of hairspray, if need be.). . I hate to say it, but the food at the Autogrill is better than this joint.  . . If you're in the mood for good Italian food, check out Cafe Paradiso in West LA.  If you're in the mood to people watch, then go to Ugo, but don't expect a meal that satisfies your dire craving for the most authentic Italian food out there.  This is not it.. . Do check out their Gelato.  It's well worth it on this side of town.
