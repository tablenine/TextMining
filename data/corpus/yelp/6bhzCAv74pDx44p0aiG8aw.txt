Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Bathrooms: Clean. Atmosphere: Fantastic Urban Hip. Service: Poor. Food: Hit or Miss, Below Average. Price: $33 per person. . I really wanted to love this place, but I ended up just slightly liking it!. . Appetizer Combo for two was excellent and a great start to our meal!. . Won Ton and Hot and Sour Soup was cold and tasteless.. . Chicken Fried Rice was not so good!. . Scallops, Peanut Chicken and Salt/Pepper Beef were good!. . Pass on the Grilled Sake Chicken was terrible.. . Service started out good, ended up very bad.
