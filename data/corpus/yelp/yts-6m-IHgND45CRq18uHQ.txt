I went to Shout last Friday night and well the DJ absolutely sucked...I guess Friday is Techno night but I prefer a bit more Hip Hop...Anywho I was told not to eat the food prior to arrival so I didn't but it has a great atmosphere....It's a lounge type thing upstairs and very good for groups to go....I was a little suspicious about couples who were just there to people watch but I had a great time with my girls...The crowd is late 20s on up to 40s +....and the men are def. there to mingle (to my disadvantage because Im not single)... . I would go back but I would probably try a Saturday night instead but they have a great little setup.... . Be ready to pay he $10 for valet if you opt to and the upstairs lounge/mini club is free
