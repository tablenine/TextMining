Restaurant: SIP The Experience
Category: Coffee & Tea
I love this place! Love, love, love. Â I ride marta to work, so I'm always looking for a spot to get an iced latte either than Starbucks. Sip's vibe, interior, and drinks are awesome. I go there almost every morning.. . And their grilled cheese panini is to die for!
