Give me sushi and give me a view and I will be in heaven! I don't even know what to say about Yamashiro...it really blew my mind!!! Granted, I went there directly after attending a party which had an open bar, so things were generally on the upswing, shall we say, at the time.... . The view was so kick-ass! The view alone is worth a four star rating...the sushi was pleasant, of course it was on the pricier side given the venue, and they were about to close the kitchen when we got there, so we had to chose really fast, but it was all still quite good. I especially liked the tofu-lettuce wraps! . . I didn't order a cocktail (that was probably wise, I didn't need another one!) but I think they had a nice looking drink menu, as well. We were staying at the Magic Castle Hotel, so they gave us a free ride up and down the hill. . . I enjoyed Yamashiro immensely...this place is not to be missed!!!
