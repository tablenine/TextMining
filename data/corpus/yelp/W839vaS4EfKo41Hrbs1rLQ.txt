So my first experience at Stanley's was about a week or two ago on a cold Saturday morning for the weekend brunch. It was nice and not overcrowded at all (although I was told by my BF that in the summer the place is a zoo for brunch). . . They had quite the spread of breakfast foods. And believe it or not it was the first time I tried biscuits and gravy (poor judgment on my part - I should of known better that it would be an instant love affair). The coffee was pretty good and I liked the scrambled eggs and bacon. . . I left feeling very satisfied and ready for the day! I cant wait to go back - for biscuits and gravy ... hehe.
