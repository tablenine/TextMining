*NOTE TO MY FELLOW ALKIES*- late night happy hour is only at the bar!  I came here for dinner for the first time last Friday and thought that all drinks would be $4 after 9pm but unfortunately ended up having to pay $10 for my mojito cuz happy hour is only at the bar.  Very tricky of them since upon seating you they will give you the happy hour menu along w/ their regular menu.  I was even thinking no wonder it's only $4 because it's so weak!  Hence -1 star.  . . Other than that, the food, service and ambiance were great.  I had the Argentine Gaucho Steak, it wasn't top quality rib eye but it was definitely juicy and flavorful.  I loved the mashed potatoes and spinach that came with it.  I also got to try their Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut which had a very interesting taste.  It came in a bed of soup that was slightly sour, it didn't taste like any fish dish I've had before but I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you have a big appetite, the halibut was rather small.  I would definitely go back to Ciudad for their gaucho steak and apparently their goad milk flan is great too so I would like to try that next time.
