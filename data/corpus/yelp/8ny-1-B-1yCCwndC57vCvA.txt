Restaurant: Terroni
Category: Italian
I've been to Terroni several times and each time I find something more to love about it. The pizza is always delicious, but it's the pasta that really steals the show. This is a great, fun place that manges to retain a "neighborhood" feel and it's perfect for the nights (or days) when you want something on par with Mozza, but don't want to wait a month to get a table at Mozza. One word of caution: the wine adds up quickly, but oh, it's good.
