Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Can you say yum! I had been meaning to stop by here but was never in the mood for fish tacos. Now, I can see myself being in the mood all the time. When I first walked in, I was looking for the menu and didn't realize that all it was was a sign right above us that stated, "Fish Tacos," "Shrimp Tacos," and "Drinks." I was a little worried considering the decor or lack thereof. But my fears were quickly assuaged as I bit into my colorful, freshly fried taco. The fish itself was still very warm and just seemed to melt in my mouth. I equally enjoyed their unusual salsas and really liked the spicy mango. The crema was absolutely delicious. I'm just hoping I can restrain myself from this deliciousness lest the diet go by the wayside.
