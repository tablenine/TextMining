Met a friend here for lunch.  I was excited as I've passed by several times and was told how great it was by numerous people.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I ordered a full slab of rib tips (mainly bc it was only a few dollars more than getting the half order).  They were tough to chew and I really didn't care for any of the three sauces offered on the table.  Two of the sauces were reminiscent of chili while the last was sweet.  I wanted something a bit spicier.  My sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about.  Shoe string like and soggy.  I wanted them to be crispy.  The corn bread was delish but it's corn bread, could you really mess it up.  I guess the upside is that the portions are large, easily enough for 3-4 meals, but again, I didn't love it, so how great is that really?
