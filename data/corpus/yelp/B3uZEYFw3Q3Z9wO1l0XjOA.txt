We liked the place. Really liked it. Then went one night, and the eastern European (Why have an eastern European waitress in a Japanese place anyway ?) Â got it all wrong. Mixed up stuff we ordered , disappeared somewhere , general service was very slow, too. Massive accent , hard to understand. Anyway, very disappointed. . . Still ,we went back 2 weeks later to give them another chance, got a seat upstairs. Some guy turned up with 2 glasses , filled them with water without saying a word. No sign of waitress/waiter. . . We waited for 10mins. Then left. No one stopped us.
