Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
NOM.. . This place never fails me.. . Every time I go here, everything is good. Of course, with their huge menu, I haven't tried nearly "everything". You can come here for several different types of food (brazilian, italian, vegetarian options), so it's good for groups.. . Relaxed, interesting atmosphere, with outdoor or indoor seating.. . Service: Normal and polite. (Ignore the weird racist review below mine.). . Drinks: Great wine selection (the Tempranillo is my go-to glass for this place), great beers (bf always gets the Xingu black beer, which is not bitter and very chocolaty).. . Menu Items of note: Yuccas and plantains as sides are delish; My favorite entree is probably the Roasted Chicken Cacciatore - the lemon sauce is amazing, it's always cooked to perfection with tasty steamed veggies, and the portion is big enough for three meals. . . Last time I went, I had the rigatoni bolognese, which was a good, simple dish, the leftovers of which sustained me for several meals afterward.. . Dessert: HOMEMADE TIRAMISU!!! With real lady fingers and everything! I haven't seen it made like that since working my way through college in a tiny kitchen run by tiny Italians. The only flavor missing from it is anisette, but it still rocks, and is way big enough to share.. . Nom nom nom.
