After a 2 hour wait I must say the experience of waiting was better than the food.  Didn't really like the taste or the quality.  So, meh.  Next time I'll bring my carne asada and chow down on that while kicking it w/ friends in line.  . . On the flip side, my other friends loved it and esp. the kimchi quesadilla...which i thought was too nuh-kee (korean for, too buttery/cheesy?).
