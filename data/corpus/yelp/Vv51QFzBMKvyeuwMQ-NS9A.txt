we trekked all the way out to brooklyn on a friends recommendation for this place.  We were not disappointed one bit, except for waiting a while for a table - it was Friday night after all.  THe food was simple and on par with some of my favorite places in manhattan.  very rustic and low key, and the prices were very reasonable.  We drank a great Amarone for around $85 a bottle.  Don't see that too often in NYC!!
