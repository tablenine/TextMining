I was here on a Sunday (2nd visit) for breakfast with some friends and our breakfast took a total of 2 hours?!?  We were quickly seated in the back of the restaurant and given water by our server...and from that point forward, our server was pretty much non-existent.   I had to flag her down for our check 30 minutes after they cleared our table.  There was a line of people waited to be seated.. . The food is decent and typical diner prices and portions.  Not my first stop for Sunday brunch....
