Love the burgers.  HATE the attitude.  The "our way or the highway" thing is great in theory but it just doesn't work.  I sat next to a woman who really wanted to try a burger but because she was lactose intolerant she asked for one without cheese.  They refused.  I get the idea of no special orders, but this was above and beyond and just unnecessary.. . Another time I was meeting someone there, who had ordered for me and was saving a table, and they would not let me in without waiting in line.  Again, I get the line thing, but my seat was being saved and my food was getting cold.  The line is for people that don't already have a seat.. . On top of everything, there's no table service, yet they seem to expect tips.  A tip for WHAT?  Taking an order like McDonald's?. . Funny... they wear shirts that say F.O. for "Father Office"...  my friend  @ericwhitehurst on Twitter said "the shirts SHOULD say "F.U."
