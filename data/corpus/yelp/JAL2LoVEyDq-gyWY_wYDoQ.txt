love this place. . . it's a great place for a quick, amazing meal. . . it gets pretty crowded so i'd recommend going at an off-peak time. i hadn't been there in a couple months, but we went last night and were impressed as usual. max and i got there around 7:30 and there was plenty of room for the two of us. . . we've been here a bunch of times so have pretty much tried everything. the noodle dishes are my fav. but the rice dishes are also great. . . the portions are big and i usually end up with leftovers.. . the dumplings are all really good too. the squash/bacon are my favorite. . . its communal style seating and byo, so just be aware ahead of time.
