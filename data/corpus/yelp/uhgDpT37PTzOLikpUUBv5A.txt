a good way to get yourself somewhat overpriced yum in the form of japanese-style small plates.. . the bombs (tiny slices of fish arranged on top of a round bed of rice) seemed a gimmick, and more forgivable if less fish, more rice weren't part of the equation. the ceviche was a colorful mush of a mess, and oh so good. the overly fatty shortribs (special) came with an unremarkable sauce, but its resemblence to bulgogi won me over. seaweed salad was standard, while the calf liver sashimi (special) was just plain scary. ok, my friend who actually ordered the thing would beg to differ, but he can get his own yelp and challenge me to battle. to be fair, the taste was subtle, but the accompanying sauce was overpoweringly salty and bitter. mostly it just looked too much like what it was: raw liver. get the pork betty, _use_the_cilantro_. not just a garnish, people. the japanese wheat beer was good but pricey at $7 for a small glass. the berry mojito tasted like a sweeter version of a regular mojito. somehow not very berry-like, but still quite delish. apricot martini was good, what you'd expect. in the spirit of adventurousness, I agreed to share the green tea mousse. interestingly, if you aren't a fan of green-tea flavored things and also dislike mousse, you won't like this one. go figure.. . waiter was friendly, helpful, and hott. decor: so-so. mood lighting kinda made it hard for me to read my menu. next time I'd like to sit at the sushi bar or check out the area out back.. . we left with tastebuds happy, but maybe our stomachs not so much: afterwards my friend had to pick up a samosa.
