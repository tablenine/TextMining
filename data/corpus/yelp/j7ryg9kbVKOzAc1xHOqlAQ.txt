my boyfriend LOVES this place.. and i mean LOVE. Â we came here once with a group of people and we actually pretended to leave when everyone got up to leave.. but after everyone got in their cars, we went back inside b/c he wanted more zyka.. the first thing he asked for when he gets off the plane to see me in atlanta is to go to zyka... SO since he doesn't yelp, my review would be an average between mine and his.. we always get 4 things:. -chicken 65 . -nehari - spicy beef stew, the beef is so tender and breaks off super easily when you poke it with your fork.. really really good with the rice.. -naan. -rice. we also tried a special there that the guy at the counter suggested... it was some kind ground lamb.. looks kind of like spaghetti meat but so so so good.. the flavor is so good (not too spicy). my only gripe about this place is that it is sooo insanely greasy (as is every other indian restaurant ever).. which i can take for like.. 8 mouthfuls and then i have to stop.. don't get me wrong. those 8 mouthfuls are so so good.. but having grown up eating my mom's food which has like nearly ZERO salt and oil my stomach just isn't used to it... on the other hand.... the flavor is amazing and is possibly the best indian food from a restaurant i've ever had.. if you don't mind a little grease and can handle it.. i'm sure this place would be for you.. my bf comes here and kills 3 entrees alone, drinks up the nehari like it was a soup (grease and all), and we actually have to pace ourselves from coming too often b/c he's like afraid of having too high expectations and getting sick of it one day.. and i mean deathly afraid
