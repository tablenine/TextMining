I'm from Bolivia and Lala's is the only place I found (without looking too too hard) that serves Bolivian beer. Must I say more? The one time I tried to find Bolivian beer, I ended up at a small grocery store in Northridge and they had to pre-order it for me (got it a week later). Hence, I go to Lala's for my Bolivian beer cravings. . . I usually get the meat platter so I could share it with whoever I'm there with and try as many different kinds of meat as possible without hurting our wallets. This also gives us some more financial freedom to order the empanadas and chorizo. SO so good.. . The meat does tend to run on the dry side but it's nothing a bottle of Bolivian beer can't take care of. Also, everyone's talking about the bread and chimichurri. Yes, indeed, it's hella good.
