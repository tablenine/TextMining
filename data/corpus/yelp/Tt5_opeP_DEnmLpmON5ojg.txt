Restaurant: Baoguette Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
I love vietnamese food but I had never had banh mi, which is a perfect marriage between western bread and asian spices and herbs. Baoguette bakes their bread daily so the baguette is nicely warm and crackles when squeezed. You hear the crackling of the bread as you bite into it, and then your mouth is filled with the slightly sour and refreshingly savory taste created by the combination of cilantro, cucumber, (pickled?) carrots, pork terine, patte, and pulled pork. Light yet savory Vietnamese taste surrounded by carby bread: what more could I ask for?! I'm definitely going back again, this time to try the sloppy bao. . If you're mouth is watering like mine, I just have to tell you (sort of a disclaimer) the wait is a bit long and I also have yet to try other places for comparison but it is a good addition to my favorite neighborhood.
