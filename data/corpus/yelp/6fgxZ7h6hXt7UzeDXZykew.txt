girlfriend took me here for my first time after talking about it forever.  it definately lived up to the hype.  the gravy was tasty and nice and salty (which is how i like it, hehe).  Standard waffle on the flattish side kinda like waffle house, very generous portions and nice staff.  great food for after clubbing :)
