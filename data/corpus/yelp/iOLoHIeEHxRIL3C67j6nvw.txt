Prior to coming here, I was very reluctant.  I hate restaurants with 100+ reviews by yelp with majority of them being those hipsters who prefer ambiance over taste...... . I saw the huge line and was pissed.....I was thinking, "why the f would people pile up in a line to get served up overpriced bakery?"..... . THIS PLACE MEETS THE HYPE........damn good tasting sandwiches.  I ordered the pan de lechon with toasted bread.......the pork melts in your mouth, the bread is very good, not too dry, not too hard.....and less than $5.. . Cheese dessert things are tasty too.......almost everything we ordered was tasty....best of all, it meets the Asian taste of not being too sweet......i love it.
