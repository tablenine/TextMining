Everything is wrong about this place except for the burgers.  Were the burgers a lesser beast; were they not a tour de force of beef; were they not the young turk of the LA hamburguesa scene... then I would have given this place one star, and that star would be for a killer selection of brews.  . . But for cereal, the whole looming vulture thing with the tables is fucking dumb.  It's some serious Lord of the Flies shit out there on the patio.  Would it kill them to give you a number when you came in, or one of those weird little beeper things like they have at any other restaurant?  It's worse than 1pm at Urth Cafe.  . . Bottom line: the burgers are bomb.  Probably the best burger I've had in LA.  But they are NOT worth the wait nor the hassle.
