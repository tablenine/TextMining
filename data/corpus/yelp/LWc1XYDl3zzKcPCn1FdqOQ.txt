Hot Spicy and Mostly Broth!. . Outdoor seating and Ramen? No Way! This is at least a "Yeah I am a Fan" review.  We ordered the Miso Ramen. The orders included #2 and #3 spicy.  2 was pretty spicy. We added extras including pork. The pork was actually delicious.. . I think my problem with the ramen I had was that it was mostly broth. There were hardly andy noodles and everything costs extra. Extremely expensive for ramen that I would say is just average. . . While this was not bad ramen, it was just less than I expected based on the price. I doubt I will be coming back when there are so many good ramen places in the area and so many that I haven't tried yet.
