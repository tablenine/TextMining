I love- . . The energy of the restaurant, delightful for brunch!. The quality of the food- always healthy and fresh!. The peanut butter and coconut cupcakes.. The soups- defrickenlicious.. The whole grain pancakes with berries, bananas and carmelized pecans.. The Portobella and The Favorite omelet, sooo gooood.. The salads, get a half size, they are huge. . The cappucinnos with the tiny choc chip cookies on the side. . The service is always great!. . What's sucky-. The parking.. The wait.. . But I keep going back!
