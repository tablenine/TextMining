The place is definitely swanky and pretty! I love it.. We were seated in a semi private area near the open kitchen.  Must be an "in" thing to have open kitchens.. . Went with 4 other dining companions.. and the ladies and the meal were so fun I wish it was not Sunday night!. The 25.00 tasting menu is limited to 2 choices each for appetizer, entrees, and dessert,  and the choices all sounded tasty. I opted for the grill leg of lamb with naan and a chutney sauce.  Appetizer was the  Peaches (which tasted like nectarine to me since it was so crunchy).. and dessert I opted for the fennel flan, that seemed a bit gritty in texture for me, but the cookies and strawberry compote was magnificent!. Now lets rewind.. so I can go into detail about the entree.. The Grilled leg of lamb was sliced beautifully and cooked medium rare.. ( so if you like your red meat well done.. you might want to tell them, or order the fish..) It tasted wonderful, not too gamey at all for a medium rare lamb. The naan was funny looking tiny little naans that looked a bit silly next to all the meat, but it tasted marvelous!. My only complaint would be the strange texture of the creme brulee, it was gritty, not silky smooth like the traditional creme brulee I have had in the past.. The ladies and I closed down the restaurant.. we had such a marvelous time, ladies supper club is so great for the stomach and the soul!
