Hmmm... I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews I'm reading.. . My thought? Yuuuuummmmmm...... . . We went there with a large group of people. Immediately, I LOVED the large, dog-friendly patio. We will be bringing our Golden Retriever with us the next time we visit.... After walking in, I noticed the cozy atmosphere - basic in decor, but a great vibe. And they have a nice back patio as well. Great in the summer, but I can imagine the wait being a bit long in the winter. Oh well, I'll have a glass of vino while I wait.. . Anyway, I ordered the pizza with clams, I think? (Note: I AM adventurous when it comes to food) It was heavenly - not fishy at all, just had a wonderful taste. I also tried my boyfriend's pizza, the 4-cheese and basil, and I also tried another friend's roasted pepper pizza. Seriously? It was so great! I love the thinner crust and the fact that it's served on the wooden trays.... . I had a couple glasses of a Malbec that was tasty, and I noticed their interesting list of vodka infusions (think: honey bergamot) that I'll have to sample next time. . . And to top it all off, they are one of only a handful of certified organic restaurants in the country... I don't generally subscribe to the philosophy, but I do applaud it and think it's pretty cool.. . In a nutshell, I'd go there again. And again. And again.
