Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
ehhh i don't know what the big deal is? i had set C with takata fried rice and a bowl of 'special pork ramen'. The fried rice was good but nothing out of the ordinary. . . when we first sat down we weren't sure what to do there was a pencil and paper there for ordering but we weren't sure if we were just to start writing or wait for a menu and since it took a minute for the waitress to give us our menu. When we got the menu i was surprised by the lack of options. there are like 8 choices of ramen and rice combos and a few other options. the ramen essentially comes with nothing but a few thin slices of chasyu. every other topping starts at 50 cents for corn and up to 2 dollars for more meat. which can take you from a 6.95 bowl to easy 8 to 10 dollars for a simple bowl with the things that normally come free in other places. . . the noodles are really skinny and not 'typical' ramen noodles. i didn't have a liking to them. i prefer my noodles thicker. I had the strong soup normal oil and normal cooked noodles. the soup was tasty but nothing spectacular and it didn't taste really strong.. . overall i wouldn't go back unless someone else wanted to go and i couldn't think of another place to suggest.
