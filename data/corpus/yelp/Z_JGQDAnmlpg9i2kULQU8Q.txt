Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Caf√©
Category: Cuban
I don't know if I've ever been to a Cuban restaurant I didn't like... But here is another great one. The mood here is light and very frendly in what used to be one of those disgusting Chicago tiny corner hot dog stands. I love the way they've decorated the place down to the smallest details. I always get an empenada, try the milkshakes too!
