Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This place is made to appeal to the diner who believes that if you are paying a lot for your meal it is therefore a "good" meal. I will say that the fish served here is better than average, but the bang for your buck ratio is low, as they tend to be stingy with the fish. Service is where this place is lacking is spades. The first time I went here, the waitstaff seemed either clueless or reticent to find us a table. Against my better judgment I went back to this place again about a year after my first experience there, with a friend. We got there just at opening time and we were not allowed to enter the restaurant, because they were not ready yet, despite it being 10 minutes after the opening time posted on their sign. The waitress was rude about the whole thing too. They didnt even offer to seat us and offer us drinks or at least water while we waited for them to get their stuff together. Their loss: Iwill never go back. If I want fair-to-middling sushi I can to to 100 other places and be served with brio. If I want to pay a lot for sushi, I can go to Katsu and get fish and service that will blow you away.
