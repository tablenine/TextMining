Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
WOW I cannot believe how many people are giving good reviews of this place.. It is INCREDIBLY undeserving.. I have been a ktown resident and visitor for 21 years and I can say with CONFIDENCE that every Korean that lives in Ktown avoids this place.. Why? IT'S NOT GOOD!. Long time ago Manna used to be a semi-classy shabu shabu place. Then it turned into a no class krn bbq place.. It's odd how every Korean as been here for one reason or another, but they all say they've had better. The only people who go here now are visitors and people who just probably don't know any better. So take my advice..and go somewhere else. I normally venture to MadangSae on Vermont+James M. Wood.. This place can fool you with its size and the fact that everyone knows this place. Reviews who are raving about the side dishes obviously don't know that side dishes are found at every Korean restaurant regardless. . The fact of the matter is...it all boils down to meat quality and this place has none.
