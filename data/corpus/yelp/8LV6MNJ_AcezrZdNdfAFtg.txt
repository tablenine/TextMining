Really solid place for a healthy lunch near downtown. I'm pretty ticked off that I've worked down here for 2 years and have never tried it before today. . . We ordered 2 of the paninis and the Dolce Vita fruit cup. The sandwiches come wrapped in deli paper with a name tag which is a nice touch. The sweet bread goes perfectly with the avocado tomato and turkey. Fiance got the ham and havarti with pickles. It was also very good, however, there was a little too much ham and the very center was not warm. . . The fruit cup was AMAZING. It was a perfect blend of fresh fruits, granola, honey and yogurt. . . Alternating bites of the panini, fruit cup and crunchy corn thingies put a big smile on my face.
