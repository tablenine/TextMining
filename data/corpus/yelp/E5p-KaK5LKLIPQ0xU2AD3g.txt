Went there last night and I can't stop thinking about the yumminess. Sat at the bar and shared the fennel sausage and funghi misti pizzas and a bottle of wine. It was perfect. This place is not snobby, has a nice warm atmosphere that makes annoying hipster people seem OK, the energy is high, but not overwhelming and it smelled so good! The only bad thing about this place is that it is not in Pasadena. The drive over there bites!
