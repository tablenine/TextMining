Oh how I wanted to like this place. I have been told by several people that I had to try the burger. A few weeks ago, I went to do that but I never even got to order. . . First of all, the place smells like a moldy basement and it's so dark. You kind of feel like you're in a serial killers lair. But I was willing to overlook Moody's "charm" because I heard the burgers were fantastic.. . We waited for 20 minutes for a waitress to come to our table to take our order. 20 minutes! It wasn't busy at the restaurant. We look like friendly people. All the waitresses were congregating up by the bar, ignoring us. We flagged them down...waved our arms in the air...all to no avail. As good as these burgers may be, I'm not going to go through this much work just to get in my drink order. We ended up leaving, and I was really disappointed because I really wanted to try the burger. Guess this is one Chicago food experience I'll be missing out on.
