Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
May Street Market is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It is similar in quality and style to both Erwin and Uncommon Ground, so if you like those you will like May Street Market as well. Our food was excellent (try the Maytag blue cheesecake, it's wonderful!) and was served very quickly by a charming waitress. Prices are fair for the quality and freshness. Decor is very nice, modern and elegant. The desserts were delishous and creative. Highly recommend!
