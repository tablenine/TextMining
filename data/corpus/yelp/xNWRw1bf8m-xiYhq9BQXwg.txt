Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Mastro's is quite delicious and is a great way to celebrate your birthday!  The steaks are amazing.  I got my bone-in-filet rare, which was practically moo-ing, but heated up very well the next day.  Just be careful not to put the little gold sticker in the microwave, because it will spark!  I was a little disturbed by the "frat party" that was occuring at the table next to us.  It made me very curious about the other more private enclaves in the restaurant.  But nonetheless, the service was amazing.  The waiter even walked me hand in hand all the way to the restroom.  I would definitely return for another special occasion.
