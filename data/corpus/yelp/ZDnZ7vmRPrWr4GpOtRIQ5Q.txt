pros- great beer selection on tap, very friendly and hospitable staff. Should have great hours soon!. . cons - a bit pricey and some of the crowd in line seemed a bit snobby toward us. Probably people that were jealous of our 3 days beards and lack of office wear. Awesome beer, small fries and a sausage set my friend back $18.25. The beer is the priciest part, but worth it.. . You could tell the place was new. The guy at the counter had to check to make sure the beers we wanted were on tap. They don't offer everything on the menu yet. The kitchen guys were doing some hectic-looking maneuvers. All small things that make the place charming. Hopefully, the staff will have an easier time doing everything smoothly soon. We don't want them to quit, because service was still excellent and very quick!. . OK, the dirt on the fries - they are good. I would know, I'm Belgian. Are they perfect? mmm..not quite. Mine were a tiny bit greasy at the top of the pack, but then were quite good a layer or two below. Crunchy, golden and salted on the outside, supersoft on the inside. Right thickness  too. Hopefully they fine-tune it soon and they will be as good as the ones in Belgium ( though still pricier). Maybe the second frying was not hot enough? I dunno. Anyway, still very good. Jonathan Gold wrote about the fries at Oinkster a little while back and those SUCKED. These don't.  These are the the best fries i've had in Los Angeles for sure.. . The sausage seem fancy and crazy and I will try them next time.  For the people with vegetarian girlfriends or boyfriends,  there's a sausage for them too. my gf should be happy.. . I would give it a 4.5 but I will be going back and they just opened so give them a 5
