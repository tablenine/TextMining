Went there with my wife for an aniversary dinner.  The food and service were all top notch!  I used to live in San Franciso and this restaurant reminded me of some of the better fusion type of places I used to frequent there.  To top it off, we had really stuffed ourselves and didn't feel like ordering dessert, so the waiter surprised us with a plate of a couple nice chocolates and the words "happy aniversary" written in rasberry syrup.  Very nice touch and appreciated!
