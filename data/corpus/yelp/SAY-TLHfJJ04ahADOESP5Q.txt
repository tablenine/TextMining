I loved the fried green bean appetizer and my cuban sandwich was awesome. I'm lowering my rating because of the craptastic margaritas and horrible service. It was my birthday and we got there kinda late. We ordered the margaritas and damn were those things tart! I like tart but it was like sour lemonade. For the 2nd round we ordered the more expensive brand thinking it would be different, well it wasn't different enough and I didn't even have a buzz when I left, UNACCEPTABLE! The waitress hardly acknowledged us and stiffed herself out of a decent tip. Its not worth going back. This town needs a kick-azz margarita...still looking! if you find one let me know!
