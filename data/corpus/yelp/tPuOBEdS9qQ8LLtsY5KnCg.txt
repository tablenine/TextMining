Category: Steakhouses
Mastros in Beverly Hills is one of my special occasion destinations, and they didn't disappoint last week.  From the moment you walk in you are treated like a Beverly Hills celebrity (and the place was swarming with celebs!). . .  Our server Deb was charming.  Loaded with personality but also possessed that wonderful ability to balance attentive along with allowing us to dine without interruption.  . . The food??  Outstanding!  From the bread to dessert!  Mastros house salad comes with a shrimp so big he had an area code!  Portions are enormous, and you'll enjoy at least one more full meal at home!  The steaks are perfection.  Our decadent sides included crispy fried sweet potatoes and sauteed garlic spinach.  The meal ended with some of the best key lime pie I've ever had.  OH-and the "we hope you enjoyed Mastros/please come back soon" phone call the following day was a classy touch.. . If you own a restaurant or want to learn what customer service is all about, dine at Mastros.  You'll have a great meal to boot!
