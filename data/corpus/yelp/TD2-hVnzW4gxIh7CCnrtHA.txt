Came here on a Saturday night. This is a major "Hollywood" type place, where you wouldn't be surprised if you saw some reality show filming here. Came here for a birthday dinner, so we wanted to do something different and fun. And it was. Decor is geisha themed with a hipster twist . . . lotsa red and funky music.. . The rolls are good, the edamame is the bomb, and the drinks kept coming. After dinner a promoter / manager dude came up to us, bought us some rounds, then walked us over to the club we wanted to go to next. It made us feel more VIP, although it was probably just his job to shuttle hot chicks all night from one place to the next.. . I recommend going to Geisha House at least once, and take pictures with the geishas . . . so cute!. . xxx C
