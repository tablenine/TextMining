Category: Sandwiches
Dipped sandwiches, 60 cent lemonade &amp;amp; iced tea, and rows of Dodgers fans. . I like. . . Always our pit stop before games, and a perfect appetizer to Dodger Dogs and garlic fries at the stadium.. . Go with the Beef Dip or Lamb, share a table with a stranger, and stop by the counter for some bubblegum or a candy bar.
