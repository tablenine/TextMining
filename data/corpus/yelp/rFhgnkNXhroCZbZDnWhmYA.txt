Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
For some reason I thought this was going to be a French restaurant but it's more Italian I guess. Whatever it is, it's good.. . The lunch menu is sparse and reading it, I wasn't that interested in most things. However, everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic. I had an excellent pasta dish and the salads I tried were delicious. The presentations are beautiful and the service is good. I'll be back soon.. . UPDATED 12/06/2007:. I downgraded them from 5-stars to 1-star for the pretentious LA attitude.. . I came by here at 7pm on a Thursday evening looking for a table for 2. After the rude hostess rolled her eyes at us like we were second class citizens for not having a reservation, I looked around to see about 75% of the tables unseated. So, I took my appetite and wallet one block over ( . http://www.yelp.com/bi....  ). Just to be fair, I walked back by about 50 minutes later and there was still about 25% of the tables unseated.. . Lose the attitude Fraiche!!! There are plenty of other friendly places in the area to be wasting time at your place and being talked down to.
