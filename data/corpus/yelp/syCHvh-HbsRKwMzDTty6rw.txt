This was the first cemita sandwich I've had so it's hard for me to compare, but it was definitely very tasty.. . The bread is the highlight of the whole sandwich.  The outside is a little crunchy and covered in roasted sesame seeds.  Without the bread this is an just an above average sandwich.  The avocado adds delicious depth to the sandwich and marries well with the bread.  The meats and such are just ok, they don't take away from the greatness of the bread and the avocado spread, but they're not the draw.  On the table there are 3 sauces, which were all very good, but the dark, thick mole sauce was really a stand out.  I tried it third, and after that I was drowning every bite in the rich, complex, slightly spicy, slightly tangy sauce.  I also enjoyed the pickles on the table which I ate next to the sandwich.. . I'd say the sandwich was good enough that I'd go a little out of my way to grab one if I'm anywhere near Humboldt Park and need a quick bite, but I wouldn't drive across town just for a taste.  I'm filing it under good to know about, not good enough to tell the world about.
