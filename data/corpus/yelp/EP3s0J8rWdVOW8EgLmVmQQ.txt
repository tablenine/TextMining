i was taken here in the past by some friends and i had the pad see eiw. i was hesitant at first because im pretty picky about my thai food.... i recall not enjoying it.. . i went there a few weeks ago and decided to give it another try. i was really hungry that day so i got tom yum soup(which i forgot to ask for chicken or plain and was freaked out by a huge shrimp!) it was tasty. i also got some pot stickers which were ok, and pad see eiw again....ah it tasted like cinnamon or something i dont know.  but i didnt like it.  it also came with an egg roll that was super greasy.  =(. . service was fast though.
