Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Best salsa in town. When they bring out that bucket of chips, it takes all my self-control to not eat the whole thing before my dish comes out ... sometimes I don't make it.. . I'm a big fan of their rice and beans, not to mention their tacos. Many people are impressed with their fresh tortillas, too. I never walk away from this place without getting stuffed.. . And the holiday-to-holiday decor is always fun, especially when they dress up the diving suit.. . As has been mentioned, you have to get here at the right time or you could be waiting.  For me, that means leaving early for lunch.  If you get there by noon, you should get a seat quickly.  If you get there about 12:15, well, be prepared to wait.  I don't even bother to go here for dinner, as it's always just too crowded.. . I don't recommend the store on Manchester, though, the flavor of the food just wasn't as good.
