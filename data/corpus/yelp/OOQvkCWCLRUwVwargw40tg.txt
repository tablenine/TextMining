This is an absolute destination.  Fancy schmancy bar with elegant decor.  The bar menu and service are less than stellar.  The server wouldn't even ask if they would make me something interesting.  She just said I could have cooked veggies.  How unimaginitive.  I specified that I wanted a sauce, and suggested something with balsamic vinegar.  Then, when she brought it out, she said it had a bit of balsamic but was mostly using its own juices.  That is specifically what I didn't want.. . Still many of the details are excellent (including their brand of sparkling water).  The lounge area isn't perfect but still works for drinks.  I would certainly meet someone here for a first date.
