This was our second time at Opera.  My husband and I had eaten there about a year ago on a non prixe fixe night.  Food was excellent, but given the fact that we aren't normally in the area, and given the prices, it wasn't a destination spot for us although the food is amazing.. We had a guest in town, so we decided to treat him to Opera on a prixe fixe night.  They have raised their prices to $28.75 a person for their prixe fixe dinners on Sundays and Tuesdays.  Definitely still a bargain given their portions and their normal prices.. We decided to share the entire meal.  For appetizers, we chose the Ahi Tuna, Chopstick Crabcake, and of course their Duck Mushuu.  Everything was amazing and delicious.  For entrees, we chose the Duck Three way, Australian Rack of Lamb and their Mongolian Beef and Broccoli.  The lamb, hands down was one of the best that I had ever eaten, the duck, AWESOME!!!!  (Sorry...no other word can describe the flavor explosion or the meatiness of the duck.)  The Mongolian Beef which was prepared with a filet...I would definitely not recommend.  It was boring, and the mushrooms were woody...nothing Mongolian at all.  For dessert, we chose the tower of Chocolate, The trio of Creme Brulee, and something banana.  All yummy, but I'm greedy, I wish that the portions of Creme Brulee were larger.  We also brought our 2 year old, and I have to say that despite that Opera is a great place to bring kids.  It is loud enough that the banter and fussiness of a 2 year old doesn't intrude or spoil the evening for other guests, yet quiet enough that you can still hear yourselves speak.  The bright eclectic decor is also interesting enough to keep them preoccupied.  Staff was friendly and informative.  Drinks are a little bit on the pricey side, but not shocking.  I'd highly recommend Opera.
