Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Palms is my favorite Thai restaurant in Hollywood.  Not only do I love the Thai Elvis and his pimp car, the food is excellent.. . The roast duck curry has been the only thing that hasn't been the best (Osha Thai in S.F. is the best I've tasted so far), but their noodle dishes are divine as are the soups and vegetable dishes.  Yummy!
