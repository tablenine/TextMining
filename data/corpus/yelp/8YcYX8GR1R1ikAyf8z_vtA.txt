This is my favorite no-frills sushi joint period!  Sure, better sushi may be found at other places in LA, but I think that this place offers the best value.  I've been a regular customer for over 20 years and they have consistently delivered solid quality from top-to-bottom.  It's the perfect place to bring a sushi newb because they won't kick you out for unsushilike conduct like ordering a California Roll.  Nozawa-san will thank you for keeping them away from his joint!. . The only downside is that too many people now know about this place and the wait can be brutal.  I swear it wasn't this way in the 80s!
