I've been a customer for nearly a decade. I absolutely love this place and always jump at a chance to go.. . Almost everything about this place is good. . . Their sourcing practices are extremely strict and it has been independently verified that their food does not even contain *traces* of animal products. Not so for a lot of other vegan joints.. . On top of that, the food is first-rate vegan cuisine. The only time I've eaten out and had vegan food this good was at Millenium in San Francisco, and I paid probably more than twice as much. . . I guess one thing that sucks about the place is the other patrons, who are total bourges, but that's just the lay of the land with veganism and high-end restaurants.
