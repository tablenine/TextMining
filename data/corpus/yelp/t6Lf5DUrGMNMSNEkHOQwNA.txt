Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
MAGIC CAPS!! MMMM~~~ and moo free pizza.. I love this little cafe, it's so cute and psychedelic looking.. It was my 2nd time to come here (1st time 3 years ago when I came to visit) and my friend brought me here again.. The waitresses are so awesome to talk to and very friendly, good service, convenient location, vegan/vegetarian friendly aka pro-lesbo joint.. . The layout of the place is cool, and I think this is a good late night eating place. I would make this place my go-to place next times I go back to Chicago.. The food is really good, but it's quite pricey since it's really just a "cafe", not really quite "restaurant" status exactly.. . The names of their food items (if you want to see a menu . http://chicago.menupag.... ) are a bit funny.. it's like they encourage drunks and pot/psychedelic users but.. well I suppose it's fitting since its good when you have the munchies or something, and the bountiful colors for the visual stimulation.. . Food items around $7-12 average. Hipster/hippie/treehugger type crowd
