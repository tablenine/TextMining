Went here tonight with some friends and it was not bad. We had the crab... but I really must say that the crab was just too salty to endure. I admit that the first bite seemed like heaven with the garlic dip they gave us... but you can only have so much of it before your tongue says.. STOP!! It's like eating all the salt at the bottom of a pretzel bag until your tongue bleeds in a plea to cease. OKAY. So I'm exaggerating a little. But it was pretty damn salty!! Of course, that's only my point of view, b/c the bf loved it. Rene loved it and Jeff loved it too. So what do I know!! =). . I LOVED their bread and garlic olive oil. I thought their shrimp tasted like any other shrimp.... . . I think what I loved the most was the look and feel of the place. It was SO fun! All the photos and paintings. The decor was really fabulous. The servers were very attentive and I really love places that leave you a jug of water to pour yourself. . . Since I haven't tried everything yet... I'll give this place 4 stars until I try some more... I guess that's what the edit button is for. ;)
