Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This is definitely one of my favorite Korean BBQ restaurants to eat at !!!. . i actually normally don't like "MEAT" that much ~~ but i love love eating here ! the meat is fresh &amp; delish &amp; the side dishes are just as Tasty !!!. The meats also come with rice paper wrappers and radish which just makes each bite all the more yummy !!. . i lovelove their sauces as well~ especially the salt crystals :O . . the waiter that we had was super nice &amp; helped us cook the meat,. although we did go during the mid afternoon so it was pretty empty not Â busy at all:]. . Oh YES and the Salad with perfect amount of dressing so its not too salty :D. this place makes me a self cook korean bbq luver !!
