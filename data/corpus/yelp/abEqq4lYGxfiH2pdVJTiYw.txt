I hate over-hyping a place, I really do.  But for those of you that don't mind the rantings and ravings, I have to say that the Versailles chicken was possibly one of the best ... if not THE best chicken I have ever had.  EVAR.. . My friend first recommended that I go when I told her that I was making a trip to LA.  Her eyes widened and she told me about this chicken that she still dreams about.  And now I know why.. . If you decide to venture there after reading my accolades of the place, DEFINITELY get the #6.  The combination comes with rice, beans, soft and succulent plantains and HALF a golden, garlic chicken.  . . Garlic doesn't even begin to describe it.  Paired with the onion that comes atop the bird, one bite is filled with buttery, garlicy, lemony goodness.  There's this citrus tang that really pops on the palate, and I found myself eagerly awaiting the next tender bite.  . . My fellow diner just had the chicken breast, which was on the dry side - so definitely get the chicken that is still on the bone.  You won't regret it.. . Another tip: go with a smaller group, show up early and make sure EVERYBODY is there at the same time or they won't seat you.  We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria to split among four people, which was refreshing.  . . When I make another trip out to LA, you can be sure that I'll have Versailles chicken on my mind.
