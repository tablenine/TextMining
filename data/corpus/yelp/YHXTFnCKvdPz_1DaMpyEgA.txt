A great concept with equally great execution.  . . I've been to oinkster several times over the years, and they never fail to deliver.  I've ordered practically everything on the menu, and enjoyed pretty much all of it.  Some of the obvious stand outs are the pulled pork sandwich, the fries, cheeseburger and rotisserie chicken.. . The pulled pork sandwich has a great pork-y flavor to it.  At lesser restaurants with these type of bbq sandwiches, the sauce tends to overpower the pork, giving you a mouthful of tomato/molasses/vinegar/what have you.  This sandwich, however, tastes like pork, where the sauce is there to enhance and accentuate the flavor of the meat.  It also comes with a seemingly homemade pickle.  This ain't one of those limp refrigerator pickles.  This is a fermented, sat in a brining jar for several days, possibly weeks, pickle.  The burger is just a good, well cooked juicy burger.  Standard accoutrements, but everything about it is executed to perfection.. . Oh, regarding the fries, each time I've come here, I've gotten more and more disappointed with them.  They're good, no doubt, but I've had much, much better Belgian fries.  The dipping sauces are great, no doubt about it, but the fries have a tendency to harden up really soon after frying.  Chipotle ketchup is good, but how about some curry ketchup?  Regardless, these are minor gripes.
