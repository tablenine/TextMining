Oh Gloria, why hath thou forsaken me?!. I had high expectations of Gloria's after reading all the positive reviews here on yelp, but unfortunately all i can say is: Â Wow, what a letdown!!! . 7:15 pm (Saturday night): Arrive at Gloria's. 8:15 pm: Party of 2 seated (it was "Los Angeles cold" outside- about 50 degrees, it's not fun standing in that for an hour). . 8:30 pm: order food and drinks. . 9:45 pm: Food arrives, thank goodness, because blood sugar is low and delirium is setting in. . . Not only was this the longest time i've ever had to wait for food (and yes, there were apologies for it), but we were also seated in the absolute worst place- next to the door. The door was continuously opened and closed and there were people waiting, no, HOVERING, next to our table hoping for us to get the heck out so they could sit down. . After such a long wait I couldn't help but think that this food better blow me away..and unfortunately it didn't. We ordered the pork/cheese pupusas and the Carne adobada. The meat was very tender and tasty, but it definitely didn't justify a 3 hour wait. As a side note there's a mamasita who sells fabulous pupusas for a few dollars outside of Saints and Sinners on Venice Blvd on Saturday nights (late night- midnight -2 am). I would highly recommend getting those pupusas rather than waiting 3 hours and spending the bigger bucks. . . I always give a place two chances before I nix it all together so If i ever decide to go back to Gloria's I would never again go on a busy night. The turn-around takes way too long. I saw at least 10 customers walk away from Gloria's after hearing that there was going to be a 1.5 hour wait.
