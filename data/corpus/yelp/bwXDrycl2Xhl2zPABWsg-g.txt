Happy Hour!!. . and yay for football season because its happy hour from kick-off till the end of the game. woo!. . I like their beer selection. The mangolicious martini was a bit watered down. My friend and I went and ordered 5 appetizers. The waiters reply, "wow you guys ordered a lot" Geeze, way to make us feel like fatties. Can't help but have some variety. Even though we barely finished half, it was good oily fun food. The chicken strips were a bit dry...their onion ring tower was cool though. Chill place
