Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The food they serve here is not really Japanese style but it doesn't matter because they can make ramen taste so delicious.. . A tip for first-timers, don't order side dishes because most of them taste like shit like the spicy scallops. Don't forget to add Cha-shu pork, Egg, and extra meat and noodles. . . My favorite is Miso Special #1 with Pork and Egg. OMFG !!! I want some japanese ramen right now !!!. . I'm often confused why some people order #7... I mean, really? What's the point of making your trip to little tokyo. If you don't like spicy ramen just pour water into your instant noodles at home. The restaurant is packed and the line is long already...
