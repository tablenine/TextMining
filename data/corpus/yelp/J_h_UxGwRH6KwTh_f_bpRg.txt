Not EVERYTHING was bad here but the food docked at least a star and a half.. . Ambiance:  Meh.  This is like graduating from Olive Garden and coming into the city for the first time.. . Service: Great.  Our server and host were prompt and polite. . Food:  I'd go back to Olive Garden first.. . There was plenty of food but the quality was sub-par.  I had the Italian Antipasto for an appetizer and it was one little piece of cheese, one shrimp, few meats and piled with olives. Presentation aside, it tasted as if it was all made the night before and left in the fridge until "order up!". . Cannelloni for the main dish. I'd rather drink dirty bathwater.  The cream sauce was so thick it started to congeal so I ended up eating a few bites of someone's lasagna, which was pretty good.. . At the end of the day, I won't be coming here again.
