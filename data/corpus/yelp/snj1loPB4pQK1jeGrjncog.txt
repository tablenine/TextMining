A great little lunch spot!  Sure, the ordering system seems somewhat dubious at first, what with the verbal passing off of your desires from beefed up worker to beefed up worker.  But hey, it works.  The food comes out at the end.  What more do you want from this life?. . I would stay away from the Oxnard vegetables platter.  I ordered it once and felt ripped off.  Apparently they consider a "vegetable platter" to be one spear of asparagus and an entire roasted green onion.  From now on I am sticking to the Ahi Tuna and that is no lie.  Ahi Tuna, fantastic mashed potatoes, and a more than passable Caesar salad.  Sounds like a good lunch to me.. . And yes, the busboys do apprehend the trays practically before you sit down.  Since the tables are pretty small, this bothers me not at all.  It's not exactly the kind of place you would sit and stay awhile, though for lunch it's perfect.
