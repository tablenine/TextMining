Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
Oh wow, it can't get  any worse than this.  I must say  everything looked great on the outside.    We immediately got seated by the Hostess, however, there was  no acknowledgment from the server.  After sitting there 15 minutes, the waitress said  'I'll be with you in a minute"  No apologies, no sense of urgency, just your typical slack "I don't give a crap" attitude .  We gave it about 10  more minutes, and still,  no drink order or  further contact  from the server!  THEN we overheard the child (approximately 4 years in age) seated next to us complaining to his Dad about his meal.  That's when we knew it was time to head  over to Twain's.   El Tesoro was complete waste of our time.    . . I have since contacted the Manager  no returned call, no response to my email.  No surprise when they go out of business.
