Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
yummity yum yum.. . 1. $15 all you can stuff your fat face with. it's all korean bbq style meat and dishes. the banchan is alright.. . 2. plenty of seats except for friday, saturday and sunday nights. for big parties, make reservations.. . 3.  free, if not cheap, valet parking. for all you lowridin  gangsta rice rocket cars, park on the street. you'll never make it up to the valet.. . 4. the whole place is in an outdoor covered area. which means smoke all you want with out having to get up out of your seat. . . 5. i didn't give this place 5 stars because it only has korean alcohol. like hite, ob, chamisul, bokbunjah, etc.. . 6. the other reason i didn't give this place the 5th star is because the service is like any other korean place. terrible.. . so all in all, the unlimited meat and that fact that i always leave there drunk, is the reason it got 4 stars. enjoy!. . great place to yelp btw.
