Tom's get four stars for overall experience. The food is not the best I have ever had for brunch but it definitely hits the spot. Where they smash the competition is price and service!. . Where else can you go for a freshly cooked breakfast for 4, all less than $35?McDonalds does not count as an option. Also, only place I have been to where they give you free drinks and food while you wait in line! NICE
