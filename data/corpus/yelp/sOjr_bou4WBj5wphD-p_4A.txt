Really good place tucked away for some great Southern food.  I always wind up ordering the 1/4 chicken dark and helping myself to ample amounts of the BEST corn bread EVER.  The sides are alright - depending on your tastes.  The salads portions are large and the honey mustard dressing here is good too. Family friendly.  Warning- this place always seems to be packed so be prepared to wait.
