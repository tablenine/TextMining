BEST SUSHI EVER... annnnd it's BYOB!. . Coming from Southern California, where we don't have the luxury of BYOB restaurants, that alone made this place amazing. Sure, we had to wait like an hour and a half, but it made us hungry, and even more satisfied when we finally did get to eat.. . This sushi is amazing. So fresh and so clean, clean. The specialty rolls are to die for. I mean OMG is exactly what came out of my mouth when I ate my first piece of the Oh My God roll. YUMMMMMM..... . So yah, bring your fav bottles of white wine, yes, they give you a wine opener to open them, and chill for a bit while you wait for the best sushi of your life, thus far.
