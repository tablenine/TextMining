My experience isn't any different from anyone else's.... . Come here for the big size pizza, it will definitely be bigger than your face.. . Come late night when they're closing up at 2am (?), 4am (?) and they will give you the rest of the pizza that they were about the throw out. This happened to me when my friends and I were hungry after going out to the bars during college.. . They don't have a wide selection of toppings, but the plain pizza topped with hot red pepper flakes, garlic powder and black peppers satisfied my tummy for sure :)
