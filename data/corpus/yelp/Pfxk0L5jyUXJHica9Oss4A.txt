Brunch, which is what I call the first meal I eat on any given Saturday or Sunday, is my favorite meal of the day.  . . I have several favorite spots, but this one has recently jumped right to the top of my list.  There's one simple reason for this:  the salmon eggs benedict.  Amazing.. . The restaurant is in a great area, usually with plenty of parking .... during peak hours, you might have to wait for a moment or two, but never too long.  The servers are all delightful and friendly........ . Since most of the seating is outdoors, it's a becomes a bit problematic on the hot summer days....... so I'd avoid when it's 110 degrees outside.. . The food is top notch.  I love the salmon, I love the bacon, I love the eggs, I love the fruit, etc etc.  I've never eaten anything off of the "lunch" menu, but I'm sure it's delicious too.....
