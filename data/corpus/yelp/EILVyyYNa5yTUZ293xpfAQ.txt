I had one too many clock work orange martinis during happy hour so my memory is a bit hazy.  I remember the decor being chic and the location able to accommodate big groups.  More importantly, I remember the clock work orange martinis.  It tasted like a creamsicle.  I didn't taste any vodka, and that was my problem.  Getting wasted on creamsicles.. god times.
