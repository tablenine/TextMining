A-ok for a late night joint. . . I honestly thought it was just a coffee shop. I had no idea it was also not only a diner, but apparently a vegan diner. . . A friend of mine and I got off work at about 2:30am on Sat. night and we were wanting some coffee and maybe a snack. She suggested this place, and I had heard good things about it, so we decided to try it. . . We both got a big cup of mocha. I ordered the eggs benedict (which I thought had real ham on there....and also thought vegans don't eat eggs and definitely not ham...pretty sure they were real eggs). Are you supposed to ask for vegan options? If this was a vegan meal, wow, sign me up because I definitely wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. My friend got the vegan rice crispy treat. I was not a fan. It was too chewy and not sweet enough for me.. . Service was ok. Our waitress seemed to have forgotten about us, but she was friendly. My friend and I were gossiping and finishing our coffee, so I didn't really care our waitress wasn't that attentive. She took our order and got our food out really fast, so meh, good enough. . . I really dig the whole artsy, hipster vibe of the place, cheap eats, and the late hours. I don't dig drunk girls falling on our table.
