Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
The category was japanese, the rest. was taka sushi tonight. I'd never been here before, but after hearing so many good reviews about it i'm glad i finally made it here. i like how it's tucked away kinda hidden off the main road. the interior is smaller than i had anticipated, but it makes for an intimate dining environment. i made a comment how i could imagine this place being like a japanese hostess bar (not that i've really been in one before)...we started the meal w/ the sea urchin, which i liked everything it was wrapped in, except the octupus b/c it had basil in it. it kinda threw the flavor off a bit. then we had the japanese pancake w/ octupus, which was soooo delish! the sauce on top was just perfectly salty w/ a hint of sweet. it felt very healthy w/ all the veges in it too. my favorite had to be the grilled yellow tail cheek--so fresh and perfectly cooked. i could imagine myself eating it sitting by the ocean, where someone had just caught it. yum-o! since i have a unagi fetish, i had to order the unagi nigiri and it was great. i had a craving for something fried, so i ended my meal w/ the spider roll. the soft shell crab was excellent! it definitely cured my craving. overall, this is a rest. that pays attention to detail. food is presented beautifully. i enjoyed the service too, they timed each entree just right. they never brought too many things out at once, which allowed us time to enjoy and focus on each entree individually. Â it was an enjoyable dining experience, definitely will be back.
