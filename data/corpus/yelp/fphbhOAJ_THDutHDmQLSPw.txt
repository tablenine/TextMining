Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Since I went to UCLA, I've been aware of Tito's presence for about 10 years now (wow that's a long time and I am damn old).. . If this was just a truck that parked outside a club, I would probably rate it higher, but everytime I've been here or driven by, the line is off the heezy and parking is a pain.  It's just not worth the hassle for what you get.  I only go when some friends insist on it.. . Not a big fan of the crunchy shredded beef taco, so not a big fan of Tito's Tacos.  I tried their burrito once and it gave me some stomach trouble.  Read some of the other posts, never really noticed their salsa and yes, the alleged horse meat is not out of the question.. . I am on a taco rating rampage tonight.  Just hitting up every taco joint I can think of.
