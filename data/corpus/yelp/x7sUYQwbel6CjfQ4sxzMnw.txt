Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
What a great place.  Every dish I tried here was excellent.  Usually, I expect if a restaurant has two disparate cuisines that one or more of them will be horrible.  But that is so not the case here!  Definitely worth the wait, as it is not that big and really popular apparently, but you can see why people like it.  I can't wait to go back.
