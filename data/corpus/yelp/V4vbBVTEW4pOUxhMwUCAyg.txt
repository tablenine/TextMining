Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The place is legendary.  So is the line....hey but they are open late The dogs are ok, but not good enough for me to wait in that line!  It's good for drunks....you'll likely sober up in time for your dog..... . By the way, went to the Greek Theater last week and they also serve Pink's there....dunno if they taste identical..... . Over-rated!  But its legendary so go try it for yourself...
