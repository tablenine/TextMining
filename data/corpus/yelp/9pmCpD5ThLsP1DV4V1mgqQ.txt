Can I say that it's the best brunch in LA, if I've only had someone's leftovers from there? But yet, when I was debating the merits of pancakes  vs. waffles with my best friend, I remembered these pancakes, and came at her with, but the thing about pancakes is, you can make a pancake cake with a stack of them. She said, "Jean, you're crazy and obviously tired." But that's what Griddle is, your brithday best, in the morning.
