i used to go to this place more often than now. and of cox it's because of their famous hainan chicken with rice. but i think i've experienced better, the ginger and hot sauces that they give u with the flavored rice is good, i could eat it without the chicken. to me, i think the chicken are just okie, a little dry and rough. i just went back again recently and tried their seafood salad, it was actually pretty good. the dressing is like a sweet vinaigrette, with shrimp, squid, and scallops. Â small one is about 4 sth and bigger portion is about $7-8 that serves 2 ppl and comes with a plate of bread. i rmbr a long time ago i went there and tried the shrimp eggrolls, which i would also recommend, they're thin like "boba straws" haha... . service is okie here, dun expect much. and they closes on sundays, which is kinda rare for most restaurants. parking is just a pain in the ass, you will need to fight for those street parking spaces. -_-
