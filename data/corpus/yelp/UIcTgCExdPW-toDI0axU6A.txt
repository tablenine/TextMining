Solid. I don't normally eat steak tacos but I'm sold. I visited with a friend who's been coming to this same location since he was 13 years old and the staff knew his usual (strange) order by memory.. . Fast service, inexpensive... it's not Taco Bell cheap but you get what you pay (a little bit more) for. I'll be back.
