i really like the layout of the place... especially the outside patio. the clipboard door guy got mad cuz some guy let me and my friends in so that was lame. but we walked right past him anyways suckaaaaa..... . by the way, do you think a clip board REALLY matters? I can tell you this.... it MIGHT help sometimes, but in the end, if they really don't want your ugly ass in there, they probably wont let you in.. . there is way too many stereotypical blonde hollywood bimbo gross looking botox and fake plump lip girls... no offense to any blondes... it's not even tho blonde that bothers me. they could of course be bimbos with brown hair and all the other good fake hollywood stuff that goes along with that crowd. just trying to get an accurate picture of what kind of people were there!. . if people who have never been to hollywood have an idea of what it would be like, les deux is the place that would probably represent that idea. it's people like that who end up hating la because they don't know any decent places to go party.. . i just went there for the justice after party so the music was good and i was with my friends so it was cool... but i bet on any other given night it would be soooooo stereotypical movie hollywood. gross.... . yes i saw some celebrities there. but i could give a fuck about them. what's the point of going to a club if the music is not good just cuz some douche bag celebrity is there? oh i forgot, not everyone goes out for music. excuseeee me celebrity stalkers.. . i perfer to call it LES DOUCHE.
