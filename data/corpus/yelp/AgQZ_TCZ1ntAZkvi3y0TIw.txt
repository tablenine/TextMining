Seeing how I love hainan chicken and rice I had to try this place after yelpers raved about it here.  It was really good, but I still don't think it tops the hainan chicken at Noodle Planet in Westwood! Maybe it's the soup they give you to pour over the rice there that really hits the spot for me. Haven't found that anywhere else.  The chicken here is really tender and well-cooked though, and I like how they give you three different sauces, especially the grated ginger sauce.  Their chrysanthemum tea is good too; it wasn't quite as cold as I would like it, but it was still tasty.
