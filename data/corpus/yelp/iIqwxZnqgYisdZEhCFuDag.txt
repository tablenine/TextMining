Ohhh where to start. Went here last night (Thursday) with a group of 6.  Got there around 8:15pm, told there would be a half hour wait (they dont' accept reservations).  Here's a good trick, there's a bar across the street, and instead of waiting outside in the chilly weather we gave them our phone # and asked them to call us when our table was ready, and they were totally cool with it.  Anyway, we all ordered something different.  The Phat Rice was just OK - if you're a huge meat eater you would like it.  The ribs on top of it were EXCELLENT.  So tender and flavorful.  #13 (sorry I can't remember what it's called) has pork, noodles, some sort of red sauce and these noodle disc things that are sooo yummy.  That was my favorite dish.  I definitely suggest this for anyone looking to go out and have a fun and different night.  Oh - the bar across the street - clyde's, total dive, but fun in a small-town dive bar kind of way. Go there while you wait.
