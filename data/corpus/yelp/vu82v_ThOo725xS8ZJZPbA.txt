So we had this great idea of going to Summerfest at 3pm. It was over 90 degrees and we were dying after the 30+ minutes it took to walk from the entrance to North Highland. We did find a frozen margarita stand at least but it was just too hot.. . We went to the most underground, airconditioned place we could find. We got there early so we got good seats at the bar and the beer definitely cooled us down. Apparently they have good steaks too, but we did not eat here. I liked the basement like atmosphere and the crowd was mostly fun (except for the people who decided to bring their kids and the creepy old guy who wanted to make out with Lauren).. . I am liking that pretty much every bar in Atlanta has Sweetwater 420 on tap now.
