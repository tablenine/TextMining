Way Overrated!!! . . Agree with some yelpers here that his place is way over-rated. The only thing I would praise the dumpling is their skin. The dumpling lacks flavor.. . You can easily find an ordinary dumpling place in Shanghai or Taiwan that is better than this. I don't want to compare it to places in Asia as it is a bit unfair, but if you are suppose to be the best in LA or even USA as they claimed to be, you better serve something that is at least up to par.
