To review Q - oh, the danger.  The problem is that Q is deeply personal.  People who grew up in Atlanta (like me) generally like sweeter, tomato-based sauces.  People who grew up in North Carolina, for instance, seem to think vinegar is the only important ingredient in a sauce.  For the funniest summary of various preferences (and some gratuitous but funny slams on Alabama and Yankees), see . http://www.youtube.com.... .  Disclaimer aside, here's my take on Fox Bros.  . . Off the bat, I'm a certified Memphis BBQ Network/Memphis in May Q judge, so I'm a good bit pickier than your average bear.  They are for my money the best Q inside the Perimeter - I haven't been to the places in Marietta folks rave about, but ITP I think they're it.  I almost always get the ribs, which range from good to exceptional (when they have the perfect come-off-the-bone-with-a-tug texture).  I also love their poppers, the sides generally, and the Tomminator and Lopez are the best things to happen to tater tots ever.  Oh, and the 'burger' is a stunning tribute to gluttony, even by my meat-centered standards.  . . For folks from TX, which is where the Bros are from, their brisket is occasionally pretty dry, but again I don't know of better inside the city (largely because beef ain't Q, but that's another rant).  Their pulled pork is also usually pretty good, and isn't shredded to all get-out, so you can actually appreciate the quality of their work.  Again, if I wasn't a judge, and spoiled by competition Q, I'd probably rave on about it.  Haven't tried their chicken, since pork is the point.  . . Bottom line - on average days, the best Q in town (ITP).  They're legendary for consistency issues, but their range is from not bad to really darn good.  Definitely try the ribs, and whatever else you like.
