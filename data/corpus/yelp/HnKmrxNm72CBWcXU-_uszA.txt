Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's Bakery is the best. It's a good lunch spot or a place to buy a house warming gift for your friend. Their potato balls w/ tapatio sauce is really good, along with their pina colada smoothie. The medianoche is delicious too. I'm not much of a sweet tooth so I haven't tried a lot of their sweets, but about everything I try from Porto's is delish!. . oh I forgot, their CHEESE ROLL is the BEST THING IN THE WORLD. You always have to buy a dozen when you go to Porto's.
