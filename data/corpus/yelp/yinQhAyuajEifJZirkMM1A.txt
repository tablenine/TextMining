I like my cupcakes just like I like my men...a little on the heavy side. No, not fat and nasty, just a little hefty. You know, those cakes grandma used to make when she mixed the batter by hand. Joan's on Third knows what I'm talking about. . . The yellow cupcake with chocolate icing I had yesterday was yummy. Dense, moist goodness. The icing was nice and thick as well. . . Next time I'm going to go early so I can catch the cupcakes fresh from the oven, maybe even when they are a little warm inside........*salivating*
