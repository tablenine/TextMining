Category: Pizza
I love Osteria. . . Every time my ma comes to Atlanta to visit she has to go here because the pizza is so good.  She always says "it's just like in Italy, it's just like in Italy" (yes she repeats herself, and yes 'it's just like in Italy' is now an inside joke with my family).  . . All the pizzas are thin crust and baked in a wood fire grill (I believe) so they come out crispy and you can taste on the crust how they are charred which I love.  . . The prosciutto pizza is probably the best, and they put a serious amount of prosciutto on it, they do not skimp, which is great. . . I also love the arugula salad as well.  The ingredients are fresh and the tomatoes are always good and juicy.   . . I have not had any problems with service and I really enjoy the place.
