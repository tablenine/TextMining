Not recommended if you are in hurry or appointment in the next hour.. u need to wait before get seated and if they're really busy, your food will come out after 30-40 mins... but if you're in relax mode, you'll be fine :). . a very nice place for American breakfast restaurant... the french toast is very yummy... the pancake is supperrr big... and the egg dishes are tempting too... overall, good place to eat *agree with other yelpers*
