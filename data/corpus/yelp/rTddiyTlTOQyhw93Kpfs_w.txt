One of my favorite places to go after work to have a drink and some good food.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxing.. . With a great variety of food, I tend to stick with the Cajun influenced menu items most of the time, but they almost make a mean burger!  One of the nicest outdoor patios in the city and an amazing Bloody Mary make for a great early day to late night hang out spot.  If there are just 2 people in your party, or you really have a party of 20 people - FPN is always accommodating and remains on the top of my list!
