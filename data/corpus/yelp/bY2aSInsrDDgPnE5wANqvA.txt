Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The restaurant is always packed with crowd! This must mean that they are all here for crustacean-cracking experience. Although I love sea food, I found their spice-level way too much for me. A lot of Asian customers loved the spicy kind, but I preferred the milder variety. The shrimp were good (I could feel my cholesterol go up and down as I was eating) and the crab had enough meat in them. I would go back probably once a while.... . The pros: the crowded bar, ambience and the experience with the bibs. . The cons: the wait time (we waited 2 hours), lack of parking space, way too crowded, the dirty restrooms....
