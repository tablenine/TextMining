OH DAMN!. . Kogi is comin' to our office y'all!  Kogi 90210!  WHOO HOO!. . A flashmob started forming in the street against the anticipated 12-12:30 call time, and when the truck showed up at 12:40 the crowd started cheering.. . Of course, I had a one-oclock meeting so I left the line, and asked my coworker to order for me.  But the line was LONG.  My food showed up on my desk about an hour later.    We were about 20 people back.. . Notwithstanding.  It is delicious.  Delicieux.  Deliciomundo. . . I had 1 pork, one chicken and one short rib taco.. . All...amazing.  I probably liked the pork and chicken best.  Usually I adore short rib, but it was the least transcendent.. . The sauce.  The sauce is perfect.  I don't even know how to describe it.  The absolutely right blend of heat and complex, but totally comforting and appropriate flavors.  The meat is tender.  The veg didn't look terrific, but I like the crunch of the cabbage, and the fact that it wasn't overcooked/overprocessed.. . For $6?  Srsly?. . Sadly, though, despite its deliciousness, I probably won't join the mob outside if they come by again because I don't have a 2 hour lunch.  Hell, I rarely take a lunch break anyway.  If I could get in the line early, maybe, but since people were lined up an hour before the truck even appeared, I don't think it'll work for me again.. . Unless my coworker wants to stand in line for me again!  :)
