This place hits all the right spots - it's cheap, its good and it's healthly!  Got there at 11am on a Saturday and was the FIRST CUSTOMER OF THE DAY!!! Ok, so there was no reward for that, other than having first crack at the toppings and a place to seat (when I left about 15 minutes later, there were about 15 customers in there).  Loved the Cauliflower, loved the tomatoes, loved all of the toppings.  If only my pita with falafel was bigger so that I could've stuffed a little more in.  I walked out feeling like I had fulfilled my daily veggie requirement!  Will definitely be back.
