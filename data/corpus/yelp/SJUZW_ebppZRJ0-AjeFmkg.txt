OK, Â I'm a few weeks late getting this checked in. . . This place was stylishly yum.. Little loud but the portions were just right and the service was spot on.. Our group was made happy and comfy. Definitely a hopping place. The sushi was actually very yummy and the beef jerky selection was hilarious but somewhat trashy alluring. Of course I got it and immediately felt like a gay trucker. The cocktails were on par, nothing too fancy.
