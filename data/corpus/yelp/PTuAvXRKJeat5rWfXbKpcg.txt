Ate here last night for the first time.  Overall, not a bad experience.  I ordered the veggie enchiladas, which I thought we delicious- usually they can be kind of questionable depending what kind of vegetables they are made of.  These were butternut squash with a great mole sauce and black beans on the side.. . My date ordered chicken enchiladas, and seemed to rather enjoy them as well.  Tableside guac was prepared freshly, though as much as I enjoy chunky style, we had a few extra large pieces of avocado that required more mashing after we got it.. . A bit pricey (our bill was $50 for guacamole, 2 entrees and 2 iced teas) for my liking, but I'd probably go back.
