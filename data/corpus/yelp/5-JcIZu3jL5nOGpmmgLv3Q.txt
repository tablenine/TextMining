This is one of my favorite sushi places of all time. I'm pretty picky about sushi, especially sashimi, but this place always has a great selection of fresh fish. I firmly believe that japanese style sushi/sashimi should be done in a traditional Japanese way, with none of the silly crunchy roll crap--and this place stays true to its roots. I always get the sashimi platter, and I usually go for lunch, since it's a little cheaper. I love the variety of sashimi and the small side foods that comes out. Everything tastes delicate and never fishy. To top off great traditional sushi is the REAL green tea they serve (now they charge for it...boooo). Even though it's pricey, I can never say no to really great real japanese sashimi!
