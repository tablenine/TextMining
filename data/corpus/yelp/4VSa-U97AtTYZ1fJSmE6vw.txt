Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's Tacos... Es-Okay, Esé! . . Many have ranked Tito's Tacos as being the best taco joint in LA, but we fellow Yelper's know better, which is why we've given Tito's a three star average. Tito's Tacos is an over-rated, mediocre taco joint, known for its comforting, but greasy tacos. A deep fried tortilla shell, topped with meat, mounds of cheese and lettuce. Grease oozing from every pore of the taco shell, turning the taco into a soggy mess that you have to quickly ingest  before the shell splits open. Tito's is greasy comfort but I prefer a taqueria or even a Tijuana taco stand that makes you three al pastor corn tortilla tacos. Served with homemade salsa, cilantro, onions and lime juice. Relish the tacos with a radish and I'm good. Give me a cold Corona and I'm even better. Sorry, Tito's, but a dexterous Tijuana taco maker can run circles around your deep fried cheesy tacos. Simón.
