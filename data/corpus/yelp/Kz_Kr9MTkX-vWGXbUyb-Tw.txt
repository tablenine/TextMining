I expected to give this place a higher rating due to its reputation and  I had been looking forward to coming here for months on my trip to LA but I wasnt blown away.  The corn grain bread was really dry and just too dense. The cashew carrot spread it came with was great, though. I got the special of the month which was lasagna.  It wasn't bad, it was fine, just kind of bland and not comfort food-y enough which is why I ordered it.  The best part was the garlic bread on the side.  My girlfriend got the viva las pasta and it came with basically no red sauce or "parmesan crumble" but the tempeh meatballs were good.  I would definately come back because of the location and I'd like to try other things on the menu.
