I love this place.. My MOM loves this place.. My KITTEH loves this place. JK.. The onion rings are FAT as well as fattening.. I always get the turkey panini, I need to try something different.. The mochas are DOPE.. It's snackers heaven if you look at the counter.. Did I mention they have CAKE?. CAKE.. The seating is awesome.. WINE. CHEESE.. They have heaters out at night so you don't freeze.. In the LA pre-summer nights.. It's on Hillhurst, so if you like skateboarding downhill to get places at night wearing all black clothing, you won't die of going too fast.. Highly recommended after a nice Griffith Park hike with Pals.
