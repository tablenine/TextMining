We brought out-of-towners here for a bite and some drinks on a Friday night and really enjoyed both.. . We all shared some rabbit, sausage, and flatbread. The rabbit was great. It seemed to have been braised in beer and served with pasta. The flatbreads were tasty and the marguez sausage was the best thing that we ate all night. . . The beer list was enormous and well stocked. The wine list was a little on the lean side. Usually, I like wine with food, but here, I'd go the way of the beer everytime.. . I really like the idea of the small plates with the drinks as the star of the show in constrast to tapas where there are just small plates. The plates here are tasty and substantive enough to keep you drinking.
