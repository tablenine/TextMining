Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
BEST.  STEAK.  EVER.. . I can't say enough positive things about this place because it is actually one of the few restaurants that lives up to the hype.  The steak is perfectly seasoned, tender, and requires no additional sauce because it is that ridiculously good!  The lobster mashed potatoes were good, but really...the steak is good enough to stand on it's own.  The ambiance is classy and you just feel like a baller, dining beside all these celebs.  This place is way better than all the other steakhouses (psh, Lawry's, Ruth's Chris, etc. don't even compare) - often imitated, but never duplicated!
