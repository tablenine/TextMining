So, here's the thing..... . Being a vegetarian sometimes I feel as though I get the shaft at fine dining establishments, not so at Houston's. After reading the dear Carrie Neal's review I was somewhat hesitant, especially since it seemed as though Houston's had been so good to her for so long, and then without warning did her dirty, and I get semi nervous when I hear about regulars being treated like dirt. . . Still, I ventured out to Houston's in search of this mysterious veggie burger I had heard so much about, I valeted, headed inside and was greeted by a friendly hostess, I was seated and perused the menu. While the menu isn't huge, the offerings seemed thoughtful, I came for the veggie burger and when prompted was prepared with my order. The waitress was super helpful, and wasn't phased by my special requests. . . 15 minutes later a simple clean plate arrived to my table, veggie burger center of attention, warm toasty soft brioche, the right balance of lettuce, tomato, and onion, the burger itself was perfection! Juicy and succulent, tons of flavor, the texture was spot on. It was accompanied by a stack of thin salty crispy fries. . . I have never been so satisfied by a veggie burger in my life, its dinning experiences like these that don't make me feel like an outcast as a vegetarian. . . Houston's is a little on the pricey side, but I'm willing to let it slide for such a fantastic dining experience.
