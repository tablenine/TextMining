Okay, maybe I was a little harsh in my first review.  It really isn't that bad and my most recent visits have been a little more enjoyable.  The prices are still high, but the food is apparently authentic and always tastes pretty good.. . I still don't like their dining room since it's pretty just a giant enclosed patio.  I use the word "enclosed" loosely because it's completely open on 2 sides except when they lower vinyl zipper flaps when it rains.  It gets hot and sticky in the summer, so try to go at night or on cool days.. . I will say the margaritas here will get you drunk pretty quickly. I guess that's enough for an extra star.
