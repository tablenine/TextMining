Really?. . You're so desperate that you'll go to new depths in shallow culture to pay too much for too little, only to be judged by what kind of car you drive, or by the title on your business card?. Or perhaps you'll pretend to really be interested when if it wasn't for her banging body she'd be as interesting as a 3 day old newspaper, is that really how you want to spend your Friday night?. I'm sure it's me. I keep looking for a refreshing environment. A place with great music and beautiful people who "get me.". . Perhaps another night I would have loved Tap and called it "refined" instead of "pretentious"
