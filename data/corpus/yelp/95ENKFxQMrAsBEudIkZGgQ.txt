Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Outstanding Chinese with a touch of French.  Homemade sweet and sour sauce is actually a champagne reduction with real fruit, not a load of sugar jelly like most places.  Terrific Seafood Rumaki, Crab Rangoon, Whiskey BBQ Shrimp, any of the specials.  Meats are all high quality, even the rice is Basmati, wa better than most places. The owner, Alan, is a great guy. Friendly, attentive service, and BYOB.  A hidden gem. Tell him Joe Stephen sent you. Nice looking dining room.  Street parking plentiful, no valet.
