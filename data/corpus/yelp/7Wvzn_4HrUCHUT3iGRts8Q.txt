If you gave this truck any less than 3 stars:. 1. I don't understand you.. 2. I don't want to know you.. 3. You have no taste buds.. What's not to like? Incredibly gourmet, flavorful tacos and burritos. Kogi and also the Calbi truck totally raise the bar for fast food. Where else can you get flavors like this?... even in a brick and mortar establishment. Nowhere. All the losers who say... "it's a damn taco" or "it's a truck, people" totally don't get it. Worth the wait even as your're bitching and complaining in line. It's that good.
