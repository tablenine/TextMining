Restaurant: Rise-N-Dine
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Today was my second trip for brunch at Rise n Dine. We both had a craving for it today. On both visits, we have been struck by the interior of the place, the service, and the food. I love the shabby chic/DIY indie feel of this place. It's nice and airy without being blindingly bright and the mix and matchness of it makes it cool and casual. . . Everyone that has waited on us or greeted us here has been super nice, mellow and more than competent. I like the thoughtfulness of the hostess when you arrive - if they can't seat you, they offer to bring you some coffee. A nice touch when you're jonesin for brunch. . . Now about the food. We've tried something new on each visit and each has been well prepared and tasty...and Rise N Dine isn't afraid to try some unusual dishes. I've had the Pangaea, which was created by Butch from the now-defunct restaurant of that name. A grilled roti topped with perfectly scrambled eggs, harissa, hummus, feta, cucumber and olives. An unusual combo of stuff but made for some tasty eating. On today's visit I had the Turkey Pasta Scramble - whole wheat pasta with chunks of turkey and scrambled eggs. This was not at all heavy or overly filling and had great flavor - make sure you get some of the spiced tomato sauce with it on the side. Sqweeze had the breakfast tacos and the kielbasa omelette - both met his approval. This is definitely at the top of my list for brunch/breakfast places in town right now...
