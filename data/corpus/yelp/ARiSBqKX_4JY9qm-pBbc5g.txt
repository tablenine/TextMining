There was a crowd &amp; a wait, but then on the flip side, there were those incredible Oreo pancakes that lasted about three days.  Hot or cold, those pancakes were heavenly!!  the perfect amount of Oreo to pancake, and I'm not a pancake person...Oh, and there was also the Huevos Rancheros which I shared with my friend-pretty delectable as well.
