Every time I come here I leave asking myself the same questions:. . * Why did I return here?  Answer: Desperation for a place to eat.. * Why are they still open?  Answer: Others are desperate, too.. . No really.  I've been to the Old Orchard Mall location.  Why does this north side location look like it needs a remodeling?  I mean, the last show tunes poster they added was for Starlight Express, which is about the last time they renovated this aging dinosaur.. . The food is just ok.  Half the menu contains inedible Jewish food made with organ meats served myriad ways.  I know it's "my people's food," but honestly.  Enough with the Jewish soul food...just give me a sandwich with meat that doesn't come from an animal's intestine, a vital organ, a bladder or a gland.. . And that's the problem: I never know what to get here.  Should I get the Turkey Reuben...the turkey Reuben dinner...the turkey Reuben combination? So many ways to order.  I always get what I think is what I had last time, or hope that what I order will be as good as the previous time.  Last time, the sandwich was great--a Reuben that I think was corned beef.  I ordered the turkey Reuben with fries instead thinking it'd be a big sandwich packed with turkey.  Nope--just a few slices of turkey, some commercial food service brand sauerkraut, and bread so flimsy it almost came apart.  It was tasty but the sandwich was greasy AS HELL.  I'm usually all about greasy stuff, but this was...GREASY AS HELL.. . And then I got the bill.  Notice how I didn't order a beverage, which usually keeps a tab reasonable.  Instead the bill came to $14.80.  Pricey for a sandwich that wasn't nearly as large as the corned beef Reuben I remember from the previous time.
