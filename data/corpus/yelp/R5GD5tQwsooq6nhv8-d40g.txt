One of my favs for drinks music and appetizers. I love love love the tuna tartare. Its very spicy but i can't get enough. The atmosphere is sexy and sophisticated. The lighting is low but not too dark and the seating is arranged like a sitting room or living room area which promotes a relaxed atmosphere that is good for conversing. The service is great and the music is awesome. I am currently wishing that I were there now
