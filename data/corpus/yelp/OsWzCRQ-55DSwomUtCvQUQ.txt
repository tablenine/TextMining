Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
My boyfriend and I ordered Grillin' Chickin' ($8.95), Papa's Portobello ($8.50), and a side of Sweetheart Fries (plus $2.25) and Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade. Everything was really delicious and even shocking that veggie sandwiches and burgers can be this good actually. The tastes were awesome, however, I'm a bit curious that if they are using organic vegetables or unrefined sugar for all the menus they have. Their dessert menu has a note says, "All our desserts are free of dairy, cholesterol and refined sugar", however, the drink menu doesn't have the note, which makes me wonder if they use refined sugar or not in their drinks. I can't take sugar because of my health reason. I think we just have to be careful what to order here if you have a health problem, unlike macrobiotic restaurants that only use refined sugar in everything, even in their drinks. The service was really friendly and very prompt. I want to go back and try other menus they have.
