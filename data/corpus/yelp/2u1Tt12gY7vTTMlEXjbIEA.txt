Our server either didn't care about his job or couldve just been hungover from the night before. It happens. He wasn't rude, just indifferent to the fact that he never brought diet Cokes and hardly refilled our coffee/water, and totally screwed up our order and subsequent check. Â Either way, the food was good (once we got our orders straight) and I'll give it another go.
