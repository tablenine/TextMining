Restaurant: Wahoo! A Decatur Grill
Category: American (New)
As if Atlanta needs another fabulous brunch place to argue about on Sunday  morning. Well let me make your decision this weekend: if you haven't been yet, dine at Wahoo! The cozy red seats are always filled in this popular restaurant, as sunlight streams in brightening the room. The patio seems lovely - I definitely want to return in a month when it's warmer.. . The Wahoo omelette and the French toast with strawberries are both scrumptious. As for the breakfast buffet, let me warn dieters against it.  You will stuff yourself silly! Perhaps that's not such a bad feeling for a lazy Sunday.... . In addition to brunch, I went once for dinner and fell in love with the Charleston shrimp and grits. Admittedly, when I moved south three years ago I'd never heard of grits. I think the name turned me off. Slowly they began to seem okay....after having this dish at Wahoo, I have officially become a fan. The south and their seductive cuisine are winning me over!!!
