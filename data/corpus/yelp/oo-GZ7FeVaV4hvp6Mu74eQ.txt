We stopped in for drinks before meeting some others for dinner. Bartenders were great and a lot of fun. The place is a bit dated but oh well. After a few drinks it really didnt matter. We did order an appetizer lobster rolls. They were not happening, not to much taste or flavor. I may have to try again for dinner.
