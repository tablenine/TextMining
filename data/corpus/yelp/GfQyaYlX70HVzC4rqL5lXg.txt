Sweet and sour JESUS, this place is amazing...enough so to completely warrant the considerable wait times during peak hours. Â . . For those trying this restaurant out for the first time, I strongly recommend the ramen/fried rice combo...if there is such a thing as a gastronomical handjob, this is it. . . And if you're feeling particularly indulgent, try the ramen kotteri style (with broth made from black pork back fat)...it may wreak complete havoc on your circulatory system, but it's SO worth it.
