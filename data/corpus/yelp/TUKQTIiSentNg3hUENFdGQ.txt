Decent joint.  . . Pros:. Great beers on tap, delicious hamburgers and energetic atmosphere.  This is a great place to relax and meet new people as well.  You share tables and it's a natural conversation starter.. . Cons:. Food is expensive, the place is small.. . It's a very casual place to grab a beer and hang out with your friends if you're looking for a low key hang out.  I haven't been here at night, but the happy hour is alright.  Parking can sometimes be difficult to find as well.
