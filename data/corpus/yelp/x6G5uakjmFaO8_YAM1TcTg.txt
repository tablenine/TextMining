Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
The location is a little questionable (shady little stripmall, unimpressive exterior), and parking on a Sat. night is awful but the food makes up for it.. . The banchan is fresh and plentiful, with more than basic kimchi, beansprouts and cold fare some places give, their daenjang chigae is pretty good, and their bulgogi and kalbi is delish!
