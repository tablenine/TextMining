People are funny sometimes.  If you don't like deep dish pizza, don't come here.  If you're starving right this second, don't come here (the pizzas are hand made to order, hello?).  If you're on a diet, don't come here.  If you don't like your servers and bartenders to sound like they're from Chicago, don't come here.  Have you seen the wait?  They're not depending on you and your little 2-top to survive.. . That being said, the pizza is phenomenal.  Cheesy, rich, and they certainly don't skimp on the toppings.  I'm not a huge fan of the crust, but you either love or hate a buttery-crunchy crust.  Local brews.  Basically, I'm a fan.. . Be advised, my review only holds water at Uno's on Ohio &amp; Wabash...not in Schaumburg, and certainly not from the Jewel freezer.
