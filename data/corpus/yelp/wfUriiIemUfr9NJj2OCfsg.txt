Atmosphere is cool, food is OK and many of the bartenders are indifferent. They often serve "pints" of beer (which are NOT cheap) filled 1/2 to 3/4" below the rim of the glass. This translates to 12 to 14ozs of beer in a 16oz glass. I'm not talking head on the beer, because when they serve it, it has none, but mearly a short pour. They're usually in a hurry as they pour, don't care you're often paying $5+ a pint, and have an FU tude if you mention this to them. Â If you want good beer served by someone who cares, try Lucky Baldwins down the street.
