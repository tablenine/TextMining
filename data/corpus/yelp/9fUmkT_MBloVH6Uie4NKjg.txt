Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
If you're price conscious like me, Pitfire Pizza is Mozza's cheap knock off.  However, nothing-- I said NOTHING --can replace Mozza. This is the best pizza I've had in LA.  I also got the bone marrow, which inspired me to recreate the same dish at home.  The budino was just too sweet for me.  My teeth are rotting as I type this.
