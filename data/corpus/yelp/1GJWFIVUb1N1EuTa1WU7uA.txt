I had to write the anti-Gingergrass considering it's today's Review of the Day.  The restaurant is down the street from me, but I won't go unless coerced.. . This place is OK - some dishes are decent like the salt and pepper shrimp, but Vietnamese staples like Pho are bland and expensive for what you get.  Plus, they have a bunch of arrogant wait staff who just stand behind the counter not knowing what to do.  As another reviewer mentioned, the food is gringo-ized (maybe "gwailo-ized").. . Looking at the rest of the reviews, there's a love it or hate it vibe to it all - so I think the difference are those who are OK with inauthentic or those who have a low-tolerance for it...I fall into the latter camp...and so I recommend:. . If you're in the Silver Lake area, go to Pho Cafe instead, the unmarked restaurant in a strip mall for very good pho and noodles.  2841 W Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90026 - across from the Silver Lake Lounge.
