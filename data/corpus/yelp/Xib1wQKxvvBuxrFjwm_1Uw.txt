Came here on a random Thursday night around 7:30pm. The place was PACKED. The two of us waited for about 30-40 minutes. We've been to their other locations in Encino and Hollywood so decided to give this one a shot too.  . . The food was really good. We ordered salmon, albacore, mackarel from Japan, and yellowtail sushi. The spider roll, the panko crusted seared tuna, and the crispy rice with spicy tuna. We loved the food!. . Service was not as good as the other locations, it was a huge disappointment actually. Not sure why, maybe it's because we were sitting at the sushi bar. The sushi chef was efficient though. The waitress that we wanted to get stuff from was very impatient.. . The wait staff seemed to be rude (except the hostess). There was a lady who started an argument w/ one of the waiters because they didn't have her phone order ready. The waiter blamed her for "not calling".  I don't know whose fault it was, but it would seem wise not to attack the customers by saying that "she didn't call to order", and maybe a better idea to take the argument away from the middle of the restaurant.  . . We have agreed that we'll probably not return to this location at all. The Encino one is close enough and the service is much better.
