Stole a few moments on this sunny day to finally check out SSK. . . Came in for an early lunch and I will definitely go back! Ordered the chicken panini with arugula, chevre and roasted tomatoes. Very tasty.  Service was friendly, I parked right out front and it was quiet inside -- most other diners were solo like me and working on their computers. . . Only dislike?  I ordered a water which I guess is automatically a Pellegrino. So, $1.85 for a drink that I thought was no charge. I would have appreciated being told that upon ordering.. . Nice vibe and I look forward to trying some soup or breakfast on my next visit.
