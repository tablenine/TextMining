Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
After waiting for 1 1/2 hour for a table for two on the x'mas day, I have to say... I still love Din Tai Fung. I have definitely had better dumplings, particularly during my travel to Asia, but Din Tai Fung's food is solid and consistent. Service is fast and efficient. It is the place that I go again and again.
