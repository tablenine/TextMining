Restaurant: Noche
Category: Tapas Bars
"tapas" not "topless" every time i mention that noche' is a tapas restaurant i have to use the following directly afterwards. . the place is small but packs a punch. If you are one of the faithful that i see on sundays then you definitely know about the dollar dos equis every sunday. i highly recommend you get there early on sundays. also, the crowd will always have some douche bag talking way too loud about his weekend triumphs. besides that "1 guy" noche is filled with great people and great food.
