After a nice hike at Runyon Canyon, we (8 of us) had brunch last Saturday.  We didn't have to wait too long even though the restaurant was busy.. . As for the food and service, it was excellent.  I had the Belgian Waffle topped with fresh strawberries and bananas and powdered sugar (either $8.95 or $9.95.  sorry, can't remember).  When my dish arrived, everyone at the table was drooling for my dish.  =0. . I thoroughly enjoyed the waffle and fruit!  It was delicious!. . Xie Xie!
