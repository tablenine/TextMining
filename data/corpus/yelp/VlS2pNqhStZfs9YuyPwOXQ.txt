Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
My good friends and I came here on a Friday night around 8pm and there was a 30 min wait. Bottega seems promising, as it has a nice, contemporary decor and was super packed.. . Here is what we ordered:. . --Portobello Fries - these were really deep fried mushrooms. --Pizza - it was good, but not amazing. --Calamari - a disappointment. It was not seasoned and had no flavor. --Penne Gambler Pasta - decent, the garlic and olive oil broth didn't overpower it. --Asparagus with fried egg - our server recommended ths. It was ok for me. . What I liked:. -the food didn't take long to come out. -I asked for hot water and they gave me hot water in a nice, white teapot . -service was very attentive! Our waiter was very eye-candy - he looked like David Beckham!. -the meal came out to be $15 (before tip) each for 5 ppl, pretty cheap!. . Note #1: Don't come here on a date. Bottega is super loud. I couldn't even here my server. . Note #2: There is street parking in front, but you can't park there after 8pm. There is also garage parking across the street for a flat rate of $5
