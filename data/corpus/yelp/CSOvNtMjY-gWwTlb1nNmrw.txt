#434 review.... . So most likely....  just like all the other review..  you either like the relish or you don't.. . Burger. Fresh. sirloin. buns. lettuce. . It's good.. Fresh.  Thank God I never had to wait.   . It doesn't taste like Astro's...or Rick's.  Completely different taste.. . Solid burger.  Get's 5 stars on everything.  I'll give it 5 because it stands on it's on scale. With me and burgers it's not a competition.  This is better than that.   I'm a firm believer that each burger spot is will not taste like it's competitor or any other burger spot.    I'm sorry I didn't have any alamode.  Yeah...i know.    . . Yes i give lower scores but again...this one is legit.   The bread wasn't bad.  The meat didn't taste like it came from the freezer.  Yes, I liked the relish.
