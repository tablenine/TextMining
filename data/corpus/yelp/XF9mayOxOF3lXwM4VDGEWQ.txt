I got the chance to check this place out last Friday and overall I enjoyed it though a few things peeved me.. . Cons:. - TIGHT! The closeness in there is ridiculous. Every step I took warranted an "excuse me".. - Bathroom line. I'm a frequent urinator when I drink (TMI lol) so I spent 50 % of my evening on the bathroom line. They're unisex so there's not even the opprotunity to sneak in the mens bathroom.. - Idk if they do this to everyone but the holding the my card &amp; I.D thing? Not a fan.. . PROS. - HUGE cheap drinks! Owww! :) My boyfriend and I are DRINKERS and this place got us smacked for a mere $40! He had 4 drinks (Blue Hawiaan, Something random and fruity, a vodka martini, and a Mojito) while I had 3 (Mojito, Mojito, Mojito LOL) and we left stumbling. NICE!!. - Ok food. The calamari was a little soggy but it was probably because we were outside in the rain. -shrug-. - Ok staff. They weren't overly friendly buty they were accomodating.. . All in all this isn't a place I would frequent weekly (like my beloved Blockheads) but I can see the potential in it!
