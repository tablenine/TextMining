Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I walked and I walked and I walked and I walked and I walked.  Did I mention I walked!?  And while it isn't really that "long" of a walk it seemed to take forever to reach my destination and the whole time I am thinking..."what is so special about this place?  How good can the sushi be at a cafe?  Are we there yet? This had better be good food!  Are we there yet?". . Well folks let me tell you my walking and semi patience paid off.  This place literally came out of no where and slapped me in the face.  The restaurant is sleek and modern and not at all what I was expecting.  Honestly I thought I was walking to a whole in the wall sushi joint.  Little did I know this place is pretty fabulous!. . The food is great as well.  Of course I got the sushi and it was melt in your mouth wonderful.  The rolls are huge for the price so you definitely get what you paid for.  Everything is artfully done and it's so pretty you almost don't want to eat it!. . My dining companion had one of the many Thai options on the menu, drunk chicken or something like that.  I liked the chicken but not so much the noodles.  However, I am not a Thai food fan and she said it was very good.. . But let me back up and tell you about the appetizer I had.  I ordered the crab rangoon and OMG I loved it.  they were in these cute little balls and you just pop one in your mouth and they literally melt away.  Revealing a yummy goodness inside!  I was sold!  My friend got the spring rolls.  I was worried because I had spring rolls at another location and disliked them.  But these were very very good.  Fresh and yummy!. . I definitely will be back.  But next time I am bringing my own wine (it's BYOB) and taking the bus!  Hooray for great sushi!
