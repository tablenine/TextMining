Agreed that decor &amp; ambiance are great. Really nice wine list. Went for a late dinner with my partner. Shared the forest mushroom appetizer (outstanding) and the good ole standby margarita pizza. You can always tell the quality of a restaurant if they can get the simple things right. They did it VERY well. The pizza was incredibly delicious. . . The wait was long, so we ended up eating at the bar. The service was great though. Just make sure to clarify on wine prices, though, if you care. We were under the impression we were getting $10 glasses of wine, and they actually turned out to be $15 each. Two varieties from the same winery made it a bit confusing, but it should have been pointed out to us explicitly on the menu when the staff made the recommendation. . . Still, excellent experience and will definitely go back.
