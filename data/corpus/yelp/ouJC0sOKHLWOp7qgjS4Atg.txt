Went to Milk for dessert and ended up ordering mini red velvets and a slice of blue velvet cake.  . . The mini red velvet cupcake was just perfect. The cake was not sweet and the cream on top added just the right amount of sweetness and flavor.  Well worth the 75 cent per piece.  . . Hmm blue velvet was really different, not in a bad way but in it's own blue way.  Never thought it was possible but hey it tastes just as good as red with the exception of having actual blueberries in it. . . I also got a banana mint chip coffee blend .  This was not the best thing on their menu for sure.  It tasted like they threw everything together blend it and served it without giving it a taste test.  It was bland not sweet and strong coffee tasting on the bitter side, but at least I can't complain about the desserts which is what they are more known for.
