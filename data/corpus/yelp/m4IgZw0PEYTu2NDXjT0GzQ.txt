Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
After I checked out from my hotel in Vegas, my friend and I were driving back to LA for 2 hours and randomly thought about dumplings because we started to get hungry. Since I use yelp a lot, I remembered Din Tai Fung was the place with most reviews. So we ended up going there. . . IT TURNED OUT GREAT! It's pretty small, but it fills you up.
