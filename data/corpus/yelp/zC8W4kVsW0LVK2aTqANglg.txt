No need to mention:. Long wait . Hard to find parking. . Must try the chicken broth, even though it's priced at a ridiculous $6. If you have been to Asia and eaten plenty of dishes there, don't come here with high expectations or you will be disappointed. On the way out the kitchen staff was staring at the lady, nowadays I take that as a compliment. Enjoy!
