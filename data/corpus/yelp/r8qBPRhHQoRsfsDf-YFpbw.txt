I've been here once or twice before and it was great. During my most recent visit, however, the experience was mediocre. Service was good and staff are friendly but the food was just average. Usually I love their buffalo burgers, but this time the flavor was just bland--no way was it worth the $12 I paid. Onion rings and side of roasted asparagus were great, but I come here for the burgers. It's very likely that I won't be back.
