Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
For the price, this is one of the better sushi around West LA. For poor student like me who want to enjoy good quality fish, Hide Sushi is the place.. . I love the dry erase board for the waiting list (self-serve) and the friendly chef (of course, you need to get to know them, and they will take good care of you!). . overall, it's really good and very close to my place.
