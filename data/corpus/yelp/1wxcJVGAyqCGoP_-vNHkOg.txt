Restaurant: La Fonda Latina
Category: Latin American
La Fonda is pretty much a mish mash of different Latin cuisine that is pretty inconsistent across the board.  Some things are quite good here (quesadillas) while other things are pretty bad here (Cuban sandwich).  The service has not been good in my experience - slow to bring food and drinks, absent servers. The upper deck patio at this location is definitely a major plus.  Overall, it's pretty mediocre.. . 2.5
