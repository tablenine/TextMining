So my 1st trip to Pinks was a blast for me! We got there on a sat night about 7 and stood in line for about an hour! But we were in line with some great people! They were friendly and loved our kids! Hopefully everyone will get that lucky since the wait is usally that long, maybe a little less if your lucky! I got the Bacon chili cheese dog and it was good but my hubby got the GUADALAJARA DOG and it was amazing!! They have great onion rings and chili cheese fries! I def. think its worth going at least once if your in the area! The only downfall is they only take cash so make sure you have enough with you!!!
