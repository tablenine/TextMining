Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
Tuesday evening.  Romantic atmosphere.   Dim lighting.  Not very busy about 7:45 PM.  Friendly wait staff.  Bartender was not professionally trained but helpful, quick, and attentive.  Huge selection of wine.  Short food menu.  Started off with the serrano ham and manchego cheese toasts appetizer, which was really good.  Awesome porkchop with apple chutney sauce on top.  Extremely tender meat.  Flatbread with mozzarella cheese and arugula.  Absolutely delicious.  We noticed this dish was popular with two other couples while we were there.  The Bluebird dessert was a combo large enough for two to share.  It included baklava, figs- plain, dates chocolate-covered, cashews, and pistachios.  Pretty darn tasty, although I don't normally like nuts in my dessert, or fruit for that matter.    Large selection of beer including the always delicious Founder's Breakfast Stout.  Vodka organic regular and cucumber (64?) - an expensive drink at 9 bucks.  Other flavored vodkas as well.      Total for two for dinner: $89.
