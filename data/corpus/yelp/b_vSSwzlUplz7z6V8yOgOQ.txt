pastrami is my "go to" sandwich.  i sweat pastrami. and if the pastrami they serve here came in a 24oz pastrami steak form, i'd eat it... and believe you me, i'd eat it good. . . seriously though, the meat is soooo tender and flavorful.  if i had dentures, i could probably take them out and still be able to eat the meat, that's how tender it was.
