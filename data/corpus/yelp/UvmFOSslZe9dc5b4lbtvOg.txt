Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I don't know what the 1 starers are all hating on. I love this place. I remember sitting on my dad's knee eating a taco, then stopping here whenever we visited my older brother in college and later having him take me here whenever I came in from Detroit.. . Cash only, but if you're SOL, they have an atm outside. The lines are pretty epic. It's just good old fashioned tacos, wet drippy mild salsa, and good times.
