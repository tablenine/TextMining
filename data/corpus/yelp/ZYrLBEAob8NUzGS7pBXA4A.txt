Despite all the health inspections and notices.... I still find myself coming back. Great roast duck and BBQ pork! There is no better place to get it. I recommend getting things to go though. . I definitely recommend getting your roast meat here. It is quite an experience to see all this meat hanging from the window and ceiling. Plus you get to see them hack up a whole duck for yo.u in probably under 2 minutes. It is amazing. Not an experience you will get at Jewel or Domminicks
