Made a reservation a couple nights before, but when i got there, seems like a reservation wasn't necessary. Was seating right away, the place is very nice and cozy, the menu seems pretty varied. Service wasn't great, had to wave a couple of times to get the waiters attention. Food was surprisingly not-bad. Not the best I've ever had, but not bad. Will definitely come again.
