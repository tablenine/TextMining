We've never thought of ourselves as food-cultists but this is the third Mario Batali restaurant we've had the pleasure of dining at (Esca, Babbo, and now this).  We're fans, though.  We started with the brussel sprouts and the fried squash blossoms. We ordered something we jokingly called the "meat lovers pizza" - that's not what it's called on the menu -- but when we got our bill, that's what it was listed as (it must be the internal name).  Fennel sausage, speck, pepperoni, yum yum.  Capped off with the ginger pig cookies (cute but kind of at rip 2 for $5).  We love the quartinos his restaurants serve - perfect for lunch, 2 glasses worth of wine.
