Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Went here yet again, this time for my birthday.. . I must say, the service at Fogo de Chao is IMPECABLE. You're basically a king, for about an hour of button-popping-face-stuffing-meat-fest.. . Here's how it works:. . You flip your meat tab to green and the cuts keep coming. . . You turn it back over to red and you have a moment to digest, relax and enjoy your own space.. . The location is amazing, so comfortable and classy.. . The meats are almost always cooked right and the sides are delish.. . I really cannot recommend a better place to introduce someone to Brazilian food.. . Definately try the Picanha, the rice and beans and the fried plantains.
