Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Had dinner here after work with a friend on their half-price wine night. . . Overall, I'd say the atmosphere is fine, nothing too special and nice and mellow on a week night. The service was good, but not great and the omni-present busboy seemed to really freak out my friend with his hovering and eagerness. . . The food was fantastic. We had a bottle of Syrah reco'd by the server and were not disappointed. . . We stared with the mac and cheese which is about as decadent as you'd think. Big chunks of pancetta added a salty smokiness to the dish that only made it more rich and delicious. Definitely share this appetizer and get the small version unless you are a true glutton for cheesy punishment. . . I followed up with the fish tacos which were the best I've ever had. The perfect mix of spicy and citrusy without drowning the flavor of the fish. The beans were also incredibly tasty and the whole meal was very filling. . . My friend ordered the pork chop which was accompanied by the biggest sweet potato gratin either of us had ever seen. It was good from the bit I tasted, but I was happier with my tacos. . . I really enjoyed Feast and plan on heading back, though their prices will keep me from becoming a regular. It's in that weird place that's too casual for special occasion dinners, but too pricey for just meeting up for a menu that is mighty tasty, but a bit above fancy bar food. I will be back, but maybe for lunch or brunch so it's a bit easier on my wallet.
