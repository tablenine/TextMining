Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
Our group of 5 dined here for my friend's birthday.  None of us had eaten here before, but all had heard about the great reviews.  We walked in and Kevin Rathbun himself was sitting at the bar talking to someone.  We ended up sitting at an outdoor table (it's pretty quiet out there compared to the inside).. . We ordered quite a few small plates and sides including:. eggplant fries with sugar and tabasco sauce. ricotta ravioli. french fries with blue cheese fondue. tortilla soup. gouda cheese charred corn. chicken tenderloins and tofu in a curry sauce. crab cake. . Overall, we were happy with the dishes, but they were certainly nothing special.  The soup and eggplant fries weren't even finished by us.  I think I could find this quality at many of the upscale American restaurants in Atlanta.  . . The desserts did stand out though.  The regular dessert menu had about 7 options on there, and the special daily menu had 5 more (I think they are transitioning to their new fall menu).  The great thing is you can pick 4 desserts of your choice for $12.  We had the peanut butter banana pie, the grasshopper cake, the Jack Daniels cake, the key lime pie, and the Mexican chocolate cube.  All were fantastic, especially the grasshopper cake.. . Wines were surprisingly cheap.  A huge selection of options for $6.50 per glass.  Service was solid, and the manager came by to say hello and also said bye when we left.. Overall, I would give Rathbun's 3.5 stars.  Not as good as I had expected, but worth checking out once.
