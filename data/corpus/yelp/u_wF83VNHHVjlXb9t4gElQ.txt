Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Honestly, the best California hot dog I've ever had. The atmosphere is very nostalgic. I had Jalapeno Dog and since I gave pork up years ago they were kind enough to substitute it for an all beef hot dog. The chilli cheese fries go well with any hot dog. Onion rings is always something to consider. Only thing is if you 're going to Pink's make sure you clear all of your appointments. You would need to have more than just a lot of time on your hands. The wait is long, the line is a dog leg and no parking whatsoever. It's something that anyone who loves food as much as I do would have to experience. If food is just food to you, then this place I wouldn't recommend. If you live to eat this place is great. Remember to make sure you have a full tank of gas to endure that los angeles traffic and cash only, no cards accepted. The staff is very friendly and unique because they don't write anything down. Ordering is all verbal memorization.
