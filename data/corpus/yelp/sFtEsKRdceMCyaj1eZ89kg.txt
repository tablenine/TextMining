I tend to think people cook chicken whether it's fried, roasted, or any other way. So I usually stay away from the chicken. I love waffle so that's exactly what I had tonight. I was going to order the number 6 I think which was Natalie's Special or Jeanne Jones Omelette (#5) which would have had chicken in the omelette and of course a waffle. I ended up ordering the Home Style at the top of the menu which I never saw before. 2 Sausage, Waffle and 2 Eggs. That was really great. Eggs over easy and I usually don't care for sausage but it was chicken so I tried it. Very good. One of my friends knew the waiter from the Long Beach location. Very cool to be like the in crowd at a different place.
