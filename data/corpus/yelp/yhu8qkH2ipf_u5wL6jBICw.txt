Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Love that it has an outdoor seating area.  Service outside is pretty attentive.  On the other hand, the latest time I ate here, we ate inside as it was cold outside, and our service was pretty bad.  We had to flat someone down to refill our water.  Both times my bf and I shared the Taste of the Daddy combo platter - 21.95 for your choice of ribs (spare or baby back - we chose baby back) and 2 pulled meats (we got the pork and the brisket). We added 1/2 a chicken.  For sides we've gotten the sweet potato fries and smoked beans, and I've also had the mac &amp; cheese.. . Food always comes out super fast!  Chicken - skin was good, but as with all bbq chicken it was a little dry.  The server accidentally brought us someone else's platter that had the spare ribs - they were very large and looked delicious.  But she brought us out our correct order with the baby back ribs.  Ribs were very good, came off the bone easily.  I usually don't like brisket - but with the bbq sauce at the table, it was awesome.  Pulled pork was my fav though, very juicy even without the added bbq sauce.  Sweet potato fries are awesome - greasy, but sooo good.  Awesome crunch and sweetness.  Smoked beans tasted like chili, has large pieces of meat in it.  Mac and cheese is to die for!!!  Mac is really soft and it's sooo super cheesy.  YUM.  I barely ate any meat, I was too busy eating the fries and mac &amp; cheese.  As always, we've been too full to imbibe in dessert.
