It was good but I wouldn't say it is the best. There is definitely more hype around this restaurant than it deserves.. . The nachos were excellent! I believe the burgers are great too. Anything else we ordered wasn't too appetizing.. . The service is good too - even when it was crowded the waiter made sure to give us the freshest ingredients.
