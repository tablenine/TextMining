Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
El Barco is more fun than good. The food is decent, the portions are huge, the atmosphere is a riot, and gotta love that giant Corona served up like champagne. It's nickname of the "Mexican Hooters" is well deserved, but the service is unapologetically bad.. . Honestly, we used to be regulars here until one night when we were starving and the wait was super long. We decided to give this unassuming little restaurant across the street called Rudy's Taste a whirl -and we've never gone back to El Barco since. They have several of the same menu items, but Rudy's is SO much better. Seriously, read the reviews for Rudy's -it is such a gem.. . BTW, if you go to El Barco, your clothes and hair will REEK of fried fish for the rest of the night. It's part of the experience.
