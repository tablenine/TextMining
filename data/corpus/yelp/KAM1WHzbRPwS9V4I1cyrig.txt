I have only eaten here once but I have been here to drink and mingle about four times and I like this place a lot. I ordered two sushi rolls and they were DELISH!! So I would go back and try more, the service has always been great weather sitting at the bar or having a table. I like this bar because its young professionals and people who dress well, and look good :) Drinks are reasonably priced for the area, I love this place and I am considering it for New Years Eve!!
