Went here this afternoon for lunch and had a really good meal for a decent price. I don't live extremely close, but am up in the neighborhood a lot and this place is ALWAYS packed... lines down the block! . . So, we decided not to brave the crowds and went in for lunch. I don't much care for their salsa (just not my favortie style) but the lunch specials were really tasty. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and also tried a bite of the steak burrito. Everything tasted fresh and the services was very friendly. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but for the neighborhood, it's a pretty good spot.
