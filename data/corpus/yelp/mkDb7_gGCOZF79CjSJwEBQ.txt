Portobello Fries were amazing.. . Service?  A few beats off.  The place is so busy that I don't think they've had to focus on it too much.  . . Sent back my first entree (the pasta with prime rib and black kale....the meat was dry and overcooked and the pasta was hard from being browned.  The dish could be amazing if not so over-cooked).  . . Second try was awesome....ended up with the Chicken Parmesan.  Delicious homemade sauce, fresh mozzarella...mmmm!. . Had the Peanut Butter/Chocolate Terrine for dessert....deeee-licious!  I'd go back, but if the service doesn't get any more attentive and prompt, I probably wouldn't be back a third time....there are enough great places to choose from at the moment.
