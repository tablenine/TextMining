Cheap lunch options, flavors were 'good' to 'ok', the bread however was a bit chewy &amp; doughy. After inhaling their classic sandwich during lunch, my stomach started to get bloaty &amp; uncomfortable. The pain got worse as the day progressed. By the time I got home from work, I was tearing from the pain and spent the rest of the night in fetal position. Â My friends who enjoy this place said perhaps the bread was undercooked that day because it's usually crisp &amp; fluffy. I'm sure this sandwich is fine on its good days but who knows what the cuplrit was that put me in that incapacitated state - I'm too traumatized to ever give it a second chance.
