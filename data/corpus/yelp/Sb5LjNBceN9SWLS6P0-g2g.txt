Thanks Yelp for this one.  Get there early because the lines get long quickly.  I ordered the lunch sashimi for $17 and it was fresh, diverse, and delicious.  It comes with lots of pieces of tuna, octopus, white fish, salmon, and seaweed.  It was well worth the price for such fun for my tastebuds.  Probably can't afford this every time, but it makes a nice treat.
