Yeah you gotta wait for a bit. But for good reason, the food is amazing and the place isn't very big. I had the king crab legs seasoned with The Whole Shebang-mild. WOW!!! Â would take the crab meat and dip it back in the bag with all the great butter and seasonings in the bottom of the bag. And DO use the bib. Trust me, you'll need it.
