im from los angeles, so i like to think of myself as highly knowledgeable in mexican.  so when i say big star has the best tacos ever...its legit!  those pork belly tacos are just sooooo good.  im not the biggest fan of the fruitiness of the el pastor tacos, but thats fine because all i ever eat there are the pork belly tacos.  the queso fundido and the guacamole is even better than rick bayless's!  i also love the simple garage-ness of the entire place and i totally bonded with the doorman as we found out we used to live on the same street in studio city!  you gotta love a place with an angeleno in the front!
