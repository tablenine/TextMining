Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Sports Bars
My all-time favorite drinking hole in Los Angeles. Jim Morrison was one of the regulars back in the day - what else needs to be said? The pizzas are good, the burgers are OK, and the mozzerella sticks are awe-inspiring. Especially if you've already downed a couple doubles. You can't go wrong with Barney's Beanery!
