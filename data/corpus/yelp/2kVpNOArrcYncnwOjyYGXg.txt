So in 5 days, I've had kogi bbq 3 times... I live at least 20 miles from each location, work 20 miles away.... yet I've still gone 3 times... (they were off sunday and monday) I love love love the short rib tacos.... sliders are pretty good too... the hot dog is definitely a must try at least once... its the vegetables the make it super fantastic.... . . kogi bbq.. ur making me fat
