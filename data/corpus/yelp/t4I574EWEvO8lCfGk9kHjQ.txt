Wandering into Decatur on foot Friday night, my boyfriend and I decided to take ourselves somewhere other than the Brick Store.  The Grange was an excellent choice: the atmosphere was delightful, the fries we shared were delicious (although we would have liked a bigger basket of them), the beer selection was extensive, and the bartender was extremely accommodating (and his heavy Irish accent was totally endearing).  Watch out for or full speed ahead towards the on-tap combo of a Golden Monkey and a St Bernardus Abt 12: with abv's of  9.5% and 10.2%, respectively, how can one's evening out not be successful?
