Meat-lovers paradise and the service is TOP NOTCH...it's unbelievable that the food and service are both so consistently excellent...is it a Brazilian thing?. . The meat speaks for itself, the salad bar is always fresh and I could probably eat 50 cheese rolls but I'd have no room for the picanha...in addition to the red meats, my favs are the chicken wrapped with bacon and the pork ribs....the great thing is if they don't bring by a cut of meat you are craving, you can just ask a waiter and they'll make sure someone brings that to your table asap.. . The food is A+ but the service is A++...
