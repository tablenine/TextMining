Not sure what I can add to the gazillion reviews, but I will say that their new "Blue Plate Special" is pretty awesome.  I brought a book, went belly up and enjoyed a lobster sandwich with fries and a beer for $20.  Staff were super helpful (and cute!).  I'll be back.. . OH, I should mention.  The BPS is offered every day from 530-7 (5 on Sundays).
