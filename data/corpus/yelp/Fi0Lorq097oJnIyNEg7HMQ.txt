We waited over an hour for our reservation here on a Saturday night for a birthday party - after they called the member of our party who made the reservation three times to confirm the day of our dinner!. . They totally ignored us for the first forty-five minutes we were waiting, but then they compensated us with a free round of drinks, free (and yummy, if garlicky, bruschetta), and at the end, a free sampler of four different full-size desserts (the creme brulee was especially delicious).. . As for the dinner, I had a pizza which was mediocre. It would have been nice if they had been more apologetic about waiting for our reservation earlier in our very long (hour and fifteen minute) wait for our table after our reservation time.
