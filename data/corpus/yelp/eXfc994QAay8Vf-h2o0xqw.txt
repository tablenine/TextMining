Tuesday is half-price bottles of wine, so basically we can order a nice Kim Crawford white for the same price we pay at Wine Discount Store or Binny's- so it's definitely an incentive to keep us coming back.  The food is good.  Not sure I'm addicted to a menu item yet, like I am the beet bruschetta and breakfast burrito at Lula, but I've never had a bad food experience.  The service is actually better than Lula-- no pretention, just hard-working folks trying to pay rent like the rest of us.  The only complaint I have is the smoke from the bar.  Sorry smokers--- it's nasty so I'll be glad when the smoke-free law takes effect in January.
