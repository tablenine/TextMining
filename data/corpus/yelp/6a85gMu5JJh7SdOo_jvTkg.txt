So you're freezing from the cold and you're hungry? Nothing warms up the soul than a hot bowl of pho. What is exactly pho? Thin rice noodles simmered in hot broth with typically beef or chicken and slices of red onion. Serve with a side of bean sprouts and lime wedges. If you order the beef pho, the broth actually cooks the slightly raw meat. Dump bean sprouts and squeeze in some lime. Add in sarachi sauce (spicy chili sauce) and you get a full experience of Viet dining. I must say their cozy eatery is very cute and the baguettes are delicious, piping hot and toasty from the oven. I even had room for their pandan (malaysian leaf) icecream! The waitress gave us mini samples of durian and pandan icecream. I don't like the pungent odor of durian fruit but the pandan was really good.
