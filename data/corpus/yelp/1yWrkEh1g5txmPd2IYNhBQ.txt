My father in law's boyfriend is in love with this place, as is he. I personally don't see the obsession. It's okay food, for a very good price considering the neighborhood that it is in. In fact, if it wasn't so cheap, I wouldn't be able to justify having to pay for parking. But there is nothing served here that I can't get out in the 'burbs.
