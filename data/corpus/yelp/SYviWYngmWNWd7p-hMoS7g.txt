I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and we loved it.  The different kinds of meat were seasoned very well where you can still taste the flavor of the meat.  Be prepared to eat a lot since it's so savory.  The sides were very tasty too.  I liked the crunchiness of the polenta.  The cheese bread is the BEST, I had to stop myself from eating it!!  The service was excellent, very attentive and fast.  The wine that was recommended by the waiter was very good although I don't remember the name of the wine.  Overall, I really liked my experience and would highly recommend this restaurant.
