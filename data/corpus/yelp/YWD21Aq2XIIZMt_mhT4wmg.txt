Restaurant: Francesca&#39;s Forno
Category: Italian
I must be getting old, because after having a tasty meal at Francesca's last night, all I can remember are a) how noisy it was b) how hard it was to read the menu, due to the dim lighting and tiny font, and c) the uncomfortable chairs.. . I think I would enjoy going there for lunch on a weekday, though. Â I'd just need to bring a chair cushion.
