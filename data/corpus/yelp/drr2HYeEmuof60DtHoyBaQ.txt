The certainly have quite a few reviews, here my .02. . . After a late SAT evening SUN brunch seemed to be on the menu. Greeted by the exceptionally energetic hostess was escorted right to a table which was surprising considering it was Easter Sunday. Service is prompt and helpful coffee was consistently filled without any need for  request. . . They have a delicious looking Menu with plenty of options . Me - Took the Waitress advice and chose the "Sassy" - House Specialty with Chorizo, Cheese, Guac, Eggs, Sour cream and Potato.  Um... Yum, hit the Spot! My friend decided that the "Acelga Picosa Omelet" was the way to go and was quite happy with it. . . Side Note - I found it interesting they were serving a Braised Rabbit dish on Easter... good on them for their creativity. . . If Over Easy were closer to my place I would certainly work it into the Brunch rotation.
