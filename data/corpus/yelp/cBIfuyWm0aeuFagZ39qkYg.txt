AMAZING!! Love this bar! Me, my boyfriend and two of our friends were in town for the moe. concert at the Riviera. My boyfriend had read about everyone meeting up at Fat Cat before and after the show so we decided to check it out. . I have nothing bad to say. We walked in and were told we could sit anywhere. We had the good fortune of sitting in Chris' section. He was patient while we decided what to order and then was constantly asking if we wanted more as soon as one ran low. We also got coupons for a free shot after the show! . We decided to go back the next night before the concert again and made sure we sat in the back by the pool table (which had a jager bottle in the felt!). The boys played some pool and Teresa served us. Just as good as Chris! . When Chris got there, he remembered our order from the night before and served us whenever we needed something. . I can't say enough nice things about the bar (clean!) and the food (great!) and the wait staff (amazing!) I will recommend this bar to anyone going to a show up north and even if they aren't. It is worth the trip! ANYTIME I go to Chicago, I will be hanging out there. . Teresa did a great job serving us. Chris is an amazing server! I work at a bar waitressing and bartending and I learned I should take a page out of his book! If I am half as nice to customers as he was to us I am sure everyone that comes in will be satisfied. We never waited for a drink and never had to tell him what we wanted. Even if we changed what we were drinking he would remember that too. Unbelievably nice guy as well! Sit in the back by the pool table if you go because he will never keep you waiting! . Thanks Chris and Teresa and thanks Fat Cat for making our trip to Chicago so great!
