Whatever. This place was just meh. There were some nobody actors sitting next to us talking about some audition they just went on or some boring shit.. . It's very expensive for what you get. I ordered some blah omlette. Blah-mlette. It came with potatoes, they were a little oily. The coffee was something like $4. Insane. The toast &amp; jam were excellent but very tiny, which was a super bummer.
