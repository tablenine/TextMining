Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
The best things come in small packages.  It definitely holds true for Umami Burger...burgers!  These little burgers are savory, juicy, and just a party in your mouth!  The only thing is...it's quite little...and when you're paying $10 bucks for like 5 bites, it kinda sucks.  (Yes, I'm a petite girl, but that doesn't mean petite burgers satisfy me.). . I had the socal burger and it was awesome, as was the umami burger my bf had.  However, we were both veryyyyy disappointed with the fries!  We are fries lovers and they gave us unsalted, bland potato wedges.  Bleh.  . . My advice:  at $10/5 bites (or $2/1 bite), make Umami Burger more of a special every so often "treat."  I definitely can't afford this like I can afford In-n-out!
