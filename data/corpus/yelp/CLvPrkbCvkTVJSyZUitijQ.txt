Came here last night due to a blistering heat wave that is crossing southern cal. My roomie and I decided to forego dinner and just fill ourselves up on the goodness that is Sinbala's shaved ice.. . I must say the shaved ice lives up to the reputation, still the best I've had in So Cal. Ice is fluffy, toppings are awesome. Flan, Red bean, Rice balls, Condense milk and lychee totally decimated my taste buds. Good stuff.. . The chinese sausage...I know this place is known for it, but honestly, my mom makes it better at home. We had the ginger and chinese sausage platter and it's satisfactory. Not the OH MY GOODNESS stuff,. I'd strictly come here for the shaved ice. Not to mention they give you a carafe of water in case the shaved ice is a bit too sweet for you.
