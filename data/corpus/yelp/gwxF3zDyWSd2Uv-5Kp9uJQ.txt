Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Amazing fried catfish and seasoned fries. So many people miss out on that in their big attempt to get the crawfish, shrimp, or crab. Per pound, the food can get expensive if you're not careful, but who really cares about price when you're busy licking your fingers and lips at the next poor crustacean sitting before you. The hardest part about the place is not getting into the crab.... or peeling off the crawfish shell from the minuscule meat.... it is making that bib look GOOD. =) Â  Biggest tip I can give anyone is that if the bib they give you doesn't have those catch pockets on the bottom, slide the bottom of your bib underneath the paper tablecloth - no drip-age! . . Watch out for the infamous wait though. Even if you choose an odd-ball time to go, you're bound to have a wait of some sort. Don't bother trying to pull into their "lot". I swear they have more space inside than in their parking. Get street parking along the block.
