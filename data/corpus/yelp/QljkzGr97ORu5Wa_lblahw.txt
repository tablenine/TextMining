I've been putting off Kogi Taco for a long time, ever since it first appeared in a short bit in our paper back in December of 2008.  It's not because it didnt peak my interest, but the rumored 45 minutes to an hour wait just for some $2 tacos just did not appeal to me.  So last night, after learning that they'll be at a friend's lot AND there will be two trucks there instead of the usual one, we decided it was time to see what the hype is all about.. . We ordered:. . - Chicken Taco:  the shredded cabbage in what seems like a vinaigrette of some sort completely overpowered the chicken, while eating, I had to repeatedly ask, "Is this the chicken one?" cause I sure don't taste the chicken!. . - Spicy Pork Taco: the bf and I are huge fans of al pastor and spicy korean food, so we had high hopes for this one.  *sigh*  there was no kick!  where was the heat that korean food was famous for??  instead it tasted like a normal pork taco, nothing spicy about it.. . - Short Rib Taco: probably the best of the tacos, the meat had enough flavor to puncture the overwhelming cabbage.  was the galbi in this taco comparable as the AYCE places?  not quite...  but it was still tasty nonetheless.. . - Kimchi Quesadilla:  probably my favorite dish from Kogi.  it was spicy, it was simple and my gawd, it was good!. . Overall, like everyone said, not worth the 45+ minutes wait, but if you happen to see it and there's no line, definitely give it a try.  It's a great concept, but there's room for improvement.  I think my biggest complaint is probably the overpowering taste of the cabbage and the lack of flavor from the meat, which could also be the result of the overpowering cabbage.  Did I mention the cabbage?  HAHaha.
