Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
So I bounced over to the Midtown location of the Vortex last night with my fellow Â yelp happy hour crew to round out the night. This location only reinforced my love and up most admiration for the Vortex. Dare I say, I love this location better then the L5P one?!?!?!? Yes, I may! . . Just because your in town doesn't mean that you won't be served by a tatted up waitress. So shove those preconceived notions of "in town" location to the side and belly up to the bar baby! . . The decor is the same and so is the menu, even thought I didn't eat here. To get to the bathrooms you go down this really cool hall way and be sure to look up and check out the flying skeletons. Here's a hint. They glow! To freggin cool!. . I will definitely go back to this location for some in town fun.
