Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Basically, they cut a lot of corners to keep the price low.  If you're in the mood for Korean barbecue and lots of it, though, it's a great deal.. . The building is basically a tent, open to the air, but with space heaters.. . The service was not unfriendly (as it can be at some Korean places), but it was brisk and impersonal.  The waitress didn't even offer us menus -- just asked if we were having the "all you can eat," which we were.. . The sides arrived almost immediately and were all delicious.. . The meat arrived shortly afterwards.  We had three different kinds of beef.  It was all tasty, and if was fun to try it with all the different sauces and other condiments (especially the raw garlic -- snappy!).. . There aren't a lot of choices of beverage.  However, this stuff is best washed down with cheap Korean beer, and that they had in abundance.
