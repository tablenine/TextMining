Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
This is one of my most favorite restaurants. Every dish I have tried has been delicious, fresh, healthy, and well priced. This is not your typical Vietnamese food. It is a fusion of East meets West. My favorite dishes are the gingergrass tofu and bo sate. The tofu is a little crispy on the outside and perfectly soft and warm on the inside. It melts in your mouth. The bo sate is tender pieces of filet mignon with yams and string beans in a spicy peanut sauce. Amazing! Every entree comes with broken rice and slaw..both perfectly prepared. They have great sangria, and banana spring rolls or key lime bars for dessert. The spring rolls are great too for an appetizer. Basically, you have to come here because everything is mouth watering! It does get crowded during lunch and on the weekends and they don't take reservations, so come on the earlier side. Another bonus is the Silverlake Wine shop across the street...they have a great selection of wine. So you can eat a fantastic meal, buy some wine after, and be in food-wine heaven!
