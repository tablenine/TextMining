Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This place changed me from only being able to eat sushi rolls to love eating sashimi. Their super white tuna is out of the world!! Every time I had it, it felt like the fish was melting in your mouth, leaving behind the taste of fatty tuna. Then it was like teasing your palate so you would always want more and more and more. . . Their sashmi combo was very fresh and yummy. We've tried lots of other Japanese restaurants in Chicago. Toro is not your typical Asian-fusion place. The rolls are good, but I'd say if you want some old school sashimi with nothing fancy, Toro is the best. Given the price and quality, there's no other place in Chciago can compete with Toro.
