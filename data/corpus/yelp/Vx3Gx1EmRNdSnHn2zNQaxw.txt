Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
My first visit to Veggie Grill and it was totally worth waiting all day for.  I'm not a vegetarian but I'd heard about this place through the grapevine so I was really curious to try the food.. . My friend and I shared the All-American Stack and Grillin' Chickin' as well as the Sweetheart Fries because who doesn't love sweet potato fries?  Both burgers were amazing and the fries were just so-so but still topped off the meal well with an amazing chipotle ranch dipping sauce.  . . A little pricy for what you get but I'd be willing to go back every so often when I'm in the area.  The prices aren't all that different from going to any other cafe with similar food items.  The staff was awesomely friendly and it was nice to note that there is an outside patio which is dog friendly for any dog owners thinking of going to enjoy a delicious meal.
