I love Spitz. It's so yummmmy. . . I've been going to Spitz since winter of 2005 or 2006 (whichever year they opened). And I'm so glad that my brother visited Eastern Europe and out of the blue mentioned how he missed eating street food such as doner kebabs in Europe. So we did a little google to see if anywhere in LA sold doner kebabs and what do you know, out pops Spitz. . . So ever since then, I would get the classic w/ fries at Spitz. My poor brother was in school in Berkeley, so whenever he was down, we would stop by Spitz to curb his (and mine) craving. It's so yummmmy. Their sweet potato fries are delicious too but I'm a wussy to pay extra $ for them. Recently, they put in garlic aioli sauce (very similar to Zankou's garlic sauce, but bETTTER) in our togo order and YUMMMx5. So try their regular fries and get a side of garlic aioli and some zesty or fire feta (whatever it's called)..
