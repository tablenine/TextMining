In the words of Commando: All Be Bach.  Come on man, it's a restaurant with mouth-watering shafts, battered fries (with the option of dipping sauces. Not just ketchup and mayo, but O-face-making dipping sauces), and beer.  Also, there's a DJ spinning.. *Also* it's next to little Tokyo. Karaoke anyone? **Also**, well, it's kinda romantic. A Weenie between your buns. HELL-O.. . This place has definitely inspired me to partake of other gastropubs in the City of Angels.
