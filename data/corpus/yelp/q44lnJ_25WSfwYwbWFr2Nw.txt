as usual, i have to try out those places that gets all the hype, and usually i get disappointed, same with Rascos.. . If you really be honest with youself, the chicken isnt really that great. i could get something like that at ANY corner grocery store. nothing special, dry, overcooked/fried.. . but the waffles are a little better, sof on the inside, a little crisp on the shell. With the whipped butter is very creamy.. . but i think its a little pricy for 2 piece of chicken and two waffles for 10.50...
