Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Oops I did it again! Every time I go to the Griddle, I get the pancakes and my buddy gets the French toast and we always think that we are going to eat the whole thing. We never do. Not even close. But it's always worth the try. The orders are huge and the food is delicious. .. . There's something great about getting up late on a weekday morning and eating a breakfast that is like your mom would cook. The reality is that Mom never cooked this much cuz our plates weren't even big enough. Mom didn't serve breakfast all day long, either. Oddly enough, Mom did have a bunch of Hollywood hipsters hanging outside waiting for a table. Hmmm.... . I like the crowd. I like the food. I recommend the place.. . Here's a tip. There is a back door and restaurant parking behind the Rite-Aid store. You get to it on Fairfax. You'll never find parking out front.
