Food tasted pretty good, I wish the kimchi was made with cabbage, and was spicy.  Fusion kimchi is just kind of weird.  Another thing is that my fiance, my two friends AND I ALL had REALLY BAD breath after eating here. I eat a lot garlic-ky foods, dried fish, a fair amount of authentic kimchi, and have even been affectionately nicknamed "Baby Stink Breath" but this bad breath was like nothing I have ever experienced before.  When you think a burp smells like a fart, you know your breath is bad.  I do NOT recommend this as a first or even second date place.  Make sure you and your s.o. are very settled into your relationship before dining here together.  I can not emphasize this enough.
