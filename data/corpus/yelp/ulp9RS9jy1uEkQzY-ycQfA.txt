Restaurant: Coobah

The girls and I usually hit Coobah after a mani/pedi across the street at Nail Bar.. . We've ordered several things here, and I think the best thing on the menu is either the breakfast burrito or the huevos benedicto.  Friends always rave about the pancakes, but I'm not totally thrilled about them.  They are different and the cinnamon butter is very good, but it's just kinda 'eh.. . Service is good and it's a fun place to go.  We always have a decent meal.  I tried the Strata Grande on my last visit and it fell kinda flat in my book.  The chili tater tots, however, area  nice little treat to share with the table.. . It's good, just not GOOOOOOOOOOOOD.
