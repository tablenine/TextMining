I give two stars mostly because their service was terrible.  It was so slow on a weeknight around 8pm.  It gets pretty loud in there too.  It is one of those trendy sushi places so the maki rolls were pretty fancy and more on the expensive side.. . Food taste wise...it was pretty good.  I liked them but not worth the wait unfortunately.  We ordered the lamb chops for appetizer, hawaiian maki, and something else I forgot what it was called.  My husband's cousin just did not like the food at all but my husband thought it was decent.
