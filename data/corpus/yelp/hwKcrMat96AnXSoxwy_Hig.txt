The place is a fantastic gem hidden away behind Piedmont park area.  It's a bit difficult to find, but worth it on a nice day.  The patio is great and the ambiance inside is nice as well.  The food smells and looks delicious - the ropa vieja, the pollo, . . . etc.   I say looks delicious, because not being a meat eater I was quite limited to my food options.  The beans and rice, the plantains, and yucca are all excelente -and I think I had a soup dish, too that was fantastic.  There are also a nice list of Spanish wines.  The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that it would have been great if there was some other type of vegetarian option - a vegetable to go with the beans, rice, plantains, and yucca -- but, if you're a meat eater - check it out.
