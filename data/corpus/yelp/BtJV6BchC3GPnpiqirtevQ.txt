It's a nice little place to sit down and get something to eat when at the park.  I didn't say quick, as the service can be a nightmare, but if the day is nice, just hang on the patio and chill for a while.  Nice view of the city skyline.  You kind of think a place like this would clean up with some better coffees, but it is really more a tavern like the name says.
