A friend wanted me to meet her here for dinner; this was my first time at Uncle Julio's.  It wasn't that it was bad; we both got an appetizer as our meal and they were both very good and decent price.  We both ordered a frozen strawberry margarita; at $7.75 for the size of the drink, they were no where as strong as they needed to be.
