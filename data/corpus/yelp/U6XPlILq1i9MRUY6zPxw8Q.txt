Restaurant: Taqueria del Sol
Category: Tex-Mex
Taqueria del Sol is personally responsible for about 3" on my waist.  Seriously, I'm addicted.  . . Not only is the food consistently good, it's simple, fresh and inexpensive.  There's ALWAYS a line for a reason.  I haven't had the experiences voiced by some as far as service.
