Think this place is soooo over rated. I've eaten there twice. Its really crowded and popular during lunch and there's always a line to get in. I dont know why though. Their sushi is just okay. . I did take out once and their portions were tiny! . expensive and small portions. not a good combo. get better sushi some where else
