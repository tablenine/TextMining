Restaurant: Café Santorini
Category: Greek
Sit upstairs!  The restaurant is surprisingly big with tables everywhere but I do believe that the best seats in the house -- given nice weather -- is the upstairs.  . . The bread they bring out is EXCELLENT.  They're basically sliced up focaccia (I think) with lots of seasoning.  It's painfully addicting and I ate about 10 pieces.  If you order hummus and pita bread, there isn't even close enough pita to use all the hummus.  But what you can do is keep asking for the bread which goes better with it.  I found that the pita bread was too thin and floppy.. . My main dish was the Grilled Beef Brochette which at your typical lower end Mediterranean restaurant is essentially beef kabobs.  But never in my Mediterranean eating experiences have I had a restaurant ask me how I wanted the kabobs to be cooked.  I asked for it medium rare and most of the pieces were cooked to order minus a medium piece.  It comes with pilaf, vegetables, hummus and more pita bread!  I liked how light and flavorful this dish was.  Even the pilaf was cooked perfectly and not mushy at all.. . Some of my friends didn't enjoy their dishes as much.  I wouldn't recommend getting the Farfalle pasta with pesto because it's pretty bland.  Most of the dishes range from $10-20 but if you want to save some $$, get the lunch wraps. . . Everything is linen cloth here so it definitely has a nice yet cozy ambiance.  Decor is rustic and the staircase downstairs spits off into multiple areas which is kind of interesting architecture.
