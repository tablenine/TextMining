I was there on a Monday Night. As far as I know this one of few places happening on Mondays.. . Monday night is Rocker night. And it's 18+.. . I got there at 10pm; it didn't open till 10:30pm.. . The only reason I don't give it 1 star is because the bouncer was very cool and I chatted w/ him about life for 30minutes before the place opened.. . It's really loud inside and it's loud outside. The patio is filled with more smoke than any club I've been to.. . Crowd is mostly under 21.. . I like the 21+ crowd and hip-hop. I will definitely not go back here on a Monday.
