Last night was my first time at "Across the Street", and I must say I loved the coziness and decor of the place, the bartender is really nice and so is the wait staff.  I started with a freshly squeezed lime house margarita, which was tasty.  Not the best I had, but tasty.  For appetizers we ordered the Goat Cheese Enchiladas, which had a nice smokey flavor and the herbs and mango garnishment brought together the flavors of sweet and smokey.  I enjoyed this dish.  For the main course I had fish tacos which was probably the best fish tacos i have had so far, served with a side of rice and beans.  Almost every dish had crumbled goat cheese on them....which was different from the usually Mexican dishes I have had....but it brought on a good flavor.  Definitely a place to try.  And the best part.......since the weather has been so amazing lately....we sat outside.  It was really nice!!!
