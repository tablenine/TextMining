Restaurant: Wurstk√ºche
Category: Hot Dogs
Belgian gone wild. Wurstkuche specializes in innovative sausage combinations like, Rattle Snake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeno. The specialty sausages are served on a freshly baked roll and piled high with caramelized onions, spicy peppers, sauerkraut and they have a selection of mustards that will tango with any taste bud. I had the Buffalo, Pork, Beef and Chipotle sausage with caramelized onions, spicy peppers and sweet-hot mustard. The sausage was very flavorful and the skin was perfectly crispy. I also ordered a side of their fresh French fries (which are very thick), and you have 10+ dipping sauces to choose from in which to drown your potato friends . And what to wash it all down with? Why not one of the 20+ Belgian and German beers that are on tap. Also, $2 PBR pints (holler) if you're looking to save the scrilla.. . Now that you get the overall picture, let me just say that Wurstkuche is head and shoulders above any "hot dog" and "beer" joint that I know of and is a great addition to the rather lackluster downtown eating scene.
