Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I've probably been to The Boiling Crab 5-6 times.  The first few times, I really loved this place.  Their seafood was just super fresh, the atmosphere was fun, the waiters/waitresses were nice.  If I was writing a review then I probably would have given it 4 stars.. . But our recent few visits were major disappointments.  The wait was ridiculous.  We had our name down and were told to wait 45 min.  We walked over to the near market, came back 45 min later, name got called already, so instead of seating us with the next available table, they put our name on the bottom of the list.  We waited for another hour and 30 min to get a table.  That was not cool at all!!!!!. . The quality of their food has not been the same and the taste is just so blah now.  Just a great disappointment!!
