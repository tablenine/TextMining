Impressive queues shorten quickly in this fast paced southwestern themed pancake house.  Service was courteous but necessarily brusque, and the food turned out with alacrity.. . I had the breakfast tacos.  Not bad, though a little bland for my tastes.  Decor is bare bones, but effective and appropriate for the style.. . My frequent orange juice refills were most welcome.
