Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
I recently returned to Cafe Selmarie after about a 4-year absence, and was happy to see that it's "business as usual" over there.  Had a terrific cobb salad and a bowl of chili for lunch -- perfect for a Chicago winter day.  It's definitely one of the few places I miss, and I was glad to find them still in Lincoln Square, amid the "Cold Stone Creamery," "Potbelly" and other suburban chain restaurants which continue to infiltrate Chicago's neighborhoods.  (Note re "Potbelly" at 4709 N. Lincoln:  skip it and go to Costello's which is just a block or two south - you'll be very glad you did.)
