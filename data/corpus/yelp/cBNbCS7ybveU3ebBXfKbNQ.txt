man...i'm being really stingy with my 5 stars these days.  4 for now...until i come back.  after all, i did only try one dish.  but Mmmm was it good!  . . i ordered the special that sunday....the seafood lover's omelet.  crab, shrimp and lobster covered in hollandaise sauce.  that was my first time having hollandaise sauce, so i didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't too rich, so i could still taste the seafood, and didn't need any tabasco.  i looked at it saying "i'm not gonna eat all this" and i believe i ate almost everything, even most of the fruit on my plate.  (only ate 1 of the 4 half pieces of bread though.). . i came here at the recommendation of my coworker friend, who confirmed with me that they have a host everyday, not just the day we went.  someone is there helping you find a seat, so don't get freaked out by the long line you see coming out the door.  almost all the seating is outdoors, but it's a lovely place to have brunch.  the menu is huge!
