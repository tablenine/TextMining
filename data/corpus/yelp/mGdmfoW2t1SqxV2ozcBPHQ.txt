Restaurant: Electric Lotus

My girlfriend and I visited Electric Lotus by chance while walking by on our way to a different spot in the same area. Even though the place was packed, we were seated immediately and after a brief delay ordered the Garlic Chicken Tikka and Vegetable Korma. The chicken was a little dry and uninteresting - I didn't taste the garlic at all - I found myself over-using the chutneys to compensate. The Korma was good but a little salty. The service was a bit absent, though I imagine it had to do with the rush we happened to jump into the tail end of. . . Overall, the food was reasonably priced and decent - nothing to get excited about - but the service and ambience was lacking.
