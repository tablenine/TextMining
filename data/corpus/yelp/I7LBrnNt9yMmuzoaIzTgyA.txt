Hmm.  I don't know what the whole hype about Portos is.  My friends dragged me to this place after my constant driving past so many times in Glendale.  I got a a Cubano and some other random sandwiches and they came with plaintain chips.  I was not impressed for the price.  Any of these I could have made with Costco (and I do love Costco) croissants and added whatever.  The quality of the sandwiches as well as what was inside is nothing special.  Again, I don't know why people rave about this place when you could just make these at home.  I did not like the sandwiches.. . However, their potato balls were very delicious and a plus since they had meat.  Yum.  Their pastries looked beautiful, so we got some ganache fruit thing with gel topping and some cream filled tarts with blueberries and assorted fruits.  YUCK.  As soon as you stuck a fork in them, all collapsed in a messy pile and none of the pastries had any flavor.  It just tasted like plastic muddiness on a plate.. . I really don't know why people rave about this place.  I will not go back to this place again.  It didn't meet any of my expectations.  Except maybe for the potato balls only.  Their sweets and pastries suck.
