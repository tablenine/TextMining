DELISH flatbread pizzas and some insane tasting cheese on a strater salad makes me give this place 4 stars - the high-ish prices and just-okay service kept me from giving it the full monty, because I really enjoyed this place!. . My boyfriend and our friend Bill got some very tasty, unique cocktails that you might love if that is your thang. Â One was really spicy and refreshing - I don't remember the name, but your waiter will let you know I am sure!
