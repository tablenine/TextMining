Not bad overall as a default place to go to Argyle when you can't think of anything else.  The food is decent and they make good bubble tea (second to Joy Yee's) in my opinion.  Their service is rushed because they get high traffic so don't expect a lot in that department.  Other than that, it's not too bad when you just want some quick Vietnamese foods.
