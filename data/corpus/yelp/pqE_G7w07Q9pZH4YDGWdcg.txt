Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
If you want to find a no-non sense place for fish tacos, this is the spot! They make their tacos to order and you can choose either fish or shrimp - I recommend both. :) . . They have an awesome salsa bar where you can "build" your own tacos instead of other places that slather on all sortsa stuff that you may/may not like. The salsa bar is pretty fresh and have a multitude of "heats" from mild to super hot. The prices are pretty cheap too, around $2.00 for tacos. The only thing that they dont sell are ice cold coronas to go with it.
