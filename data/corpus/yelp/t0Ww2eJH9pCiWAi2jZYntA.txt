The first time i went there, i tried the salad, bean cake and scrambled tofu. I forgot which salad it was so i never ordered it again. But, I get the scrambled tofu everytime i go there. . . I sometimes get a craving for it and have to take a lunch break to go there. Unfortunately, there was a time i never made it there because of the traffic and had to turn about after one hour. And you better believe i ran straight there as soon as i got off work later that evening. Im not a fan of their grits...I like plain grits and i think theirs has cheese or something. Yep, im one of those people that gets the same dish in the same restaurants.
