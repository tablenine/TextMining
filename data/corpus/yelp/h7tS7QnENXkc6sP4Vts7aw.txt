Restaurant: Delicatessen
Category: American (New)
Delicatessen, unlike it's name suggests, is a modern bar and restaurant North of Little Italy. . . I give it two and a half stars.. . Four or five stars for strong drinks and nice clean decor. . . But on the Saturday when I visited it had quite a few B&amp;Ts. Yes, one guy actually had a hooded sweatshirt with the hood up. Maybe it's better at other times.
