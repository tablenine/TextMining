this is that trendy LA restaurant; where all the girls are in minis and the guys are in button ups. the decor and ambiance is pretty awesome with interesting paintings, lots of glass rooms, lofty pillows and fireplaces that go up the center of the room. it's two floors; with the bottom floor crammed with people and the upper floor offering the more intimate vibe. we were lucky enough to get seated upstairs, so we could actually hold conversation and not feel like we were screaming at each other. . . the waitress was super awesome and on her game. she ended up bringing us a round of free shots; and even took one with us! . . the food was pretty good; i really have no complaints. though it was a tad on the pricey side; it's to be expected if you're going to be eating out in trendy LA.. . overall, it was a very nice time. a place i'd recommend trying but not a place i'd go to every time i was in LA.
