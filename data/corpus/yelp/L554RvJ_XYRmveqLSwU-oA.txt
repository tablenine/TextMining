Restaurant: Southern Sweets Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I "discovered" this bakery 3 years ago and I have been hooked every since. The cakes are made with real ingredients.  My favorite is the coconut cake but the red velvet is close, as is the golden choc cake.  I introduced my coworkers and we place a takeout order every week. The sandwiches are good too.  I have tried other bakeries that have decent cakes or cupcakes, but this is my favorite.
