Category: Dim Sum
Great dim sum.  Arrive after 10 but before 1115 on weekends. Too early and few carts.  Too late and a long line.  This is a place Chinese go and have a good meal and I understand why.  Hargow / hargau and shrimp cheung fen (shrimp in rolled rice noodle - looks life a white pile of noodle sheets) are two great shrimp dim sums here.  If you park in the city lot have your parking validated and save about $5
