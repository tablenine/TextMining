Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I've always enjoyed sinking my teeth into a fat pastrami sandwich at Johnnie's.  The 4in thick mound of meat in that french roll has my mouth watering everytime.  Yet, I have a couple mixed feelings about this place.   . . Situated among taco great's Tito's Taco's and Cinco De Mayo, Johnnie's Pastrami has been doing business since 1952.  With that said, they have a legion of devout followers who swear by the place.  I myself at times has said they are the best pastrami place in LA.  But there's two type's of pastrami's, the deli style and the greasy spoon style.  Johnnie's is the latter.  Arguably the best of that style.  . . The sandwich comes on a french roll that perfectly compliment's the meat.  The airyness of the bread really soaks up the juice the pastrami stew's in, leaving you the option of not putting on any condiments, just how I like it.  The pastrami itself is done sooo proper.  Super tender, super juicy and the perfect amount of fat from the brisket.  It's like biting into butter.  . . At 10 dollar's a pop, you better expect that they're gonna slab a mound of that goodness onto your sandwich.  Which brings me to my mixed review.  10 dollars?  Damn dog, that's plenty of money.  That's not including fries and a drink.  The best way to do this place is come with a friend, split the fries and get yourselves a couple drinks,  and the check is gonna be 15 dollars each.  So, if you have the money and you really want to treat yourself, head to Johnnie's with a friend and do the greasy spoon pastrami style right.  . . Pro's. -Arguably the best greasy spoon pastrami in LA. -Laid back, old style diner atmosphere. -Free refills. . Con's. -Price @ $10.25. -Sometimes inconsistent in quality
