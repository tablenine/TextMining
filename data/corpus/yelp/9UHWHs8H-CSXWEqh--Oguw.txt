The best breakfast items I have ever had in my entire, as Edward Cullen would say, EXISTENCE. . . Brioche French Toast with black berry jam, vanilla yogurt, fresh berries and bananas. WHOA.... blew me away with how soft and fluffy it tasted. The blackberry jam was not sweet at all, more like just persevered fruit and when smeared along with some vanilla yogurt, the whole french toast seem to be "melt in your mouth" silky smooth. Absolutely delicious. Best French toast in the world.. . Banana Walnut Pancakes was another home-run as well. Came out as 3 gigantic fluffy pancakes topped with walnuts, fresh bananas and powdered sugar. I thought it stopped there, but NOOO..... when I cut into it, there were actually bananas and walnuts embedded inside too. OMG...... beyond words. Best pancakes I have ever had! The cooked bananas added perfect sweetness  and the nutty taste of walnuts added a whole new dimension to the pancakes. Soft and fluffy and you get full from a few bites. I adore!. . Organic Latte was nothing special. I feel like just because it is organic they add a few $$ to the price tag. Love the coffee art. It was  beautiful. Went cold pretty quick so I am not a fan.. . Service was impeccable. Derek was the sweetheart that served us (you deserve raise).
