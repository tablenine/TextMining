I think this place gets more credit because it's an institution.  I'm all about respecting relics but the sandwiches here are just a TAD overrated.  . . The rolls are run of the mill rolls and the meat, with the exception of the beef, was dry and chewy.  . . Go for the history and the institution, but manage your expectations.
