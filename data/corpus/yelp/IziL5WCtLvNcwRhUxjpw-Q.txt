A great gourmet market to not only purchase quality goods but enjoy them too.  This store had a hodgepodge of gourmet eats, from prepared meals, cheeses, crackers, wine, spreads, baked goods, etc.  Center booth includes coffee and gelato selection.  Cafe mocha was a little watered down but flavorful and well made.  Plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy your goodies so it all works for me.
