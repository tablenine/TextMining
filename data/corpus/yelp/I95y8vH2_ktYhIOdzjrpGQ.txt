Loved the atmosphere and the random celebrity sitings (Haylie Duff and Noah of BH90210!). The food was good, although a bit heavy. Lomo and codcake appetizers were nice and the skirt steak was delicious. The paella was more of a risotto with a somewhat overpowering lemon flavor. The churros were too sweet! I would come back to try some more tapas plates but you should definitely head somewhere else for dessert.
