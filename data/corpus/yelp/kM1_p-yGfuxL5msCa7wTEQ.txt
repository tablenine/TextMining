The appeal of this place for me was that it really brought back some of my childhood. It reminded me of my little Japanese grammy's kitchen...vinyl seats on metal frames, uneven floor, old lino...kinda place that you walk out feeling a little greasy and a bit sweaty, but content. If someone inside would have been puffing on a Parliament while hand-mixing something in a bowl , it would have completed my time-warp. It was real throw-back type place, real J-Town history...what a warm blanket! Now lemme tell ya, in a moment's notice, 'bachan could doctor up a bowl of Top Ramen like no other, but this place wasn't bad either. Of course I'm not comparing the two, but to me, ramen has always been comfort food.. It was a pretty big bowl of ramen, complete with the egg hard-boiled in shoyu and eggy broth. The pork had a kinda soft consistency, but it was good. Had a side of gyoza...def. homemade. Everything was solid and good...nothing mind-blowing, but hit the spot. I'll be back for the food and the good feeling. Broke the hell out because there was a crowd of people waiting to get in, giving us stink-eye. But hey, as my sweet little Grammy used to say, "F**k it." . 3 stars for the grinds and 1 extra for the atmosphere.
