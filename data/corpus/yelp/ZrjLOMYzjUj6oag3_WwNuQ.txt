This review is just for the at cost lobster special and the bar area in general.  As my dear bff Martha said in her review of our dinner last night, it was a toss up.  Our drinks, which took ages to order because our bartender had no clue what liquors they had, were pretty pricey.  $7.50 for a rather small vodka and Seven Up is not my idea of awesome.  The bartender was a general dumbass and he took so long we wondered if he was hand writing the menus himself.   We also ordered a shrimp cocktail app. that was $13.  I'm sorry but even though they were big and juicy, 5 shrimp does not equal $13.  Wildfire and Mon Ami Gabi have comparable cocktails in the $7 range. The lobster itself was very good and yes, very cheap.  They have a drink special of pineapple martinis for $5 on Thursday which I wish I'd known at the beginning because they were good sized and tasted pretty good.  Somehow $11 lobster night turned into a check of around $40 each which I think I'd rather spend elsewhere.
