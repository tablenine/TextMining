To all the people who expect FO to be another burger restaurant where you can customize your order, not have to wait too long in line, friendly waiter service to serve you with a smile, and feel that customer is always right, you're looking at the wrong place - go to Islands or Red Robbins instead. There's good reasons for their policies, no customization helps the kitchen to get the food out faster and not try to please every person who wants their dish to be tailored to their tastes. . . The burger here is good...big juicy patty (go medium) with the sweetness of caramelized onions and gooey cheese goes well with any of their 94 types of craft beer. Also go direct for the side order of sweet potato fries w/ aioli sauce that easily feeds 2. There really is no wait service here - order food and drinks at the bar, keep tab open or closed, and get a number and the back waiters will bring out the food. Not into burger? Go for their small dishes like cheese, smoked eel, spicy olives, and daily specials. . . This location is much more spacious than the original Santa Monica location but don't underestimate how crowded it gets weeknights and lunches during the weekends.
