Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
Went out for Mexican last night and instead of visiting my usual EAV fav, decided to try Holy Taco.  The patio is huge and was told to sit where ever we wanted.  The garage doors were open to reveal the spacious inside dining room that was nicely decorated (leftover from the other three establishments that previously occupied this location for a brief time;  but, I digress).. . Ordered the chips with guacamole and Ecuadorian salsa - both the guac and salsa were a la carte.  The chips were so greasy it took away from the taste of the guacamole.  The salsa was fresh but lacked the spices to give it flavor.  Then again, maybe it was the greasy chips that washed out the salsa flavor.  Really not sure.  . . At this point, I was a bit skeptical about how the rest of my meal was going to taste.  However, I must say, Holy Taco shined with their roasted chicken and grilled shrimp tacos.  Both were flavorful and absolutely delicious. . . At the end of our meal, we told our server, David, what we thought of the chips and, not to be a butt, I also told him how great my tacos were.  We suggested he tell the chef that the chips were too greasy and the grease overpowered the taste of the condiment(s) served with them.  David said that it was not his place to do so - the chef wouldn't appreciate that.  Hmmm, I thought servers were the front line who provide feedback from the customers to the chef/manager so they can improve.  Silly me!
