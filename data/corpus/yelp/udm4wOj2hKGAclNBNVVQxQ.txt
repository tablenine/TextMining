I went to Fork &amp; Screen last night with a friend for the first time (and probably the last time).  As we pulled into the parking deck, she saw the sign and said, "Did that say PorkScreen?"  It kind of looked like it from a distance.  We laughed a lot and then discussed how funny this would be if it was a porno theater (especially considering the neighborhood) where they served food along with the movies.  Ewwww GROSS!. . So, we walked into the smallish sized theater and found a table.  Service was prompt and good.  We ordered the chicken quesadillas and the wedge salad (i'm a sucker for the wedge).  Both were decent in size and definitely better than I expected.. . As it got closer to movie time, the theater filled and someone with a big hat sat in front of me.  There was also a couple sitting next to us who ordered food in baskets (it comes on this stupid paper that makes way too much noise) and proceeded to eat it in a very loud manner.  I'm not sure what they were doing but when we left, we saw that they ordered fries and onion rings.  I guess those rings are super crunchy because that guy made some serious noise munching down on them.. . The screen was on the smallish size and next time I'll most likely go to one of my usual theaters.  This place is convenient if you want dinner, but if you're looking for drinks, save yourself the trouble and either sneak it in or go to the Landmark theater in Midtown.  People are loud due to the eating and drinks so it can get distracting.  Also, the lights are always on so it doesn't really give you that good movie experience.
