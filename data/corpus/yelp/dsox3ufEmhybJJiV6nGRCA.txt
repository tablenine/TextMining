I will preface this with a fact that I am a whore for tableside guacamole. I just can't help it, I think it's genetic. So they earned a few bonus points there.. . The margarita I had was definitely well executed too, though with how large and powerful it was, I was feeling pretty tipsy by the time the entree rolled around.. . I appreciate it when 'Mexican' doesn't equate to greasy. A friend of mine from Mexico was kind enough to cook for me a few times and his was far from unhealthy and was quite similar to what I saw available at Rosa... so I'm a bit shocked when I see another review say it wasn't very authentic. While I've only been to a few spots in Mexico, and only been out with my various coworkers to places THEY claim as being authentic (and seeing as they are first-gen, I trust them), it all seemed to be about right to me.. . The environment was a bit over the top, but when the prices are high, you expect a bit of a grandiose environment of course.. . The server, how I wish I got your name, rocked. His jovial omnipresent smile made me happy. .... or the 4oz of tequila I managed to stuff in my tiny body may have done it too. Either way, thanks =D
