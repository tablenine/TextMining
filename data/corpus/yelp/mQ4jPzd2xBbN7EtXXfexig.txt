Restaurant: Quoc Huong Banh Mi Fast Food
Category: Vietnamese
Best thing about this place: the tofu Banh Mi.  It's not on the menu, but if you ask, they'll happily make it for only $2.50.  . . The people that work here are so nice.  On my last visit, the lady that ordered after me didn't realize they only took cash, and the owner insisted that she just pay on her next visit (even though if she didn't realize they only took cash then clearly she was not a regular).  I trust other yelpers not to take advantage of this information.
