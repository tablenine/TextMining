Whenever I am in Burbank around lunch time I like to go to Porto's. The atmosphere is so so especially since it is usually crowded and you have to fit to find a seat but the food is worth the wondering. . . My favorite is the Cuban. But there is also a steak torte that is delicious. Of course you can't pass up the pastries. I recommend getting something to go since you will be full from your sandwich. . . I have also heard rumors that their cakes are to die for but have never had the pleasure. Maybe for my next birthday...
