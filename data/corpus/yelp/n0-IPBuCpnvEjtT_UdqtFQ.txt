If you like martini's, then this is your bag.. . If you like crowded, cramped places with WAY over priced, weak ass cocktails, and a ton of L.A. poseurs and douchebags, then this is your bag.. . I've been here tons of times, because for some unknown reason my friends like it, and every single time I wish I hadn't paid $10 for a cocktail that would probably be better if I got it at Denny's.. . So you may be wondering, why's Johnney's review so bad, compared to all these other good reviews?. . My only explanation is that for me, I was born and raised in L.A., been there and done that, and I'm over and done with your typical L.A./Hollywood, superficial, poseurific "hotspots." Â Love or hate my review, I'm always right. . . Usually.
