*Updated* I went back after being away from this place for two weeks - consistently good!!  Ordered the same exact thing as the first time. Just as good if not better than the first time. "Ima Japa, they are Japa - all they serve is Japa Japa"   Great service even with the line going out the front door!!!  I love this place. (I think - as with most authentic Sushi  places - if you sit at the Sushi bar, you may pay more for your sushi/and or the whole menu may not be available at the sushi bar.). . *My first time*. . I read.  I went.  Now, I believe.  Its all that with happy ending. High quality sashimi - extremely reasonable prices.. . I did the sashimi and tempura dinner ($23) and I will return - nothing short of the freshest sashimi I've had in a long time. Maguro, spicy tuna, HAMACHI, tako, negi maguro - a feast for the eyes and a delight for the palate. Served up with soup, pickled veggies and rice - not to forget the Tempura - battered lightly and cooked up crisp and perfect for that melt in your mouth satisfaction.Plum wine ($4) sweet and an excellent pairing with the wasabi and did I mention this place was PACKED!  Dinner, Monday? Packed!! The service did not fail, though.  Excellent service. Im so glad to have tried this place.. . Happy ending?  The price - what a deal!
