Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
OVERATED I like my pastrami super "gristly", juicy, peppery and smokey flavored. The pastrami at Johnnies decent at best. It tasted like pastrami if I were to order it at Subway. I prefer Canter's, The Hat, Busy Bee's, Bay Cities Deli or EVEN Togos! I love me some good pickles to compliment a pastrami sandwich, but Johnnie's pickles were NASTY. They were cut into chunks and were really soft. WTF?! I like pickles when they're cut the long way and most importantly, when they are crispy. The skimpy portion of LARGE crispy crinkle cut fries were the only bright spot on my plate.. . Oh yea, did I forget to mention that Johnnies' is really expensive and that they dont take credit cards? WTF!! A pastrami plate was $22.50 (ATM Fees + tip included) to get skimped on fries... FML. . The best part of the meal was getting out of the office to eat outdoors with my ninjas.
