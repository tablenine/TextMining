Honestly, the only good thing about this place is its decoration and location; it's on top of a hill with a gorgeous view of the city. . . I had been wanting to visit this restaurant just because of its gorgeous view. I went on a date here as a belated birthday event, and our table was ready when I arrived. The table was right by the window with a beautiful view that overlooked LA's city lights. . . For an appetizer I had the Darth Vader Roll (vegetables, spicy tuna, and black rice). The black rice gives away its "Darth Vader" look. Any way, it was okay but not anything special. For my entree I had the Loch Duart Miso Salmon, worse decision I ever made. The salmon was drenched with lemon sauce as well as the mashed potatoes. There was so much lemon, that I didn't even finish it, and left the restaurant with an almost empty tummy. As a nice birthday treat, they came out with a small petite dessert of a wafer with cream and a dark chocolate stick with "Happy Birthday" written with white chocolate, (candle too). For dessert we ordered the White Chocolate-Mint Ice Cream Profiterole, which was probably the best thing I ate there. . . Overall, I give one star for service, and another for the beautiful view. Other than that, I don't recommend coming here for a meal. If anything, come here for a drink and dessert.
