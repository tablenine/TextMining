Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
I'd best describe this place as "fun"!. . I went during a very quiet time... my sister had some "business" to handle across the street, and I didn't care to join, so I strolled over to Delves, sat alone for a party of one at the sushi bar, chatting it up with the chefs, drinking martinis and enjoying a few pieces of sashimi.. . The staff is very friendly, they have a fun variety of drinks (a favorite was the mix of sake with bailey's), and the sushi is fantastic too.. . As far as the ambiance goes, I wouldn't necessarily describe it as "classy", but I think they try to make it more fun and friendly than impressive,  which is kind of nice. I don't  always want the snooty atmosphere, and this is definitely a place to go when you want to let your hair down without sacrificing a quality!!. . I will say...reserve tables if you're planning a party. The sush' bar is nearly always open/free but tables are hard to get as this place is *huge* on b-day parties . . I think they perform and do karaoke too...which gets an extra star on my "fun scale" :)
