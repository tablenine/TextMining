Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I was introduce to Joan's On Third from a friend for a quick bite. My quicky two cents, Pros: Great yummy tasty food, The french baquette is perfect (crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and not doughy), Lots of choices for a sandwich shop, Lots of veggie sides and salad selections. The Cons: Service a bit slow, Not enough seating area, A bit of a snooty factor here for a sandwich shop and the price is a wee bit high. Would I come back again? Yes I would.
