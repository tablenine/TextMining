Small market with fun and delicious, albeit expensive, snacks, cheeses, etc. The meatloaf sandwich is their most popular dish and it was pretty good. Much more filling that it appears. Not amazing, but a solid, unique, sandwich with some really nice flavors. Try the green bean salad as a side! It's super flavorful and delicious!
