Came here for restaurant week.. It was a great deal and we just couldn't pass it up!  I got the delmonico steak..I think..and one of my friends did too, except hers had a ton of fat in it..and as soon as she asked the server "Is this supposed to have this much fat on it?"  He apologized profusely and brought out another steak for her.  2 of my friends got the lobster bisque, which I heard was phenom, and I got the wedge salad..who doesn't love a good wedge salad?  Dessert came too, which was whatever..dessert is dessert (unless you go to Sweet Mandy B's for a cupcake, then it's heaven).  Although everything was really great, and the guy replaced my friend's steak immediately..everything else was just really sloooooooooooowwwww..and it took forever to get the server's attention at times.  So that's the only reason they're getting docked 1 star.  I'm sure he was prob just sick of all the Restaurant Week patrons. hah
