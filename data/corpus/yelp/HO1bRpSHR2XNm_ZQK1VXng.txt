Went here a few times with my family. The dim sum is alright, but the regular dishes are nothing special. Last time I came here, we ordered two lobsters (black bean and green onion), pepper beef, some sort of seafood and vegetable dish, pork, and green beans. The lobsters were fine...everything else was less satisfactory. I get that it's pepper beef, but that means it's beef with a bit of pepper, not pepper with a bit of beef--there was far too much pepper. I was guzzling water like crazy after trying that dish.. . The pork was your typical Chinese pork and was okay, but the green beans supposedly were flavorless (I didn't try them myself, having been put off by my family's negative comments) and the seafood and vegetable dish had so little seafood it was practically a misleading name. That dish was particularly expensive too.. . The cheap lobster special makes this place a nice one-time thing, but I won't be coming back.
