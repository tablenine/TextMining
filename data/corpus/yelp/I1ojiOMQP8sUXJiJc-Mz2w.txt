Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
When you come in, you'll notice that the shrimp and fish are precooked and sitting on a rack. I don't know if it's always like this, but it was the case when we came here. When you order, they reheat it by throwing it into the fryer. What my dad and I got was a soggy, oily, mushy mess in our tortillas. No amount of salsa could help a fish or shrimp taco recover from that kind of hot mess.. . Somewhere in Ensenada, the best fish taco is rolling over in its grave and crying tears of sadness because this place is giving it a bad name.
