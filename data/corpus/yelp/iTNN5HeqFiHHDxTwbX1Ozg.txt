Picture this, Uncommon Ground, last Sunday.... . So I come in and figured I would get some work done on my laptop, use the wifi, have a laid back late lunch. Tons of servers there, none of which could fix the wifi problem that they all apparantly are aware of. This point would be moot if they didn't advertise it as a feature of the place. The food itself is delicious, but the prices are on the high side - Â burger, soda, tax, tip - you are looking at almost 18 bucks.
