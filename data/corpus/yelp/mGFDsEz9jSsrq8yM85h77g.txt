I love Lala's! The food is great and reasonably priced. Every time I go I always order the chicken a la provenzal. I can't help! I love garlic and if something comes completely smothered in garlic it's impossible for me to resist! So try it! its good. . I've also tried the chicken al champignon and a la cebolla. Both are also really really good but I always go back to my garlic drenched chicken. MMmm garlic!. Boyfriend always orders the chicken picante. I still prefer the others I've tried over this. He also likes the steak milanesa which is also pretty yummy. . I've order the ensalada con entrana (take out) for my mom. She really liked it which surprises me because she never likes what I give her. I want to try this next time but I'll probably end up ordering my garlic covered chicken.. Lala's sangrias are pretty good too.
