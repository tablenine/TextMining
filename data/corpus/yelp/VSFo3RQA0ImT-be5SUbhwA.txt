I'll be as brief as I can about the most hyped restaurant of the season. . . Good crunchy and chewy crust. Toppings familiar to sophisticated American palates and down home Italian ones. Others patrons might be wowed. I had the daily special - wild nettle pizza. Started with chicken liver crostini. Would order both again. ;-). . Great to drop in at slightly off hours, but I can't really see myself chasing reservations. After all, Â it's just pizza. Very good pizza.
