Restaurant: Shopsin&#39;s
Category: Diners
I love a restaurant with a personality and Shopsin's has personality in spades. From the massive menu to the redonkulous hot sauce to the inevitability of waiting in line for a table (there are only 6) to Kenny Shopsin keeping a watchful eye on the place. It's a little overpriced, especially considering its cash only, but that's a minor quibble. This is the kind of place that could only exist in downtown New York and I love it for that. I also love it for blisters on my sisters.
