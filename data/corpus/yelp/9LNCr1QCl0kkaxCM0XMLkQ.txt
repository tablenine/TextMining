This place was really good - excellent friendly staff.  Gloria was really nice.  Great food on the cheap too.. . Maybe i didn't read the reviews or summary better but I didn't take notice that they don't have a full bar and have very limited wine selection.   not a problem for me, but the wife was non-plus'd.   Kind of a deal breaker for her.  . . If you can deal with just beer and live no more than 15 to 20 mins from this place give it a go.
