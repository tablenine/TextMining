Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I like Pinks. Why? Not so much because I even remember what the hot dogs taste like. Every time I've been there, it was our last stop post-crawl before hitting the sack. For real...the dogs are pretty good and there is a variety. . . Pinks is an L.A. institution. People whine that it's a tourist trap; blah, blah, blah. The entire city of L.A. is a tourist trap. So what? The best time to go there and hang with other Angelinos is LATE/EARLY depending on your plane of existence.. . My friend swears that Pinks manages the line in order to create the perception that the place is bursting. Â Sure enough if you stand there and watch, the line consistently cuts off at the driveway down the sreet and stays that way all night. Am I crazy?. . If you like Pinks...when you're in NYC, try Gray's Papaya...YUM!
