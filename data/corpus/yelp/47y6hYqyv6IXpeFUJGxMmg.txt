I finally caught the Kogi truck on the 3rd attempt. The first time at UCLA was way too many people and the second time was a little bit too late. The truck was basically across the street outside my apartment this afternoon so I have no excuse not to try it. . . I ordered spicy pork taco and short rib burrito. The spicy pork taco was great. The meat is tender and flavorful with all the pickled veggie and cabbages. However, I was very disappointed with my short rib burrito. It's way too soggy inside. I had to bring it home and get a fork and knife. . . I may give them a second try on the short rib taco next time. I am very sure that I will not become addicted to their tacos though. Just an occasionally treat when they stop by my neighborhood.
