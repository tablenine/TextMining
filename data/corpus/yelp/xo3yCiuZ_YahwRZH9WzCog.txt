Lots of good beer on tap. Great to see a place with multiple beers from Stone Brewery, one of my favorites. Excellent place to go for lunch, the specials are pretty good. 1/2 Sandwich, and Salad or Soup. The club is my favorite, but everyone always enjoyed their lunch. I've never been there with less than eight people, and they always accommodate us, even if we don't have a reservation.
