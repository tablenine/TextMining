Murakami exhibit and then ramen, how can you go wrong?  We waited for 30 min, but my friends loved it and said it was worth the wait.  The japanese host was very polite and vocal in his words even though it was past 8pm on a sunday and people kept on coming in.  (Even though they had a HUGE sign on a chair that said "CLOSED")  Is everyone in l.a. illiterate?  He even rode his skateboard home.  Awesome!
