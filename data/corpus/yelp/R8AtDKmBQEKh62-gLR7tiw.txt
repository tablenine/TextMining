A couple reasons why 3 stars:. Food was good- some great:. Beet salad- 2 stars. risotto- 3 stars. butter- sage chestnut filled raviolis- 4 stars. black linguine w-clams and peas- 4.5 stars. Pomegranate martini- 4 stars. organic lychee martinis 5 stars. wine and beer selection 4.5 stars. Japanese sweet potato dessert 5.5 stars- out of this world - sparkle sparkle yum yum- can't stop thinking abt it!. . service: 1 star. . I arrived early for my reservation (grant it 2 hours early which really changes the reservation) and the young- female host was an absolute, rude ...*#%^. . . She promptly informed me- there would be no tables for the rest of the evening.  At that moment- a man acting as a host- assured me in 10 minutes they would have a table.. . No problem- off to the bar (bartenders were cordial and prompt) for a much needed drink.. . People were eating at the bar and I was tired of waiting for a table so I informed the host 40 minutes later that I was going to eat at the bar and before I could get the information out she non-politely told me that they were @ full capacity for the evening and would not be able to seat me. . I told her that was fine and that I would order at the bar- and she told me I was not able to dine at the bar???. WTF???  I ignored her and did anyway.... . Food is lovely and I will return but there is no excuse for having an ill mannered, non friendly, graceless host at such an elegant restaurant.
