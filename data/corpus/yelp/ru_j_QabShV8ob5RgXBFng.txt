This place is SUPER packed!  We had to wait a good 20 min or so just to valet my car!  We didn't have any reservations so we just grabbed a glass of wine at the bar.  After about another 20 min or so we were seated at the preparation counter where we were able to watch the chefs prepare the dishes.  . . Atmosphere:. Casual but upscale and a very relaxed environment.  Dark furniture and nice lighting.. . Portions: on the smaller side but each dish was quite unique.. . Appetizer:. Burrata with bacon: This was a stacked dish where the burrata, bacon, caramelized shallots, and marinated escarole were on top of each other.  This one was quite unique.  I thought the escarole kinda overpowered the rest of the ingredients with it's pickled taste but it wasn't bad.  I guess I am too much of a burrata/mozzarella fan that I prefer to taste that instead.. . Primi:. Gnocchi with oxtail: This was nicely made.  The small doughy balls of gnocchi tasted very nicely with the oxtail that seemed braised.  The sauce was very mild in taste and not greasy.. . Secondi:. Grilled oxtail: this was very tender and the caramelized crust was very good.. . I always loved Batali's cooking and this place is a great place to sample his work.  I had a great dining experience here.. . Cost:. 1 appetizer from the mozzarella bar, 1 primi, 1 secondi, and 4 glasses of wine for dinner for two: about $100 per person.
