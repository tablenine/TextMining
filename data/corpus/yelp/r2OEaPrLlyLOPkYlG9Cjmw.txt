Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Great dumpling house!  They're made fresh on site (which you can't say for every restaurant).  They're always hot, juicy and delicious.  And if you have little kids waiting with you they may like watching the cooks make the dumplings through the window to the kitchen.  . . Be wary:  you'll end up ordering way more than your stomach can handle.  But the full feeling in your stomach as you roll yourself to your car is totally worth it.. . The atmosphere is very casual and relaxed. . . My advice:  get there 20-30 minutes before the restaurant opens because you'll get a table right away.  Plus, waiting 20 minutes is better than waiting the hour you'll end up waiting if you get there any later.
