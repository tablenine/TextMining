Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pinks is a Hollywood icon, and people gather here like an adult porn convention. The lines can be ridiculously long, and all people talk about is what type of weenier they're going to eat, which can be annoying if you standing next to a guy :P . . My favorite dog is the Huell (Howser) dog, which is a double hot dog in a single bun, with chili cheese and mustard.  I've have eaten two in one sitting.  :P. . Always a So-Cal favorite.
