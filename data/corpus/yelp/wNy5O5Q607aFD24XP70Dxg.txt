not sure if it was amazing because i hadn't eaten breakfast and had been "greening" a park all morning or because it was brobdingnagedly sized and i doused it with black pepper and parm, but it was seriously malicious. as in wickedly delicious. . . word to your mother: eat it while it's hot bc the novelty blows away with the steam.
