I came here when the place first opened and was debating whether to come back since my salad was a little wilty.  But my cousin and I came here for brunch today and I was impressed.  The decor is very cute and cozy..I especially like the brick and custom artwork on the walls. The bread and olive tapenade was delicious (but the waiter didn't give us any small plates to eat off of).  I had the St. Petersburg Scramble and my cousin had the Veggiewich.  Both were good, but her bread was a little soggy and my eggs were a little wet.  Overall, the food was pretty good.  My latte was delicious...creamy and smooth.  The service was also friendly and attentive.
