You pple write WAY too much.. . 1. This is buffet meat. . . 2. This is the Costco of cooked meat.. . 3. This is cooked meat done dim sum style without the grumpy old Asian ladies. . . 4. This is not exactly quality meat. Edible yes. Quality no.. . 5. Otherwise service is good and decent place for hanging out with friends.
