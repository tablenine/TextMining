Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So I took my bro here since he is from out of town. There was a short line b/c we came mid afternoon. I ordered the polish dog which was good but not like mouth watering good. I could go to costco and get those hot links which are more yummy imo. Bro got some fancy named polish dog that came with mushrooms and nacho cheese on top. He liked it. I dunno this place is pretty expensive for some hot dogs. But I guess go there and try to say that you have been there and done that.
