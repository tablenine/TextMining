Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
I snuck up to Joy's on Saturday afternoon for a late, solo lunch.  Quite good.  Since it was my first time in the place, I did my litmus test and ordered chicken pad Thai.  It was very tasty.  The sauce was better than the sauce at my usual Thai place, Bamee, but I think I prefer the Pad sans cabbage, ala Bamee Noodle.  Good quick service and pleasant atmosphere, despite the incipient Trixie behind me, reading out load the menu items to her party, ala Chris Farley Zagats skit from SNL.  I love the Trixies and I don't judge, but when you make your dinner conversation too loud, you've crossed a line with me.
