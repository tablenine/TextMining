come my lady. come come my lady. you're my BUTTERFLY. sugar. baby.. whoaaaa flashbacks of the late '90s!. . Okay let's get down to biznass. Butterfly offers cheap cheap cheap sushi rolls and BYOB! I've only had their maki rolls but they satisfied and I got my sushi roll fix. We shared the ebi temp, crunchy spicy tuna, philly maki and summer over a bottle of wine. I'll be returning to try some more maki rolls and perhaps some fresh nigiri.
