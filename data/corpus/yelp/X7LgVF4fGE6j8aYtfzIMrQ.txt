food was great.  it is a rather romantic spot, although at the place we were sitting was not the most romantic of seating arrangements....he was across the table and there was no way he could sit right next to me, and the other couples were very close by.  the evening turned hysterical as we listened to what seemed to be a first-date (but after a few drinks) conversation of a couple two tables over.
