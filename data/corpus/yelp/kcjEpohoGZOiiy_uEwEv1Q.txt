Somewhere out there, I know there's a better French dipped sandwich but I'm compelled to say Philippe's French dip sandwich is the best. Â It's been programmed to my system much like McDonald's French fries. . . Last year, Philippe's celebrated its 100th year. It's easy to understand why. I did not grow up eating at Philippe's but there's something very comforting about having a meal of beef sandwich + coleslaw and lemonade on one of their communal tables. Philippe's is an LA institution and I'm rooting for another 100 years. And more.
