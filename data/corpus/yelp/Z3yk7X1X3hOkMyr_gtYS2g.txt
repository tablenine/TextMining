I don't think this place needs anymore good reviews.  The 373 reviews it already has should really be evidence enough that this place is QUALITY!  I never knew such simple foods and simple flavors could be so delicious.  This place really is a testament to how the freshest food makes the best food.  If you know food, you'll know this place uses only the fresh stuff.  . . I'll admit the flank steak salad is overrated.  I was not a fan of big leafs of lettuce with just some sour bland dressing.  I think i actually prefer their sandwiches to their salads.  The ciabatta bread is grilled and soft, they use some creamy slightly tangy smear/sauce and the roasted red bell peppers are so sweet.  Whatever meat you choose will be delicious.  I do enjoy their daily specials as well.  Keeps things different.  Try their mint lemonade for something cool and refreshing.  Don't expect a sugary sweet lemonade, its more on the tart side.. . Go here if you like your food light but satisfying. The surrounding area looks pretty hip and happening too.
