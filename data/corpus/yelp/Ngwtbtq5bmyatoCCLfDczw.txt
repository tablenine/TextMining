Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Mehhhhh, not so good..... The first thing I see when I walked in here with some buddies of mine after work, is some hipster white guy working the front/ waiting the tables. NOT AUTHENTIC. Now, trying not to be judgmental (since white hipsters like authentic noodles too) we still decide to eat here. . . Okay, so it was probably my fault that I didn't enjoy the meal because I ordered the ramen with Salt soup base. There was definitely no lack of MSG in the soup because I felt so thirsty after the meal and for days after... The noodles also weren't even really ramen noodles. And what's with the addition of char sui ? Isn't char sui Chinese, not Japanese?. . Totally unimpressed. And the spicy noodle challenge thing only adds to the gimmicky-ness of the place. If you want good ramen, suck it up and go wait in line at Daikokuya!
