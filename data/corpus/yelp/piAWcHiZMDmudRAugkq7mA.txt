Restaurant: No Mas Cantina
Category: Mexican
I petition to change the name to 'sí mas'!  Love this place, and the wonderful story that goes with it.  No Mas is perfect for Cabbage-town, and I deliver serious props to the businesses that are working through the transition of this in-limbo neighborhood.. . The food is sublime, service is warm, and the interior is large, open and interesting.  I have been involved in numerous corporate group events here, and they have always been extremely accommodating and quality has never suffered - so I would highly recommend it on that front as well.. . Make sure to venture into the attached retail store after your meal to do some shopping, that is if you didn't spot anything in the dining room that caught your eye - because, everything that the restaurant is furnished with is up for sale - cool concept.
