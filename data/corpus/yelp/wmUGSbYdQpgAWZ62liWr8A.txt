Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
tonight we were craving some good ole pho so when we read the reviews we had to check it out.. . first off, it's hard to find because there isn't a sign that says "pho cafe" but what you can see is a small brightly lit restaurant slammed with folks eating and slurping away. the restaurant is a long row of tables and like i said some brightly lit contemporary style lighting. Packed with the hipster crowd of silverlake but i tell you it's kind  of refreshing to be immersed than in the "ed hardy wearing west hollywood folks" (as my girlfriend put it). so we felt at home there.. . the food was great too. the menu simple but being a vietnamese food fan  it was yummy. don't expect any type of fine dining here. no romantic lighting and you are sitting so close to your fellow pho lovers that you can feel the heat coming off their bowls. this is a place purely for the pho enthusiast who want to be served good quality food for affordable prices and really quick and efficient service!! oh remember it's cash only so go to that atm.. . we give it two thumbs up! just be prepared for it to be slammed but it usually goes quick so no worries!
