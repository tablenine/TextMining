What i always get when i go to Porto's: . . Potato Balls™ . . and . . Cheese Rolls™. . Haha i can't believe they trademarked the names (also trademarked: Refugiado™ - guava &amp; cheese pastry)...but they are THAT good. Don't forget to ask for Tapatio for your Potato Balls™!. . They have other stuff (cakes, cookies, tarts, pastries, coffee, sandwiches, etc. etc.) but I rarely venture from the aforementioned goodies. I did just try the Papa Preparada sandwich tonight because it features Potato Balls™ (also included are swiss cheese, mayonnaise, mustard, lettuce, and tomato on Cuban bread) and it was yummy. I've heard good things about their other sandwiches as well... and my friend likes the Dulce de Leche coffee.. . Metered parking along Brand and in the back... meters run til 10 so be prepared! Apparently there's a free garage on the next block but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to fully explore the parking sitch tonight.
