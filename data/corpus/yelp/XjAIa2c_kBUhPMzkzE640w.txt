Category: American (Traditional)
So I ended up at this place tonight after me and my friend went to a play and she was telling me about some of her latenight spots. I had passed The Vortex b4 and new they had a parking lot (YES!!!) so I said why don't we go there since you said they "supposedly" have the best burgers in town........ . we got there around 11:15 which we were soo freakin lucky because the kitchen was just about to close.... I ordered a bacon burger (since they are famous for them) and my friend ordered the tots with chili and bacon. The sweet tea was not to my liking...ugh...but the burger was good...i wouldn't say the best in atlanta but it was coo.....It was Tuesday Trivia night but they were putting everything up by the time I we got there. Its really kinda small to me....it was packed......but its a nice crowd...I enjoyed myself and the scary skull decorations...I think i'll go there for my latenight cravings.......chill and reasonable.....:)
