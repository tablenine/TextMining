After hearing about their famous pastrami sandwich, I'd been wanting to try this place for a while. My bf and I went right after peak lunch hours so the place was pretty empty and we found meter parking right in front! Woohoo! The place was a lot bigger than I expected and had an old classy feel to it, especially because of all the dark brown leather booths.. . I ordered their most popular #19: a pastrami sandwich on rye bread with coleslaw, swiss cheese, and a pickle on the side. The sandwich was pretty good... but REALLY good when I added the spicy mustard on it! If you don't see the bottle on your table, ask your server for it! It gave the sandwich the perfect kick and made it taste sooo much better. The pickle was also cold, crunchy, and complemented the sandwich perfectly. I also got a side of macaroni salad which was just okay. My bf got a side of fries which were surprisingly really good! Golden ridges, slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside...so good that I didn't even need to use ketchup! :). . Overall, definitely the best pastrami sandwich I've had, but then again I haven't had too many in my lifetime. But the reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it's a tad pricey for what it is. It was about $13 for just the sandwich.
