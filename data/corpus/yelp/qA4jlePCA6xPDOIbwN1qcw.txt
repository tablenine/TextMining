i've never heard of philippe before until i was done eating.. i was told this place was famous and rated high, etc etc.. . i too, must be missing something from this place.  yes, i thought the buck-fifty pickle was tasty but what was so good about their famous french dip?  we asked for double dip, but i don't know- i could say it isn't as great as i was told it was.
