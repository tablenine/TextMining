Amazing meal last night for my birthday.  The ingredients are so fresh and high quality that the flavor explodes with each bite.  The delightful servers and staff saw that every moment of our meal was perfection.  OK.  I'm uploading a picture of our desserts.  Just don't make fun of the decadence.  They are wonderful.
