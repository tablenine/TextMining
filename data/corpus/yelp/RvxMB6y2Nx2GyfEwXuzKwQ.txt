This is a lilttle hidden secret in Atlanta located off Howell Mill. They serve breakfast all day on the weekends and its very tasty. The banana bread french toast is especially good. The specials of the day are never disappointing. The servers are friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back. There are comfy chairs and books to read when the lines get long on the weekends but It's definitely worth the wait.
