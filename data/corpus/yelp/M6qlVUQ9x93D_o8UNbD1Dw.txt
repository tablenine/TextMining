Restaurant: Bone&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Steakhouses
I had not been to Bone's in many years....it is a "special occasion" type place for my pocketbook. Our family had a celebration dinner there on Saturday and Bone's did not disappoint. It is by far, the best steak restaurant in Atlanta. My filet was super flavorable,cooked perfectly, and I could cut it with a butter knife! Our group shared the asparagus, spinach and grit fritters.........all were delicious and the portions were plentiful. I skipped an appetizer to leave room for the fabulous steak but managed to have room for a few bites of dessert. The key lime pie was the real thing--smooth and creamy with a tart taste.. . Our server was top notch--knowledgable, attentive but not pushy. His wine recommendation was perfect! I have no qualms about giving Bone's 5 stars....it is among Atlanta's top restaurants period.
