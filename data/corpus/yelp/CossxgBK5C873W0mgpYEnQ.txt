Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The prime rib at Lawry's is the BEST.  Not only the prime rib, their salad, Cream Corn &amp; baked potato are delicious.  Join their VIP and you can accumulate the point.  They always have some kind of specials to earn double points.  Once you reach 250 points, you will have a $25 gift certificate.  . . The service is great.  They are always packed, so be sure to plan ahead &amp; make reservation.
