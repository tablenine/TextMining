Oh man do I love it here!. . I don't even care that Dale works here, I don't care that they have a effen/cream soda cocktail.  Let's talk about the food.  Let's talk about the staff (not including Dale from Top Chef). . Everytime I call for a reservation I feel like I calling a friend.  That's sounds lame, but it really is true.  It's real nice, not contrived nice.  The food is real, simple, and to the point.  The flavors of Hawaii come through and its just one of our favorite places to go for a date night.. . I will say that it is normally a tad over budget for me, but for a nice treat (and the bonus of a prie fixe menu), its so worth it.. . I appreciate the love that the chef totally puts into her food and her business.
