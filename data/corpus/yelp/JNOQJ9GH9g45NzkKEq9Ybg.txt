First off, I can understand why this review would get 3/3.5 stars or whatever it got before I clicked on Write a Review.  This one douche, after I left the restaurant,  verbally abused the waitress and kept yelling for the manager.  I should have thrown him in the interior courtyard pond, but 1) I didn't think I was physically able and 2) that interior is too pretty for his ass.. . Anyway, excellent food, appetizers and other tasty things that I could show my family from out-of-town in a "so-LA" setting overlooking a smoggy ol' sunset.
