This is my first yelp $$$$ category review... Normally I am a El Chato taco truck type of guy or a $$ restaurant type of guy when I take out my gf cus I honestly don't think dropping huge cash on food makes sense when I could get 2 nice dinners usually for the price of just one at a restaurant like Mozza..... . BUT... this place was WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!. . WOW... That is all I got to say.... . I made a reservation ONLINE the day of, and the only time available was 5:45 pm. Since it was so early, we ended up getting there 25 minutes late so we decided to sit at the bar instead which was an EXCELLENT and BETTER choice.... . $35 3 COURSE BAR MENU!!!!. . - you get a FREE glass of GOOD WINE. - You get to pick ANY 1 item from the mozzarella bar. - you get to pick ANY 1 pasta entre. - you get to pick ANY 1 desert item!!!. . All for only $35 BUCKS!. . The buffala mozzarella bacon dish i got was OUT OF THIS WORLD... absoulte PERFECTION. . The goat cheese ravioli I got was STRAIGHT UP RIDICULOUS!!!. . The canoli desert (one caramel, one espresso, one chocolate) was INCREDIBLE. . I am a CRAZY foodie and LITTERALLY, the BEST damn restaurant I have EVER been to... The food was so damn perfect in every way, for every dish, that I honestly thought I was residual STONED or something because my taste buds were firing off on all cylinders for like an hour and a half straight no matter what i put in my mouth.... . Chef Mario Batali, you are a f'in PIMP. . For two 3-course meals with Â glasses of wine + an extra glass of wine ($8) for me, the total before tax was $78 for my date and I.. . Again, even if you are on a tight budget and normally go to $$ restaurants, this shit is WORTH EVERY PENNY.... . Sit at the lovely bar, get the whole culinary experience with the 3 course $35 deal... You will save some cash and you will get to experience all Chef Mario has to offer.... . Tip: Park on street right out front at 6 PM with meters and save $10 off the crappy rip-off valet. . I WILL BECOME A REGULAR HERE because the flavors were that good... I have been to litterally thousands of restaurants of all different types, and this was NUMBER ONE!. . Oh ya... service was IMPECCABLE as well... you got some professional non-snooty service here... I am only in my lower 20's and was treated no different than the rich old dudes that also dine here
