Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
This restaurant is currently the only "must-hit" place on my list when I go back to visit Chicago. I somehow managed to spend four years in the city without ever eating in this part of town. (Darn that Hyde Park bubble!) I suppose my Korean-American friends didn't think I'd be down to try it... or, knowing me back then, I could have just been in one of my moods. Sigh.. . It was five years later and my best friend, Hyemin, must have finally realized that I was ready for Chicago-style Korean. In a way, I'm glad I didn't find out about it until then -- I would have easily gained about 20 lbs. because this would have become the go-to spot for dinners with my fraternity brothers. Most def.. . We arrived at an odd hour, somehow avoiding the lunch and dinner rushes which meant good service. . . I let Hyemin do all the ordering. I think we got chadolbaegi. Mmm, meat. Then more meat. Then the "leftover" meat is turned into a fried rice dish that we all proceeded to devour. Wait, weren't we all "full" just 5 minutes ago?! Rice swimming in rich, fatty meat drippings--can't I just call it dessert?
