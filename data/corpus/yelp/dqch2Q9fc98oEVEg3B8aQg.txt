First and foremost, to call this place a glorified bibimbap joint is a complete injustice. It's more than a bibimbap. I know Roy Choi (owner and chef) is just trying to be modest when he calls his bowls "peasant food". There are complexities both texture and flavors that bring these bowls into the fine-dining stratosphere. . . My buddies and I all tried the chubby pork belly bowl and it was delicious. The pork was clearly the highlight of the dish, which was perfectly marinated and cooked. I loved how the spice was not over-powering but came in spurts, from the few pieces of chile that were scattered throughout the bowl. The textures were ridiculous! From the toasted nuts, shaved asparagus and the pickled raddishes (YUM!), they were all complimentary to the rich and succulent pork. And at $8?! What a bargain! And unless you're a bear, you will get full with one bowl.. . The reason why I can't give 5-stars is the appetizer. We had the cheesy gooey fries and it really didn't belong on the menu, IMO. It was just french fries topped with a citrusy thousand island and melted cheese. Don't get me wrong. It was really good but it didn't go well with our rice bowls. It belonged in a brewpub's menu, not Chego's.. . Definitely a fan. Will come back.
