Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This place is quality. They give you several choices to choose from on how to make your ramen, heavy soup base, oily, spicy, and etc. The downside here is that the popularity of this place is fairly huge. And since it's a small restaurant, the wait to eat is pretty big.. . This place is at its best when you come here after snowboarding, the food tastes even better when you're tired. :)
