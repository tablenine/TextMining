THE best hamburger I have ever eaten. Also the most expensive burger I have ever eaten, but it's made with a real steak, not just ground beef. The T-Bone is unbelievable. I've been here a few times, I also tried the tri-slider sampler, which was interesting, I can't remember what the 3 burgers were now. The fries sampler is huge but tasty, and comes with interesting sauces like chipotle aioli. But just come here and get one of the steak burgers.
