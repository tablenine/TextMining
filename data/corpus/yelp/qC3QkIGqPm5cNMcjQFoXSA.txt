The Grange has some real tough competition to battle with in Decatur. Although it has the advantage of the lovely outdoor patio and a decent amount of space indoors, The Grange would never be my top choice for a night out in Decatur. It's nice to be able to count on ample seating, a laid back atmosphere and a decent sized beer selection, but what really makes or breaks the Grange in my opinion is the food. Compared to its neighbors, the food at the Grange is pretty mediocre -- and a night out with friends and beer is oh-so-much better with a few good eats. There's a nice selection of options, but I've often felt I paid too much for rather unremarkable food.
