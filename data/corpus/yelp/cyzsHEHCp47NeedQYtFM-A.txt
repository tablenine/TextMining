Cool!  Santullo's has actually IMPROVED!  It seems to me that they either 1) have new management, or 2) stopped using heroin.  Santullo's now uses a clear ordering protocol, with signs explaining to you where to order, and the cook/prep person gets your order right the first time and actually hollers out to you when it's ready.   The cook on my last visit was a nice clean gal who was articulate and not on the nod.  Wow, I really did not have faith that the junkies and scumbags of yore could get their shit together.  Even if they all just OD'd and got replaced by people who remember where they are and aren't covered in oozing facial wounds, I am happy that Santullo's is back on track and I will definitely be going back regularly.  Portobello mushroom pizza, here I come!
