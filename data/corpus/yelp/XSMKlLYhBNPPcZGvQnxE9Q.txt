We both tried their $15 all-you-can-eat. There're salad, shrimp dumpling, California roll sushi, tangerine ribs, pork pot-sticker, beef satay, and chicken wings. Among them, we like beef satay and chicken wings the most. We were not too crazy about the ribs.. . Service was pretty good, we ordered two more plates of beef satay, which each has two skewers of beef, the third time we ordered they only gave us one. We got the hint. ^_^. Ambiance was quite nice actually when it gets darker, noise was acceptable. . . Somebody sitting next to our table ordered some fish dish and the smell of fish oil was so strong it sticked to our clothes and we could still smell it when we got home.. . For those of you interested in their $15 AYCE Dim Sum, it's every Sunday 5 - 9pm, they also have $10 AYCE Sushi Monday to Friday 11:30am - 4pm. You should call ahead to make sure they still have the promotions.
