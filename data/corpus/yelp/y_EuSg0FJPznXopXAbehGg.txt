If you want to eat a lot of meat, then this is the place for you. The price for the meat and salad(?) buffet is $50 and my brother Â and I went here recently because we had a buy one get one free coupon. . . The salad bar was underwhelming. The only great thing about it was that they had oysters...the meat was good, some of it was overcooked, but thank god they don't charge a fee for leftovers lol. People have raved to me about the garlic steak, but it tasted bland and not garlicky. Must have gone on an off night? I must say that the lamb was flavorful and juicy!. . If you want to check this place out, I would look in your neighborhood savings coupon book. Oh, and they gave us a $25 gift card for filling out a survey at the end of dinner.. . If you're looking for a really good ambience and atmosphere and a larger salad/appetizer buffet, I would check out Zed 451. Again, some of the meats on the menu are "meh" but they have an awesome harvest table and also serve fish too.
