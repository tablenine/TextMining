This place is truly a gem! Great ambiance with an excellent selection of homemade shochu. The menu is charming with drawings in a flip book. Food is delicately prepared with a nice presentation. The pork belly topped with cilantro blew me away!! Really does melt in your mouth. Also had the party bomb, uni/salmon, and the mini hangar steak. Very creative and artistic sushi. Too bad the otoro and chutoro roll was out so I will have to come back. Billyburg is looking up in the restaurant biz.
