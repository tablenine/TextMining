Came here with 3 guy friends and ordered a Eyes Wide Shut (I believe that's the name) Pancake, that has a chocolate chip and a shot of espresso. The 3 other people ordered Oreo French Toast, another Pancake from the list, and a regular order of Omelette dish. . . Those who ordered Pancakes and French Toasts, were definitely TOAST!!! It's way too sweet... I mean geeze, after a few bites I can't even take it anymore, it's way way way too sweet... I didn't try the French Toast, but I heard the complain on it... Only the Omelette person finished his dish. As for us, yeah we took it to go, but once it's in the box, we couldn't imagine putting those into our stomach. I'd keep thinking if I put that one more bite into my mouth, I'd soon die of diabetes. Lesson learned? If you're not a fan of sweet or sugary stuff, don't order them!!!. . The waiting was crazy too, 45minutes on SAturday morning at 11.30am... compared to what Shauna D, we're still better, but food-wise, nah uh. My cousin told me though the french toast is actually good, so I would still come back to give it a try. . . Parking here is always sucks, can't help it, but I heard there's parking in the back, which I didn't see, so next time I come back, I'd check it out. Price wise, I think it's decent, but because of those crazy sweet food, we had to get out of there and get something salty to balance it, so off we went to the dim sum place in downtown, that still served them until 2.30pm.
