BAKERY is by far the BEST..coookies, muffins, cupcakes, cakes, croissants...drooool...drrrroool...drrooool.. my favorite cakes-tiramisu, red velvet and of course Tres Leches..yummy!. This place is alwaysss packed..I work right down the street but luckily they know I"m a regular and they let me kinda cut in line if I'm only ordering one thing. Â I'm not a big fan of their potato balls I'm not a pork eater..the empanadas are okay..I've had better chicken empanadas elsewhere...the smoothies and coffee drinks are a lil pricey..but the Orange Juice is damn good..also a lil expensive but it is fresh squeezed and very good...My favorite is their Santa Fe CHicken Salad..the cilantro dressing is realllly good.. . Can't go wrong with the bakery..very inexpensive and totally worth it!!. . PROS-Bakery and the workers..very friendly. CONS-long lines buttt worth the wait.
