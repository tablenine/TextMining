Decided to take my friend here for her birthday. It was pretty empty when we arrived. We were seated next to the family with the two crying babies. Hm? lol.. . They gave us a bread basket, which was nice. The bread IN the basket? It was okay.. . I like that they have an ingredient of the month. When I went, it was melons. They had a prix fixe menu based on melons. Pretty cool.. . We were given a random small sample of some tomato, melon, ?,? thing on a spoon. That was yum.. and free(insert heart). . . Shared the mussels &amp; shrimp appetizer. Didn't taste that good. Very plain. Super small. I know it's an appetizer.. but wow, for 13 bucks-ish.. it was for HALF a person. Real talk.. . I got the ginger glazed seared salmon w/edamame puree,truffle teriyaki sauce, &amp; green bean tempura. Hm.. I know it's seared and all, and I guess that's how it's supposed to be made.. but..I don't like my salmon to be raw in the middle. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE raw fish, but when it's WARM+raw.. ew.. tastes almost metal-y. Very small portion. At least the sauce was genius :) . . My friend got one of the specials. I think it was the wagyu steak? I forget. She liked it.. but thought it was the smallest piece of meat she's ever seen. . . Expensive for the very small portions. I wouldn't complain about the portions if it tasted amazing. It did not :(. . I'll give it another try this month.
