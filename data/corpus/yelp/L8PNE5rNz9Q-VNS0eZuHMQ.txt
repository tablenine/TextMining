Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Let's face it--if you are not a fan of seafood, you'll probably find little to impress you at Glenn's. (the diner title is a huge misnomer, this is no greasy spoon!). That said, both my fella and I had the freshest fish of our lives here.  We had scallops for our appetizer, which were HUGE,  fresh, and delicious.  The waiter told us the seafood is imported from Hawaii every night and never more than 36 hours old.  Whether that is factual is a moot point--it tasted amazing.. Prices were high across the board, but again, to be expected for fresh seafood. However, I still balked a little at $19.95 for a slice of fish and a handful of potatoes.  . Still, I cannot believe the freshest seafood I've ever had in the midwest is located right around the corner in my little neighborhood!  We will definitely be going back.. ETA:  Had breakfast here over the weekend and it was amazing!  Cinnamon RedHot pancakes were everything I dreamed they would be!
