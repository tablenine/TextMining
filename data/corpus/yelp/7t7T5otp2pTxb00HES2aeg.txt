It was 8:30 am on a Saturday morning and what was I doing instead of sleeping? Researching places to go to brunch. The brunch spot had to fulfill two criteria: 1) It had to be in Wicker Park/Bucktown and 2) It had to service mimosas. After Yelping, my friend and I decided on Silver Cloud. . . We were literally the first customers in there. I was so thankful they were opening at 10am. Everything on the menu looked so good. It's all comfort food, so how can you NOT want to eat everything? I decided on the biscuits and gravy ($6) and added an order of eggs ($2). Everything on the menu seemed fairly cheap compared to what you might pay at other brunch spots. Oh, also, I noticed that you can substitute egg whites on the omelet for no additional charge! Good to know! . . My meal was fantastic. I was completely stuffed afterwards. The absolute best part was the fact that you can order a mimosas ($7) with MANGO juice instead of orange juice. Plus, they give you mini bottle of champange. Classy! . . Service here is awesome! You get the vibe that everyone is really friendly and the atmosphere is great for catching up with friends.
