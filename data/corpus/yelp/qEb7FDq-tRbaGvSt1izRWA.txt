I liked the place. I was staying at the Empire Hotel with my family and it was right around the corner so we figured what the hell. I loved the guacamole they make at your table (nice and chunky) but the entrees were very average. Let's put it this way, I've had better, especially at their prices. Not cheap. Well at least the $16 marg I ordered was strong!. . Perhaps where they lack in taste, they make up in atmosphere. It is a pretty and trendy Mexican joint. There is definitely an element of street appeal. My family really loved it:) I think its a great place to bring out of towner's!
