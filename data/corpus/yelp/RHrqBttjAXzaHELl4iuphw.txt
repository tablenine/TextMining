like the reviewer below me, i really wish i could give Toast 3.5 stars as well. The food is GOOD. it's not great, but it's GOOD. therefore since the reviewer below me rounded up, i will round down to 3 stars. . . The scene in front of Toast during lunch hour would have you believing this restaurant should be in the 5 star range, however it's not. I'm not sure that it is worth the long wait, and many times have found myself traveling a few mins east on Beverly, to their sister restaurant Lulu's. If you do happen to venture to Toast and manage to find (difficult) parking and nab a table, I would suggest the breakfast/brunch menu over the sandwiches which are good but not spectacular.
