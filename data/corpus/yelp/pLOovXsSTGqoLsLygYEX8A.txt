This place is AMAZING! I've vacationed in Germany before, and by no means am I an expert, but the food here is damn good.  I tried the Aligator and Pork sausage which was flavorful, but a little tough.  The duck and bacon was definitely something I have never tasted before--great flavor and cooked just right.  Now I know this place is all about their sausages, but man, the Belgian fries were BOMB! You can taste that it's cooked in a different type of oil... not sure what kind but I am determined to find out.  The pesto mayo, Thai peanut, and Chipotle ketchup were my favorites. This place is filled with hipsters (as someone else previously mentioned) but screw it, go there with good company and focus on the greatness that is Wurstküche.
