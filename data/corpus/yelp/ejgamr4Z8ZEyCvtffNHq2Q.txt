Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Oh wow, these definitely are the best fish tacos... in Los Angeles. Hardy har har! . . Okay, on a serious note, the fish tacos were amazing, as were the shrimp tacos! :)  Their Horchata was good too.  The guy at the cash register was telling me that this was made the Central American way, and I like it.  It differs in the beans or something that's added, I don't recall.. . The people that work there are great, and so friendly.  I'd definitely recommend eating there.  I love this place.  I got lucky and my meal was on the house!  I will definitely be going back there! :)
