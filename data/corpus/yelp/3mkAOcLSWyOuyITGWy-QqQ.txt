We used to come here a lot for happy hour since we worked nearby, but a couple of us no longer work in the area and just happened to be around so we figured we'd stop by.  It was prime happy hour time and there were no tables available for happy hour, so we waited around for a little bit and a small table opened up, but there was only one chair for two people.  There seemed to be quite a few waiters/waitresses around and we had asked a couple waiters for help on getting another chair, but no one was very helpful!  They both just said there weren't any.  If you've never been to this place, there's three or four sections to this place.  We found the small table in the third section where the pool table is.  I went and looked for a chair and found one (when everyone else I asked said there weren't any) in the last section.  I had to carry the chair over myself, which I didn't think was cool.  Then, it took forever for anyone to come to our table to take our order!  I was not happy!  I had to wave down a waitress to get her attention before happy hour ended.  So after this awful experience, I doubt that I will return.  I do like their happy hour prices and food though (especially their empanadas)...too bad their service sucks ass! =/
