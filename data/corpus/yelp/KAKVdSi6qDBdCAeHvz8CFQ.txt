Stuffed nose. Drugs not working. Spicy. I need spicy. I'm too chicken to order unfamiliar Indian, the Chinese down the street isn't quite what I'm looking for, and I need some comfort. A food hug. One magical little word: Panang. . . Sticky Rice quoted 45-60 minutes and that was no lie, 60 minutes almost on the dot. One order of panang with tofu (yeah, yeah), an extra order of rice and an order of crab rangoon. While I asked for medium spicy, I could have easily gone hotter. Medium was spicy yes, but not the sort of heat I needed to break through this sinus wall in my face. The order of panang was perfect for one person with a little leftover and as it turned out, the extra rice was unnecessary. . . Thai delivery has been letting me down in my 'hood for years. I'm happily bumping Sticky Rice to the tip top of the list. Now all I need is my sense of taste back to sample all the yummy things they have on their menu. . . *Achoo!*. . 'Scuse me.
