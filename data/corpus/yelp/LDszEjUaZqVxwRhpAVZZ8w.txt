Okay I have been to Flash Taco numerous times, so I figured I'd write a frekkin' review on it. Don't you hate when you've had one hell of a night partying but EVERY food place is closed because it's after hours? I know I do, and what's worse is when you're stuck eating at Taco Bell or some other not so great establishment, but FLASH TACO hits the spot. ...smh... If you are in Wicker Park and you haven't been to Flash Taco...well...just....idk....shame on you. Its not soooo soo bad... I do admit the service could be a bit better...and cleaner...but when so many people frequent it during after hours I see how it could get kinda hard to maintain.. . Toodles.
