YUMMMMMM for the garlic noodles! I went there for a birthday dinner. The restaurant was so beautiful but walking on the aquarium was a little scary.  I ordered the special which was the chilean sea bass. I've recently started eating fish and that fish was so delicious! It came with jasmine rice on the side. I would definitely recommend it! My friends got the other special which was frutti de mare? I'm not sure if they enjoyed it as much but they did end up finishing all the lobster and mussel...blech. Also ordered was the halibut and the shaken beef.  They loved both! I'm so excited to open my palate to my sea friends especially at an awesome restaurant like this! The tiramisu was not that popular amongst our crowd but the chocolate lava cake and the creme brulee were practically devoured.  Best birthday dinner ever!
