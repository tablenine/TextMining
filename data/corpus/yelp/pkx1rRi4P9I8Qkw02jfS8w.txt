No bueno...even when baracha.  Okay, I'll admit it, I thought I liked it at the time...it was freezing cold outside and I exposed my hands to the elements so I could gobble down my sope while waiting for the train whilst some drunk girls across the tracks kept yelling to my friends and I that they wanted fries...random.  . . Anyhow, once I had sobered up a bit at my apt I realized the food was bland and the vegetables were very undercooked...kind of had the texture of bark, yuck.  We ended up eating leftover quesadillas that I made earlier that night and they definitely hit the spot.  If you're in the area and craving Mexican, Arturo's on Western is a much better choice.
