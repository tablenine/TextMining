I was excited for Craft Atlanta to open- the NY outpost is a must-hit when I go to Manhattan.  I thought our version lived up to NY for the most part, it lacks a bit in the service-- kind of inexperienced and way over-attentive, it was hard to have a conversation without being interrupted constantly.. . The yellowtail was divine-- half tartare, half sliced, with avocado and orange.  Roasted mushroom assortment was fab.  Short ribs melted apart.  Risotto was nice without being overly heavy.  Braised escarole was a disappointment-- overcooked and way too mushy and without much flavor.. . The pineapple and tarragon sorbet was a great flavor combo and the malt ice cream was nice, without being cloyingly sweet.  The cardamom ice milk was a disappointment-- would have been better as a palate cleanser.. . Overall, the space is nice- I can't wait to go back!
