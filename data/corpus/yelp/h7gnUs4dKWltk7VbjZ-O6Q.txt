Meet up with some of my friends here on a busy Saturday night. The interior was great, loved the decor and the atmosphere. The space was smaller than what I imagined, and was completely packed.. . I would give this place four stars, except for that the service was painfully slow. We saw our server maybe every 30 minutes if we were lucky. Chips took forever to even get to our table, and weren't even that great. By the time our food came out, I was starved. I got the chorizo sandwich, found it spicier than I anticipated in a good way. It had good flavor but I would probably order something else next time. It probably took another hour just to get our check. We were there twice as long as what we would have been, and I felt bad because there were a lot of people waiting to get tables. I'll go here again, but would probably prefer No Mas more.
