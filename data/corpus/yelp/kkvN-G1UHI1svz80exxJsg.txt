I really do like this style of pizza (thin crust, light on sauce).  I've eaten here twice, and both times the pizza was very good.  I like the funghi a lot.  However today I tried the Salmone Marinato and it wasn't anything like what I expected.  Maybe because I'm such a sashimi fan and enjoy fresh fish, I though this would be like raw salmon in a sort of olive oil and garlic marinade.  Instead it was cured.  I've never had cured fish before and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't good either.  The consistency was tough and really chewy.  Another thing that bums me out is the menu is in Italian and there aren't any descriptions of what the appetizers and such are.  So you have to ask the waitress if you want to know.  In our case, when we inquired about the Salmone she didn't know if it was smoked or raw or cooked.  Maybe that should have been a warning.  At any rate, the pizza is good and I'm sure we'll be back again.
