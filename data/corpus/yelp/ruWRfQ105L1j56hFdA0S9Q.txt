although there is no sign on the outside. you cannot miss this place due to the football stadium lighting inside! its almost a little too bright.. BUT... despite the fact you see little spots when you get out into the darkness of a silverlake night, i really can't find any cons about this place. the food is simply amazing and always hits the spot. SUPER fresh ingredients and they have this beer from Taiwan that is to die for. i have never found it anywhere else.
