I was looking for a local spot for a quick and tasty lunch from a place I have never been before. As you can see this place is highly recommended, and I was not disappointed. I had the Todo Italiano, and it was an all around good sandwich. They had an interesting selection of sandwiches, a spicy marinated pork caught my eye. Also, a special board to the right when you walk in. With the side of chips (included in the price) and a bottled iced tea, I walked out with a bill just over 8 dollars.. . The food was great, the price was even better. I will definitely be back to explore the menu.
