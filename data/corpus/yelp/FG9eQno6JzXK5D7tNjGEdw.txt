i always thought this place was fake because its called "the oinkster"  what am i in a 90s sitcom?  i still dont really like the atmosphere or decor, it is creepy.  like the rest of eagle rock.. . if you want to have the worst breath in the universe eat the gross fries with the horsey sauce.  veggie burger is what makes this place.  home made pickles and lots of lettuce.  its good even without cheese.
