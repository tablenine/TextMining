Pretty fabulous. Went for brunch with a friend and we were both so happy that it's small and cozy and the coffee was really good. And they give you crayons and let you draw on the table while you wait for food. It was really fun. I can't handle anything too fussy in the morning, and this was the perfect mix of attentive but not overbearing. So good for them.
