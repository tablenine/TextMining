NOTE: Short Rib taco is the BEST thing on the menu. GET IT and you GUARANTEED will be delighted with the unique combination of tastes.. . TIP: Ask for side of extra "red sauce" and they will give you a whole giant dish for it for FREE. . Other than that - MEH.... Nothing more than hype... + the crappy fact that you have to track these guys down on twitter and deal with crappy metered parking just to find them! The tacos are good and that earns them 2 stars, but they are $2 and are the same size as the authentic mexican tacos at olympic and la brea right at el chato truck where they are only $1... + el chato has free parking in the lot they always are stationed at and you don't have to waste precious time tracking them down on twitter.... . i won't be back unless they come to me or unless i run right into them and i am already walking the streets and don't have too park (aka - not too likely). . Not worth the hassle or the hype or extra money you have to shell out just to eat at this place
