Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
waited in line for like an hour, but what else are you gonna do as a tourist? We took a visit there back in '08.. . Date got the Rosie O'Donnell (chili cheese dog w/ kraut) and I got the huell dog (dbl chili chese dog-1 bun) and the America the beautiful (foot long jalapeno dog with pastrami, bacon lettuce and tomato (hey i stood in line for a fucking hour! I was storved). I was worried that we wouldn't be able to get a table, but we were able to find one. Don't get me wrong, the hot dogs are good, but the snap of the hot dogs were the best part.  But overall, just eat there because it's the touristy thing to do.  say cheese!
