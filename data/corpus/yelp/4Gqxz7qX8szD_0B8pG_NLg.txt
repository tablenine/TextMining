Four stars (maybe 4.5?) for the bakery downstairs, which is open every morning at seven. Tasty pastries, baguettes, coffees, sandwiches. The sandwiches aren't cheap - most are between seven and 12 bucks - but they are super tasty. The croissants wrangle with Bread Garden for "best in town".. . The upstairs is pretty pricy, and my experience was mixed. We had a savory shrimp cheesecake - interesting, but not particularly awesome. For the money, downstairs is the best bet. I'm pretty sure they sell beer downstairs, also, if that floats your boat.
