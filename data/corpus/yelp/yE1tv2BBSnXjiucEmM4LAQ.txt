Not bad, but nothing earth shattering.  Dropped by here on a Friday evening for dinner, and while the space can be a bit cramped, the restaurant had a nice cozy feel to it.. . I ordered the fish tibs with shiro and was somewhat alarmed at how quickly it came out.  Kinda reminded you of a cartoon where someone steps behind a curtain and comes back out dressed in an entirely different outfit.  The lady practically took our orders, walked around the corner and came back with sizzling hot food.  . . Talapia was cooked well, but it wasn't very seasoned or flavorful.  The shiro was also a bit disappointing.  I was expecting a hearty chick pea sauce, but it tasted like bland, runny tomato sauce.. . Injera was good.  But I think that's standard operating procedure.
