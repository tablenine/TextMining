For $10 (incl tax and tip) I've had much better. The broth was mediocre. I've never had a meat ball where I didn't care for until today. Only good thing about this place is I didn't get a side of thumb with my soup. But what is pho without a side of thumb???. Btw, to find this place, look for a store Â front without a sign next to an escrow place.
