I was warned when coming here that I should be well under the influence before arriving. Considering that was while I was driving over, it was a warning passed along a little too late.. . It isn't that the food is terrible, but it isn't that great either. Keep in mind I was more sober than Jesus, so my review will probably differ vastly from someone who's chugged more beer than a frat house. Food was okay, drinks were okay, decor is a little cheesy. It's certainly nothing to sing praises from the mountaintops for, but my drunk friends certainly seemed to be enjoying themselves, and we had a great time as it was. Not to mention it's 24 hours, which is great news if it's 3am and Steak n Shake isn't good enough for you.. . Would I come back on my own? Not really. But if another friend has a drunken birthday bash that ends up here, I certainly won't head for the hills screaming in fear. Who knows, maybe it's 5 stars when intoxicated?. . Word of warning on the parking lot: SUCKS. Hard to get in and out of, ugh.
