Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My bffl LOVES this place to death. When there's a special occasion or when we're around the neighborhood, Lawry's is the place to go!. . Obviously the prime rib is mouth-watering and delicious, but the spinning bowl salad and creamed spinach are to die for! The mashed potatoes with gravy and creamed corn are also good. . . I just don't like how the tables are arranged- they're really close to each other so you can hear the conversation at the table next to you. The waiter, waitress, or hostess has to pull the table out for you so you can get into your seat. . . What I love most about this restaurant is that they have chips and meatballs for you in the waiting area so you don't starve. Very considerate of them =)
