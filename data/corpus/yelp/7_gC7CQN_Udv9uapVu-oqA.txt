Solid.. . Despite opening week woes this place is a welcomed addition to downtown, catering to folks looking for a step up from Ralph's Deli.  I dropped by on a Saturday night, scraping up some things to go with an impromptu get-together with friends.  I told them I had a party of 10 and to suggest something.  I left with a handful of artisanal cheeses, breads, accompaniments along with heirloom carrots and mushrooms that were all top-notch.  Great service and finally, some people with good taste - filling a niche that has a demand downtown.  I don't eat like this all the time but once in a while you want something different than subway, denny's and (plegh)  wokcano.. . Forgot to mention, if management or ownership is reading this - I've noticed there is always one bartender that is always kicking arse and carrying the weight of the entire staff - Why is this?  They should all be asking patrons how they are doing and what they can do for them.  Something is being managed horribly wrong at the bar right now, I've waited 20 minutes for a beer, watching the bartenders/bar backs wiping glasses and avoiding eye-contact...hopefully will get fixed in-time.. . - -as a follow up, by the week of 4/18 the bartender situation seems to be fixed.  There's really not a whole lot NOT to like about this place.  The osso bucco was stupendous as well. - -
