Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Who knew vegetarian food would taste this great. =). . -A bit pricey for semi-fast food vegan food (meal for two people including drinks was $30). . -Fresh taste (I can't really explain it- like baja style I think). . -Construction of the food items are basically the same, except for type of "meat". So the flavors are pretty much the same.. . -Carne Asada and the grilled chicken sandwiches were yummy! I recommend getting the sweet potato fries too!. . -A must try place for vegan grill food. Soups, sandwiches, burgers and salads.
