So we went here on Friday night for my friend's birthday. There were a ton of us there but I went with 5 of my closest girlfriends. It was raining and I was feeling a bit sick on Friday but hopefully my review won't be clouded by my stuffy nose.. . I'd been to the new Fado's before, but never when it was this crowded. Mostly people in their 20's, college kids, etc. pack this place... and a lot of them look like typical frat boys. The music was a not-so-cool medley of typical bar songs with a bit of 90's hip-hop mixed in... not sure why frat boys love it so much. Some guys would scream at the top of their lungs to these songs while playing air guitar.... Thank God for the company I had or else I probably would have left early with that music pounding in my already-sore ear. . . Since I had never been upstairs my friend and I decided to take a little walk. The upstairs was okay, but I noticed a bit of an older crowd up there. I have a really strong dislike for really drunk guys who come wayyy to close to me, and for some reason that kept happening at Fado's. One guy, who HAD to be at least 200 lbs, even sat on my lap. I mean c'mon, is this necessary?!? But whatever, moving on.. . Since I was sick that night I didn't get any drinks, but I'm sure the beer there is just fine. Last time I was there I had a vodka and cranberry which was fine also. I hear their food is okay, but have never tried it for myself. This isn't exactly my scene but I can deal with it if I have the right company. It wouldn't hurt to play songs from this decade either...
