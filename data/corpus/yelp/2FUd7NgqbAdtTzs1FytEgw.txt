Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Fast (and I mean fast) servers and great burgers! . . I love the burgers and the well done fries, but  the most fun is watching the servers do their job at lightening speed.  The same servers that have been there since I first went about 7 years ago.  If you even 'think' that you might need a napkin, they are right there handing it to you.  Actually, the tuna sandwiches are really good as well. . . Of course you can't leave without a piece of their delicious pie.  I like the apple that comes with warm cinnamon sauce, but the cream pies always win out. . . The only drawback is waiting for a seat at the counter (it's only counter)  You just have to hope everyone will go in turn. . . Still...definately worth the counter and parking hasstle.
