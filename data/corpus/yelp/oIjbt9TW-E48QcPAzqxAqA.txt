After reading all of the great reviews about this place I knew that I had to go.  So I had a day off, and away I went, to pho happiness.  I was seated outside.  The restaurant itself had a great ambiance, loud, but a nice look and feel about it.  Outside was much quieter and the tables were nicely spaced and set.  I ordered the ginger lemonade, the highlight of my meal.  I ordered the tofu summer rolls from the appetizer menu, in an attempt to save room for their fried banana rolls for dessert.  I didn't make it to desert as the rolls filled me up.  While I enjoyed the restaurant and the staff was lovely, the rolls, weren't good.  I am chalking it up to making the wrong choice.  I will definitely be giving Gingergrass another try.
