Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
As part deux of my "OG Tastes of LA" series, I offer the self-proclaimed home of the french dip sandwich, Philippe the Original.  While the restaurant has existed in some form since 1908, it has called its current location home since the 1950s or so.. . My personal fave is the lamb dip (double dipped, as others here have advised) with blue cheese and a few dabs of the hot mustard.  Do heed the warnings posted in other reviews about this stuff.  It is liquid pain and you can easily blast a hole out your face where your nose once was.  That's what it feels like when you OD on the stuff at least.. . I remember going to Philippe for the first time as a little boy with my Dad and his parents and being quite surprised (shocked really) at the elderly gent sitting next to me going to town on a pickled pigs foot.  I don't recommend those to anyone, but Philippe does still surprise in other ways even today.  They offer a fine menu of wines by the glass, and I myself have enjoyed both a viognier and a sangiovese from Napa's Miner Vineyards.. . I have never had a problem with parking, and Olvera Street and Chinatown are a short walk away if for some mystifying reason you are still hungry!
