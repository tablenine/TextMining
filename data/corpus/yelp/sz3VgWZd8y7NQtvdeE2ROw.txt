This place is awesome. I love the vegetarian noodle dish and the veggie crepe. The food comes really fast there as soon as you sit down and place your order the food is right in your face! Excellent for lunch since I am always rushing... Make sure you bring cash because the do not take credit cards. A++++++++++++++
