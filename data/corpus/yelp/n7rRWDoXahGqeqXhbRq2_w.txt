Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I was surprised. I ordered the Ozzy dog and it was surprisingly good. Also the Bubble Up soda was good! It's better than sprite! . . It was around 2 or 3pm when I went. The line was about a 15 minute wait, which sounds heavenly compared to the other reviews. . . Some lady also got special treatment and my sister's boyfriend and I were like "ummm, can't you wait in line like everyone else." turns out, she was the owner or something.. . I'd go here again if the line is short. I'm not down to wait an hour for a hotdog.
