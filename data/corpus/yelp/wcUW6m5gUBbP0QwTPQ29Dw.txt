Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
One of my favorites in Atlanta that I've been going to for almost eight years.  The crowd is either hit or miss with it being super packed some nights while others it is very light.  It has a great "first-date" atmosphere and you can NEVER and I do mean NEVER go wrong with the food.  . All of their pasta is fresh and their linguini with garlic cream sauce is divine.  (Here's a secret - have them add shrimp to it.  It's heaven!)  The food is always fresh and they have a fantastic Crme Brule and Tiramisu for dessert (along with many other choices).  Their wine list is always being updated and is not only innovative, but reasonably priced as well.
