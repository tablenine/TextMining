Good price for good eats.  But even though it is a good price I still buy a lot and end up spending $20 bucks still.   The cheese rolls, potato balls, creme brule are very very popular, what isn't good with sugar, fat, cheese or potatoes?  But the sandwiches and salads are very well portioned for the price, they come with delightful crispy banana chips that tastes like potato chips.  But is it the best I've ever had?  probably not. . . I asked for someone for hot water to warm my baby's milk and they wanted me pay 75 cents!  That is way outrageous!  We brought like 50 people there, the least they could do is give me a some water.. . Is this place overrated? yeah, probably had better bakery goodies at Diamond Bakery.  The only reason it's popular is because it's not TOO sweet and it's fresh for a good price.
