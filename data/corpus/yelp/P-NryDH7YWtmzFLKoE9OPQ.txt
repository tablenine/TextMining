Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
i refuse to pay or stand in a 1hr long line for a damn hot dog... so i made my friends do it while i stayed in the car.... . this is not a place to pot heads, stoners, etc. etc... the wait alone will get you irritated... . i got a turkey burger &amp; a turkey dog &amp; i think fatbuger can do a better job with their turkey burgers..@ least the cream soda &amp; lemonade was good.
