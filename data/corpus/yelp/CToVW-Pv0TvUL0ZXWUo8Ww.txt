The evening got off to a disappointing start.  I was the first in my party to arrive and ordered a Pim's Cup at the bar.  The drink itself was delicious.  The bartender took special care in preparing the drink, and it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had.  That being said, another person behind the bar took my payment.  The bill came to $15.16 (expensive, but truly a quality bevergae).  The 16 cents threw me off, but I figured I'd get $4.84 back.  WRONG.  He only gave me $4 back!  It should be my decision alone how much I tip.  I was annoyed.. . My party had arrived by that time.  Our server was nice, and we ordered a charcuterie platter to share.  The meat selection was outstanding, and the complimentary small baguette we received served as a nice complement.  My mom loved her Washington oysters, and we also split a beet salad.  The beet salad was not at all what I expected, and it was small, but tasty nonetheless.  I ordered the bouillabase.  Salty, but delicious and hearty.  I was satisfied.  My dad loved his creamed spinach (the spinach did not look creamed, but the taste came through) and beef strogonaff, and my mom thought her fish was delightful (I think she ordered the salmon).  The apple tart tartine with vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect end to the meal.  My dad liked his chocolate brioche bread pudding, but it was too rich for my tastes.  I was full and content, almost forgetting the initial bar disappointment.
