Like everyone else said, this place is expensive, but worth it once in a while. I always have the paella, because it's my favorite, and Matt tends to have a steak, and they're both good. One adventurous evening, we ordered an apetizer of goat cheese covered with honey and served with cherries. While that sounds like an odd combination, it might possibly have been the best appetizer I've ever had!. There patio is the ONLY place to sit... although the dining room is beautiful, it has a more fancy, dressy feel to it, and the patio is comfortably casual. There is also live music which makes any meal that much better.
