Nice neighborhood place for dining on a "school nite."  Falafel was OK; haven't had much better in Atlanta.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Note: Sunday is karaoke nite so unless you are in the mood, pick another night.  We weren't so cut our dinner short.  Packed and loud.  More clubish than restaurant.
