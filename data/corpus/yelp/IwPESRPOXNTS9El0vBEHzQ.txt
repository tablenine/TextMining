When spring comes I think about three things: changing my hair color, throwing out clothes I haven't worn since Prince was a symbol, and trying a new eating regime (usually discovered in a reliable source such as People Magazine).  . This week I bought a Juicer and was ready to go raw or vegan-something yoga inspired when my Fiance and I  were offered a dinner on his boss. (Does it get better than that?). His boss recommended a few places in Malibu and then Cut in Beverly Hills.I knew my new equipment would collect dust but who turns down a free  steak?. I share this beginning because you need to understand the caliber of meat that threw me off the wagon and left me in a Japanese/American hybrid meaty coma.  . If you are looking for a burn to a few large ones, this is the place: best wine/food pairing (sommelier on the premises- super sweet and helpful), super fresh farmer's market fruits and vegetables (sigh..fava beans....)  and the meat will not disappoint even the most type O person you know.. My only slight complaint is that the meat temps were not exactly right-but I'm sure they would correct it if we asked-we were too engrossed in the experience.  It is a great place to people watch- we saw a few familiar faces and they looked like they were enjoying the goodies too.
