Restaurant: Cakes &amp; Ale
Category: American (New)
I had a fabulous meal at Cakes &amp; Ale last night.  We didn't get the ostentatious spiel at all... just a friendly, laid-back, knowledgeable, efficient female server.  We had a bottle of a Napa valley rose -- very nice.  They bring fresh skinny breadsticks and butter, which is sort of an awkward combination to eat, but delicious.  After sitting next to the candle for a few minutes, the butter was soft enough for me kind of dip the breadsticks into it.  Started with the "toast pocket stuff with caramelized onions and cheese," which was essentially the most delicious half a grilled cheese sandwich you could hope to buy for $4.  Then the arancini, which were to die for -- crispy, cheesy, and with a lovely citrus-y flavor.  I had the gnocchi with Italian sausage -- little fluffly clouds of carb-y goodness covered with lots of parmesan cheese.  Very tasty.  My friend had the duck, which turned out to be ground duck formed into patties over wheatberries, spinach, and other interesting tidbits, including grapes.  She enjoyed the duck; I did not.  However, the stuff it was sitting on was delicious.  We finished with the phatty cakes -- tasted just like my grandmother's ginger and molasses cookies, with a mascarpone cheese filling.  HIGHLY recommended if you like those flavors.  Dunked into coffee from a French press... heavenly!  I'd highly recommend C&amp;A based on this experience... not cheap (we spent about $50 each), but a party in your mouth with every bite.  Very pretty space, too -- lots of dark wood and big silver-framed mirrors.  Parking is a challenge... but that's downtown Decatur for ya.
