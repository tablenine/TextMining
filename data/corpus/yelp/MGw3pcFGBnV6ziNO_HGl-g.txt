Good hainan chicken.  Service is ok.  I took my friends there for the first time but the waitress told us we have seats.  Suddenly one patrons moved to our table from the counter and the waitress said nothing.  I know that has nothing to do with the restaurant but I think the waitress should say something to the patron.
