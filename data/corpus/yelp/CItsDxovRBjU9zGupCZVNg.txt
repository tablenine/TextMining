Oh, yes.  The famous half Garlic Chicken with black beans, rice and plantains, served with plenty of sliced onion and that delicious marinade!  The sour orange and garlic marinade is also available for sale by the bottle, good for chicken, beef, fish or vegetables. Versailles' Garlic Chicken is one of those dishes that keeps calling you back.  It's hard to forget, especially because you'll be smelling like it for days.  Ok, not a good first date place but damn good.  And the staff ROCKS!
