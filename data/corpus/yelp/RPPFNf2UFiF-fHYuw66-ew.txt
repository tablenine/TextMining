Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
I've eaten at this Heaven on Seven several times.  Being from the South and having made many trips to New Orleans (a few trips solely for the food), I am easily critical of New Orleans food outside of the Big Easy.  Were it not for the fact that so many Hurricane Katrina victims have opened Cajun restaurants all over the places they now call home, I would say you would be hard-pressed to find better New Orleans food outside of New Orleans.   . . The gumbo is first-rate.  The hoppin'-john is very good, as are the red beans and rice and the andouille sausage.  The jambalaya is a good bet, but the collard greens are a little sweet (Greens don't need sugar.).  I am not a Cuban sandwich fan, but I ordered it b/c it came with shoestring fries, which I love.  I am still not a Cuban sandwich fan, but one of the people dining with me said it was a great Cuban.  I have even ordered a cheeseburger and fries, both of which were above average.  I have yet to see a dish come to a table that I didn't think looked great. . . It apparently has a wonderful Sunday brunch, too, and if I were a fan of brunch, I would find out for myself.  Seating at the counter is first-come, first-served, and the restaurant is in the same building as Loews theatre, so this is a great stop for dinner and a movie.     . . All in all, worth a stop every time.
