Definitely one of the better Pho places around the town. but not my favorite. . . The beef/shrimp spring roll is quite good.. . The pho (I had with 'filet mignon' meat) is pretty good. The quality of the meats were definitely better than most places. My noodles were slightly undercooked. Soup itself was ok... . This pho joint is more of a hipster place with better pho.. a bit pricey as well.
