Maybe I'm easy to please...or I just enjoy quick service and a savory meal.. . I went in on a Monday, full house -- around 2pm! There were two groups waiting, so I put my name down. I waited no more than 5 minutes to hear my name called and snagged a spot at the bar before both groups. I guess there's an upside to dining solo! Â ;). . The waitress was very attentive and took my order immediately -- Daikoku ramen. It was nearly 78 degrees outside but that didn't stop me from ordering the hot dish, even though their Tsukemen (cold dish) sounded quite appealing too. I was thinking I would be forgotten about, considering how busy it was (and I could see all the orders coming out), but the waitress came and refilled my water when I least expected it.. . The soup wasn't too salty (as is the case with most ramen places), the fatty pork was extremely tasty (it melts in your mouth, literally), bamboo was yummy but couldn't get enough (I think they use real!), egg, and bean sprouts were average, and the noodles had a nice bite. Oh, and lots and lots of green onions (my fav!)...If you're not a fan of green onions, you might want to tell them to go easy on it when ordering. . . Overall, reasonably priced and tasty ramen delivered by attentive wait staff in "Little Tokyo". A good once-every-two-weeks kind of meal. :)
