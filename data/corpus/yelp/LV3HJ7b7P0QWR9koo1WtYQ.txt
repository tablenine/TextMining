This is my second review of Bakeshop, my new corner bakery, and I can only say that my love grows fonder every day.  . . This weekend I bought a white chocolate mango cake to take to a birthday party and what a delight.  The perfect pairing to afternoon coffee, a beautiful cake in the european tradition of cakes you can enjoy without needing an insulin shot.  Wonderful flavor, and just the right amount of sweet.  . . My italian roommate approved the Chocolate Pannatone as authentic and delicious.. . All this and a cozy and neighborly atmosphere.  Bakeshop, you make my neighborhood!
