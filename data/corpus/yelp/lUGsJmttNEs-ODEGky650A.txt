Restaurant: RA Sushi Bar Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
I went here on the first Friday night after they opened, somewhat weary of what I might be walking into, and with very guarded expectations.  So, I was pleasantly surprised by this new addition to the Midtown scene and I'm definitely glad I kept an open mind long enough to try it first.. . Before the positives...first, I will say that this isn't going to be the next sushi destination of Atlanta.  If you're craving topnotch sushi, you best stick to MF.  However, having just said that, food here was actually quite decent and the quality of fish was fresh.  We sampled a few usual fares on the menu and no complaints by me...   . . If you go here expecting the usual quiet, zen atmosphere of your traditional Japanese restaurants, you'll be hugely mistaken.  This place is oozing with flair and big on hip factor.  Inside of the restaurant was too loud for my taste, but I was down with the open space layout and the decor.  Where RA really shines is in their outdoor patio area, which is probably by far the best in Midtown, with comfy lounge style seating and a large bar that directly opens out.  . . Overall, this is a FUN place to go and enjoy yourself without getting too serious about the food.  Sure, there are better sushi restaurants out there and yes, the place can seem a bit too flashy, but sometimes, you just wanna go where there's plenty of urban vibe and where people are hip, trendy and pretty to look at.
