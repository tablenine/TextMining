This is the best cure to your LA hangover. Although the line will probably make you sick because there is always a long wait, it will be well worth it. After a night of fear and loathing in Hollywood, throw on the shades and head to the Griddle to refresh yourself with a bloody Mary or bubbly Mimosa and hearty breakfast. . . French toast is not usually my choice for breakfast, but I come here just for that. The Griddle makes the best French toast ever! Just a warning: the pancakes are disgustingly enormous. They serve lunch food like burgers, sandwiches, and salads as well, but I rarely see anyone eating lunch items even at 2 in the afternoon. Stick to mama's old fashioned French toast!
