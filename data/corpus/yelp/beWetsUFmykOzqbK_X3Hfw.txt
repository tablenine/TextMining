Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
I'm a big Dante's fan.  I usually only come here for big events like birthdays or Valentine's or something, but whenever I do make it, it's awesome.  It's good for big groups as well as intimate dinners for two.  And be sure to make reservations before you go.. . The place is just so cool on the inside... some may call it cheesy or tacky or whatever, but it's still just cool to have live alligators beneath your feet when you walk in and to sit on a ship and listen to live jazz while you eat dinner.  I love it!
