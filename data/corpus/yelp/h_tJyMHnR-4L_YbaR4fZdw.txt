Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I lived in LA 10yrs ago and my roommate took me to Roscoe's one morning after a wicked night of partying on Sunset led to a massive hangover.  We were physically removed from the Saddle Ranch Chop House after 11 straight hours of drinking (hey, I woke up and watched Leaving Las Vegas... what else could you do?) and my roommate got the bright idea of pretending to be a vallet and see if we could park some hot cars.  Luckily, we were in walking distance of home and made the trip safely.. Anyway, this was one of those next mornings where you swear some small gnome crept into your head with a hammer and just punished your brain for a while.  The thought of chicken and waffles made me sick... but then when that maple syrup hit my mouth and the greasy taste of fried chicken followed... all pain went away.  This place was magic for me.  Of course, in your early 20's you can eat this crap all the time and not gain a pound.  These days it's rare for me to even get a hangover, let alone eat a styrofoam container filled with fried chicken and waffles, but if I had the chance again, I would.
