Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I'm a huuuuge pizza fan, and the pizza was pretty good here.  . . We were here for dinner for a friend's bday after wine and sangrias at the Colorado Wine Company.  Hmm, its a good thing we didn't try to walk from there on foot. . . They're known for their pizzas so that's what we ordered.  We shared a large pizza, half deluxe and the other pepperoni with pineapple. I love that its a thin crust and they cut it in rectangular pieces instead of pie sliced shapes.  So reminiscent of the pizzas in Italy.  :-). . A friend of mine got the antipasto salad which we all tasted. The verdict - it was one of the best salads loaded with salami, olives, cheese, etc.  This is no skimpy salad. It could be a meal by itself.  . . Another friend of mine got penne with meatballs.  He said, he's had better.   It was just ok. . . I ordered the caprese salad.  Hmm, I'm not a fan of sweet balsamic dressing. It was TOO sweet to the point where I don't even remember if there were tomatoes or mozzarella on it.  I prefer the traditional caprese with just stacks of freshly cut tomatoes and mozzarella slices on top of each other with basil drizzled in olive and balsamic oil. Sprinkle a bit with some salt and pepper and voila! Perfect!  But this was not the case.   . . So I gave it just 3 stars because a) the hostess messed up on seating us.  She claims she called us even though we were clearly ouside waiting.  So we waited some more until she finally sat us in the back at two separate tables.  Not cool since this was a bday celebration.  b) my caprese salad was less than stellar.  But the pizza was indeed the supahstar!
