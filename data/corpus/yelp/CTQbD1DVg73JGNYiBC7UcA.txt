Took a forty minute drive because of all the hype, made it 15 minutes before the 2:30pm cut off time, but was turned away.  We wasted our time.  . . They need to make it clear on the website that the cut off time is not set in stone, but whatever they feel they can handle, which is pretty LAME!  . . Saw what people were eating and the burritos looked like the size of McDonald's snack wraps.  On our way home, we went to Hello Terriyaki and ate their bulgogi tacos, which were way better than Kogi!  Asked other people in line if it's worth the wait, they said, "The food's good, but it's not worth waiting in line for."
