totally ridiculously sweet place.. took some babe friends from out of town here for lunch and they absolutely loved it.. huge list of food, full coffee bar and tons of really really great tea. atmosphere couldn't really be any better, feels like you're in an old saloon or something.. but great delicious lunch and drinks and scrabble made this into a great lunch trip.. really couldn't have asked for more.. . EXCEPT there was a really douchey dude talking business loud on his cell phone and some dumb depaul girls kinda ruining the vibe of the rest of the place, only reason this didn't get 5 stars.
