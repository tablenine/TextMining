im a younger guy so i didnt find this place to be the greatest date environment in the world...its pretty quiet, its pretty dark...so the ambiance was so/so... . the food on the other hand was pretty good. Â The baby octopus for the app was pretty solid..the cod was some of the best cod i have ever had..it melted with the touch of the fork..the short ribs were ok..not the best ever..but good.... . the wine list is extensive and pretty decent with recommendations from my guys over at house of gluntz...so that was a pretty nice. . overall..i recommend going there to try it...but i most likely will not be back for dinner..just drinks
