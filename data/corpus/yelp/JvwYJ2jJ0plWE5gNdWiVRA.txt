Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
We were on our way to the tar pits and my hubby said a Roscoe's was near by, so we looked for this place. Parking was a little small, but we got a spot. We were promptly seated. I was going to go with the famous chicken and waffles, but all I really wanted was waffles. I was going to order the livers with waffles, but at the last minute said giblets. It was something different. My hubby ordered the chicken and waffles. My older son got 2 pieces of dark meat chicken with rice and gravy, and the little one got 3 chicken wings and fries. It was disappointing they had no kid's meals . The four of us ate for $54.11. I think the chicken and waffles came out to $15 and my kids' 3 wings was $8 and mine was like $9 or $10. My plate came out and it was huge!!! I thought I would get a few giblet pieces and a side of rice and gravy, but I got a whole plate of rice, topped with deep, fried, battered giblets, and the whole plate smothered in gravy. The rice and gravy was delicious! I could have ate just that. The giblets were tough and chewy. I had to cut them in pieces to make it manageable to chew. It was still tasty giblets though. (As tasty as giblets can be, right?) Next time, I will get the livers. Hopefully, they'll be easier to chew. My older son who did not want to eat here, said it was the best chicken he ever had. My husband said the same thing. I tried a little, and it was good. I wish they had more locations. Oh, also highly disappointed we didn't get to see Snoop. My 4 year old really wanted to see him!
