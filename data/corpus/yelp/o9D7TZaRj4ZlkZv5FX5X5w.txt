Restaurant: Chateau de Saigon
Category: Vietnamese
This place is really great.. . We have eaten here twice. The first time was lunch, the next time dinner.. The first time we ate there, me and hubby both order pho. Their pho was really good. The last time I had pho was in MN which had a big Vietnamese population, so I think that place had better pho than the Chateau. But Chateau's pho was also very good. And it was only $6/bowl. And mind you, it was a HUGE bowl. We had left overs. We actually ordered the make your own spring roll platter, and we regretted ordering it because the pho already filled us up enough. Good thing the server knew we couldn't handle that much food, and she came over to our table and asked us if we still wanted the platter. We said no, and they were ok with it. That was really so nice!. . The second time we came, we had spring rolls (Didn't really like it), Shaken beef (really good!) and the Bac(sp?).. . We will come again.. but maybe try Co'm first.
