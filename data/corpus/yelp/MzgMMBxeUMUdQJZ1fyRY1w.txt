Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
One very nice thing about the Bourgeois Pig: this is one of the quieter coffeehouses, with music turned far lower than at most.. . This place may well deserve that fifth star that I've failed to give it. Being gluten intolerant, were I to sample their menu very extensively, I'd end up a very sick boy, because that menu seems to consist almost exclusively of baked goods and things made with baked goods (sandwiches). But, as the saying goes, "the heart longs for company, coffee is only the excuse" - and the company tends to be very good at the Pig.. . The coffee's not bad, either. Putting them together, I find I have enough to vouch for this place's having earned its first four stars. I'll leave it to you to decide if they've earned their fifth. :). . They have a homepage:. . . http://www.bpigcafe.com. /
