I had heard of this place before and decided to try it using Groupon.  I ordered the Bistek Cubano and my g/f the seafood rice platter.  Mine was bland and my g/f was a little less.  Don't even ask me about portion size.  I was surprised reading the raves and reviews on this place but I guess everyone has different taste...I just like great food.  . . I agree there are much better joints out there.  . . I don't think I will be back.
