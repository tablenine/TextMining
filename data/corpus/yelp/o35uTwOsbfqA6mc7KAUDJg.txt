The kicker for this place is the natural approach to ingredients.  They do it well.  Real food prepared for semi-hipsters who like food without hormones and such.  It was a pleasant alternative to my normal poor diet (I'm a person who won't eat anything without cheese and considers Pizza a food group). . I had a club sandwich and it was delicious.  The mozzerella cheese was the freshest i have ever had.  The applewood bacon was thick and chewy and yummy, and the avocado was stacked a plenty.. . Their potato salad is different.  Good, but different.  More sour cream, lemon, and dill than most places.  Worth a try if you are a fan of potato salad.. . Only drawback for me was the food service.  I sat at the community table and 3 people all got the wrong orders.  Not a big deal, but hey, this is a review site.. . I Definitely recommend this to anyone. (if you don't mind eating across the street from the scientology compound)
