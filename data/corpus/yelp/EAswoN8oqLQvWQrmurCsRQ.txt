Truly a disappointment.  You shouldn't walk into a restaurant and have it smell like a fish market.  While the service was friendly and fish tasted okay, the selection was pedestrian, at best.  They only had hot saki despite the menu's mediocre selection of cold saki.  The hot saki, in addition, was not smooth with a hard, cheap taste to it.  Definitely not a location I'll ever visit again.
