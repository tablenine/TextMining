One of these days I will order a pizza here hahaha.. . I love hainan chicken and this place serves it up quickly and consistently.  GINGERSAUCE!! YUMYUMYUM!. . The restaurant is so cramped... I've seen better el pollo locos than this place but it's a good price for quick hainan chicken.  That being said, watch out for a long line at certain times (would never go here at night unless it was to surpise a rare group of adventurous foodies... who like cramping into litte niche eateries), parking is weird (street) but it's located not far from other good places to eat (desert) or drink (boba tea cafes).
