When I initially tried this taco truck I thought it was alright/kinda/pretty good.  I told myself that I would hit it up if I were in the area, but probably wouldn't make the drive out to Venice or LA for it again.  . . Well, I lied to myself. I've driven out here multiple more times just to get some korean bbq tacos, burritos, and to try their nightly specials (which are awesomeeee).  Short rib tacos, short rib breakfast burritos, Kogi hoagie, spam sliders: zomgwtfKBBQ awesomeness.  . . I'm not gonna lie, I really like having to find this truck on a given night. It's kinda like solving a mystery.  Mysteries and meat usually aren't a great recipe for a good experience, but in this sense, they definitely are.. . Maybe my first venture was me telling myselfthat I wouldn't crave it so that I wouldn't have to drive out 20-30 miles to get me some Kogi.. . Either way, like a trashy streetwalker in downtown LA on a lonely friday night, I'm hooked.
