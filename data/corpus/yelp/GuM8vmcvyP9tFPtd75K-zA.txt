Are you a hipster? Do you like being around hipsters and people that dress straight out of Urban Outfitters? Well come on down to Fred 62 because cool, hip, and good looking people is all that this place has to offer. . Disclaimer: I like Urban Outfitters and I don't think there is anything wrong with people that shop there...because I have. . . I went last night at about 1am and it was on and poppin'. . . I must say the burger I ordered was misleading. The presentation and look of it made me believe it was going to be good but when I bit into it it was oh so disappointing. There was nothing special about the meat, buns, or condiments for that matter. My fries were stale and the bun was too. It was busy in there so to me that mean there should be no excuse to have stale fries. They should be pumping those bad boys out! . . This place wasn't exactly terrible. They did have good service. I understand why people like this place. I mean, who doesn't like a restaurant that's open 24 hours a day that's not Denny's? I just wasn't impressed at all!
