.If you have to take out of town guests all over the city and don't feel like taking requests about what they want to eat this is the perfect place. With over 13 food kiosks a sort of modern food court/ cafeteria this place has something for everyone. I can actually say the numerous times I have been here I have never ate at the same spot.. . It easy, clean, and not too hard on the pocketbook. The only downside is that you may have to wait to get in
