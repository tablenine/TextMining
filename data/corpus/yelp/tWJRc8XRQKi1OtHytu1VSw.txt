I'm here to support this place. Everytime I go there, I have fun. I usually order appetizers and not entrees. Very cool retro decor with old license plate mounted all over the way. This place isn't trying to be all posh like the other bars surrounding it. It's a simple fun place to be at. So here's four stars for you guys. =)
