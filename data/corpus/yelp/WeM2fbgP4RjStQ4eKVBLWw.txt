You know I have no clue how good heaven might be, but I am thinking they have got to have a Portos somewhere up there.. . In commemoration of my 200th review....(ie way too much time on my hands:)), Portos had to get the golden review.... . I have never actually eaten inside this place (i understand you can get a pretty good lunch here too), but i have gotten a few items that have stood the test of time.. . a)  Fruit Tart---  Wow...I have been hooked on this dessert since the first time I experienced it from Porto's...these folks know their desserts, and I am so glad to be a part of the process.....i cant describe it, you just have to taste it.. . b)  Rum Cake---  not as amazing as the fruit tart, but its like judging who is finer Halle Berry or Beyonce....do you ever really lose..... . Nope. You dont.....Portos is my favorite bakery on earth....
