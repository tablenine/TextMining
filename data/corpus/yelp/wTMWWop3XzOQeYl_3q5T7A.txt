Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Was shopping for furniture at a really cool place called HD Buttercup. Afterwards I Â decided to grab a bite with the bro, so right next door is the office. . . I found it confusing at first, didn't realize you order at the bar and get the food delivered, but it seemed to work effortlessly after I made the adjustment. I ordered the office burger and the bro had the duck confit salad (always watching his weight). That duck leg had more fat then my burger. Well I also ordered an ice tea (they don't offer it) so I went with a cute diet coke in a bottle (retro looking), and a side of spicy olives. The olives were delicious, the burger above average, and the salad I couldn't tell, my bro devoured it before I could get a look. . . I'm not really impressed with the food, and wouldn't make a special trip to have another burger there. I did like sitting outside and people watching.
