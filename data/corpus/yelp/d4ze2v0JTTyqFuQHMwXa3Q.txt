Category: American (New)
After the the burger what else is there? We have cocktails which Holeman and Finch is getting known for, but after that, how's the food itself? Well, I went this week to have some dinner prior to the time the Burger came out so I was forced finally try the real menu.. . I have to say I really wasn't impressed. I'm not sure what's going on in the kitchen but someone may want to check their taste buds or their heavy hand. Everything we had was over salted. Myself and two others shared six small plates and every plate with the exception of the Steak Tar tare was coated in a heavy dose of salt. . . Whether it be the sauce, the protein, the veg... the consensus at the table was that salt was the main ingredient in everything. . . After getting through the salty haze the food itself was just decent. Once again with the exception of the tar tare I was just left whelmed. Even the best meal on the table (raw steak) seemed to have little bits of chunk in it. Not the most appetizing thought when you're eating raw meat. . . I'll come back for the burger and the drinks but I think as far as the actual menu is concerned.... thanks, but no thanks. After all was said and done the bill was $100 which just seemed steep for the quality of cuisine we were provided. . . Well.... you win some you lose some... Â  Still 4 stars for the amazing burger, cocktails, and restrooms....
