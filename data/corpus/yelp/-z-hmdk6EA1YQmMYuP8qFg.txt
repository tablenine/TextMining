Sushi gen is officially my favorite sushi place. Forget the pretentious over priced sushi places, this spot has the freshest sashimi for an unbelievable price. $35 gets you the sashimi deluxe, it's got practically every variety from halibut, octopus, buttery tuna, to shrimp. The platter is huge and can fill 2 people easy. Who's ever heard of a $35 sashimi plate that can fill 2 people! It's unreal!
