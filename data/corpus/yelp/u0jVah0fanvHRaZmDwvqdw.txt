Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Let me just start with I always thought of Chinese as take out or delivery. Tonight I ate in with a group of friends and I realize I've been missing out. The space is modern, yet, not stuffy. The staff is very relaxed and I felt welcomed. Bonus points for being BYOB! I don't eat shell fish but my pals couldn't get enough of the crab rangoon. They were served in little purse like pouches, not what you normally see with take out. The spring rolls were fried, not what I normally prefer, but tasted "clean". Â Then there was a sharing of Mangolian beef, a veggie dish of egg plant and mushrooms and champagne lemon chicken. I think the chicken dish was the biggest hit. We had wine, good food, good company AND the added excitement of being seated next to a table that was being filmed for the infamous Chicago Check Please! With that said, get there soon before the show airs and this place realizes the Check Please! effect. I really enjoyed the evening and am now wondering if I will be in the background of one of my favorite shows on the "great" WTTW. Go soon and bring a white and a red or several of each!!!
