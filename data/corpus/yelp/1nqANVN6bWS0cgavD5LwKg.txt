Best Mexican food in Atlanta. . . The owners moved to Atlanta from Mexico in the 90s and the walls are plastered with "Best of Atlanta" awards from ever since. . . The food is much less greasy than most inexpensive Mexican places in Atlanta. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food so I cannot elaborate on how well they season things, but every dish I've had has been highly acceptable and I have had no cause for complaint.. . The wait service is exceptional and despite long lines most nights of the week, they move people through there like it was their business. Despite the relatively short wait lines - any other restaurant with comparable capacity and lines would have people waiting for hours - there is no feeling of being rushed while you're eating.. . Each time I've been here the waitstaff has been friendly and efficient. They are a team staff so people are always coming by to refill colas and water glasses, and if you need anything you may ask anyone who happens to pass you if you cannot find your server. . . Despite being kinda far from the Midtown/Georgia Tech area, this restaurant is a huge hit with university students... and well worth the drive.
