I have been here only one time. I also came here when it was under a different name. . Very good buffet with many choices for the avid sushi fan or someone new to various Asian foods. . The price is what you would expect for a sushi buffet, but I would suggest going for lunch where you save about 12 bucks a person. . Not the best sushi in the world but for a buffet I think its well worth it. . I would go back again but just waiting for a time when I go go for lunch and when I have a huge appetite.
