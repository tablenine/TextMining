This place is so nice! Came here on a Thursday night around 10pm. I didn't know until I got there that it was a bar setting. Must be 21+ to enter. Seat yourselves, order up front, grab a number, order a drink and sip while you wait. . . I ordered the Office Burger since its a must try. For about $13 it better be good! Definitely met my expectations. Juicy and flavorful. YUM, i'll be back. But not frequently because 2 burgers, an order of fries, and 2 Framboise set us back $50. Including tips. WTH. oh, the fries are soo good too. it's that garlic aioli sauce... mmm. . . Good meal, nice service, great atmosphere. and a large selection of beer/wine. Wish they had a happy hour!
