TERRIBLE SERVICE. . . We sat outside. We asked a waitress where to sit, and she tried to direct us to the other portion of outside seating. We didn't want to sit there because it was protected by plastic, and we wanted to catch the breeze. I soon figured out why she tried to direct us to another section - because she is LAZY. . . First, I asked her which of the beers listed on the menu were "lite," because the menu only says "lite" - lite what? She would not go check for me. . . Then, when I asked her to take our food order, she said, "Yeah, in a minute," and went to talk to some guy in a truck who pulled up alongside the restaurant. . . She took our order. She repeated it back to us - including my friend's order of shrimp enchiladas. When the food came, he was served a shrimp quesadilla. . . When the bill came, the shrimp quesadilla was still on it. We asked for an explanation of the bill, and she said she put the difference in price between shrimp quesadillas and shrimp enchiladas on the bill... true. But it was $4 more than the price listed on the menu. We were so annoyed that we stopped arguing.
