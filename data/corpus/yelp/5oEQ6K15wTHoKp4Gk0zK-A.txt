I hate to be the guy whining about how everything was so much better back in the day, but I feel like every time I eat from Joy Yee's it's a little worse.  My ex-favorite dish, the seafood chow mein, has become a bowl of bland in bland-flavored sauce.  That's what happens when you try to make a billion dishes from every country in Asia.  The post-meal feeling is how I'd imagine a stomach full of grease feels like.. . I'm glad to say that the bubble tea is still awesome.  Expensive, but the sizes are large and the stuff is like crack.  Hopefully the food will get back to where it used to be.
