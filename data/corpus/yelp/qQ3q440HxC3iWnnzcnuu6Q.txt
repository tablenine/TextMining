Yeah, this is the best ramen joint in LA.  The only thing for you to remember before showing up at this place is to expect a long wait no matter what time you're there.  Although the ramen itself tastes great and not to mention a great value, the fried rice here IS the best fried rice you can find (doesn't matter if you're into Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Thai or Japanese fried rice).  The sake at $6 is also an excellent deal if you're into an alcoholic beverage with your meal.  Highly recommended.
