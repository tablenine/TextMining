As a vegetarian, you have a tall order of finding a place that will make your meat-eatin' friends happy, but serves at least a vegetarian dish for you. One thing in common my friends and I have like pho (though, my dish to them does not count as pho; it's "veggie noodle water.") . . Pho cafe had this. It was very hard to find, since the store didn't have a sign outside, but after walking up and down the street, we realized people inside this nameless place were all enjoying pho. . . We went in and ordered our respective usuals (my friend ordered the normal pho, and I ordered the vegetarian pho). Mine was very tasty with fried tofu in it, which is a huge plus for me. Very flavorful broth (with an onion flavor to it) and very fresh tasting. . . Why, then, did I give this place 2 stars?. . This place made us both sick for the next day or two. I will spare my fellow yelpers from the details, but it was not cute at all. In fact, it was enough to drop a 4-5 star rating to a 2 star rating.
