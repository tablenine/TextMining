Tortellini pizza!!!!!! I love tortellini pizza, especially late at night while stumbling home. I seriously haven't had tortellini pizza since I was in undergrad and it definitely hit the spot and for a few minutes I actually thought I was back in my carefree undergrad days, drunkenly getting pizza on the way home, instead of being a responsible super busy adult. The staff was really friendly and kept the line moving quickly at 1:30 am. I think slices were $3.50, which is a little pricey, but most definitely worth it.
