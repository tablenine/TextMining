Solid four stars. I should have looked at the Yelper pix a little more closely because somehow I was expecting Kielbasa or Brats... large on a plate with a side of potatoes and kraut... instead more like hot dogs in buns. . . Don't get me wrong, still very tasty. Got the 'gator/pork sausage. A little gamey but still good with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. The beer selection is also very good. Love when I can get Chimay on tap. Yum. Fries were average. Dipping sauces were good... there are many more so I'm hoping some others will knock my socks off (ranch was avg. blue cheese/walnut/bacon was above avg). . . Either way a good find. Would definitely go again... if just to try more beers and unique soda pops!!! my friend loved the cucumber soda!
