Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Very small and tight space seating area with highly modern interior design fits in perfectly where the restaurant is located.  Been coming here for the past 3 years and their pizza's, salads and appetizers have never failed.  . . If you're looking to eat Domino's type of pizza that's $5, stay home and order delivery.  Mozza is not your ordinary pizza restaurant.  Owned by one of Food Networks Chef Mario Batali, it's a very classy yet casual restaurant with a full wine bar and an open kitchen where you are able to see all the action.  . . I usually request the bar table seating where I get to watch the kitchen staff toss the dough, layout the ingredients and bake it inside their wood burning oven.  All the ingredients are fresh and their dough is exceptional delicious.  . . I enjoy starting off with their chopped salad that is drizzled with this fantastic dressing.  Then I would order their caprese salad that comes with baby vine tomato's,  fresh mozzarella cheese and sweet basil.  I've tried couple different pizza's but my all time favorite is their Arugula Pancetta Pizza.  Eat it with a bottle of Reisling and your tummy will thank you.  Great place to come before heading over to watch a musical or a play.
