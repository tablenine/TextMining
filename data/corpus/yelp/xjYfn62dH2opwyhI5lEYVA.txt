Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Have to go against the grain and say that the food here is OK but the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not saying that I expect a restaurant with cheap food to have a wonderful ambience but the other patrons in the restaurant are so annoying that it makes me want to shoot myself halfway through dinner. The bread they serve as an appetizer (which is free, which is nice I'll admit) tastes horrible and the food is just blah. Sure, it's open late but when you're surrounded by Sunset Strip boozehounds it's not really worth it. Delivery maybe?
