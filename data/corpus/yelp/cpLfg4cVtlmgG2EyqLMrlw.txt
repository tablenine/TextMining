Went here with friends for lunch yesterday and had a pretty good time. I like the interior decor, although I hate the paper white table coverings. I think it's a bit tacky.. The seared ahi tuna was so-so, very average, but the coconut seafood soup was delicious as was the creme brulee. Our waiter was sweet, but didn't seem to have any knowledge of the menu (twice I asked for something that he said they didn't have, and twice, I saw that they did, indeed have it...). . Very limited menu, but it WAS lunch.. My cost for the ahi tuna app, a CUP (which is more like a bowl) of seafood coconut soup, and a glass of wine was about $25.. I might like to try it again for dinner.. . I forgot to add that a sweet guy that had a mutual friend bought the house specialty drinks for the table. DEFINITELY try the Mango martini, and DEFINITELY ask for Reggie!
