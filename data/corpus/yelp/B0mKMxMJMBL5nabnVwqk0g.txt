Yummy, laid-back and affordable!. . I like to hit up this place after a long day at the MOCA.. . I just love little Tokyo! . . Is there anything better than affordable sushi and a place thats open late at night?!!?!?! I don't think so.. . Friendly staff, waitresses are always smiling. . And I'm always smiling every time I come to this place!
