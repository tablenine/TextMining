I laugh when people complain about the quality of food at a place where practically everything is $4. Stop getting mad that this spot doesn't provide an outdoor seating area, polite service, clean bathrooms, cheap drinks, AND good food all at the same time. Be happy its 4 out of 5. . . I sat here for hours with a friend, had several glasses of some cheap wine, the free chips, and some seaweed salad- which wasn't as bad as I expected- while sitting in the sun, and my bill was $30. The waitress even gave us a few free wine refills. Hellooooo I'm not going to complain! Do you people seriously expect 5 star food here?? I'm just happy places like this exist so I don't have to totally cut out my social life during this recession!
