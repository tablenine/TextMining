worth the wait!! for vegetarians, you must try the tofu tacos/burritos. theyre delicious!!!! even if youre not a vegetarian, you should try it anyways!! its flavorful and spicy, party in your mouth!! :) totally worth the wait. but now, they`ve expanded so you can catch multiple kogi trucks in different areas. :)
