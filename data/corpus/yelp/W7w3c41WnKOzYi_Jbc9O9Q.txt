This is easily a 5-star place folks.  But alas, Swingers and the ensuing tourists kind of took its toll on the place.  Still, this place has some MAD character.  I mean, it just oozes hip, regardless of the crowds.  And that is what gives it more storied appeal. . . My old roommate thought he was the long-lost Rat Packer - and used to come here VERY regularly.   Sometimes I would join in, sometimes I wouldn't.  But the drinks.  Marty and Elayne.  The poseur crowds. The bartender attire.  The decor inside.  They all make this place what it is for better or worse.
