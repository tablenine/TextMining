I try to come here as much as i can, which is ironic how i have abs. Hmm???.. . I love this place with a passion. The Grease, the bacon, the grade crush, the whole shabang.. . I once waited 1hr and 25 mins, but well worth it once the dog entered my mouth, NO PUN INTENDED.. . Sure the lines are long, parking is ridiculous here, but if you appreciate oily ass food like i do, then everything is worth the trouble.
