This place is great! I have been waiting for a place that serves good soups and noodles that uses fresh and local ingredients for a long time. You can tell they put a lot of thought and care into their food and it shows. The bacon and butter squash dumplings are amazing! I think this is going to be one of my number one spots for the winter.
