This review is almost solely concerning service.  The bartender really KNEW wine and gave us lots of background.  Obviously it's not just a job to him.  We had stopped in for a glass of wine before deciding where to dine.  The GM, Lynn (Lin?) offered assistance in calling for a reservation as we were considering Coast.  The bartender also recommended a good Reisling to take over as they are BYOB.  This was a PERFECT example of what seems to be fleeting and inconsistent in a city with some many bar and restaurant opportunities - really good service.
