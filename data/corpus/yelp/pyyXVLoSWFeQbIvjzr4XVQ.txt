Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
The last time I thought I had a good fish taco was from Baja Fresh. . . last week.. . I was wrong. . . That was NOT a good fish taco.. . I went to the Best Fish Taco in Ensenada (BFTE) in Los Feliz and I learned what a fish taco should taste like. Crispy, flaky, fresh. It should NOT be soggy, old and drenched. . . At BFTE, tacos are $1.50 (fish) and $2.00 (shrimp). Pretty much a deal you cannot pass up. Not to mention a DIY salsa bar, which made it pretty easy for me to skip the cilantro!! I had a great meal that was cheap, fast and delicious. (Not to mention a hop, skip, and a jump away from Scoops . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). A great day for cheap eats and an even better day for cheap YUMMY eats.. . P.S. Cash Only
