Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s Buckhead At Tower Place
Category: Sushi Bars
This is my twin brother's favorite restaurant to eat at when he's in town (he's a Marine). He comes here so much, the waiters come hug him and bring him sake shots right away. I love it because the veggie options are HUGE and so so delicious. So many maki options, and they are all great. I love all the sake cocktails, the sake mai tai being my staple. The prices are great, but be aware, the wait is looong depending on when you go, for both seats and food, and expect lots of clapping and birthday songs. It's a great place to go with a group of people (not a first date, unless you go early), and is generally a whole lot of fun. I became a vegetarian well before I even know what sushi was, so I don't know about it's authenticity, but I LOVE the veggie sushi here much much better than at other places. Ru San was at this location for New Years Eve rolling sushi with his chefs, which I felt was a nice touch. And if you don't care for the crowd, you can get take out! When I want sushi, I only eat here.
