I don't know... I wanted to love this place after seeing it in the Food Network and hearing hype about it from local LA ppl.  The crowded parking lot was giving us hope, as well as the super long (and slow) multiple lines to place the orders.  The old hotel-like building, the chaos inside, and the somewhat grumpy ppl behind the counters (at least the two we interacted with)... so far so good.  The guy in front of us was telling us about their signature mustard, a must have.  So our time to order came, and we ordered two beef French dips with sides of cole slaw and potato salad and a lemonade.  Cheap, good.. . Short trip up the stairs to what looked like dorm rooms with long tables, with a cafeteria/prison feel to it.  A bit odd, but then again, it adds to the character I thought.  By now my expectations of the sandwich was quite high.  Then came the food.  After a much hyped up first bite, I was left wondering, "hmmmmm, perhaps if I put some mustard".  After the second bite I thought, "hmmm... tastes like wasabi".  Comfort food I get, but it was lacking in taste, unless I'm missing something.  I mean, it's ok, not too bad, but worth the hype?
