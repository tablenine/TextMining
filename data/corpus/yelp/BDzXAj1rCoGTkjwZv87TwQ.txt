What??? Â Never had Fried Chicken ~n~ Waffles??? Oh hell yeah, I love me some Fried chicken n waffles and some grits. Okay, so the waffles may not be the best I've ever had, what do I know, all the times I went to Atlanta and never once stopped at one of the million Waffle houses on each corner, but there's something about the combo. I'll never forget the look on my friend's faces when I told them we were coming here. Clearly they had never had this combo &amp; thought I was crazy. Needless to say they were singin' a different song after we left. If you come here in the wee hours, you may see a celebrity or two. Bay area folks, don't be fooled by the bogus chicken place in Jack London.
