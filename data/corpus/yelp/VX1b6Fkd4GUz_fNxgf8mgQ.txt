Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Banana Butterscotch Ice Cream Bar... mmmm.... banana caramel ice cream covered with butterscotch &amp; nuts then frozen... It can't get any better that this right?. . Oh yes it can! Milk has so many yummy things to choose from like ice cream bon bons, creative milk shakes &amp; sundaes (all made with Milk's ice cream that you can also buy hand packed or in pre-packed containers), cupcakes sitting in ice cream cones, frozen flavored coffee drinks, cookies, sandwiches &amp; pasta it was hard for me to narrow it down to the ice-cream bar I chose... so I also got the very good orecchetti pasta with chicken, pesto, tomatoes &amp; zucchini... and a Mexican Coke... and  a piece of coconut cake.. . I would have written this sooner but I fell into a sugar coma after eating the Banana Butterscotch Ice Cream Bar  - and a few bites of the Coconut Cake (yes I said AND... and?!) .  Now that I'm lucid again, I'm planning my next visit to Milk!. . Tip: The closest parking is the Valet Parking at the Mexican restaurant across the street...that charges $3.  However, ya could drive 2 blocks up (toward La Brea) and park in the shopping center with the T-mobile... you'll need the walk after eating at Milk anyway.
