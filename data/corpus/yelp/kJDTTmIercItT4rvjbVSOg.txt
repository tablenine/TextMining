Three stars because I've had really inconsistent experiences here.  The first time I ate, I ordered pancakes and coffee.  The coffee was awesome; the pancakes were raw in the middle.  Instead of giving me new ones, or discounting my bill, they gave me toast for free.  Toast =/= pancakes.  . . The second time I came here, I had a burrito that was amazing, with a fantastic black bean salad on the side.  Service was prompt and friendly, and it was a near-perfect dining experience.. . Third time - better than the first, but I waited far too long for my check.  When I'm done eating, I want out the door, you know?  I'm DONE.  I don't like waiting around for the waitstaff to get to me with my check, I prefer to give you my card right then instead of having them drop off the check and come back ten minutes later for the payment.  . . Fourth time (I live in the area, it's convenient, haha) - an amazing breakfast.  Full stars.  . . This would be a four-star review if there were any kind of consistency.  As it is-  three stars is the best I can do.  They're lucky I came back after that first raw-pancake experience, omg.  :P
