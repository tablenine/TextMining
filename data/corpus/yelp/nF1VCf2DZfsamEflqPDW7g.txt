Great decor, great service, honest waiters......but I was not impressed with my dishes. . . The chicken lollipops were really good. Per the server, it's their winning dish and has been featured on Martha Stewart. It was tasty. For the main course we had the garlic noodles, tamarind beef and chicken curry. Garlic noodles had a good flavor. Tamarind beef....the best part..the roasted brussell sprouts. The beef was a little tough and not very flavorful. Perhaps a little extra tamarind sauce would have helped and some garlic and some hot pepper? :) . The chicken curry...bland. . . Overall....I spent a lot of money for okay food. I say it's a good first date place because of the decor and atmosphere.....but not a restaurant I would frequent.
