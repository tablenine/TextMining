Restaurant: Panahar Bangladeshi Cuisine
Category: Restaurants
The food:  We started off with the Halim soup.  It was wonderfully rich and had a hint of spice.  It was perfect with the lime served with it.  My tandoori shrimp was cooked just right with bold flavor and no chewiness.  For a side, I ordered the rooti (whole wheat flatbread) instead of the fatty naan and a side of raita.  The rooti was really good even though the owner told me not to order it, but the raita was off.  It was so sickly sweet and watery that I couldn't take it - I've never had sweetened raita so maybe this is a Bangladeshi thing?. . The service &amp; experience:  The manager/owner was very interested in whether we had been there before.  Making a reservation was easy, but we had to wait for a while even though there were plenty of tables available.  Then we had to wait an unusually long time for anyone to take our orders.  They only had two servers, and yes, the lone busboy/water boy working.  It was unfortunate, as it would have made the experience much better had they paid more attention to us.
