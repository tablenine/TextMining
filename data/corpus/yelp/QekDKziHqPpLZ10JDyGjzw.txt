This place is great. It is very homey and not fancy by any means. It is straight up about delicious food! Since it is very small, the scents tend to linger within the room and you will leave the place smelling like meat and garlic. Just warnin' ya!. . My favorite item by far is the Jab Chae. Delicious. The Bul-Go-Gi is good, I find that it's not marinated as much as I like but it compliments all the side dishes you get with your order. There's a side dish that tastes like potato salad that I love from here. It's a great experience cooking the meat with a group of friends. If you take too long to cook the meat, one of the ladies will come and speed up the job for you. It's cute. . . Unfortunately the service isn't fantastic. If you are used to just drinking water, it takes them awhile to come around. You'll have to ask them to give you a refill. I suggest ordering all your drinks once you put in the initial order.. . The bathroom is also past the cooks from what my friends have told me. Dunno if that's a dealbreaker for some folks. . . Come here at lunch or on a weekday night. You will most definitely have to wait on a weekend because this place is packed. There's seating for about 20 - 30 people, if not less. It's also very close quarters.
