Category: Pizza
This place is really good. Don't let me get you wrong... . Although, they know it. RIght when I pulled into Valet, the guys goes, "Um, do you have reservations?!" . . This was a Thursday night. When we got there, we were seated right away (no place to wait) but the waitress was sooo rude. Seemed very put out with my questions on the wine and menu (this was my first time) . . Salad - Iceberg. Pizza - The goat cheese and bacon, leeks (no scallions). Pineapple, Jalapeno. Dessert - Key lime cheesecake. . The food was good, I really loved the crust. I think the goat cheese one was better, but I love anything and everything goat cheese! My new fave. . I also felt like they couldn't wait to get us out of there so they could seat more people. Our waitress told the ppl (who were right next to us) "thanks for not going over your time" - Um, excuse me?! . . Our bill was $100+ and I only had one glass of wine. So expensive pizza, next time I wouldn't want to feel rushed and would want a different waitress. I was over the one I had.. . Overall, good pizza. I can't really compare it to anything here in LA cause I dont go out for pizza all that much, but it was good.
