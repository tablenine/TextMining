Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
When one first hears about Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, they usually have a very confused look asking what kind of a combination chicken and waffles is?  Then they go the restaurant and are hooked.  Anyone in town should check out the classic chicken and waffles.  Lots of other good soul food to choose from too, and all the celebrity pictures on the wall are cool too.  Nothing fancy, nothing over the top.  Just a nice healthy waffle, and golden deep-fried chicken.
