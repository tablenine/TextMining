Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The prime rib is awesome!  The spinning salad is also really good.  The waitresses' uniform always cracks me up.  There is only valet parking and to avoid having to wait for hours, I recommend making a reservation...oh and always tell them the reason you are there (like a wedding anniversary or birthday)...you may get free dessert or something....
