Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
On my way to Versaille this weekend, I saw this place...Gloria's cafe.  There were 2 Yelp stickers on the glass door and I was immediately drawn to it.  This must be a good place so I dont have to to even go online to read the reviews.  Well it was a great place! Yumm-e!. Tried the tamales and the pupusas.  This is the first time I had Salvadorean style tamales and they are very good.  At first I thought they gave me sliced plantains but guess the tamales look like that.. I got these to-go, and even after 3 hours in the box, they were still oh so good...i can only imagine how good they must have been out fresh.  Next time i am going to have eat in the restaurant.. The staff there is friendly, the atmosphere quaint, cozy and very homey.
