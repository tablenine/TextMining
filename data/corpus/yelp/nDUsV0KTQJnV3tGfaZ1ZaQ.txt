Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
So in the beginning, we use to mob this place up all the time because it's very spacious. After a while, we started to notice that not too many Koreans ate at Manna. I wondered why..? At first Manna kind of wows you. Cheap price for so much meat! As time passes by, when you go more and more, you start to notice the little things that irks you about the place. Service is okay but sometimes you get ignored because the place is so big and each server has to attend to so many tables. They can only do so much even if they're really good. Sometimes we would grab our own stuff that we needed, depending where our table is. As for cleanliness, it's kind of a toss up. If you are a clean freak, you probably won't eat here. If you can eat in any condition, it'll pass. I don't know about the women's bathroom, but the guy's bathroom has only one urinal and one stall. Wait, this place houses hundreds of people but there's only one urinal and one stall? Sadly, yes. I've been to small bougie Hollywood clubs that had more bathroom stalls than this joint. The quality of the meat is okay but the when you order the Chadol Baege (thin slice beef), it'll most likely come out frozen, stuck to each other, and will be about 50-65% fat and the rest red meat. If you have a party of 15+, Manna will seat your party well because they're so spacious. We use to be regulars here but I haven't seen this place in a while. I've explored other Korean bbq buffet places in Ktown which are smaller, cleaner, better service, and where the quality of the meat is much better at the equivalent price.
