Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I am so spoiled. Having lived in the Bay Area for over 10 years and eating some of the very best Vietnamese food in Mountain View, I have very high expectations. The Pho at Ginger Grass is acceptable, but certainly not as good as an authentic Vietnamese Pho house, such as Vi Pho Hoa in Northern California. I still went in with an open mind and hungry stomach. The Pho was good but the lunch special wok chicken was cold and fairly tasteless (not a good thing when it comes to Vietnamese). . . The service was pretty awful. Slow and inconsistent. People at tables next to us getting really cranky too. I had really hoped that this would be a great Silver Lake restaurant, but the bad attitude by the wait staff and standard fare was really disappointing!
