I'll keep this short and sweet. This place kicks ass. Here are the only rules you need to know:. . 1. Pasadena location is better for getting in and out and just eating.. 2. Hollywood location is better for hanging out and people watching. It has a coolness factor missing from the Pasadena locale.. 3. Drinks aren't refillable.. 4. If you don't like chicken and/or waffles, then why the hell would you come here? - This is more of a rhetorical question than a rule, but still. You only go here for the chicken and waffles, duh.
