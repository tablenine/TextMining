This place is inconsistency at it's finest.  . . Some of the dishes, are excellent, but the service was a bit misguided. It took plenty of time to get our drinks, and we had to beg for the check at the end, but they gave us a dish that we did not order, and did not charge us for.  The setting is great for a hip, trendy environment, unless you actually want to see the food.  I cannot speak for how the food looked, because I literally had a hard time seeing the food.  Their specialty drinks were, okay, with some of the flavors not really blending well.  If you're a tres chic place, have killer girlie drinks, please!  . . The quality of their fish was very good for sushi, but some of the fusion dishes fell short on quantify for price (I'm sorry, 1 short rib in a main course is not okay), flavor combinations (texture and flavor combos really), and service, which can ruin a moment.. . The skate wing was very very good though, and I highly reccomend the dish if you do go there.
