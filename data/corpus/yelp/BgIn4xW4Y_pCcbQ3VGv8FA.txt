Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I know my fish tacos and these tacos are frankly disappointing fish tacos. I mean all you get is a plain corn taco with a couple of fried fish or shrimp and thats it.  Then its up to you to dress'em up from a salsa bar. . . People please.....I can think of 4 other places that serve up better fish tacos than these.  I can't figure out why the high ratings     Go to Senor Fish in Eagle Rock and you'll know what I mean.
