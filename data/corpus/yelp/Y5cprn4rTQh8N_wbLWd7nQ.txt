Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This is the most macho ramen place I've ever seen.  There is a test of manhood - or womanhood, I don't think they discriminate, so you could call it "macha", too - called the Special #2.  I've seen other Yelpers recommending and/or bragging about it.  DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.  Unless you're the type of person who just can't turn down a dare.  Or you've got an iron stomach.  Or you just like it HOT HOT HOT!   All of the ramen is goo-oo-ood, and most of them are way spicier than wimpy Yonsei guys like me are used to - and I'm a Californian, which means I can take Mexican, Thai, Korean spices, all without flinching (well, maybe not all at once).  I can't remember how many levels of spice they've got - like, maybe seven total? - but I got the third from the bottom and I still got my collar soaking wet with sweat.   . . Still, I gotta say...this Japanese house of torture (they have ways of making you talk!) is not only good, it's kind of fun.  It's hidden away up on the third floor of Weller Court, sort of across and up from the Kinokuniya book store (another great reason to come to this largely forgotten spot).  When we went, there was a twenty minute wait, and though I went to the other noodle place right below where there was no line, my wife said, "There must be a reason why this is the only place in the whole court that has a waiting list."  And she was right.   . . Noodle lovers of the world, you must check this place out.  But if you're a fame whore and you look up, and see that they have a whole wall dedicated to Polaroids of those people who can finish one of those gigantic bowls of molten lava called the Special 2...well, you can't say that I didn't warn ya!
