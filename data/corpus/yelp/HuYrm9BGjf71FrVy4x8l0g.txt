I've been here twice so far - once on a weekend, once during a weekday - and both times have been fantastic. The beer list is definitely something with five or six pages of domestic and imported beers. Both servers I've had were able to give their recommendations, so these clueless servers must be elsewhere.. . The food is also very solid. Their seasonal specials are always worth a try. The last time I was there I had fries made out of chickpeas. They were incredible. I'm a huge fan of their shrimp and grits, which they top with truffle oil. I can't think of anything tastier. I also recommend their mussels.. . It's great to go with a group of friends or stands great as a date venue. . . The best part? (Besides the food and the beer...) You can smoke after 10pm.
