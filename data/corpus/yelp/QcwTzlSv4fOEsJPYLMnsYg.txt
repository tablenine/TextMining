I agree with other yelpers: New York just can't get tapas right.  Why can't we be like Andalucia - buy a beer, get a delicious slice of tortilla espanola???. . With that in mind, I'll say Tia Pol is probably the best tapas spot I've found in NYC.  I went on a Monday night and it was pretty crowded - lots of parties of two, which seemed right for the tight space. We got there at 7pm and got one of the last available tables, but by 730 there was a substantial line.. . I thought the Sangria was good - a glass means a full glass, which is refreshing since other spots around the city aren't so generous.  . . The tapas were pretty good for NY.  The shellfish/clams dish was pretty awesome (ask for lots of bread to soak up the juice).  The tortilla espanola and the ensalada de alcochofa were both pretty good but not spectacular. the special croquetas were bacalao, which I thought were also pretty good.. . Good vibe, pretty good food, good drinks...Tia Pol deserves 4 stars, but, again, this is going by New York tapas standards.
