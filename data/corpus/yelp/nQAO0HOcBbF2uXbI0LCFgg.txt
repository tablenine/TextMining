Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
OK. It's hard to rate this place because it's one of those things where you go for the novelty as much as the actual food. . . Being from a Southern family, it's hard to enjoy fried chicken made in  restaurant, simply because Grandma and Mom really know how to make the best fried chicken on the planet. That being said, the experience of Roscoe's was highly enjoyable, and the food was good, as well.. . the fried chicken was good, I'm not going to say great like Mom's, but I like the skin crispy, and it was. I'd just prefer to have a breast over a leg, but the choice wasn't there. So I had a leg and a waffle.  Regardless of quality, fried chicken is fried chicken- what's not to love about it?. . the waffles are good, again, nothing spectacular, but a little butter, a few containers of honey, and wrap it around bites of chicken, and we're all good.. . The funny thing is, before I even heard of Roscoe's, I used to eat Van's whole grain frozen waffles, toasted, filled with honey and grilled chicken breast. It seemed like the perfect pre-race meal: carbs and protein for a hard or long day in the saddle!. . So I don't think I'd go here as much for the food as I would just to say I went to Roscoe's.. . So I can finally say, thanks to Tamtech, I have been to Roscoe's! Yay!
