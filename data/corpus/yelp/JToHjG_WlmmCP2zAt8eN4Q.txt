Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I can't believe some of the people that don't like the pizza here.  Of course you're all welcome to your own opinions, but it is unbelievable to me.  Bland?  Are you kidding?  Buttery crust, with the sweetest tasting sauce in the world!  The cheese is amazing also!  It's like eating a cake for dinner.. . This is honestly the only thing my girl friend ever has a craving for.  She'll text me saying , "Looouusss"  We eat the pizza here about once a month.  I've never had a better pizza than here.  Honestly.
