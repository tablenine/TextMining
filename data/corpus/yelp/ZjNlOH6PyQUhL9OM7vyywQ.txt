my friends brought me here for my bday :-) nothing better than some free food with good friends on your bday. . . so u know all the hype of this place? well all i have to say is... it is definitely worth the hype. usually i am a guy that doesnt like when people hype things up because then when it doesnt meet your high expectations, u get kinda sad even if the food is pretty good. in term so of this place, u have no choice but to have high expectations and they are definitely met.. . so my friends and i all got the famous #19. i believe its a pastrami sandwich with swiss cheese, cole slaw, russian dressing all on rye bread. . let me state for the record that i am not the biggest fan of pastrami. most pastrami places ive been to, the pastrami is either soaked in oil or too salty.. well... for this place, i LOVE the pastrami. the meat in the sandwich is just so tender and juicy. like i was grabbing at pieces of the pastrami by itself and it was just so good. i wanted like a whole plate of just the pastrami. haha.. along with that, the cole slaw and the russian dressing just complement the pastrami so well. just adds to the juiciness of the meat and the sandwich. wow. and the rye bread, is so soft and delicious with the pastrami. . the #19 is just purely a GREAT sandwich. . i heard that this place won like the james beard award in 2001 or something like that. i now see y.. . so yea. u definitely gotta check this place out!
