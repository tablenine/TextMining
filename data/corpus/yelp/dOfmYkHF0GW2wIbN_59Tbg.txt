Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
Gotta Love Taco Cabana. It is definitely a better alternative then Taco Bell, especially late night. After the club, it's like Club Cabana ;) . . The food, IMO, is good- Not necessarily GREAT but I never get sick after eating it..  The employees are all very kind, especially the guy that works in the drive thru (no matter what time of day you go he is there LOL), that guy is a huge flirt also but has a great smile, so it's ok... ;) . . I love the choices of salsa and dips they have. It's a great spot to meet with friends and chat over a great, fast, reasonably priced meal. . . ~Taco Cabana is cool~
