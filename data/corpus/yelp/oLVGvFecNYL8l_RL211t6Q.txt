I had a good time here with my pals. It never gets that crowded, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your POV. It also seems to suffer from a bit from multiple personalities. From the outside where we sat, it's a cozy sidewalk cafe. Once you get in the entrance there's a very sports bar-like bar covered in neon signs. Then go further in and it's a full-on lush "lounge" with dark lighting, pulsing music and elephant paraphernalia.. . The food was satisfying, though if you're looking for, say, spices in your Indian food you may find it missing. We ordered the Tandoori Chicken dinner for two, and the tandoori chicken itself was fantastic. Very tender and smoky. The samosas that came with it were hearty and flavorful. The curry dishes were lacking in spice. I usually expect to walk out of an Indian restaurant with the smell coming through my pores, and at the end of this meal I just smelled like myself. The chai and basmati rice, likewise, were okay but somewhat lacking in aroma. The naan was good, on the crispy, cracker-y side.. . Service was efficient, if not the warmest. Our guy checked on us consistently, and I was thankful to never have that dreaded feeling that I was forgotten for sitting outdoors. They do delivery orders, and I might call up sometime if I'm craving the tandoor chicken again. In person, it's pretty much par for the course for a Vermont Ave. restaurant.
