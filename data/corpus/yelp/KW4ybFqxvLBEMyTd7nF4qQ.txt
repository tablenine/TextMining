Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Wow-zaa!. . This place is the place to be when it comes to sandwiches. Though I felt like we were lined up like a herd of cows waiting to get stamped, the wait was well worth it! The inside looks really neat with neat decors and a neon sign that says "Philippe's" at the front counter.. . Each line had a dedicated "carver" (yes, a real carver), who takes your order. The register is behind all the carvers, which I thought was an interesting set-up. When they give you your total, you place your cash on this little dish on the counter and they pick it up. . . I ordered the famous pork sandwich, a side of potato salad, a glass of lemonade and shared a piece of pecan pie. Once we got our food, we headed upstairs to their dining area: another interesting find! I was told the restaurant used to be an brothel back in the day and hence the look of individual rooms with hangers and such. . . Once I dug into the sandwich, I was in heaven! I topped it with their special recipe hot mustard and it was just mouth-watering! I savored every bite! The potato salad was yummy, with the potatoes perfectly mashed into small pieces with an excellent mix of seasonings and mayo. The only thing I have to warn you about is that you will get MAJOR food coma right afterwards. It lasted a few hours for me. ha-ha. . . Give a visit to Philippe's. It is one of the best french-dip sandwich places in L.A.! There's ample parking in the area, so don't make excuses not to go!
