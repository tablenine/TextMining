YOU RAVE I RANT.. . I am with the other haters here this place is BEYOND OVERrated...Finally came here arond midnight, waited a long line (but not an hour I don't thnk), sat in the little area out back with all the other drunkards, and devoured our mediocre hotdog.  Honestly for most of the people in line at that hour they would have eatten anything and thought it was the BEst.  My friend also got the cake there...cake?!? how random, but she didn't like it at all and this coming from a girl who loves cake from the market.  Def worth the experience though and the highlight was the long stem roses they sell in the back soooo pretty...i know im cheesy as hell....my poor bf.
