Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
The best places in the world to have seafood in my opinion are the small fishing villages of Baja Mexico and Hong Kong, where fresh seafood is as engrained in the culture as the afternoon siesta or dinnertime with family.  . . For Hungry Cat, I was as excited to try a new seafood place (for obvious reasons) but was disappointed as 1) I have not been trained professionally nor scholastically in cooking and 2) yet my seafood is WAY better than Hungry Cat ;-). . . That said, I would go to this place more for the drinks and ambiance which were good. . . I found myself eating/enjoying the farro of the whole orata more than the orata itself.  It's a mediterranean fish and on a saturday the freshest it's going to be is friday fresh. From the med transported to here at least 1-3 days processing time and now you have seafood that the American public thinks is good cause it's drizzled with olive oil and lemon and good salt, but in actuality, really good seafood is killed the day you eat it.  . . Especially if you are going for steamed preparations it's why Cantonese fish is cooked with so much - finesse - ...the seafood is alive when you pick it (in seafood villages like Lei Yue Mun). . HC - the SEAfood ... was nothing spectacular - I'll leave it at that.. . Hungry Cat is worth going back to for some drinks and some food with friends, but not a trek out of the way simply for food.
