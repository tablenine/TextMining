I thought this place was preeeeeeeeeeeeetty good. I enjoyed the garlic chicken, the raw white onions was a little errr for my liking. I liked the rice and the plantains, but the beans not soo much. The portions are huge so you can def share with someone, overall I had a good experience. I guess it was close to closing time cause when we were eating it was a tad bit rushed. Work on that Versailles. . Oh, and I love that garlic bread stuff!
