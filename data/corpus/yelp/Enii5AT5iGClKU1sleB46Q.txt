Restaurant: Brazzaz
Category: Steakhouses
Brazzaz is the third Brazilian steak house to pop up in this neighborhood (Fogo De Chao and Sal Carvao are just blocks away). The experience and prices are about identical to Fogo -- great caiphirinhas, an amazingly diverse salad bar. However, given the price, it's pretty much for meat lovers only. It's indeed delicious, but with a set price of $50, you're likely to overeat to get your money's worth. Next time I'll go for lunch, which is much cheaper.
