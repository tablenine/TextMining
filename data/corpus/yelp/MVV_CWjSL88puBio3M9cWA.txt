My office is right near here.....the chips are warm and the salsa is hot. soooo good! So, I love the shrimp fajitas, healthy and so tasty. . The staff is always great as are the hostesses. margaritas are tasty and the beer is cold. short review, but not much more to say... . It only gets 4 and not 5 stars b/c the bar can be SUPER smokey!
