I'm giving this place 4 stars because enough have given it lower. Is it great Italian food? Hardly. I went their with a large group recently, they were just able to accommodate us. Service was good, not great, and most entrees looked OK. . . That said, I had a wonderful dish from their specials. It was a seafood plate with shrimp, scallops, calamari and salmon with asparagus and spinach... pretty awesome of a combination, huh? It was cooked with olive oil, butter and had a little bit of garlic cream sauce over the top. The shrimp were good, the scallops were tender and delicious, the calamari was excellent and the salmon was OK (I'm not big on salmon, mother fed it to me twice a week for 18 years).. . So, my conflicted opinion of this place is that it is a decent joint that is capable of making some really good food.
