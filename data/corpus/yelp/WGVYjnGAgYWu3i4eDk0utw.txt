We beat the line by like 5 minutes .. phew!!!. . The ramen is good and I like how they only have 2 kind so that makes thing much easier.  It's freaking big as well (may be I'm just small person) so share it with someone.. . Service is excellent and very attentive.  . . I would go back again when I crave some hot, satisfying ramen!
