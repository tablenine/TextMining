Waited 2 hrs the first time and had it recently 2 days in a row.  The short rib Burrito is amazing.  Make sure you get some oranges to garnish with the food.  The Taco's are good, but too small for my taste.  At $5/burrito or $2/taco, I find that 1 burrito fills me up.  I've also tried the Kimchee quesadilla, and it was very tasty.  The right amount of spiciness and tanginess.. . I found the spicy pork just ok.  The flavor was fine but I highly recommend the Short Rib's at the truck.  My suggestion for first timers is to get a Short Rib Burrito and try a spicy pork taco.  Great food for the price.  Just have to wait in long lines.
