My favorite Greek eatery.  We always start the meal with Sizzling Feta and Tomato.  The cheese and tomato are just amazingly good.  I like their gyro a lot.  The pita bread is thick, soft and chewy.  Meat is flaverful and tender.  Veggies are crisp and fresh.  And the Tzatziki sauce is so delicious that I can probably just drink that thing.  We end the meal with Galactobaklava, a pudding custard.  Great place.  Delicious food.  Love it!
