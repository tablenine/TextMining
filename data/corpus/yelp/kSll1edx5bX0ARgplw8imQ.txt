This is definitely a hipster joint, so if you hate hipsters, don't come here, haha. I was drawn away from the place for that reason alone. But I've been a couple times and I do like that they have SO much variety on the menu. My friend had the tamales and they were quite good. It's opened 24 hours I believe (I could be wrong on that, if I am, sorry guys!), or it's opened really late, so I came here with a friend after a trip to the Griffin around midnight, and it was packed!. . If you want normal diner food that is cheaper without the variety, I say go to House of Pies which is down the street. Otherwise, if you want a cuter atmosphere and more variety than diner food, I say come to Fred's.
