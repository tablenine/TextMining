I like how this doesn't even have an address!. . I think it's over-hyped. I don't think it was THAT good, but definitely a cool experience to partake if you've never had Kogi before. The short rib burrito was pretty good, but it's not something I would ever crave. Korean BBQ tastes like three times better. Still, it's pretty yummy. Great if you just happen to be in the Kogi truck area w/ some friends and a bit hungry. I must say though, the tacos feel a bit pricey. And sodas are definitely overpriced. Otherwise, good food and good experience.. . Note: Yes, the lines are ridiculous. You should know that by now.
