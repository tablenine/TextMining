I visited the theatre last weekend to see Mama Mia with a group of 6.  I also was a big fan of the old place and am thrilled to see many improvements.  The waiter call button is excellent.  All of the attendees in my group loved the food (turkey griller, pizzas, salads, veggie griller).  I agree that the smoky ketchup is odd but the sandwich was excellent.  The new seats are comfy and the sound is awesome!  . . Everyone will have different tastes in food, and people going expecting the food to be gourmet (like Chima) are expecting a lot.  The food is pub or brewery food, and they are excellent in the execution.  You have to remember that for the most part, they are putting in orders for 100 people at a time.  The fact that it came out fairly quickly, hot, and accurate is amazing.  I will go back often (in fact, I am going back tonight!)
