I used to go to this place all the time with my friend and we would purposely get there early knowing that we'd likely have to wait at least an hour in line.  The food is great but honestly, I will never go back again because the service and the owner are horrible.    Let me tell you why:. . My friend and I would go and order a large portion each and I would always order extra udon (which I paid for) and then we'd get beers.  In total, we'd probably spend about 40 minutes there eating, drinking, and chatting.  About after our 4th visit within a 2 week span, the waitress started telling me that I cannot have extra udon.  Boggled as to why, I just thought she was kidding.  The final time that I went there, the owner (the old man with balding hair) came to my table and yelled at me and said "You cannot take so long to eat, if you want to eat slow, you can eat at the other restaurants accross the street, customers are complaining".  Keep in mind that at that point, everyone in the restaurant was looking at me and watching the old man yell at me.  I was incredibly embarrassed and as a "non-confrontational asain" of course I wasn't about to yell back at the old man, so I just said "I'm sorry".  . . I am sorry, sorry that I will not tolerate being treated like a second class citizen in a restaurant.  I am a paying customer just like anyone else and if I am going to wait 1-2 hours to be seated at a restaurant, I should not be rushed out or yelled at for "eating too slow".  The food is hot, how fast do you expect someone to eat scalding hot food?!  . . Needless to say, I will never go there again.  It's ridiculous.  What a Shabu Shabu Natzi!
