This is a good place... but it's definitely not the be all end all of ramen.  Part of it is the mood and part of it is the food.  Honestly, it's just too crazy there for me to consider during regular eating hours.  I think the stardom has had an effect on the service and the food.  There have been a couple times where the salad had FAR too much dressing and the miso soup that comes with the meals came lukewarm rather than hot.  (lukewarm miso soup is pretty disgusting.)  Also, the ramen is okay... perfectly serviceable, and more than that if you like your ramen kotteri style.  Good.. . But the gyoza is still awesome.  Another awesome thing: the shredded pork rice bowl, which takes the awesome pork chashu used for the ramen and makes it somehow awesomer with grilled sweetness.  Those two will fill you (or two of you!) up for not that much.  Very worthwhile.
