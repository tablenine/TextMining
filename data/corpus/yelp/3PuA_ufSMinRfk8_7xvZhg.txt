Gosh I love this place.  . . They are open for lunch and dinner but I prefer this type of food for breakfast.  Usually on a Sunday morning.  I order: sweetened hot soy milk, chinese fried donuts, scallion pancake, and soup dumplings.   . . There are not too many other places here in the ATL where you can get this authentic fare.. . Only drawback is that this place seats ~20 and is situated in a trailer in the middle of a parking lot.  It can get a little chilly sitting in trailer in the winter time.  Its cozy and I still love it.
