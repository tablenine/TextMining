Best margaritas you can find in Chicago. Avocado items are unbelivable, and the back patio in the summer is divine. Excellent service, freshest Mexican food I've had in years, wonderful vegetarian options. Best kept secret in Logan Square, and it blows Abril (its neighbor to the South) out of the water.
