I'm a shabu addict officially. Kept hearing great things about this place and finally made it out there. We went on a wed around 6 and the wait was only about 20 min . The place isn't as small as I expected. We ordered medium lean beef. It came with a good selection of veggies, and the beef was beautiful. The rice was super sticky and delicious. Their goma sauce was the BEST ever. Oh man. I had to refil mine 3 times. Their ponzu was good but not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst, it was just a tad on the salty side. Their garlic and green onions were fabulous. The service was military like, the second you need a refil they are filling you up. Ok the reasons why I docked a star: the broth was plain water. Ok this may be the traditional way to eat shabu but it's not the way I like it. Also, I felt rushed being there and the no cell phone use signs were retarded. Prices were good though. $30 for 2 mediums. I'd come back if in the area for sure but damn if I ever find a place better then my Ten!!!!!
