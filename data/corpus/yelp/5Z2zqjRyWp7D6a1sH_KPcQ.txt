Wonderful experience. The utmost thing that stands out about this restaurant is the service. Everyone I encountered was friendly and on top of it. . . the Food: I recommend the scallops and fingerling potatoes. VERY good! The desserts are also very tasty. Their graham cracker ice cream is unlike anything I have slipped onto a spoon and suckled on.
