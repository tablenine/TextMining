Listen up pork fans, if you want pork at it's simplest come here. The second you walk in you know you're about to eat some the savory good (but fatty) stuff. It's tiny, but you know that before you walk in. It's just a few stools and a constant view of pork. The porchetta sandwich is a little pricey for 10 bucks, but really I don't know if i'd want anything bigger than that. It's a lot of pork for one sitting. The ciabatta roll was crusty and warm and the pork oozes grease with every bite. Not sure if that's what i was expecting. Some bites had definite crush, but I'm not sure if I want to repeat the experience. If I go back, maybe i'll try one of the daily specials.
