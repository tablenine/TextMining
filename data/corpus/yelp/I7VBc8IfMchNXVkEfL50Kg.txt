Delicious!!! . I have been here three times (three consecutive Valentine's Days) and I always look forward to it. They have ample seating but it still has a romantic vibe, you dont feel like you are on top of other patrons. I have sat in three different parts of the dining room but I liked the furthest back the best. You can see the rest of the crowd but it is quite and very romantic. . . Every year I get the salad from the specials menu. This salad is big enough for two and it something you wont get anywhere else. It is huge, with full pieces of cucumber, carrot and beet. The dressing is a Cesar type that has a nice bite. Once you figure out out to eat it, it is very good. . . I have had the half moons with brown butter sauce and have also tried the salmon ravolini. Both are rich and delicious. Also, enough to share if you would like. The basil cream sauce for the salmon dish really complimented the fish well. Â  Also the bread and olive oil they serve before your meal is very good (but dont fill up on it!) . . Also, Sergio the waiter is funny and helpful when it comes to picking out a dish. This is a great place for a romantic evening for sure! Cant wait until next Valentine's Day!
