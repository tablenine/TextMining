Okay.  So I've come here a pretty decent number of times.  I've had breakfast, brunch, lunch, and--just recently--dessert!!. . Breakfast/brunch:  Pretty good.  Lots to choose from!  And all their different coffees and teas are great adds.. . Lunch:  They've seriously won me over because of one single item.  Sweet potato fries.  I don't know what it is about those things, but I just LOVE them!!  Anywhere I can find them, I just can't stop myself from loading up.  But I have this bizarre inner struggle, because I also like regular fries a whole bunch.  This place solved all my problems:  they let me have half and half.  . . Dessert:  Holy moly!!  I never came here for dessert til recently.  I ordered some kind of chocolatey cake and my friend ordered one of the cheesecakes.  Fantastic!!  I felt that indescribable happiness that only comes from experiencing deliciousness dancing on your tastebuds........
