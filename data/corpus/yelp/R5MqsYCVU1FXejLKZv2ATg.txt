The gelato is delicious here!  I had the Vanilla Crunch, and the Casada gelato.. . Previously for dinner I had a pasta dish that the server recommended.  It was a shell pasta with sausage and tomatoes.  When the pasta arrived it looked really small, but it was more than filling.. . Pasta + Soda + Gelato = $25
