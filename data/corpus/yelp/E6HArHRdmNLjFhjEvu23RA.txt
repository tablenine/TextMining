Great place to meet friends, have brunch with messy hair and sunglasses and just to relax and enjoy a nice meal.  Had brunch with my boyfriend  - eggs &amp; sausage, eggs benedict and the yogurt with granola.  The yogurt and granola was so good - crunchy, toasted just right,  cinnamon, greek yogurt and delicious berries.  The coffee was perfect!!
