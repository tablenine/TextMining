Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Went to see what all the hub-bub was. Milk is a total lunch spot with salads and panini style sandwiches. The baked goods looked visually stimulating and I was really excited about all the ice cream concoctions. I got the Chopped Cobb Salad with Green Goddess dressing which was ok, the dressing was a little too tangy for my tastes. My friend got the Media Noche sandwich which was underwhelming, there are way better Cuban sandwiches out their. Â Of course we couldn't leave without hitting up the sweets. I got the Banana Peanut Malt shake and a Toffee Coffee Bon Bon. The Banana shake was really good, super indulgent, and after 4 sips my stomach felt it. I couldn't even finish 1/2 of it and had to throw it out because it was so rich and sweet. The Bon Bon on the other hand was just the perfect amount of sweetness to pop in my mouth after lunch. My friend got the Milkie Way Malt and her ass downed that shit. She later texts me and asks if I'm in a sugar coma. I was actually passed out on my bed and have decided to swear off deserts from now on (yeah right). All in all Milk is a good place to satisfy a sweet tooth but I'd pass on lunch and just get right to the point.
