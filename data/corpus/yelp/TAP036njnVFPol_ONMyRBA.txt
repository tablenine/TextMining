Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This is one of those, been there once dont need to go ever again.. If I do end up there again I'll get a plain old chicago style hotdog. . While the menu items do look appealing and on a level exciting, they are way overdone and I guarantee you'll still be digesting your Martha Stewart dog a week later.
