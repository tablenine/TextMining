I've been to this place a few times for dinner in the past couple of months, most recently tonight, and it's kind of a toss-up.  It seems to me that in order to get good food one must suffer through poor service, and to get good service one must suffer through poor food.  . The wait-staff seems to be either friendly but unskilled or mediocre and unconcerned on any given night. The food comes out quickly, but isn't always the best. Sometimes it's a bit on the cold side, other times it's lacking in taste.. . Overall I think it's a good place to hang out with friends, just don't go in expecting too much. Plus the drinks are good and the desserts are excellent.
