I've been here a couple of times and decided... this is the closest thing that I'll get to the ramen I had when I was in Osaka.  The noodles were perfect.  The broth was just right.  A nice, feel good meal with a bottle of Sapporo, too.  I've tried other ramen here and outside L.A., and this place is at the top of my list.  I recommend trying Tsukemen...I enjoyed dipping my noodles into my bowl.. . Sometimes it can get warm in there but that's if you are at the counter.  I usually don't like the wait, so I always go at a time where there isn't a crowd...yet.
