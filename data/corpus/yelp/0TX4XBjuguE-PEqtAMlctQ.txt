Yet another joint that I drive past every day to work. Didn't realize how many people have rated this place. They receive three stars for being little bitches with the serving of their fries. . . I pulled in the parking lot and didn't see any parking spots available. People made their own spots blocking others in and so I followed. as soon as I exited my car, I could've sworn Jackie Chan and his clan surrounded me. Just kidding. One Asian lady approached and I asked If I was blocking her car. She acknowledged me and I told her I would be ordering take out. . . The place is a bit small. I placed my order, triple pork burger(with Chorizo) and an order of hand cut fries. The fries had been advertised as being triple cooked. During my wait there I took the opp. to take pictures for this review and witness a few exchanges over parking. But hey, this is LA. . . Ten minutes later, I received my order and they forgot to put my drink inside of the bag. I noticed a big bulge wrapped in paper and a smaller one. I thought, " Did they forget the fries, too?" They assured me they didn't. Check my picture on the disgraceful serving of fries I received for $5.00. The missing drink and the fries cost them some valuable stars, here.. . I drove a few blocks away to enjoy my meal. I can't even begin to describe my disgust when I opened the package containing my fries. The burger was just outstanding! It was juicy, a little greasy, but just right.. . Oh, and that Asian lady was just a sweetheart helping me get out of that parking lot disaster. She actually walked onto La Brea Blvd. to make sure I got out safely. She was awesome!
