I went here one night with a group of people and had a really good time. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the double checking of the IDs when we got to the bar...There is a big outdoor area with heating lamps all over the place. Perfect for smoking/chilling in the fall or winter. I suggest going there first for a pre-gaming session, then go find a place where you can dance.
