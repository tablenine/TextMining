Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I like the restaurant in Taipei and the food here even though is not as good as Taipei store but still much better than the other dumpling places in L.A..... The dumplings are yummy and I like their spicy beef soup also. Â Try their stir fried string beans, which are pretty good....However, the line there is always crazy and the service is just okay.
