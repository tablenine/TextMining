Restaurant: Yuca&#39;s
Category: Mexican
My main reason for going to Yucas was the cochinita pibil. I ordered the torta with cochinita pibil it was really good. The meat was juicy and tender. My complaint is that the food is way over priced and the portions are really small. I also tried a carne asada burrito and it was good but small and square. I have never seen a square burrito before in my life. I would need to order 3 tortas a burrito and a taco to fill up. I can go to other places just as good and fill up on one burrito and an orchata. I wont be making the trek back here unless I am in the neighborhood. Over all good flavor but over priced and small portions.
