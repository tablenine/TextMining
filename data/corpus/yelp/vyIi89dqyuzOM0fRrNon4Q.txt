Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Solid burger joint in l.a.. . had the umami burger.... seems small but actually filled me up....great quality of meat, not sure what they use but you can taste the freshness and perfectly cooked medium pink center.... the mushrooms, parmesan crisp thing - nice combo..... . the place is a hole in the wall, smaller than the original FO in SM.... 2nd best burger in L.A. next to the office burger..
