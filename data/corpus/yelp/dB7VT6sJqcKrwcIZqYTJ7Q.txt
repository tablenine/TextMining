Restaurant: Agave Restaurant
Category: Tex-Mex
I was kind of underwhelmed by Agave. The drinks were good, but the food was so-so. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and you can tell it's kind of trending towards the hipster crowd with a Mexican flair.. . The choices on the menu are pretty good. Lots of fish, which I like, but when they came out, the dishes were kind of 'meh'. They were good, and Agave isn't super expensive, but I like my Tex-Mex a bit more exciting.. . I went with a big group and they have a GREAT group-sized table up on the balcony so you can chat and look down on the rest of the patrons. Fantastic spot for big groups.
