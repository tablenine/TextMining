This place is so overrated, old and smelly. I celebrated my b-day here last night and had the worst time of my life. We arrived 3 hours before dinner reservation. Waited in line for 2 or 3 different shows only to be told our possibility of getting in was slim to zero. We were finally given show tickets after dinner but it does not start until 2 hours later ( 11:15pm ) . By then we have been so tired of waiting around we just decided to leave. . . No Magic shows no matter how good is worth 5 hours of waiting in line. We paid the $25 entrance fee and did not even get to attend any of the shows. Their ticket and waiting in line system is an epic fail! Â I am sorely disappointed and will never return consider coming back here.
