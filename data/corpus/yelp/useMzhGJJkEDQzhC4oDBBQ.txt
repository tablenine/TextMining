A very cool young and fashionable Italian place.. Let's start with the space:. The place is all white, one very very big space. The kitchen is completely open and connected to where ou sit, so you can basically see how your food is being made.. Although this design definitely contribute to the cool look of the place, the disadvantage is very bad acoustic which makes it a very loud place.. . The service is really good and goes to the level of much more expensive places.. The food was very good. The dishes are not huge but also not expensive (going between $8 to $15). You can find a great variety of pastas, salads, appetizers and a few meat dishes. And don't forget to leave some space for deserts which are also quite good.. The crowed is mostly young hipsters with many beautiful faces around.. . All in all, great place to come with a few friends or a date where you are looking for a cool and easy atmosphere and not a romantic one.
