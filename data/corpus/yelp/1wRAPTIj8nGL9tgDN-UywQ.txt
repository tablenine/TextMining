Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Okay, it's good... but is a pastrami sandwich worth $10.50 plus tax? And fries for $3.50? To say it's overpriced would be the understatement of the year. And they only accept cash. Aren't they making enough of a margin on their food that they can afford the 3% charge for credit cards? It's not as if they have invested in decor over the years. They're open til the wee hours of the morning (3am), so that's a plus but I can't consciously give this place any more than 2 stars considering their outrageous price.
