Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Dig. Dig. Dig the Alcove.. . Hepcats, good grub, coffee &amp; fine desserts make-up the Alcove Cafe.  Where else can you sit under an umbrella of trees and be in a cornucopia of urbanites, artists, and the indie counterculture. It's a melting pot and a meeting place for  the "in the know" folks.. . I dig it.
