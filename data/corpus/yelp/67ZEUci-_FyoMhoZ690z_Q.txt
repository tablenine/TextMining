This place is just really good.  I love variety, so the small plate (tapas, I guess) style of ordering here is perfect for me.  The prices are definitely reasonable, the food comes out quick, and the decor is great.  My favorite things are the grilled eggplant in a sweet miso, the bread pork with onions, and the scallops in butter.  I am sure there are better places out there that serve this type of Japanese food, i.e. not sushi, and not homestyle (katsu, ramen, etc.), but unless you want to go to New York for dinner, this place will have to do.
