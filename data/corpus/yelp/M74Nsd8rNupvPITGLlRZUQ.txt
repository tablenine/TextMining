Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe's is always a crowd pleaser.  They aren't that cheap, but their waffles taste like vanilla ice cream.  In fact, when I make waffles and pancakes at home, I try to imitate their waffles.  If you haven't been, you're missing out.  There's tons of Roscoe's for a reason!
