Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
By process of thousands of years of evolution, I'm not the hunter-gatherer type.  I don't really enjoy entering an establishment and then having to scope out my table, elbowing other patrons out of my way (instead of clawing them, of course).  Every woman for herself, survival of the fittest -- that's the way of Father's Office.. . Luckily I have some friends who don't mind such a situation, and they speared us a nook in the back room.  We then clamored at the bar to order, gathering our own beverages, too.  What the heck is the appeal here? You had to wonder.. . At first bite, however, a bit of redemption; I loved the sweet potato fries, and the staff/owner can certainly boast to having a unique burger (the caramelized onions sell it, in my opinion).  I'd have to agree with Joshua V. on the ketchup issue, though.  I mean really, at what point did requesting ketchup warrant a snub at any LA eatery?  Pardon me for being so gauche.  . . In the end, I'm glad I finally tried the infamous Father's Office burger, but seriously?  This is no casual bar.  Why go to such great lengths to hide that it's really a hip restaurant with an extensive beer list?  Organize the seating issue and get some darn Heinz in there and I'd be a happier yelper.
