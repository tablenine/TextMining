Downtown keeps getting better and better - and Wurstkuche is a wonderful example.. It has it's own attitude and ambiance.  It's rough - incomplete yet controlled.  The variety of sausages and beers to match up with them is impressive.. I had the Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with jalpeno and the Hot Italian sausages with an order of french fries and a beer (I am not much of a beer drinker - so I randomly chose one off the menu).. . The meat sausages are all enclosed in pork casings and grilled.  The Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit sausage (their alleged best seller) was very tasty.  I had it simply on a grilled roll (nothing great about the roll - but I am glad they toasted it as it made it a bit crustier), with sauteed onions and spicy peppers.  No mustard although they provide a solid selection from Atomic to mustard seed mustards.  It was pretty delicious.  Snappy - not fatty and flavorful.  The Hot Italian was flavorful and not too spicy - again no grizzle or excessive fat and very good.  Again I had it on a toasted roll with onions, spicy peppers no mustard.. The fries were very good.  Crisp - thicker cut Belgian style with a multitude of options for dipping sauces.  I chose ketchup - barbecue and my favorite truffle oil.. The back seating is a bit sketch as it still looks like a place in progress or a state school commissary - but it was fine and actually part of the charm.. This is basically a take out/fast food  place with seating and a great selection of beers.. The service was slow - but worth the wait.  . I truly like it - wish it was closer but I'm glad it's not.
