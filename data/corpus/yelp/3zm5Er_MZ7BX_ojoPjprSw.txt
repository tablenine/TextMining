So I was new to LA and everyone at work one day was talking about all the celebrities they have seen out and about throughout the years.  Desperate to see a celebrity, (not that i care about hollywood in the least bit, but because I know when I go home everyone will want to know which celebrities I've run across), I asked where to go.  A few people said to have brunch at Toast.. . One day I went shopping at the Beverly Center and decided to have brunch here by myself.  There was a very short wait for a table for one, so that was nice.  Unfortunately though, I didn't see any celebrities that I know of, though I think I probably see more than I know because I don't ever recognize them....  Anyway..... . I had the eggs florentine.  It was good, not the best I've ever had, but quite large and definitely not bad at all.  I ended with the toast coffee, which had chocolate in it and was topped with whipped cream and had a few little cookies on the side.  It was actually delicious, like really really delicious.  I will go back solely for the toast coffee. (and B-list celebrities, supposedly...)
