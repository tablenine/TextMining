Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
So I was talked into Ugo by a friend....not really talked into it as I drive by on my way home and always wondered but none the less I ended up eating here on a Tuesday night. Now I consider myself a bit of an Italian food expert as I come from an Italian family and absolutely love pasta and bread. Â . . So first things first the ambiance is great. It's cozy and they have heaters everywhere...so you stay nice and toasty if you end up outside. The service was great, our waiter was super funny and checked on us frequently. Everything is good up to this point now lets talk food.. . The bread that was served to start with was so-so, in truth it was a little undercooked for my taste. Bread is supposed to be light an d fluffy not gooey and moist (unless its cake). The oil and vinegar was a plus though. We ordered the calamari which was EXCELLENT. The spicy dipping sauce was delicious and the calamari was cooked perfectly. Then came my main course, the mushroom chicken over spaghetti. I have honestly never tasted something so bland in my life. The chicken was cut way to thin, so thin in fact that it was over-cooked and I could barely cut it. The sauce had NO flavor what so ever and I was truly disappointed as my friend had talked so highly of this place. Then we decided to splurge and get dessert. I ordered the Napoleon it was decent. The top layer and the filling was good but the rest of the dessert was well......ehhhhhh.. . I probably won't go back especially since downtown Culver City has such a great variety of places with superb food.
