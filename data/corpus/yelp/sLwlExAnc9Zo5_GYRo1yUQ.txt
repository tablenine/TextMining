Restaurant: Bone Garden Cantina
Category: Mexican
Bone Garden has alot of character to it and the food is fresh. Located in an industrial park, it has the whole warehouse feel to it and I believe the artwork is done by the owners. The 3 massive paintings that dominate one wall are amazing, Â I only wish they would add a little more with the giant open space they have.. . They were playing some really good music and yeah, it can be loud but you should know that by now with this kind of setup.
