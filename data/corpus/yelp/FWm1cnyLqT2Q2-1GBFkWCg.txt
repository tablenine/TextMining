Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The burger was good, but not as good as I anticipated.  The review on LA. com said the waitstaff was grumpy, rude, and unaccomodating.  That wasn't the case.  Had a slice of apple pie a la mode which wasn't bad.  I guess I'm a bit picky when it comes to an expensive burger.  I prefer Father's Office.
