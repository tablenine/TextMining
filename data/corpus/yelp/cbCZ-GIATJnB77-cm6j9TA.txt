I've been twice and thinks it's a pretty good place to go. I've had kind of iffy service both times, once by a rushed, pushy waitress and once by a very S-L-O-W waiter, but both times the food has been really tasty. The biscuits and gravy was delish and the breakfast burrito was very good. When you can't wait an hour and a half to eat at M Henry, this is a good alternative in the neighborhood. And in the summer, they have a shady little sidewalk cafe on the side street.
