Decor is a little dated and its a little pretentious here.  The martini's are good with unique flavors from their resident mixologist.  The food on the other hand is salty and very greasy.  This place is for lazy people.  If you want crab goto Redondo Beach, if your happy with this, you might as well save your money and goto Boiling Crab.
