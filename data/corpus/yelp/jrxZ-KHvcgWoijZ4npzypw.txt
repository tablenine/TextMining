Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I'm suprised with the mediocre reviews Orochon is getting. This is one of the better Ramen place in LA.  The wait can be a little annoying sometimes as it does get packed here, but I really like their soup base. . . They have so many levels of Spicy, you can really narrow it down to the level you want.  My favorite soup base is the Shio (Salt) base.  Sounds like the most plain one, but to me, it tastes the best.
