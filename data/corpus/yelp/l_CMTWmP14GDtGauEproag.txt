My first time here was about 3 years ago. It was the same day as gay pride parade going on right outside.. . *came with LA friends in the morning to get food and nurse day 4 hangover.. *Took about one hour to get down first beer. Then I ate. Then I vomited.. *Took about 20 minutes to get down second pitcher.. *More people joined us. More food was ordered. More pitchers were bought.. *Day turned into night. (when day drinking goes terribly wrong.). *Lesbians sat at the booth next to ours.. *I threw food at them for no reason at all. (Im not a gay basher). *They got upset.. *I told our waitress (who was also from road rules) to put their drinks on our bill.. *She told me that they were drinking Coke. Coke had free refills.. *I went up to the table and the only explanation I could muster up was, "sorry, I've been here for 10 hours.". *They understood. All was well.. . -By the By, best menu in the world.
