This place is pure awesome.  The decor is awesome.  The service is awesome.  The food is twice as awesome.. . I had the mussaman short ribs and they were so tender I put away my knife and just dug in.  The pearl onions in the veg wasn't very good, but I just put them aside and kept going.  The pad thai is fairly hearty, and the starters are very good too.  The calimari was fresh and crisp, and the sauce is good.. . The meals I have had here are very well balanced with spices and really pack a punch.  It is fairly pricy, though I think it is worth it
