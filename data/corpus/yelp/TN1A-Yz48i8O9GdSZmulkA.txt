Restaurant: Cafe Sunflower Buckhead
Category: Vegetarian
The Sunflower Cafe never disappoints. I have been several times with my veggie and non-veggie friends and no one has walked away with anything other than positive comments. This includes a meat and potatoes military type!. I always enjoy the faux-meat options because there are so few options outside of the grocery store freezer. If you are going to fake it, do it right and this place does! . They also have a nice drink menu with options you will not find at every restaurant which is always a treat. . The vegan cakes are adored by my friends with a sweet tooth. . Worth a try even if you are a carnivore.
