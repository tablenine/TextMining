I havent been here in years, but a cousin wanted her birthday lunch here.  Says they have the best veggie burger....at a steak house???  How does that work.. . Glad the spinich dip was as good as I remembered.  . . Remembered why we havent been in a while.....my cousins and I pulled into the parking lot at the same time, but I got to the door before she did, so I go in and tell the lady...yes...theres 3 of us...and she says....oh....I cant seat you until everyone is here.  I'm like lady...they are in the parking lot....its going to be less than a minute, she tells me...oh...u are welcome to sit at the bar...but I cant seat you until everyone is here.. . I walk outside and my cousin is coming up the walkway....I explained the seating comment to her and she goes in.....I'm pratically walking on her heels and she tells the greeter...there's 3 of us....and the lady looks me dead in the face, less than a whole minute later than our conversation, and she says to my cousin....oh....is your entire party here.  . . Bitch....u know our party is here....I'm standing here with two other people arent I??. . I dont like places where they are so POMPUS when really all they are is a chain resturant that serves OK food.  Our service was slow, and my cousins swore it was because I did say to the lady....."U know our entire party is here."  . . and . . Maybe it was because of that, but if I was a waitress, I wouldnt mess up my tip because the greeter had pissed off a customer.. . Oh yeah....it was 1 in the afternoon on a Sunday....not 7 or 8 on a Friday or Saturday evening....where I could see a rule like that having an affect....but even then....not if my party is parking the car.. . Slow service, but the food was ok...and the conversation made my visit all the more better.  Will I go here again...maybe in another 10-15 years.
