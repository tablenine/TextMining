Horrible horrible service!. . I came here for a friend's birthday and we had the worst service EVER. First, the night was perfectly fine, but when a larger table was seated in the same area, our waitress completely ignored us. Also, when receiving our meal, a couple of people ordered a side of rice with their order. We tried to flag down our waitress, but she was no where to be found. Instead of waiting, they slowly ate what they had ordered and tried to flag someone down. They took so long that my friends finished their food and FINALLY their rice came.. . Getting the check was a whole other story, but we ended up wasting about 30 minutes to an hour waiting for her to come give us our check.. . Other than the horrible service, the place was gorgeous and ambiance was nice, but the food wasn't all that great, especially for the price. At the end, I didn't really get what all the hype was about...
