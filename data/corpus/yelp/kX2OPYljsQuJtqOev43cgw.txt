Super small yet super expensive plates, tapas style.  Mainly all vegetarian (some vegan) with a few non-vegggie dishes.  You have to order at least 5 dishes per person to feel like you ate something, 10 to be satisfied. The dishes are remarkable and creative, but it will break your budget and leave you still hungry.
