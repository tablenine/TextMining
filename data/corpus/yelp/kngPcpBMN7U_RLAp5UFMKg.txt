How disappointing...this review makes me the customer very say to write. . . First off:. I had family in town and so we decided to head over to Fox Grill after doing a little shopping in Atlantic Station. I recommended this place to enjoy great food and a great time while watching on the big screens throughout and indulge in some food of our choice. . . Second off:. We had the waiter from attitude with a switch in his walk (not judging but here we go!). . 2 of my cousin's meals came out incorrectly. One meal was rock cold as if it was waiting on the others to get prepared. Which is unacceptable in my book..(Place it in the warmer) Ok so, my other cousin ordered a wrap without the chicken and replaced it with salmon. . Now, the menu said nothing about avocados but yet a salmon wrap had avocados in it. The chicken wrap did not even say anything about avocados either-. My thoughts as well! - Avocados what?? Huh? WTF! Not a good look or taste for that matter. . Of course, we spending our hard earn money and so this dish had to go!. . And oooooh noooooooo! Why, did we return anything for that matter?? Our switch down the ale waiter stomp his feet, kick and screamed as if he owned the joint and he personally made this wrap with special care and how dare we not like it...better yet love it!...toooooo much I tell ya! . . You all know me: . MANAGER! I screamed for a manager to the top of my lungs! (Kidding) however, I did ask nicely..because at the end of the day or meal in this case, we were not paying for nothing to get rude service. (Sorry pal). . It was all down hill from here...FOX GRILL = NOT! . What a shame, this place does have potential. ;-(
