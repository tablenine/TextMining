Restaurant: Wahoo! A Decatur Grill
Category: American (New)
Wahoo! gets 4 stars for ambiance, 4 stars for service, 5 stars for dessert (coconut cake), and 2 stars for dinner.  The mister had a much better dinner, though, so we'll average that out at a 3.  My dinner- the avocado wrap- was disappointing.  I've had better wraps at Roly Poly.  But Mark really liked the trout, so I should probably give Wahoo another shot and pick something else on the menu.  Or maybe they just don't do vegetarian fare as well.. . The atmosphere is great- the inside has a comfortable, understated elegance, just like a true Southern lady.  The patio is oh-so-romantic with soft, twinkling lights.  The service is friendly and perfectly paced.. . And the dessert!  Oh, the dessert!  After our first bite of the thick, moist cake covered in creamy, sweet icing and the exact right amount of flaky coconut...our eyes met...narrowed...and the battle of the forks ensued.  We tore into that poor slice of cake with an unholy passion, desperate to fill our mouths with the sublimely sinful goodness.  And despite our attempts to out-do each other by getting the most forkfuls of cake, it was such a large slice that it actually became a struggle to finish it off.   We managed, though.  I can't wait to try the other desserts, although I doubt they can beat the supreme perfection of the coconut cake.  Mmmm mmm mmm.
