I've only only been to this place twice and both times I had lunch.  The first time I wasn't in a cuban mood so I just had tuna, which was dry and unappealing.  I thought because the prices are so low I would give it a second chance, so I went back and ordered the cuban.  Overall the sandwhich was just okay.  The plantain chips they serve with the sandwhich are also flavorless.  They have a couple really good croquettes though.  The prices are so low (which I think why this place has been rated so highly) one can experiment and still get out of their under $7, but unless you have to, I wouldn't go at all. 2.5 stars.
