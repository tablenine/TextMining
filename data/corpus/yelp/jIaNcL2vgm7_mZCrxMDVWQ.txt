Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My goodness i love this place.  It's so...."Fatisfying."  And that's a good thing, ladies and gentlemen.  . . Every time I go to Roscoe's  I always come away feeling fat.  But that's what makes it so satisfying.  Roscoe's gives huge portions and no matter what you order it is guaranteed to be good.  On top of that, the service there is top notch.  Efficient and friendly.  . . Jeanne Jones.  My love.  Your omelets are amazing.  The chicken, and cheese, while simple, make a great dish.  Accompanied by a waffle and a biscuit with gravy make the ultimate meal that keep a man coming back for more.  Rest assured, I will never cheat on you.. . Finally, get a refreshing sunrise drink.  They are simply amazing.  Each sip brightens my day.  I always save a third for after the meal to help me walk to the car.  Otherwise I would just fall asleep from all the food I had just eaten.
