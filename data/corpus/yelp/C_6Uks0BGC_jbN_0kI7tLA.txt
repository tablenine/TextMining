Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I LOOOOOVE the Little Door.  I don't think you understand.  I LOVE THE LITTLE DOOR.. . I live in the neighborhood and this is the perfect place to start or end your night.  The wine selection is amazing and while the waiters are a little pretentious, just wear some Dior Show mascara (good recc, Nina) ... bat your eyelashes ... and say you want to start off with a nice dry Chardonnay while you look over a menu that has succulent choices from Halibut to Filet Mignon.. . I am telling you - this is a great place to have a truly wonderful dinina experience as well as a great place to meet friends and have a couple bottles of wine.  I am a total WIN-O and ordered about 3 bottles here and was not disappointed by any of them.  My friends and I have also done our fair share of celebrity spotting here so it is the perfect place to take your lookee loo friends that want to see Dave Navarro get up 7 times to go to the bathroom ahem ahem...... . I beg you to try this place.  It's pleasant, classy, but it definitely does not necessitate you to dress up the way Hatfield's does.  This is the perfect place for the young girl/guy on the town that wants to have some good food and get a good wine buzz goin'!
