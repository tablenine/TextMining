Restaurant: Loteria Grill
Category: Mexican
The best mexican food in town. I go out of my way to eat at Loteria as often as possible, and bring out-of-town guests all the time.. . The spicy carnitas are a heat lover's dream, and the mole is sublime and complex and smoky and sweet. All of the tacos are quite amazing -- heck, this place even has me craving nopalitas (cactus)!
