Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Ordered the half-chicken with two waffles.. . Steps to enjoy:. 1) butter waffles. 2) strip fried chicken off bone and place on top of waffles. 3) pour syrup over chicken &amp; waffles. 4) add hot sauce provided to personal taste. 5) begin eating. . These are the best waffles I've had. Way better than typical Belgian waffles you get at diner's. They not as light and insubstantial as Belgian waffles. They stick to your ribs.
