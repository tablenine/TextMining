if this restaurant wasnt located on sunset and wasnt so overpacked all the time i'd come every week. their blueberry sour cream pancakes were so good, it was like having a heaping dollop of blueberry yogurt on top of my pancakes. i never knew yogurt would make a good pairing with pancakes (or in this case- sour cream). my big belly could only handle about 1/4 of the plate so i'd advise girls who care about their waist size to share with a couple girls (or a special boy). . . the thing about this place is that it's cramped and you're pretty much 1 foot away from the table next to you. i guess if you dont mind sitting next to people like me, who like to stare at what you're eating, it shouldnt matter. there always seems to be at least a 10 min wait for a table with no real waiting areas...it sucks but it's semi worth it. if it werent for the location of this restaurant, i would come much more often.
