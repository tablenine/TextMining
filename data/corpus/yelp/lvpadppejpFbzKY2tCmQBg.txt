Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Sure it's nice and clean, especially for an asian restaurant. Sure, it tastes ok, and it is conveniently located in the LA area. But if you're a foodnatic looking for some real pho with good broth, this isn't the place for you. The broth here tastes awfully bland. This place has got the ambiance, hipster crowd, and a good location... but is somewhat lacking in the flavour department. Bummer.
