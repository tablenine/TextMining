Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant

Normally I don't give any place that does shabu shabu with just boiling water anything more than 2 stars. After all I can just buy the thinly sliced beef from Mitsuwa and shabu shabu it around in a pot of boiling water at home and probably get more slices of beef for less money. However, the owner at Shabu Shabu was so nice I have to give this place 3 stars. He mixed the sauces for my friend and I. How many shabu shabu restaurant owners does that? He was so nice. . . The crappy thing about this place is that ... well...there's no decoration whatsoever inside. It's just walls. It looks kinda ghetto. If you've ever hot pot in flavored broth, the beef in plain boiling water thing just doesn't really quite hit the spot anymore. The wait is long, even on week nights. . . I think I might come back to place again if I'm in the area. I really did enjoy my iced coffee. Ooh if you decide to try this place out, they do validate. So don't forget your parking ticket.
