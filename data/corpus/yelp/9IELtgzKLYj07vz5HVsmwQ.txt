This is a great neighborhood place, and is REALLY affordable.  I've gone here a few times with friends, but I most recently went this week for their "Recession Special", which is $12.99 surf or turf. . . So I ordered the steak, and was greeted about 10-15 minutes later with a steak so large I wondered if I should look around for the cow-carcass somewhere in the restaurant.  Remember that piece of meat that tips over Fred Flintstone's car at the beginning of the show? That's what they bring you when you get the "turf", along with mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus.  After the first half of the steak I was full, after the next quarter of the steak I was just eating on pride, and I couldn't finish the last quarter of it.  I am not a guy who usually leaves food on his plate, so this is impressive. . . But it's not just a place to get cheap steak.  Other times that I've been there, they had excellent pasta dishes, and great lasagna. They also have a great wine list with a few wines by the glass.  I'd recommend any of the ports or riojas.
