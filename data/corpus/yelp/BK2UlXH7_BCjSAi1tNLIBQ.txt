Very nice ambiance and waiters always came by to re-fill my water... always a plus!  The menu is not that extensive but I had some chicken breast, snap peas and potatoe puruee (mashed potatoesss!) that was delicious and filling!  One down-side, they don't give you bread unless you ask.  Great if you're on a diet (which I am CONSTANTLY on despite being in LOVE with food) but kinda shady no?  At least those who ask know their bread is fresh!  It's not bread untouched and recycled to your table!  My mate had the kobe burger which looked delicious and came with garlic fries!!  Definitely a winner for a cute date place and here's a trick - everytime there's a full moon (which apparently goes for 3 days), there's a set menu with appetizer/main entree/dessert with or without wine for 38 or 54.  That's cheap if you come ready to eat, cuz the portions are normal!
