Much bigger than its sister establishment in Santa Monica! It's a little dark inside but otherwise, it's a great atmosphere/place to hang out and drink with your friends any day of the week. They have lots of beers on tab, I think a little more than Third Street Bar. I didn't have the burger or the Sweet Potato Fries here but I tried it in the Santa Monica location and I'm sure it's just the same - delicious. Parking is plenty and the staff was friendly as well. I would definitely go again but it's a little pricey for me to make it a regular bar.
