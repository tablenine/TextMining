so me and my friend had heard lots of good things about whole foods hot bar...so we opted to go there for lunch today.. . We went straight to the bbq section and got the bbq baked beans, pulled pork, and honey chicken wings......we poured bbq sauce all over it and headed for the checkout line.....kinda scared because its 8.99lb.. . My meal was only 6.60.....so I was happy! we sat down in the booths they have by the checkout and ate our beans.......EWWWWW....they were so nasty...i started to think those yelpers that said the food taste better than they look were right.....so on to the pulled pork with bbq sauce.....MMMMMHHHHH DELISH.....i looked at my friend and was like "i can't even lie this pork is bomb"...then we bit into our honey chicken wings.....and once again mhhhhh....DELISH...he was like what are these...they are sooo good....so needless to say i will be back to get the honey chicken wings and pulled pork somthered in their BOMB bbq sauce. I also would like to try their pizza......:)they are too pricey though!
