Very good food for the price. It's set in a strip mall but has the atmosphere and food quality of a topnotch midtown Thai spot. They take reservations but you probably won't need them. We walked in on a Saturday night at 9pm with no wait at all. The sushi and Thai were both excellent! It's about a 10 minute drive from midtown up to Briarcliff but it's well worth it. You'll pay less and still get great food! . . If you like to challenge yourself with spicy food, order the "Drunken Noodles". This may have been the spiciest thing I have ever eaten! But the flavor was fantastic.
