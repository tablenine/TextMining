Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Fred 62 is a pretty casual diner. The menu is HUGE and has a really godo selection of everything, from breakfasts, to sandwiches to good deserts. The location is great, right in the heart of Los Feliz and near a lot of other cool things in that area. The food was pretty tasty and the service was good. The hostess was super nice in trying to get us a table while we waited outside in the hot sun. I'll be sure to go back and try some othe the other items on the menu.
