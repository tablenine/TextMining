We've been coming here since both my wife and I were in grad school.  Walking through the funky backdoor that makes you wonder if you're going in through the right way... in through the little market, and finally to their food counter.  In those days this was kind of the dinner we looked forward to having here and there... Not super expensive, but not a huge $5 burrito... Now that we both work, we get to have it more frequently... That's definitely a good thing!. . Food's always great.  The employees have always been wonderful.  One of the sons(?) tonight was exceptionally cool to talk to.  Even though there was a short line after us, he took his time chatting it up with us.  Tried to convince my wife to try the Greek version of the San Pellegrino lemonade... "not because I make commission, but because it's part of my culture"... and "I want you guys to get a unique experience since you can get this other stuff anywhere else...".  . . While we didn't end up with this, we ended up a dessert called Loukoumades.  Warm, deep fried, chewy... and dipped in honey... That's a recipe for "damn I should have gotten the bigger order..."  Seriously... while I love the food, I look forward to our next trip here for more of the Loukomades.... especially since he taught us a way to compliment the chef was to say "loukeme" (?) or something along those lines, which is supposed to mean very tasty....
