1. WAY too pricey for even simple items. 2. Obviously care more about creating a trendy decor than a real quality sushi menu. 3. Hard to navigate book-style menu. Was there with a group of four, and we must have spent over 10 minutes flipping back and forth through the pages to figure out what we wanted. . 4. So few of the makis actually had raw fish! A lot of tempura-fried stuff. . 5. The sushi I ate was fine. Not amazing.
