Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
i have eaten at friendship a few times before, but it's been years.  i took a friend today on a $50 groupon (i really love those) .  i was kind of wondering how we would spend all of it.. . we got the app. platter for 2, it had lots of deep fried items-crab balls, egg rolls, rangoon, a couple of good spare ribs &amp; a couple nice gyoza.  too much batter &amp; deep fried, imo, but tasty.  all served with 3 sauces-hoisen, sweet/sour &amp; hot mustard (not hot at all).. . we got won ton soup with our entrees and it was excellent, the won tons were stuffed silly with pork, the broth was simple &amp; delicate.. . then we got the spinach salad with shaved beets &amp; carrots, carmelized walnuts, &amp; champaign vinegarette.  excellent.. . our entrees were mustard walnut shrimp &amp; sesame beef.  both were extremely sweet.  too sweet.  the beef was exactly like sweet &amp; sour pork, a little chewy, and again, a lot of batter.. the shrimp were large &amp; served with julienne peppers.  i thought it was too sweet.. . i know this place is a  favorite chinese on the north side, but i don't know.  i just have not been very thrilled with any chinese food in chicago.  there are other asian places that rule heavily over our choices of chinese food in this city.  . . or it could be that i don't really like chinese food that much?  it can't be true, because i ate plenty of it when i was working in japan &amp; thailand, mostly dim sum &amp; cheap chinese.  but they did it SO good over there.  . . if i return to friendship, i will get that spinach salad &amp; the won ton soup.  maybe a side of ribs.  and some gyoza.  . . the service was excellent and i took a lot of food home with me.
