I had the (Vienna beef) hotdog with onions and mustard.  She had the same thing but with Chili and onions instead.  We shared a basket of fries.  Those hotdogs are awesome, grilled perfectly, you know your mouth is watering now.  And if it isn't, then you don't know nathans about hotdogs.  . . The place is open til 2:30am I think.  So the next time you are driving around drunk, starving and feeling rejected because you got dissed by every single girl that you tried to pick up even the big boned one, stop by Johnnie's and buy yourself a comfort dog.  Tell'em Vin sent yah!
