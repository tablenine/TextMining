This place being a block from my loft is an absolute disaster. I cannot afford to like this place as much as I do... Okay, disclaimer said. Now on with the good stuff.. . EPIC WIN on eating FOOD. Can we talk about getting a bunch of little plates and just eating them like a fat kid off his meds?? BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Good for you, fat boy, because you're ordering VEGETABLES and LIKING them! No, seriously. Brussel Sprouts? That I WANT to EAT? Something is amiss here. Bottega Louie, are you lacing my sprouts with crack!? Okay, I forgive you.. . Chicken Carcioffi is one of my favs, the pizza is more legit than 2Pac on the street, and if you can't find something that appeals to you on this more than variegated menu then you're probably from another planet and won't survive long in our uniquely oxygenated atmosphere anyway.. . Bottega Louie. I love you. So does my bankruptcy lawyer.. . OH, WAIT! FREE SPARKLING BUBBLE WATER!. . Token gesture, guys? I'll take it. ;)
