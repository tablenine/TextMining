I liked it a lot.. Cubans aren't experts at Mexican cuisine typically, but I have hung around with enough Mexicans over the years to identify what is and isn't good.. This was good.. I got the shrimp enchiladas and tacos de lengua (tongue taco - I know, but I was with someone recommending it and he swore by it).. Washed it all down with a tamarind drink.. Really really good - even the tongue.. . If you have a hankering for real authentic Mexican food, try it out.  Why not 5 stars?  Dunno - maybe the vibe wasn't quite there for me but I'll definitely be back and bring enough folks such that we can create our own vibe.
