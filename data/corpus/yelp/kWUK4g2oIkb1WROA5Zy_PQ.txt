This is my heaven for Hainan Chicken rice, even the Hainan Chicken rice in China cannot satisfy me...  I tried a bunch!  Even the ones around town, I think not!. . Yes, there are huge lines and a waiting list here!  But, it's all to get that Hainan chicken goodness!  If I can't wait and I call ahead and order togo!  I always get my Hainan Chicken, all white, and if I come someone always orders All Dark, so it's perfect, so NO extra charge!  ^)^    The rice is what makes the place and there must be some secret method, plus their ginger sauce is to die for!  I always ask for gobs and make my chicken "swim" in it!. I, also, like their Pizza bread and Shrimp Rolls! Love them both! Woohoo, writing about it is making my mouth water!. . Looks like another trip out to Savoy Kitchen!  It's not a must try, but a Must GO!
