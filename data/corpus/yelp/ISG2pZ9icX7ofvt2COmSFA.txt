Wow This place is amazing. I had a few of the friends from yelp say it was really good ! So I had to try this place out already. I mean how can you go wrong if it has been there for 100 years already !! I am a little bummed that I didn't get to try it out sooner than now ! . . I had the beef dip not double dip because to me one dip already in that sauce is good enough. I don't really like soggy bread. The sandwich was really really good though! It had the right amount of meat and the right amount of sauce! I enjoyed it a lot and I have to say that I was really full after eating it. . . I didn't order any sides just because I wanted to save room for dessert and try out that tapioca pudding that a lot of yelpers were writing about. . . I had the pudding and that was my first time having tapioca pudding. It was a little bit sweet for me and I don't think I liked it. I would say stick with the sandwich and you'll love it ! :) . . Oh by the way the sandwich isn't at all expensive ! :) Also the lemonade which is like 70 cents or something like that is very very small so if you want maybe you should order two.
