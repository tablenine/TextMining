In terms of having brunch or dinner, Uncommon Ground is never my first choice. I think it'd probably be cool to get a cup of coffee or the occasional drink, but when I went there after Kuma's rejected my party of 10, it was very underwhelming. Plus, I was starving. I think I got the burger...or maybe it was pizza.. . See? Forgettable. Plus, I remember it being really overpriced and the wait staff being kind of flighty. Meh.
