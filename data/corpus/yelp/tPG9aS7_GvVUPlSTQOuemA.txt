I was inclined to like this place because it has the same name as a bar on Clybourn Ave. that I used to love.   . . After several visits I have come to a few conclusions.. . 1)  The place is very loud.  At least it is on a Saturday night at 10 pm.  Do not come here expecting a quiet and romantic dinner.. . 2)  The beer selection is tremendous.  Lots of Belgians.. . 3)  The service is friendly.. . 4)  The food is pretty good.  Last time here we had flatbreads.  This is a fancy word for pizza.  I had the one with serrano ham, manchego cheese, and egg.  It was delicious.  I would like to be eating it right now.
