HOLY YUM YUM! This place is great. I took my mother &amp; grandmother (The experts on southern cuisine) here for Mother's Day since I hate crowds I did it the Monday before the actual holiday. So I cannot tell you what this place is like at peak times. We had a lovely lunch. My Mom and G'ma got The baked chicken &amp; dressing with collards and fried green tomatoes. I got the ribs which were not from a pig or cow, but the brontosaurus! They were huge &amp; yummy as well. This place also gave me something I had never had Pot liquor &amp; Crackling cornbread was so good! We also got peach cobbler to go, but my g'ma thought her's was too sweet.
