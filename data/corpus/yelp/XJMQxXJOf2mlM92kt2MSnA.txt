Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
Have been here many times, usually had decent experience.  Went there for brunch on 8/30/09, had a decent to mediocre food/service experience.  There were 4 of us, we wanted to split the bill evenly (in this day &amp; age, this seems like a very reasonable request), but 11 City Diner now only takes 2 forms of payment per check.  This is a new policy and is the reason why all 4 of us will not go back.  It's not like we asked for the bill to be separated.  Patrons should be accommodated, not asked to accommodate.  This is a very "aren't you luck to be here" kind of place, and it's just a mediocre diner.
