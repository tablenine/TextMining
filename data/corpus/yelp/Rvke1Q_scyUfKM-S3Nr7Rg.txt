Oh Fred 62, you taste so good after a few cocktails and late night dancing, but why oh why did you overcharge our credit card? Â I'm still pondering if the $6.00 overcharge to the mastercard is worth disputing, but I do hope the next time the boyfriend and I visit, you'll at least give us the refund.
