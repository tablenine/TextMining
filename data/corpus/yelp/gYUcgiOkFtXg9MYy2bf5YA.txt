I think that I am not enough of a hipster to really love this place.  Or maybe I am just too old.  I haven't been to a show at the Empty Bottle since 2003.  Eh.. . I hate the set-up.  I sat at the table next to the employee table and could see way too much of the kitchen.  I don't like that feature in upsale, nicely styled restaurants and I REALLY don't like it in this place.  . . The table was too small and there was too much crap on it to fit two dishes and two drinks.  Our waiter was fine.  The music was fine.  It was all pretty bland to me.  I also don't like waiting in the pool room at the EB for a table.  I reduse to sit on that nasty old couch and there really is nowhere else to sit while waiting in there.. . The food was good but not too exciting.  I was a vegetarian for 7 years and have had some pretty kick-ass meatless food.  This wasn't it.  I got the falafel which was..well...falafel.  Nothing different or special about it.  It wasn't too greasy which I appreciate but I also prefer to have a traditional sauce with it instead of mushy, overcooked, flavorless vegetables.  The pita was soggy which is kind of gross.. . I would not go here again unless I was in the area and, frankly, this area isn't what it once was (then again, I'm not the person I once was).  So really there's no draw for me.
