I am in love with the chicken currie crepe.  It's just amazing, and I order it almost everytime I stop in.  Sometimes I get the coq ou vin (is that how you spell it?) and once I had the seafood crepe, but the chicken still wine.  I also like their house salads, and the bread they bring out to you is really fabulous.  Then there is the vibe...this place is so mellow despite the fact that they really pack them in!  I prefer to sit up front by the windows (it's fun to people watch), and they have a really beautiful outdoor patio in the back.  The owner is always so nice and always smiles when we come in.  I don't know if he recognizes us, or he's just that kind of guy that makes you think he does.  Whatever he's doing, he's running this place right!!
