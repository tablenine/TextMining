So my UCLA friends and I were hungry one night and we ended up at Furaibo! We got there around 7pm on a Wednesday and it wasn't too crowded. I heard from other people that their Teba Saki chicken wings were really good so oddly enough, all 3 of us decided to get the dinner box with Teba Saki. The box included salad, teba saki, tonkatsu, shrimp, a broth with potatoes, carrots, and bacon, some random vegetables, rice, and miso soup. Â The wings definitely lived up to the hype so I was quite happy with that. The rest of the food in the box is your usual standard Japanese fare so nothing new or special there.. . All in all, it was pretty filling and the other 2 friends were satisfied while I still had some room left to spare. I was tempted to get the Hanpen cheese ($5) because all the Yelpers recommended it but decided not to. I guess the only downside would be the price. The entire box was about $14. Although it was a decent amount of food, there are better alternatives at more reasonable prices.
