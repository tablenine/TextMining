Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's is so good! Their guava strudel, guava with cheese, cheese roll, creme brulee are must haves! I also enjoy their fruit cup, fruit tarts and sourdough bread. Anytime I'm in LA, I have to stop by!. . I wish they would open a Porto's in the Bay Area. I miss it!
