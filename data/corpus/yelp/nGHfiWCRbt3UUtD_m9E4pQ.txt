A European, very open classy looking restaurant.  The restaurant has nothing to hide and that is a good thing as you can see how clean the whole operation runs.  The space is enormous and the wall to wall white, including the ivory colored marble and the subway tiles on the back wall makes this place appear even larger.. . This is a classy looking joint.  It has charm and European elegance with it high ceilings and ivory colored marble floors.  The place looks very clean as it is floor to ceiling white, but not sterile as it conveys an elegance rarely seen in this country.  . . The food is good, but not stellar and the prices reflect this as well.  You can get a nice meal for two with drinks for just under a bill.  A great place to take a date or just to start off the night.. . We had the Caprese which they served with real buffalo mozzerella and peeled tomatoes.  My lovely date had the mussels and clams which were very average, good, but average.  I had the ribeye and it too was good but not amazing.  They gave you an option of sauces, which they serve on the side, and I chose the gorgonzola.  The sauce was very salty and I did not use it at all.  . . We did not choose a desert as we were in a hurry to meet up with a pub crawl already in progress, but we had a few drinks to start.  The mojito was good and the beers I had, two pilsner urquells were delicious and so very reasonalble, $7 for 20 oz.  I'd go back just for that.. . It has only been open for a month and I think they're still working out the bugs, but for the most part they've got their act together.
