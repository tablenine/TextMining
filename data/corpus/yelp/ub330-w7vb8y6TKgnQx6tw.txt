Yes, you may see a star or two, yes, the food is good (there is better Japanese food out there), but it really isnt worth the hassle of making a reservation...their phone lines are always busy and it is difficult to get a same day reservation unless you call at 9am. Plus they are always late on calling you once you get to the restaurant (usually by about 15 min). . However, that being said, I am sure time and time again I will get on the phone at 10 am and call 20 times in a row waiting for the line to be free to experience the spicy tuna on crispy rice or the tuna and arugala salad...
