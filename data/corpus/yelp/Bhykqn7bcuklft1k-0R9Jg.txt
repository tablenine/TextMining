I shared the blue velvet cupcake and a grasshopper ice cream sandwich with someone.. . The ice cream sandwich was great.  Half of it was dipped in chocolate, giving it a thin crispy chocolate shell on one side.  The cookies were really soft even when cold.  I couldn't put it better than my friend's description: It's like a macaroon--crispy on the outside, soft and almost puffy on the inside.  I thought the ice cream was a bit too sweet, but it wasn't unpalatable.  The only thing keeping me from readily buying it in the future is the $4.50.  Really...4.50 for an ice cream sandwich better come close to perfection.  While this was good, it was not perfection.. . The blue velvet was just...way too sweet for my tastes.  The blueberries they used were all firm and sweet (though I wouldn't be surprised if they were candied in sugar).  I don't think I'd get this again, regardless of cost.  A bit of advice; if you get this and get an ice cream sandwich, eat this first.  The ice cream sandwich made the cake taste bland for some reason.. . If I were to come back, I think I'd skip anything with frosting on it.  Those ice cream sandwiches were awesome, but I have some sort of mental block about paying 4.50 for an ice cream sandwich.  Though for some reason, Pinkberry is justifiable to me despite costing more.
