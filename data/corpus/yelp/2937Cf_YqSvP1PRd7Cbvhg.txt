Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
The food is good, the alcohol flowing, the birthday champagne baths entertaining.. . My one-star rating has to do with my car which was valet'd there. I left my car in the valet and drove with some friends in a separate car to sober up in a nearby coffee shop. When I finally got back to the restaurant (12:30am) it was closed-- this was my bad.. . My beef (no pun) has to do with the fact that the valet left my car in their open lot UNLOCKED. Had I not come back that night (i.e., I fell asleep, I got hospitalized, I got captured by UFOs, etc) I'm almost certain someone would have come to my car, opened the door, and ransacked it.. . Is it really THAT much of a hassle to lock my car before you leave for the night, valet people? I mean c'mon!!!11 Luckily I had someone drive a spare key out to me so I could get home to write this negative review.. . I may yet one day come back to eat here-- I just won't be the one driving here.
