After reading all the reviews my expectations were set very high... and when we do this we typically get disappointed because it doesn't usually live up to all the good reviews.....And in this case it was absolutely NOT that way at all! . . Since it was our first time we ordered the sashimi deluxe.  The sashimi tasted like butter!  We also got the oysters which was very fresh but i think i prefer my oysters with lemon and tabasco. Other things include halibut, masago, giant clam and sweet potato tempura.  The only thing that was a little strange to me was the sweet shrimp, I don't think it tastes bad at all but it has a very strange texture....Takes some getting use to.  Also you have a choice to get the head from the shrimp deep fried or in a miso soup.  We got it fried and that was good.  But anything fried is usually pretty tasty =X . . At the end of it all, my stomach was happy.  When the bill came around I thought it would have been a lot more damage than it turned out.. So I definitely recommend sushi gen.
