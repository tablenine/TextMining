Wow. Fantastic. I've eaten sushi/sashimi around the country &amp; found Katsu-Ya (Studio City) to be the best in the continental U.S. The decor is simple &amp; stark, the food is anything but! EXCELLENT quality fish, creative combinations and just a delicious experience, start to finish. And for a reasonable price. Couldn't recommend more.
