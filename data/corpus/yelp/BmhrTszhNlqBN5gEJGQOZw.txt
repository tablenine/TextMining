Restaurant: Real Food Daily
Category: Vegetarian
eating at real food daily was like a ROLLER COASTER.. . . i started at the top when i walked in and saw all the cookies and brownies on display as we were walked to our table amongst the CROWD of people there! the restaurant was bustling!. . then the coaster accelerated higher when i was deciding what to order, the menu is so interesting w/ a USEFUL GLOSSARY on the back for all those inexperienced nonvegans!. . but as the wait for my food went on, my happiness dropped a little because we got three different servers and the last one to help us wasn't as cheery as the others. they brought me the wrong plate when our food came, but that didnt really bother me. . I got the TV dinner , which came w/ tempeh meat loaf (tasted a little sour and for some reason wasn't hot in temperature), some good mashed potatoes, and boiled veggies which i seasoned w/ some sea salt and sesame seeds at the table... . my dinner wasn't as good as my friend's enchiladas however! which had a kick of flavor! this is when the coaster came back up!. . i also got a latte which i got to sweeten w/ agave nectar. . and for dessert we ordered the peach/blackberry cobbler w/ rice ice cream, unfortunately the cobbler tasted bland, and was really small, but the ice cream made it better.. but the dessert took A LIFETIME to come. . got a cookie to go, chocolate chip, not bad not good. . over all i just feel great eating healthy but i think the taste takes some getting used to! and i think it's a little pricey
