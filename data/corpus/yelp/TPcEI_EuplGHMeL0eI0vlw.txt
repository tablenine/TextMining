Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I always have problems with high end ala carte steak houses. The steaks are usually over priced then they also rip you off on the sides. Mastro's fits this to a "T"-bone(pun). I was there with a large group for a friends b-day, thankfully someone else was paying.I will only write about what I ate and not what else I saw or what others had.. . Since apps were kind of communal I will just say that they were average and nothing to write about. For my entree I had the Rack of Lamb, side of mashed and side of snow peas.. . First the lamb: $38 for a rack with nothing! No sauce, no crust nada. I do believe it was a New Zealnd/Australian rack and not a Colorado one which is significant is both taste, and size, Colorado being superior. Not to mention price. When I have a rack of Roasted lamb I like a nice fat cap on it, if you can crust it up and get the fat melting it is to die for. Now Im ok with a peice of beautifully cooked meat with no sauce but it was dry, no good olive oil or salt just a rack. Now this I really cant believe that if all your are putting on a plate is a rack plain that plate should be chip free and wiped free of grease mine was neither, unacceptable.. . Side one, mashed. Good not great, pricey. . Side two, snow peas, good and tasty, but plate was greasy. . They do however have some decent wines served in nice and greaseless crystal.. . I estimate my own bill was close to a c-note total and $60ish was food. Which isnt bad for a real meal, but one slab of meat and two average sides served on fucked up china, I dont think so.
