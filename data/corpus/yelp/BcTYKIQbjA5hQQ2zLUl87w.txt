See, I don't really mind the "no exceptions allowed" deal they've got going on since I will each everything and anything but I can see how it can bother people. The food was good, as expected, but it didn't change my life. Next time I want to try that yellow fin tuna ceviche they've got... but I went with the typical burger and sweet potato fries. Waiting was a bitch, I have to say. I'd say they can afford a host or two to help organize the chaos. I probably won't be back soon, $30+ for a burger, fries, and glass of wine is kind of a lot for a starving artist. (but damn I wasn't starving after that meal last night)
