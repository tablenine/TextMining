Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I think part of the reason why I might've enjoyed the food here was because I was starving in traffic trying to get here. But got there I did! . . And the food is good. One thing I liked was that they serve their waters and teas without ice. Sounds like a small thing but I hate when I order tea and I feel like I'm getting skimped on because of all the ice in the glass. But don't worry, fellow yelpers, the drinks are nice and cool, ice or no ice!. . The atmosphere is cozy and I really liked the casual vibe that you get here. Very Californian. And like a lot of other yelpers have revealed, the prices really are quite decent. Don't let the Melrose location fool you! Right after, we drove down the street to Urth Cafe to top off our day with some caffeine. . . Overall it was a great place to have lunch when spending the day in LA.
