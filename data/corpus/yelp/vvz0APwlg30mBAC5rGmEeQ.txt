Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
From the service to the cuisine, Bottega Louie really works hard to create something special. It's many things rolled into one: a great bar, an amazing gourmet takeout, a tasty and classy dinner destination and, surprise, a brick-oven pizza joint. My friends and I have had the pleasure of eating dinner there twice and both times I had to get the ttagliatelle bolognese which is the closest Stateside to what I had tasted in Florence, Italy. The second time I had to try the brick-oven pizza which was just the way I like it- thin crust. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the wait staff is from some sort of Supermodel factory. The only criticism I have for Bottega Louie is it's a bit loud, like cafeteria loud, but maybe they would consider hanging something up on their high blank walls in time to help absorb the sound.
