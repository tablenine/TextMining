The rating was more like 1.5!. . OMG...i was so so excited for this restaurant, but what a disappointment!  My brain was getting so confused with all the different flavor happening at the same time for each dish.  They need to calm down on the seasoning/flavoring.  The best were the meatballs, but will i drive all the way to Culver City for this?  NOPE!
