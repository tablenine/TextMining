good deal.  where else can you get an omelette, hash browns, and 2 pancakes for around $8 without sacrificing quality for price?  the pancakes were fluffy and the omelette was a generous size, a huge upgrade from your typical IHOP or denny's (which is probably the same price if not more, i might add).. . as if that wasn't enough, it's next to the beach.  you can enjoy awesome socal weather and the sea breeze as you have brunch outside on the patio...it doesn't get much better than that.
