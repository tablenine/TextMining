I've been to this place three times now (once in taiwan), and i have kind of mixed reviews about it. I initially tried this place while I was in taiwan.. and it was truly one of the best xiao long bao that i've ever had.. ever... . But that was the first time. The 2nd time, i ate at this place in arcadia w/ my gf and it was good.. but definitely didn't hold a candle to original in tw. The 3rd time was just this morning, and i gotta say, besides their xiao long bao.. the rest of their food is painfully bland. We ordered xiao long bao, pork/shrimp dumplings, pork bao, and another thing. The bill came out to be $30 and i was still pretty hungry. Either way this place is definitely worth a try. I just wished that their food wasn't so bland.
