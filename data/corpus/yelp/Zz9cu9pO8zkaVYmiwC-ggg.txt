Steel Yourselves!!. . That's right, this place is super cool. I just . . . liked it. Sleek and chic but not "too much." Big and expansive enough, with a modern vibe, but not at all cold. A great layout, from the entrance to the bar side on the right of the restaurant, to the main dining to the left and the open-view kitchen with sushi chefs hard at work in the back center, anchoring the whole thing.. . Last night, I attended a Junior League event and the folks at Steel really went out of their way to do things right. They served platter after platter of sushi - ranging from California to Volcano rolls, Dynamite and a few custom creations - as well as assorted sashimi and filet pieces cooked over stone and served with siracha (sp?) sauce for dipping. Their cocktail menu (great selection!) rounded out the night- definitely try the Mangotini if you like slightly fruity/girly drinks; not only is it pretty but it isn't too sweet. They also have a lovely wine list.. . It was my first, but certainly not last, visit to a new favorite Midtown spot!. . PS- The free parking in the huge garage in the same building just makes it an even better spot!!
