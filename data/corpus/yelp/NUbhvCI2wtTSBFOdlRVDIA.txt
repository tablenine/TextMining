Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
Really nice italian food without getting 5 lbs of pasta dumped on you. Everything is consistently fresh, great wine, and fantastic atmosphere. Service was very patient and friendly. Highly recommend this for a date night or an office outing if you have less than 10 people. Oh, and very reasonable for the quality of food
