Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This restaurant is great. We usually go to Soot Bull Jeep but this is our new favorite. The banchan is great and plentiful and the Â meat is high quality and excellent. Will be back very soon. Our service was excellent and they treated us really well even though we are not Korean.
