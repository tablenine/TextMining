Guy didn't let me down (Triple D on food network) I had the oinkster, but wish I would have had the pulled pork (I am not a huge pastrami fan) but it was still pretty good.  Had the piggy fries and they were good too.  Might have enjoyed them better without the dressing sauce on them.  The grilled onions and cheese were amazing.  I really hated how packed it was, how there was no parking and how they charge you so much for a normal size sandwich.  I guess they feel it is ok since they were on Diners Drive-ins &amp; Dives.  Still with all that said, it was good - but if I were to go back I would def get the pulled pork.
