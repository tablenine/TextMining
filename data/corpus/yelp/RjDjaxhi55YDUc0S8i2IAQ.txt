Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
Great restaurant to come to w/ friends &amp; family. Â Nice atmosphere -- love the library-style seating area in the back of the restaurant. . . Newbies:. Try the curried mussels, Chipotle black bean burger, Country chicken pot pie, or the Wilde Mac n Cheese.
