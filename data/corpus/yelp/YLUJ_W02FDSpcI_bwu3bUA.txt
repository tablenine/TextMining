The wait today was about 45-50 minutes. There was a lot of people.. . We ordered the raw oysters (always good with me), sweet potato fries (more plain than I'm used to but still really good), shrimp and lobster.  All were really good.  I'd give the price but apparently the seafood menu pricing is seasonal.. . Wear a bib! I cannot emphasize this enough. Regardless of how careful an eater you are, it will get messy.  There aren't any plates, there just this big thing of wax paper over the table and they only have plastic utensils and a big roll of paper towels.  It's really hands on.  You literally experience the food.
