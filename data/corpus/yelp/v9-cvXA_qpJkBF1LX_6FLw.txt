Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
1) Tastes good... for hot dogs.. 2) Large portion... for hot dogs.. 3) Big menu... for hot dogs.. . But I can't convince myself to buy into the hype. Sure, their hot dogs are YUMMY, especially when smothered with bacon or sour kraut... or wrapped up burrito style. But... they're hot dogs. And unless it's 1am and I'm with a group of friends, I wouldn't even think about thinking about waiting in that long ass line... for hot dogs.
