If you question the authenticity of this hipster heaven, think again it seems to be run by Asians, and they seem to be doing a great job.. I've increasingly become a phan of pho (get it?) and this place is awesome! I ordered pho with rare steak and the broth was made perfectly. The best part is the beef. Unlike most spots that have thin and dry pieces of beef, this place has nice fat juicy pieces of beef that goes well with the broth. My only gripe is that this place is tiny and so tables are crammed next to each other and you feel like you're too close to other diners.. . DO:. ORDER the PHO! Can't wrong with that.. Try to find street parking - their lot's kinda small.. . DON'T:. Go here during peak lunch/dinner hours. The place is tiny it may be difficult to find a seat.. . Service was okay and prices are reasonable.
