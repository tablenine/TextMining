Soooo this is my second time going there... when i went there the last time i went in for a brunch buffet cause my mom got a guest pass. The entrance for the brunch ( and I guess now still is ) $25.00 with a guess pass and I believe that included the buffet. BUT MAN i went there for Halloween and the price was hiked to $50.00 not including the dinner .... I ended up paying over $200.00 (considering it's a $15.00 minimum)!!! but that's my fault for not asking ahead... now on to the food... . my party ordered : the ny steak, filet mignon, free range chicken, and braised short ribs.. The filet mignon was sized right ... had a good taste ( the sauce was ok ) no A-1 horrible.... haha. the ny steak was huge..... and it was good for the 20 something dollars. the chicken however and the short ribs ( although really good portions wise ) were bland and not as tasty as it looked. But its a magic place.... I also had the souffle it was gelatinous i dunno if souffle is supposed to be like that but the accompanied Ice cream was not that good, neither was the 9.00 cheesecake.  the shows were cool but then again we paid $50.00 to see it.. . Best part was I sat next to mario lopez.( ac slater) ... can't pay for that can you?  hahahhaa
