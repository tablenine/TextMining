Okay, luckily we were the 2nd group in line tonight at the Torrance site so it wasn't a bad wait for us (even though the truck was an hour late due to mech issues) but when it finally got there, we ordered and got our food pretty quickly.  I think that made our experience a lot better compared to what others have said in their reviews.. . Now, onto the food.  Since it was my first time, I ordered quite a bit so out of all the things I tried, this is how I would rate it from best to least:. . 1)  Sliders. 2)  Short Rib tacos. 3)  Kogi Dog. 4)  Spicy Pork tacos. 5)  Chicken tacos. 6)  Spicy Pork burrito. 7)  Chicken burrito. . The first 4 I would definitely order again without hesitation.  Overall, good food for good price.
