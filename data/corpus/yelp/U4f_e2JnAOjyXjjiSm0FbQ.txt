The best shaved ice I've found in the States so far.  I was hella excited about the boba, jelly &amp; rice balls (fresh mochi?) with condensed milk.  . . Sigh... . But.... . But..... . It wasn't as soul shaking as my Taiwanese shaved ice experience in Taipei.  In Taipei I had to hold back the tears from the shaved ice tongue explosion.  . . I'd definitely come back to Sinbala but it's not the same.  You feel me?
