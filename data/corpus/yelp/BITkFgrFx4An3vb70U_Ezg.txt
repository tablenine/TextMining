I went to Crustacean with my BF because he wanted me to experience high end dining (which, in the past, never happened).  I was trippin' off of the floor aquarium, and we were seated on the second level.. . Our server was very attentive, the water was constantly refilled.  We both ordered the Roasted Crab, carpaccio, and lobster salad and it was very, very delicious!!  I could've sworn I jizzed in my pants when I bit into everything we ordered.  It's almost as good as sex...seriously.  ^_^
