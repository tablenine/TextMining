If you're looking for a place that gives you monster-size portions of breakfast dishes, this is a good place to go.  One would think quantity, not quality, but the food was actually very good.  And a place that uses a french press to make it's coffee (and leave it for you to pour your own at will) gets a big gold star in my book.. . And if you're missing the East Village in NY, the decor will give you your fix.
