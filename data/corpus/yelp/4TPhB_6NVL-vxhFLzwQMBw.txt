Slow service. Portions are tiny, expensive and not impressive, escpecially the four-bite lobster roll for $22. Tastes like a small but heavy tuna fish on toast, but with lobster. Everyone seems to tell them that their Chocolate dessert isburnt, but they claim that it is "bruleed" and is supposed to come that way. It's charcoal. Kitchen is uneven, with dishes often taking much too long to come out. Be careful if you sit in the patio, they have a very uncomfortable concrete bench. Request a chair from inside if poss.
