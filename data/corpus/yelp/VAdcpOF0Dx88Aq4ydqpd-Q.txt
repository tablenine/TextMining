Restaurant: Sun In My Belly
Category: Caterers
This place is usually a 4-5 (I too wish we could do half-star!!!).  The food is usually good and I just always love the atmosphere.  When I first started coming to this restaurant, there was always a wait (one time for 70 mins).  But it was always worth it, the food is just great - esp if you love brunch food!  But the last two times, the place has declined somewhat and become inconsistent on food quality/service.  Both time there has been no wait (which is always welcome in my book!), but the service has been substandard or worse sometimes just horrible.  Yesterday was my second visit in less than a month. . . My friend and I went to SIMB yesterday.  We got seated right away and the host was very pleasant.  The waitress took a few minutes, but asked if she could get us drinks.  We asked for water/no ice and tea (as this is another restaurant that needs to learn to use fresh squeesed oj instead of tropicana).  She returned about 5-8 mins later with tea and waters with ice.  No biggie, we informed her we wanted to order and she took our order.  Then the waiting began.  :(  After about 15 mins, we were noticing some 1-2 small flies near us and asked our server to move table.  She had no other tables, so we stayed.  Then we waited for another 5-10 mins, and asked our server when our food would be ready.  She imformed us that it would be up shortly.  After about 10 mins, we got our food.  Our order clearly looked like one dish sat for 10-15 mins while the eggs seems overcooked by sitting too long.  Our food tasted good, but poor tempature qualtiy and timing seem to make it average.  . . I really hope that SIMB looks at its service.  If you have notice that restaurant slaes are down, and restaurants need to stand out on their service as well.
