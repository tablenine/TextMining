Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
The Little Door has one of the most beautiful patios in Los Angeles. Twinkling lights hang from the tree. Very romantic (except for the tables being so close together - a problem the Little Next Door has as well). The flourless chocolate cake is sooo good.
