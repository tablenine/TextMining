Tiny, dark, loud, clearly needs no introduction.... . But I have the advantage of visiting Spanish places with a Spaniard.. . Verdict:  not authentic, but very much in the spirit, and excellent!  Baked goat cheese with warm grapes and port reduction?  Pork chop with braised apples?  Finger lickin!. . No wine list, but the little wine store next door has a primarily Spanish selection, and there is no corkage fee.. . Service is a little... we're too cool for you... but all in all great!
