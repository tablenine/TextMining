This place is always packed and I'm not sure why. Â  The interior looks like grandma's country kitchen during the dust bowl era. I hate to put down a local establishment, but this place is sort of gross. The coffee tastes like a paper towel and the French toast is soggy. The scones are not the best (as the huge sign states). The only good experience I've had is the huge slice of cake I had 6 months ago (the last time I was there). To be fair, I have given it a lot of chances and they have failed.
