Restaurant: The Nook On Piedmont Park
Category: American (Traditional)
My lady friend and I were just leaving Pride in Piedmont Park and were a bit hungry. Looking to try someplace new that hopefully wasn't packed we meandered our way to the Nook. Lucky for us there was a two seater ready for us and we sat almost immediately. . . As for the crowd, a typical Sunday full of people watching football but with the added on ambiance generated by people coming back from the Pride festival in the park. Â It was crowded but I really could not tell if anyone was really eating.. . The major strike against the Nook was the service. Our waitress seemed to be relatively new and a bit flustered after I asked what exactly dirty rice meant (she didn't know). Even after ordering, she had to come back to our table to ask if I really wanted my burger with no bun since she forgot to mention that to the kitchen. After quickly responding Oh god yes ha she fixed that situation. But then the wait for the food began. A burger with no bun and veggie Totchos (nachos with tater tots is an ingenious idea, especially for marketing the place) should NOT take over 45 minutes to make. In the meantime, we did get to see the table next to us receive their finished check devoid of the credit card they gave to pay it which surely made us more confident. . . The only saving grace was that the food was pretty good. My burger was well cooked and the onions, lettuce and tomato were fresh. My girlfriends Totchos were also pretty good although she said the cheese sauce was kinda tasteless. . . Overall, the service was awful but the food was alright. I'm willing to give this place one more chance and allow them to blame the poor service on the crowds from Pride and Sunday football.
