WTF ALCOVE?!?!?!?!. . seriously, wtf!?. . I LOVE your food. LOVE the atmosphere. I seriously couldn't think of a better place to enjoy the summer night and a good dinner than on the patio.. . And after an evening at the observatory, with an out-of-town guest... we though, "oh, PERFECT! We'll go to alcove!". . Because, normally, Alcove, your food is relatively healthy, fresh and tasty. . . But WTF happened Sunday night? . . The french vegetarian panini was wonderful as always... and I was DYING for some awesome rosemary potatoes.. . But when my boyfriend took a bite of his potatoes and made a face, I knew something was awry. . . "They're cold," he said.. . Well... cold potatoes don't ALWAYS equal bad.. . This time... cold potatoes equaled bad. REALLY bad. . . Stale, awful, nasty potatoes.. . So, my boyfriend gets up, goes to the counter and tells them. They actually give him a plate to put our OLD potatoes on before they give us new ones.. . Okay, fine, whatever... you can HAVE em.. . They give us new potatoes. . . My mouth is watering at this point anticipating the fresh, amazing goodness.... . I insert my fork into a lovely looking potato.... eagerly take a bite.. . AND WTF!?!??!?!?!?!. . Are these our old potatoes on new plates!?!. . WTF!?. . Stale, nasty, cold potatoes. . . ARRRGH.. . So, you're losing a star... until you get the potatoes back to their former glory.
