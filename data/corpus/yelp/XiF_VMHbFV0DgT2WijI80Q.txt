The meal was expensive, but good.  The food combined with ambiance and fantastic service deserves 4 stars.  They have mastered the delivery of strong customer service.  The wait staff are personable and attentive.  Plus, several 'on the house' tastings were provided during the meal, like a pre and post desert and all the dishes were nicely prepared and presented.  . . On a Saturday night it was slower than I would have expected, but considering its location, I assume it does well during the week with the local business's. In general we were very pleased with the overall experience!
