Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
My coworker introduced Hide to me.    Too bad it's far from where I live, otherwise I'd eat there everyday....well, not really......maybe once a week =). Comments:. Blue fin Toro:   Good. Albacore : good. Hamachi: Good. Uni: oh sooo gooooood  (and reasonably priced)  OK, Hide,  don't start raising prices after reading my review!!!. Ankimo: goooooooood. Unagi: good. Giant clam: hmm...so n so. Beef teriyaki + tempura lunch special: so so....i think Tokyo Lobby's is even better. . Like y'all already know,  it's CASH ONLY.    Don't worry if you broke-a$$ don't have cash, there is an ATM machine inside.   Just prepare to pay transaction fee  (that worth another piece of nigiri). . Waiting for tables can take very long, expecially during dinner hour but I found a slot of time when it's quieter and no wait....nah, im not telling!. . Parking: go park at the back lot.  it's free with validation.
