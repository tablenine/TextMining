This place almost justifies the hot summer weather in LA.  I was very impressed by the decent service during lunch time when there was a lot of people waiting.  Our party of 5 ordered just about every little dish on the menu.  Some of my favorites were:. . *Chinese sausages - I love the flavor and that there's not as much fat as what I'm use to seeing at other places.  Let's put it this way, I'm not a fan of chinese sausage, but this place changed my mind!. . *Oyster pancake - The last place I had really good ones were at the night markets in Taipei.  This place is good.  . . *Xiao Long Bao - Not sure of the exact spelling, but these mini pork buns were so delish!  The pork buns were super juicy on the inside with the perfect taste.. . *Tofu - they were cold cuts - yum.  Gotta try it.. . *Grass Jelly with Ai Yu drink - perfect for a hot summer's day.  . . I'm glad I tried this place before reading about the health inspector scores.  Yeah, even though we've got the FDA here in the US, it doesn't protect us from the food preparers who don't wash their hands after using the restroom or picking their nose, butts, ears.. . P.S.  Tea Station food &amp; drink in San Diego is not even comparable to this place (and probably a few other places in LA) in terms of food and drink variety and taste.
