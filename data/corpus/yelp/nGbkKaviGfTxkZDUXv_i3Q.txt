Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The Roscoe's experience was great.  We went with a group and ordered a little of everything.  We were not disappointed.   Great food and service along with a unique atmosphere.  I ordered the fried chicken livers.  I have not had them since I was a kid.  They were outstanding.  The portion was so big, that even I cold not finish them.. . Roscoes's is an institution in LA.  A must if you are a fan of Fried Chicken, waffles and Soul Food!
