Holy Moley I guess I'm reviewer 536.  This place is definitely delicious!  I came here to treat my friends after moving me into my new apartment.  We got there on Saturday at 5:25pm and there was a 15 person line waiting for this place to open at 5:30pm.  All the people were authentic older Japanese people, which I thought was super cute.  . . We got the sashimi plate and it was super yum!!  The sashimi plate had, I believe 15 different small dishes on it.  My friend got the beef teriyaki plate, but I thought this was so-so, since it was really dry.  The tempura was light a fluffy, tofu was perfect and the salmon skin salad was delicious.  . . We had the cutest Japanese lady waitress, she seemed like a Japanese mom straight out of a Japanese anime.  Definitely worth checking out!
