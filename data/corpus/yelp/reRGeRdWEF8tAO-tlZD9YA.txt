Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
I grew up in Queens, NY with a pizza place every few blocks.  They were good because they had to be due to harsh competition.  Still, everybody had their "best" and we often travelled to brooklyn and manhattan in search of the perfect slice.  Little did I know I would find it in Atlanta.  Seriously, this is as close to the perfect slice of pizza I have encountered.. . Atmosphere is fine for a pizza place.  As good or better than the places I grew up with serving slices on wax paper.  But, it is not a restaurant in the traditional sense.  Don't go looking for atmosphere.  Go for pizza and then head over to any one of the cools bars (JCT, Abbattoir, Ormsby's, Northside Tavern) for atmosphere.. . Oh, and Antico is BYOB.  Do share with the pizza makers.
