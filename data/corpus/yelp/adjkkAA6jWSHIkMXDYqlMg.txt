Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
My husband and I came to David Burke's Primehouse last weekend.  I had eaten there before but he had not.  It was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had!  The food was incredible!  I loved all the sides and my husband was gitty about his ribeye!  Not only was the food unreal but the service was just as incredible.  Amazing staff and amazing food.  Thank you for this experience.  We can't wait to come again and bring our friends with us.
