Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
You can't go wrong with Lawry's...great food and service.  Once in a while they have a Prime Rib for two promotions including everything, a great value.  Just one warning...do not fill up with the free appetizers in the bar/lobby.  Stay away from the temptation.
