Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
If you can stomach the hipsters (or if you ARE one of the Chuck Taylor-wearing ironic set), and you like "fresh" Vietnamese food, then gingergrass is for you.. . The pho is filling and delicious, but I'm a fan of the Wok-Tossed Noodles with chicken (tofu and other meat-types available).  Mmm.  Also be sure to try the Vietnamese coffee, a sweet, milky, strong coffee.. . The only two downsides are the wait, which can sometimes be up to an hour, and the small size of the place.   So if you're an impatient claustrophobic, I recommend ordering to go.  It also feels like they are at least 1 or 2 people short-staffed; the servers always seem just slightly overwhelmed.. . Prices are good.  Hipsters are douchey.  Food is delicious.. . EDITED 4/10 TO REMOVE A STAR AND ADD:  I went last night, a Monday night, around 8:45 pm.  We waited nearly an hour for a table for 3.  There weren't even that many other parties waiting, but the place is nearly entirely comprised of tables for 2.  A couple larger parties were occupying the larger tables, which had been pushed together to accommodate them.  . . The food was, once again, delicious, but I don't think I'm going back.  The wait was just too infuriating.
