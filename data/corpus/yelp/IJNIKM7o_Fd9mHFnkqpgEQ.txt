I've been reading useful Yelp reviews for a while now but never felt the need to sign up to write a review myself.  Until my experience at this poorly run, semi-pricy for what it is, wanna-be "trendy" establishment... DO NOT GO!  I eat out a lot and I've been to many restaurants nationally and internationally from fine dining to hole-in-the-wall dives. Competition in the food industry is stiff.  Companies need a gimmick.  I get it.  But are you kidding me with this place?  Standing behind velvet ropes waiting to be admitted by a Sky Bar reject doorman, when on a Saturday night at prime hours, the place wasn't even busy?  Once in, you wait.  A long time.  To order food and drinks at the bar.  But don't ask your friend to go find a table for your party because even if she finds one, they're not "allowed to hold tables."  So good luck trying to eat your burger once your order arrives. Are the burgers good?  Sure.  Are they worth the hassle?  That would be a NO.  (Go to In N' Out for better fries and I highly recommend Bouchees Bistro in Long Beach for outstanding burgers.  It's worth the drive).  And to the cocky burger/bartenders serving up serious attitude, particularly the Filipino dude: you're taking burger orders and pouring beer while wearing these ridiculous "F.O." shirts.  Get over yourselves.  The joke's on you.  Having to put on this "you're lucky to be here" schtick the whole night must make for a really long shift.  If I'm sounding a little bitter it's because my friends and I spent close to $300 on burgers, fries and a couple of drinks; and they didn't even have any ketchup!
