Their bone in filet is so delicious, melts in your mouth good!  some cons are the waiting area with the bar at the bottom gets really crowded and you sometimes dont have that much space to stand around.  I would suggest going outside to wait if it is not too chilly.  Sauteed spinach is yummy and the  mashed potatoes were good.  They give an assortment of bread in the beginning, but careful not to fill up~
