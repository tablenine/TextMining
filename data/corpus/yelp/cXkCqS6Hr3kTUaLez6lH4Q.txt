Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Savoy is a great, quaint, little place.  Eat outside if you can, it makes the experience much more enjoyable.  The Hainan chicken tasted like...Hainan chicken.  The Halibut was good and when I put the sauce on my rice I couldn't help but to shovel it down.  The iced tea was very tasty, particularly with the fructose.  They give you refills and even let you take it to go.  The staff is extremely friendly and if you go there, tell Bao Rodriguez that I said, "Hi!"
