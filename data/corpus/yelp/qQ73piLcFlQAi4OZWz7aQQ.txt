Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
i like the hungry cat. I really do.  I just don't love it. I want to love it.  Every single time I go I think this time I will fall in love.  But alas I never do.  Cocktails are fresh and delicious. the pub burger is the best item on the menu, but eh. It's over-priced, too small and I'm still waiting to be wowed.
