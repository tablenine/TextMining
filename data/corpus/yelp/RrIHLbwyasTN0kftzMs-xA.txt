Restaurant: One Midtown Kitchen
Category: American (New)
A good friend mentioned visiting One Midtown and after hearing the name so many times, I opted to give it a shot during their restaurant week. . . The interior of the place had a great feel, seeing the rolling hill outside, the classic light bulbs above the main dining area, and curved bar, very cool. I will merge my two meals into one, as I went back a few days later for a Birthday party for a friend. . . Goat Cheese appetizer was unique, the truffle flavor added a great touch to the food. . . Main Course was Steak Frites which had Parmesan Herb fries. The steak was served up to perfection, full of flavor and delectable. My other visit was the Smoked Brisket which also was a great dish, cooked to perfection. Not overcooked, not undercooked. . . Dessert - They offered up cheesecake, among other very tasty fresh items with Georgia Peaches in them. Served up hot. . . The Beverages---- Our waitress was told what we liked and delivered EVERYTIME incredible drinks. Their One Martini, One Mojito, and One Margarita are also very tasty. . . Great Service, easy to make reservation on opentable, will be back! . . They also do a thing on Tuesday's ( I think) where you can do food and wine sampling with the chef, if you have interest.
