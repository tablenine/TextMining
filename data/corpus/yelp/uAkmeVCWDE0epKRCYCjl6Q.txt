I love this place. I usually order the grilled eggplant. Â Most places bread, fry and do way too much to a poor little eggplant. The eggplant at Papa Cristo's is litely grilled with olive oil and sprinkled with marinated red bell peppers and feta. My husband loves the chicken moussaka and the lamb.
