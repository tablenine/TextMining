Hands down, this place is awesome. Went on a Sunday around 2:45pm and they were still serving Brunch. I always thought Brunch ended around 2, but for them Brunch goes a lot longer. Everything sounded really yummy. My friend ordered a burger and it looks soooo good. Down side, he wanted Ranch and apparently they do not carry Ranch. He said it food still tasted good without it. I had their Chopped salad. The size was perfect. Sooooooo delicious.. We wanted to order a dessert that happens to be very popular but apparently they didn't have. They didn't have the ingredients? Or something. So the waiter told us of another popular treat - Bread Pudding. That -ish is to die for . Hot bread pudding with ice cream on top. 1 bowl was enough for 2 people.. We were seated outside, which looks really cool and cozy.. So coming back here when I go back out to the Hollywood area.
