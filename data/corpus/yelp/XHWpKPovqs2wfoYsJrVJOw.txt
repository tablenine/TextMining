This place is great for breakfast.  The pancakes are enoromous (big enough to feed 2 to 3 people).  The strawberries and cream waffles are the best and the coffee is strong!  The service is nice and friendly.  The worst part about this place is the wait and parking.  Go check this place out and skip lunch afterwards.
