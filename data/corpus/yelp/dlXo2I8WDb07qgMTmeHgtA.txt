Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
Some friends and I planned a super romantic chick fest involving broken glass and burnt hair! Whoo! The only thing lacking was bloody knuckles!. Anyways, I liked everything about The Bluebird except our super bitchy waiter.  The restaurant was actually not packed at all.  My friends and I showed up around 9:30 and managed to find a large table in the back of the restaurant. I didn't order any food but the bite of Mac &amp; Cheese that I tried was kind of subpar but the fries were ok.. I wouldn't' recommend coming here for food but OH man, this place had a great drink list! It's definitely comparable to other great gastropubs/wine bars around the city.  . Next time I come, I'm going to be fully prepared to get my drank on!...and hopefully avoid our super bitchy waiter.
