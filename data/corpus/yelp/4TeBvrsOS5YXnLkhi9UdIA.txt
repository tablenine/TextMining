so delicious. I've been told to eat here for like 5 months now and finally went today when  I discovered the painted table cafe was no longer open.  but really it could not have been better. I had half a heard roasted turkey sandwich with apricot mayo avocado  lettuce tomato balsamic drizzle plus a cup of white chicken chili with roasted red peppers and chili's with jalapeno foccacia. my companions for the meal got crabcake benedicts and vermont white sharp cheddar pimento cheese sandwich with a spinach salad with strawberries,walnuts, and goat cheese. needless to say it was all great including our cinnamon roll app. I will definitely be back multiple times.. . ps   the service was so so
