I want to give more than 3 stars, but I have high expectations for top notch food. . . The first time I came here, food was amazinggggggg.. I came here for DineLA and I wanted to try their Calamari salad to compare to Gordan Ramsey's I had earlier in the week. I was a bit disappointed, but it was still tasty. I don't recall what I ate the first time besides the salad and the crab cakes (yummy, but overpriced), but I remember walking away thinking.. YUMMM. We even saw Larry King rocking his Dodgers jacket looking like he was about to keel over haha jk. . . The next time I came.... food was good, but meh compared to my first experience. I'm not sure if it was because we were late for the reservation and had to order before the kitchen closed, but I wasn't that impressed. . . I'll try it one more time to make a final decision about this place. So far, it's been hit or miss.
