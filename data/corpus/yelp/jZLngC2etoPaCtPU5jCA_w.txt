Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I've never been a big pastrami person, but the fact that Johnnie's is 2 minutes from my apartment and I was really, really, really hankering for some chili-cheese fries, I decided it was finally time for me pop my pastrami cherry.. . Venturing slowly through their tiny parking lot, I ordered a pastrami w/ cheese and an order of their delicious chili-cheese fries (sans the onions). But god forbid, an order for both cost me a jackson!. . First time was heaven.. 2nd time, I noticed that the pastrami meat was a bit grisly and very chewy... and not in a good way.. The 3rd time just didn't do it for me anymore.. . Guess I'll only be back for some chili-cheese fries if I'm really desperate and/or hung over.... . Cest la vie~
