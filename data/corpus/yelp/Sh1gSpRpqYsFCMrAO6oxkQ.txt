I know, five stars?  What am I, crazy?  How could some chain burger place get five stars from a person who actually considers herself a foodie?. . I.  don't.  know.  But I went here last Friday night and it was even better than I remembered it - and it was pretty good the first time!. . I got a 1/3-lb burger, medium rare - and they did the medium rare RIGHT.  So pink and juicy, I thought I would die.  I hate when people overcook a burger and ruin a nice medium-rare.  My toppings were imported swiss, grilled onions, avocado, and bacon.  And the roasted garlic aioli was my condiment du jour.. . I don't know where they find this stuff, but the toppings were perfection.  Avocado: buttery, bright green and yellow.  Grilled onions: Flavorful, plentiful, and yes messy but who cares?  Bacon: Crisp, correction - perfectly crisp, and so delicious that I would seriously do anything to have bacon like this for breakfast every day.  NOM.  and NOM once more.. . I also split a chocolate milkshake with the boyfriend - delicious - and we got some sweet potato and parmesan garlic fries for the table.  The sweet potato fries were marvelous, and served with this incredible horseradish mayo that I absolutely could not stop eating.  Parmesan garlic fries were great too, but the sweet potato fries have taken up a larger residence in my memory.. . Honestly, I can't think of anything wrong with this meal.  It was a bit messy, eating a burger overloaded with toppings, but it was my choice to put all that deliciousness on there.  And I'd do it again!
