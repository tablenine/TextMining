Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
This place is fun if you like to try a lot of different small dishes. . . (I know.... a bit redundant...after all, isn't that what the word " Tapas" implies? You probably don't need me to tell you that.). . Anyways, it's definitely worth a try. The different offering were tasty, and most of the dishes that I remember having, such as the steak, something -wrapped prawns, and the lamb cooked with something and something were all good. ( It was a couple of months ago when i ate there). . Remember, they don't serve wine, but they do have a wine and beer store next door where you can find some nice spanish wines, or in my case, 2 large bottles of chimay.. . Whenever I go here, however, I always leave with 2 questions in my head. . . 1) Why is this place so loud? The room can't hold more than 20 -30 people max, but you have to shout to be heard a foot away. (yep, I'm getting old). . 2) Why don't they combine the wine store next door with the restaurant? this would take of the noise problem and the liquor problem all at once. Â I'm sure it has something to do with getting a liquor license in L.A., but they should really try to fix that.
