Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I came here for Valentines and did not expect much. I knew my girl wanted to go to an overpriced restaurant with good ambiance so i tried Taste after looking through reviews of places near Arclight (next destination). We had the pear salad, chicken pizzetta, kobe meatballs, flat iron steak, and the chocolate cream thingy desert. The salad and the pizzetta was really good there was alot of it. The kobe meatballs and the steak were ok but the pasta had a weird plastic smell to it. It might be some special ingredient I'm not use to but it wasn't good at all to me. The chocolate desert was excellent and rivals Champagne my favorite desert place. The free bread and hummus was also good. The bill came out to be 100 including tax and tip. To sum up this place had good appetizers and desert, ok entrees, good service, good ambiance (very dimly lit), and no reason to come back.
