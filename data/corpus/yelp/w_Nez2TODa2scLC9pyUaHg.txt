Wow I really didn't review this place???. . They have got the famous "Special #2" spicy level which is a challenge for people to eat in one hour I believe is the challenge. Overall it was good not great, nice and spicy though and that is a plus for those folks out there looking for a spicy alternative to Daikakuya. . . I think the whole reason I didn't finish my special #2 was it is really very large in portion and I was hurting from just about a quarter of the volume of the broth that I had consumed. . . I really wasn't trying to DO the challenge I just wanted to taste what the spiciest level was and see what the hype was all about. I ended up eating most of Debs bowl of miso #5 spicy which was just tasty and not spicy. . . Would I go back, eh....only if it was cold out and I needed some spice in my life.
