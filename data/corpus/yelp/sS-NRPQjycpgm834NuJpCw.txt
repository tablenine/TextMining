Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I am and will always unabashedly be a Lawry's cheerleader.  Although I could do without the heavy Marriot drapery/decor and tourist fanny pack explosion; this place is a nostalgic piece of my childhood that I refuse to let go.. . The waitresses are always so friekin' nice; they remind me of old stewardesses from Pan Am airlines in the 60s.  I couldn't imagine being that nice and  chipper in such hideous brown pilgrim outfits and orthopedic nursing shoes.. . I love the ice-cold spinning salad.  There is something about the signature dressing and those little salty croutons that get me every time.  . . I love smellng the prime-rib cart being wheeled over to my chair.  It's always perfectly cooked.  I like mine covered in au jus with mashed potatoes, corn, creamed spinach with a big piece of yorkshire pudding on top....delish!. . Oh and the last time my parents were there, they told their waitress I had two bone-loving dogs and before they knew it, the waitress had brought out a to-go box filled with meaty prime-rib bones.  LOVE that.
