First off, I'm not a big fan of breakfast.  Secondly, I'm super spoiled, because I've discovered the wonder that is Bake n Broil in Bixby Knolls.  I now compare ALL breakfast to their standard - in price, taste, and quality.. . I ordered the Manhattan omelet with a side of pumpkin pancakes.  The omelet was a good size, but I didn't like how it was still wet in the middle.  Plus, it totally lacked flavor.  They get extra points for having pumpkin pancakes, but they don't compare to BB's.  They were small, oily, and undercooked.  . . It was an alright breakfast spot.  If I come back, I'd probably order a more traditional eggs and bacon breakfast, or maybe some sort of sandwich.
