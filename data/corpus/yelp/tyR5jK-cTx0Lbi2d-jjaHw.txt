Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I had previously seen Bottega Louie from the outside a couple of times, and I have to say that it intimidates me a little bit. It's definitely a place where you feel people go to see and be seen. However, for a place like that, they deliver nicely on attentive service and delicious food.. . Meeting up with a handful of particularly well-famed LA Talk Thread Yelpers, I had planned to keep in basic on my eats with a margherita pizza. Goodness gracious, that pizza was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. Six well-sized slices of pizza with a delicious tangy pizza sauce, lovely cheese and yummy basil set to rest on a very awesome crust. I had to try and force people to take it and eat it (without success, save for one person).. . I also got to try a bite of their brussels sprouts and their pumpkin squash. Both where delicious, though I felt that the squash was a bit too dry for me (granted, perhaps that's how it should be? I've never had squash before). . . Everyone seemed to enjoy their order. . Some of us enjoyed out waiter service more than others *wink*. So. Very. Pretty.. . I hope to come back here to indulge my sweet tooth next time, since I didn't in my first visit. Affogato and macarons sound like just what I want to try.
