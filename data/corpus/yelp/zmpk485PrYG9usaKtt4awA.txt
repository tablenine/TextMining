Yeah, that's right!, I drank the Kool-Aid!. . I bought an iPod (a few).... I wore the LIVESTRONG wristband.... I joined an online social network.... and I waited in line for the Kogi Truck.... . Yes, I am a victim of the hype machine.... . So many 5-Stars?  Really, Wow!  You guys must have had somethin' different in your Kool-Aid.... . After waiting so long in line, you really should be rating your friends who were waiting with you, as you were with them 60x longer than you were actually at the truck or eating...Were they funny? Did they talk to much? Were they the douchebag in front of me, complaining about how long the line was?. . I think the key with the Kogi Experience is that it is not about the food...it's about the journey (following it on Twitter, etc), the anticipation, the good times with good friends (of course strangers can be cool too), cops and finally the novelty of eating a kbbq taco.. . _____________. Notes:. * To all the "hey, I'm too Mexican to try a kbbq taco" people out there: Like all good food, these tacos are made by Mexicans...eating something that's different doesn't make you pocho.... * They often run out of food so the menu is a bit limited at times...they may limit you to only tacos (no burritos, quesadillas, sliders)...also, they enforce a limit of 4 tacos per person.... * Buy the maximum amount of tacos...they're small, and even if you're full, people will buy them...My buddy sold one $2 taco for $10. * There are different meats to choose from, but after they drown them in their sauce, they all taste the same.... * Arrive early, but not hungry...portions are small and you got a long wait ahead of you...
