Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
This place is the iconic place my old roommate brought me to in the middle of the night for a snack... It was in the middle of East LA, so back in the early 80's it was like "where the hell are you taking me?"...  "Manuel's".... . I don't think that they're open til 2 or 3 in the morning anymore but the burritos are still huge as always, about the size of your foot (lol!).  Pretty good wet burrito, I usually settle for the Hollenbeck but this time I wanted to try the Hollenbeck de Manchaca which has pulled pork meat, rice, refried beans, guacamole, salsa, covered with red sauce, onions, and green chili peppers.  I usually order at the take out walkup window on the side and takeout or eatin along the breezeway.. . This place is iconic... an institution that everyone knows about and for good reason.  Everyone talks about this place and Ciro's across the street as the places to go to for good Mexican comfort food.
