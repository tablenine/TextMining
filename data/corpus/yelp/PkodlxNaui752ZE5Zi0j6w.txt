FOR CARNIVORES...forget these other reviews about how great the salad bar is. So, I was introduced to Fogo several years ago by a friend. He mentioned it was "all the high end meat I could handle". I didn't believe him and called him a liar. Boy was I wrong. Upon getting there he advised me of the deal: They'll bring around the rump roast, the sirloin etc but wait...for the filet. Don't get me wrong all the meats are outstanding but the filet is incredible. I go for the skewers of filet wrapped in bacon AND now I've gotten to where I'll advise the guy that's slicing the rare-medium rare filet to check on me every 5-10 minutes. And he does. And I was told last night that I ate about 3 pounds of filet. Ummm so good. See, I don't waste time on the salad bar, the side dishes, bread(which are all great!). I go for the perfectly seasoned rare-medium rare meat that is grilled Brazilian style over a flame. That's how I do it. And $50 is a lot?No, when I leave I know I've received my money's worth.
