When you think of Sushi-Gen you immediately think of their sashimi deluxe.  Many of my friends are addicted to this place.  It is true that their prices are decent considering you're eating seafood.  The first time I came here I got their unagi on rice.  It was SO good, but nothing special.  I noticed that all my friends got the sashimi deluxe.  POO!  I made it a goal to come back here again and get that deluxe, because I am seriously in love with sashimi.. . If you're not into tuna, then the sashimi deluxe is not for you.  I fall into that category.  I ended up trading all of my tuna with my friend.  Everything else included in the deluxe was very appetizing.  . . The wait gets CRAZY here on the weekends.  I'd definitely eat here if I were ever in the neighborhood and the wait wasn't too bad.  Otherwise, there are tons of other sushi places in Jtown.
