WOW -- it doesn't get any better than this.  This may be the BEST restaurant I"ve been to in SoCal (the one in Dallas was damn good too).  I've been to this Craft a 1/2 dozen times (including New Years eve) and the food and service are incredible (I'll forgo gushing numerous superlatives)!  Please open a Craft in Orange County!!!!  This is the place to go if you want to impress business associates or out of town guests.  From the time you walk in everything is PERFECT.. . BTW, WHAT SMALL PORTIONS?  For a high-end restaurant their portions are generous.  This ain't Claim Jumper ZZ
