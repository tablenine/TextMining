Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Ugo?  More like Ugh.  My hubby and I went during happy hour, excited to chill on the nice, big patio with some wine.  Now don't get me wrong, the patio was nice and the wines were priced right during happy hour...but the food was terrible!  We ordered a pizza with buffalo mozzarella and there were just so many things wrong with it.  It was cold when it came out, the "crust" was doughy, the cheese was clumpy and hard...it was just pathetic.  We also ordered calamari which was fine...hard to mess that up.  And we ordered the linguine with clams.  Big mistake!  Nowhere on the menu did it say "pesto sauce".  So the overcooked linguine was coated in an oily pesto with sad little clams.  The whole dish was gummy and just wrong.  When our stoner waiter asked how the food was, I told him the truth...it honestly wasn't very good.  He apologized, said there was a new crew in the kitchen, and offered us a free dessert.  We ended up taking the dessert home...it was like a small chocolate ganache cake.  Which also sucked.  The cake was dry and hard and the chocolate was weirdly chewy...i think our waiter hated us so we stuck his hand in the back of the freezer and pulled out an old ass cake.  Overall, not a great experience...terrible food, weirdly apathetic waiter, but nice patio and good wine prices.
