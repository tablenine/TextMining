i love the atmosphere, the bartenders, the food, and the beer...i hate the fact that the tables are so close to each other i was trying to enjoy my burger and beer, but the table next to us decided to fit 8 people in a 2 person table...so i would have random elbows near my face and hear these guys talk about this and that...ugh i will definitely be more cautious about where i'm sitting next time i come here.
