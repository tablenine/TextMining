I like New Wave. They have yummy stuff by local bakers, including a nice spread of vegan stuff. But when I pointed out that the "Pop-Tart Cupcakes" couldn't possibly be vegan because, well, Pop-Tarts (the frosted kind) aren't vegan, the counter girl snipped back with a very snippy, "Um, yes, they are.". . Well, no, New Wave. They aren't. But keep on bringing me back with your Glazed Donuts and tasty coffee.
