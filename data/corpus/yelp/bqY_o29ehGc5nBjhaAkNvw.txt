Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
Having grown up on Southern style food, my expectations were really high.. . We came here after a movie (and I don't think there is any way I'll ever come here again unless I'm at that exact theater again).  The food was just... spicy.  Not flavorful or exciting, just the flavor of spice.. . The martini's are only $6.50 which was a major upside.  The service was alright, but we were here late night.. . Heaven on Seven is definitely a 2.5.  In comparison to other Southern Style places in the city, I think you'd be much better off at Wishbone if you're looking for something good and genuine.
