I haven't been to Yamashiro's in many years. Although pretty pricey, between the view, great food, and pretty good service, I say go! maybe for only special occassions...or if you are wealthy...but worth it if you can afford it!. I had a guest visiting for her first time in the United States. She will go back to Austria and rave about it, I am sure!
