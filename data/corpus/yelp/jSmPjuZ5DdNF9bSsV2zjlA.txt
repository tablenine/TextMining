Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
Best pizza I've had in Atlanta. The place is a lol hard to see coming from 10th street and parking is limited. You can tell this building wasn't made for a family dining experience, but I think that's part of what I enjoyed about it. Sitting in the back, watching them make my pizza made it even more authentic feeling. Also, i would advise getting there early. When my friend and i went, we got lucky and had a seat right away. 5 mins later there was a line out the door.. . The pizza itself was amazing. Fresh and natural ingredients and the most flavorful chilies(i think?) i've ever had. We had the Divaola, which was amazing, and the group next to us insisted we try their San Gennaro, which i think may have been even better. There is also a monster pizza, which is four pizzas in one. Cant wait to bring a group to tackle that one.. . Oh, i forgot the best part....BYOB!!! Yes, bring in your favorite wine or beer and add that extra something awesome to the experience!. . The only thing i didnt like about this place? No ice to put my beer in! haha but i think ill live
