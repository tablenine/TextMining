Still a four-star review. BUT I wanted to add that you should go here for Easter Brunch. Where have I been??? Hahaha, ok, this is only my second Chicago Easter so I'm okay. . . It's $25 for a bloody mary or mimosa with an entree and coffee or juice. Sounds pretty good, right? . . I ordered the benedict trio. I don't usually like ham so I substituted the regular eggs benedict for the steak version... Meh. I should have probably stuck with the regular. (Now you see my reasoning for the four-star review). I wish I could have substituted for the eggs portabella though -- the waiter said I couldn't do that though because the portabella was going to be huge. Ok, next time, I'll order the eggs portabella. . . My favorite part was the bloody mary though. . . My least favorite part was that I dined with a large group and we must have intimidated the waiter/server because he took forever with our orders and rarely ever came back to check on us. And ok, it was Easter brunch... I guess I can excuse that.
