We got there around noon and the place was crowded. We waited for about 20-30 minutes before finally getting seated.. . I originally planned on getting their nutella-stuffed french toast, but then when we read the menu again we were really drawn to the "Devil's Daydream" french toast .... chocolate bread with bittersweet chocolate chips, topped with whipped cream. Mmmm ... After seeing the surreally large flapjacks on other people's tables we decided to just split one.. . The food took a while to come - it looks like they have a pretty small kitchen and only a few kitchen stuff to manage all the customers they have in the packed restaurant.. So our french toast finally came:. (photo on my blog: . http://gourmetpigs.blo.... ). . Now don't be fooled, these slices are huuge! It was definitely a very rich breakfast (or lunch?), full of chocolate! The bread itself actually was not too dense, which is good - otherwise I won't be able to handle it! It also has the right moistness and so does not require maple syrup or anything on top of it.. . We could even barely finish our one slice each of this, but we both thought it was yummy!. So I had a rich dessert for lunch .... :P but it was the weekend!. . Anyway, I definitely have to bring a group here next time! That way we can order more varieties and split them all!. . Long wait time and service is pretty slow tho when it's crowded so be prepeared to spend some time!
