Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
Oh my! Antico is amazing. So delicious that our group of six people managed to eat our way through four huge pizzas: margherita, bianca, pomodorini (yummy cherry tomatoes!), and the san genarro. We fought about which pizza was most delicious and came to no real conclusions except that we'd have to come back and try more. And we loved the BYOB policy. We loved it even more when we watched a couple pull out their personal COOLER before sitting down to eat their pizza. At the end of our night, the owner's 9-year-old son showed off his pizza dough throwing skills and put us all to shame. And then when we thought we couldn't possibly eat another bite, we shared homemade cannolis. I can't wait to go back.
