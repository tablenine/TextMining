I'll keep it short and sweet since I'm sure everyone has said all there is to say:. . I came here with the bf, and ordered omakase.  Absolutely amazing and probably the best sushi experience ever.  Everything was so fresh!  Even stuff that I didn't normally like (ankimo and uni) I fell in love with because it was all that fresh.  Yes, it's expensive but you can't beat the quality.  . . $170 for two people, omakase, and a bottle of sake.  Can't wait to come back!!
