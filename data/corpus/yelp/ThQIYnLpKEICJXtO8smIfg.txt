This runs on the expensive side for cafes, but hey, we're in Los Feliz. Mochas are always good, never too sweet and never too bitter, and the breakfasts and lunches are light and satisfying. I like the poached eggs with smoked salmon, and my friend always gets the pesto sandwich. . . It's usually difficult to find a place to sit inside, but there's plenty of outdoor seating.
