I really enjoyed the Banana Dulce De Leche ice cream and big red velvet cupcake, which was rich and not too sweet. The ice cream was plentiful with just enough banana in it and almonds as well. The smaller red velvet cupcakes are probably not as worth it for 75 cents, so I would recommend getting the big ones! The blue velvet Â cake was also yummy and rich.
