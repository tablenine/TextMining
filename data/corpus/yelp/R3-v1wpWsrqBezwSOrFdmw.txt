After reading the reviews, I had to see if there was a difference between American and Japanese Wagyu.  There is.  If you can handle the greasiness of fat in meat and enjoy eating the fat in meat, then the Japanese Wagyu is perfect.  I had a bite and it was delicious, but I wouldn't be able to eat an entire plate.  Hence, I ordered the American Wagyu...PERFECT for me.  DELICIOUS.  This is the best steak I've ever had in my life...cooked perfectly.  Also had the pureed potatos and creamed spinach.  Both pretty good as well.  What a great dining experience.  Yummy.
