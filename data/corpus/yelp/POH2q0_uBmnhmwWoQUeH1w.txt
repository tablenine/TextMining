Best day to go to Gilbert's?  Sunday for karaoke!  This past Sunday I grabbed Josh K and we went to Gilbert's to see my friends Josh R, Chad and Nathan perform.  I hear they are pretty good singers and have been wanting to hear them sing for sometime now.  The place was pretty packed with people waiting to sing, hanging out at the bar and/or eating dinner.. . I love the mango mojitos here and need to be regulated on how many I drink since you can easily suck down 5 of these in less than 30 min!  After the guys first song set, we decided to grab some stuff to snack on.  I ordered my favorite thing on the menu, which is the veggie platter.  You get grilled squash, zucchini, and red peppers with sauteed spinach and a heaping scoop of hummus.   Chad and Josh K had the grilled chicken pizza and mini burgers with fries.  Seriously, this place has a pretty diverse menu that can fit any ones palate!. . As for the karaoke...all I can say is WOW...the people performing do not joke around and are pretty awesome.  I think they spend a few hours before hand practicing in front of a mirror!  Josh R, Chad and Nathan were amazing and could seriously have been in this years top 13 for American Idol.  I was impressed!!!  The night would have not been complete without a bit of peer pressure as Josh K signed both of us up to sing "No Scrubs."  Yeah, I won't be doing that again with Josh K anytime soon! . . Always a good time, plus its something different than a typical bar!  Karaoke is on Wed and Sun and I think they even have Wii nights.  Hope to run into you at the next Sunday Funday!
