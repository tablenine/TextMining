Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Fogo De Chao is an all you can eat steakhouse with a complete and delicious saladbar. An amazing array of wines are also available to compliment your favorite cuts of beef, chicken, pork or lamb. . . The meats are served by gentlemen dressed as Gauchos holding perfectly roasted and sizzling cuts on sword like skewers. They ask you how you want it cooked and cut your preference as you gently use your tongs to lower the cut onto your meat dish.. . Biting into their garlic grilled fillet mignon cuts, you instantly taste the beef and garlic, you taste the caramelized sea salt on the seared exterior.. . It never fails that the meat is so tender, it falls apart in your mouth as you chew, further bursting with even more flavor.. . The chicken and lamb are to die for....the side dishes keep coming, it gets to the point where you start waving the guys with the meat cuts off...they will gang up on you, eager to serve you the following cut of meat.. . The service is 5 stars. The Ambiance is 5 stars. The food is off the chart. The price is roughly $38 per head for lunch, Dinner climbs to $54 per head . . But it is worth every penny.
