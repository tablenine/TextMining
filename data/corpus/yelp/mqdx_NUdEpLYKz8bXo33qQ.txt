It is what it is.  I had the oppurtunity to join some friends for a free sushi dinner and this is where we went.  If you have seen it on TV it is pretty much the same. Very trendy,. nicely decorated.  When I walked in the long hallway I heard Oriental Jungle Music, I felt as if I was walking into the remake of the planet of the apes. I was about to throw up already. "You Screwed it up! Damn you!! Damn YOu!!" (sorry bad movie tangent.)  I got to the waiting area and saw multiple Tv's behind the bar playing MXC.  That my friends tickled my belly in a better way and I immediatley smiled and became a male zombie.  Uhnga Buhnga!! Got a table and a staff iof non asian people helped us out.  sushi was allright, I would take out of town people there to check it out, but would never recommend to anyone who actually wants to eat good sushi.
