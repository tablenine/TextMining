Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
I came here, hoping to be impressed... Coming from Florida, I love checking out all the fish camps and seafood shacks, and was hoping this would be right on par.... So..? . It's okay, but I was certainly not impressed. . . We ordered :. 1 lb of Crawfish seasoned and steamed.... 1 lb of steamed shrimp . 1 lb of fried shrimp. 2 lbs of snow crab legs. 1 dozen oysters. We also had fries &amp; coleslaw for sides... they were average. . I must say, the fresh cane juice was quite delish! . . There was hardly anything to the crawfish, quite small and the seasoning was off.... . The steamed shrimp were good, but then again, it's not that hard to mess this one up, surprised they didnt come with any lemon?. The fried shrimp were done just right, but again, no lemon came with the order. what the??!. . The oysters were quite tiny and I never received the crackers I had asked for. . . Snow crab legs were good, but as I mentioned earlier, not one of those things that are too hard to mess up... . . While I enjoyed my lunch, I don't think I would be returning... The search is on yet again for the wonderful tastes of home... I think I shall like to try the place "Southern Seafood" . :o)
