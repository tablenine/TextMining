Went here after deciding once not to go out of ignorance. I had no conception of how Hawaiian fusion would work itself out. Boy, did I miss out. We started with the short ribs appetizer, and got the most tender juicy ribs I have tasted since ribs n bibs. An unexpected pleasure. Then onto the Maine lobster bisque, which I found less than rich and a little lemony with only the tiniest shreds of lobster meat. On and Poppin was the Dynamite-Crusted Salmon on a bed of sesame rice. Finally we are rewarded for our efforts with a chocolate souffle. The warm chocolate syrup encased in the hard cake shell was a beautiful surprise. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive. As soon as I can I want to go back and try the sushi bar.
