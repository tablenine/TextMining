If there is one thing that would make me love LA, it would be the Griddle Cafe.  (Sorry LA...me loves to hate you...). While I feel the host had a bit of a complex (although I don't blame him with the massive amount of people waiting in line), the service was exceptional once we were seated.  The best part about it...French Press Coffee...mmm...reminescent of Blue Bottle Coffee in SF.  Yes.  That good!  It's definitely a good sign when a restaurant has great food and awesome coffee!. So, upon venturing into the menu, you are hit with a wide selection that could only make your mind change about a thousand times!  Everything looked sooo good!  But seeing how the pancakes are bigger than the serving plate and ridiculously sized (although the baily's and khalua pancakes looked like an eye opener!), I decided against them.  BTW, portions are HUGE, so don't go overboard.. I opted for the Creme de la Creme French Toast.  Imagine this: French Toast with a Graham Cracker Crust and CHEESECAKE  filling over the top...a CHEESECAKE lover's dream.. The breakfast burrito was okay...it was...meh...it could've been more flavorful...Tapatio saved the day!  Finally, the Strawberries and Creme Belgian Waffles were...different, but a good different!  Take a guess at what the secret ingredients are...it's a pleasant surprise, indeed! . All in all...it's my favorite spot in LA (that's saying a lot!).  Celebrity sightings, amazing food and don't forget the coffee!  Thanks, Griddle Cafe!
