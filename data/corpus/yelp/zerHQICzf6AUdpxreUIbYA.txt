Friends have been telling me about this place so we finally tried it today. Should be more like 3.5 stars.... . We waited a friggin hour!!!! Small restaurant, not too many seats, and a billion people trying to get inside so go figure. It wasn't too bad actually since we walked around Little Tokyo while waiting. We checked out the store next door too.. . We finally got in!!!! We got the bar though. Grrrrr... O wells... We were starving! Note to self: GET BOOTH NEXT TIME! NEED SEATS! We sat right by the big pots. It was warm. Squished in the corner. O well.... . We had the Daikoku Ramen, Fried Spicy Tuna Roll, and small side of tempura with rice. Â . Ramen: Good. Broth better. Needs more meat. Egg is good.. Fried Spicy Tuna Roll: Didn't care for it.. Tempura: Good (already slightly soaked in tempura sauce).. Rice: Good with soup broth. Put lots of red pepper in the broth!!! :D. . Pretty good. Im not a big ramen person but it was pretty good. No wonder it's so popular. Cute, good, small, and japanese. :D
