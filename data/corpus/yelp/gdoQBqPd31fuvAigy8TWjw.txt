I'll skip the lengthy review, as there are already so many. Do yourself a favor and go to the family style dinner/wine tasting on Thursday night! You need reservations for this. We just happened to get lucky and stumbled upon the place and only 2 people with reservations did not show up. That's some serious luck! . . Food was fantastic, family style was super fun sitting at a long table with complete strangers, belly dancer entertainment was a huge bonus, and the short dude was a cute grandpa type whose cheeks you want to pinch! My only gripe was that it was a bit pricey considering we were eating on Styrofoam plates and drinking out of plastic cups (even the wine!)
