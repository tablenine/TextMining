Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
On our taco reign of terror tour, we hit up Los Feliz taco joints. They bill themselves as the best fish tacos and we weren't disappointed. Cheap, easy to order (fish or shrimp only -- mind blowingly, this doesn't prevent confusion from some patrons, however), and a full toppings bar with lots of hot choices (only one mild choice, and the signage says you're a wuss if you eat it -- it's still delicious). Fish is fresh and fried to order. Definitely try the spicy guacamole, and pile on the thinly sliced cabbage. Just don't ask for the tacos to go or you'll get an earful about why they shouldn't be.
