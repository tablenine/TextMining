Well, it looks like Katsuya has become a victim of it's own success.  Dinner at katusya's used to be a unique dining experience.   Now you feel like you're being rushed, eating mass produced sushi dishes.  . My gf and I were lucky enough to get seated as walk-ins in a fairly short amount of time.  But our excitement waned first by the service, or lack there of.  The place is so hectic, and  the service was sporadic at best.  1. we asked for the special menu, was given an abbreviated version that our waitress said was the same as the special menu.  It had about a 1/3 of the listed dishes.  2.  We had to ask for hand towels AND wasabi/ ginger AFTER our first dishes were served.  3.  Our table was accompanied by a couple of flying gnats/fruit flies.  They definitely seem to enjoy the dishes more than us.  And how were the dishes?  Very disappointing.  The sushi we ordered were  dull and lifeless.  The Aji was pale, hirame was oversoaked with ponzu sauce, and the hamachi was very below average.  As for the specialty dishes,  the clams were oversoaked with butter.  Kobe beef was eh, and a very forgettable shrimp dish.  Hamachi carpaccio(with jalapeno) and the spicy tuna on crispy rice were good.   Overall, the experience left quite a bad taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively.
