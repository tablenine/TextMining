Oh banh mi.  I crave thee with the misguided, sacrilegious passion that only a pork-loving Jewish boy could muster.  The only thing keeping me from you has been the inconvenient locations that you have dwelled within NYC.. . But now Baoguette has conveniently opened a shop on St. Marks - replacing the Jetsons meets Japan Bam automat.  Despite the down economy, they even sprung for new outdoor signage vs. placing an oguette after BAM's BA.. . For a reasonable $5, their banh mi's balance of soft baguette, pork variations, pickled vegetables, cilantro, spice, and probably other unhealthily delicious ingredients scratches me in a place where other sandwiches didn't even know I itch.  I gave the BBQ Chicken a try - which has most of the same ingredients as the banh mi sans the pork - and it compares pretty favorably.. . The pho ($8) was solid as well.  Liked the beef broth.  Like the sliced brisket and noodles.  I'm tempted to order this and the banh mi and dip the banh mi into the pho like a Vietnamese French Dip.  It'll be interesting to compare it to Pho 32 which is opening up on the same block.  (Am I psyched?  Pho sho!). . The noodles with beef ($9) wasn't quite the value of the other two but I enjoyed it.  I'd get it again if I wasn't in the mood for anything briny or brothy.
