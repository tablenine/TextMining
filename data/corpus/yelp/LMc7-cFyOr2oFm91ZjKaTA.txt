Came here a week ago to celebrate my friend's birthday, with a party of 12. Very easy to rack up the bill... But worth it, the food was great and the service was excellent- but thats probably because the size of our party. It was packed on a wednesday night- . . History was made that night... I was the last remaining hipster in Chicago who hadn't had sushi prior to Bob San. Yes, its true never. Oh, so shocking.. . I gotta say that the holy mackerel was pretty delicious and I'm not much of a fish eater either. I think next time I will definitely hit up the vegetarian options. The shitake mushroom rolls sound divine. Â . . I did however sample the New York Strip teriyaki and word of the wise order it rare, because medium was overcooked- the teriyaki sauce is heavy on the ginger and light on sesame and a bit too sweet for my liking. But it came with a salad and miso- very filling. . .  Cold saki is super sweet. Like candy. Take a date.
