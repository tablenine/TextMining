Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
"tiny morsels of heaven" is how i've always described this place. their juicy pork dumplings are hand "folded", steamed, and upon first bite, deliver the most juciest tender morsel of pork heaven this side of the pacific. other dishes are equally as well crafted, from their rice cakes to their vegetarian dumplings (for those veggie lovers- ajay). and for dessert i highly recommend the red bean dumplings.. . early arrival highly suggested. and if you would like to get seated more quickly, i recommend sharing tables with other parties. nothing like little chinese kids staring at you while you eat.
