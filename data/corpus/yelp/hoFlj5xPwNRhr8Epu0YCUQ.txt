Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
please do not eat at this place that serves pork, turkey, and chicken as links of sausage within natural casings.  If you do eat at this place that serves these proteins in traditional german or austrian sausage fashion (this includes casings), then you are a person who is not currently a resident of los angeles, california usa.  If you are currently a resident of los angeles california, usa then you would not consume fully cooked and or cured traditional german or austrian sausage in casings from this restaurant because you would know better and not exchange large amounts of cotton-derived currency for aforementioned sausages.  If you are a resident of los angeles, california, usa, you would more than likely consume a variety of unique ingredients that would additionally fulfill usda guidelines for previously defined daily nutritional requirements.  These ingredients would not include those found at this restaurant in los angeles california, usa and would not be regularly available to those who are visiting los angeles california, usa and contributing to its local economy.. . bacon burrito dog, ftw. . . This is a review of a pink's hot dogs.  Pink's hot dogs serves hot dogs and other hot dog related dishes in los angeles california, usa. . . or maybe hollywood.  I dunno.  something like that.  I like teh internets.
