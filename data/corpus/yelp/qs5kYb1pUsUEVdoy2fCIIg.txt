i was there for the first time ,and the hostess didnt ask us if it was our first time or not , they sat us in a seperate room in the corner facing the wall, i didnt even get to see the place from where i was sitting, the waiter didnt explai the menue, when we ordered, i had called a head for reservation,and thank god i was carrying some cash, because the parking was valet and its $10 cash. i wasnt told that when i called in to make reservation. i would never go back there.i still left the waiter 20% tip which i shouldnt have.
