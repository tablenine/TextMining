Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
We came here at least a few times a month when we went to UCLA.  Truly a great place for sushi lovers.  Fresh fish flown in from Japan every Tuesday and Friday so we'd always try to go there on those days.  Prices are amazing for the great quality of fish.  The wait can be bad so always try to get there early cuz they don't take reservations.  Gotta try the Aji if you have not.  I miss you Hide.
