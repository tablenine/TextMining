Restaurant: The Porter Beer Bar
Category: American (New)
First time at the Porter, and I'm kicking myself for not going here sooner. The place has a great selection of beers you won't find most places, and the atmosphere made me feel like I was at a station or stop in Wes Anderson's Darjeeling Limited. The luggage and suitcases everywhere add to its great feel. I had an amazing burger and a ridiculous amount of fries to go with it. Check this place out now!
