This restaurant is a terrific find if you are looking for Cuban food.  Everything was delicious from the appetizer, to the sweet plantains, the rib eye with black beans and rice, a house salsa, and a pistachio rum cake.  I'm quite a harsh critic but this is the best Cuban food I have had and I look forward to returning.
