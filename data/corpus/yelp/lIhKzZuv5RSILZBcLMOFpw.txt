Restaurant: Jack&#39;s Pizza &amp; Wings
Category: Pizza
Did a "trivia night" at this place, I think it was on a Monday.  Yes, trivia..lol.  It was my first time and actually it was pretty fun.  Although I knew about 10% of the answers, the good folks that invited us were pretty much trivia geniuses...so our team ended up winning...go figure?. . At any rate, Jack's is dirty, grimy, and relatively small, but on Monday nights I know you can get 1/2 off the wings.  They have a variety of flavors ( I even saw a strawberry on there), so you can definitely get your eat on for the cheap there.. . Apparently they have pretty good pizza (it looked good) too...i recently went back and tried there pretzels (they are known for these too) they were good at the restaurant, but not so good taking them back to the crib and trying to warm them up.. . I'll definitely go back for the 1/2 off wings...anything else is debatable:)
