Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
I took my girlfriend here on a Friday night two months ago. We had both wanted to go to Spring ever since we moved to Bucktown, and unfortunately, we were completely disappointed. . . The decor and ambiance is fine--nothing incredibly spectacular. The restaurant has a Asian minimalist theme that comes off as just another attempt at trying to be trendy. What was more surprising is that the place was dead. The front bar area was deserted, and only a few of the tables around us in the dining room were in use. . . It was the service and food that really disappointed us. My girlfriend ordered a glass of sparkling wine and after a few minutes of drinking it, a bug flew into her glass. We apologized to our waiter and showed him, so he took it away. With the high ratings this place gets, we expected them to bring a new full glass. Instead, our waiter came back with the same glass--without the bug--that had been topped off with a little bit more wine. You could see the lip marks where my girlfriend had been drinking out of it a few minutes ago. . . We tried to forget about that incident and move ahead with our meals, but the entrees were nothing impressive. We should have just cancelled our orders and left. . . Save yourself the money and disappointment. If you want a great restaurant in Bucktown, go elsewhere.
