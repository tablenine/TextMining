This was my first time trying this place out and it sucked. I spent a buttload of time trying to figure out where to park (still parked in the wrong area and got charged), and then when I finally made it to see the movie, the projector was broken and I didn't get to see the movie. They offered to comp the movie and gave me a free pass for another movie. . . I like the atmosphere and the set up is really nice and cozy.  I didn't get to order off the menu (dont really want to..because this looks like your same run of the mill type of food -only a little expensive). . . For the folks who come here for the first time, remember that they have their own parking and its free for 3 hrs. DONT park in the other parking deck...it's like $6 for 2 hrs.  I had to pay that and I didn't even get to see the movie... . . I will however be trying it again, now that I know where to park.
