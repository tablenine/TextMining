I first had this outside of the Street Fighter IV launch party in Little Tokyo.  . . I had been waiting in line for like 5 hours before the doors opened and needed to take a fat dump so I walked over to the cultural center nearby so I could unload, but the Kogi truck was right in front and there were all these people waiting.  I thought to myself, "I need to take a dump, but I need to fucking know what these tacos taste like!"  . . So I skipped the dumpage and waiting in line for 2 hours instead and ordered some bulgogi tacos.  And shit, I fucking loved them.  And till this day, I have yet to take a dump.  I also haven't washed my hands since then either.
