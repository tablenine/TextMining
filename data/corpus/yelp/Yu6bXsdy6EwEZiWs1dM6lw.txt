Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Whether charming hole-in-the-wall or modern and upscale dining, it's not very difficult to create an attractive restaurant. Too many places, though, forget to integrate place and purpose. The space should look like a setting for eating. . . Bottega Louie is dense with tables and people, but eases the crowded look with minimal decor--empty walls, marble floors, and sky-high ceilings. What makes it particularly special, though, is that the dining area is integrated with the cooking areas. The kitchen and pizza oven are in plain sight, so one can wink at the pizza maker in hopes for extra toppings. This design to me proves honest, home-style cooking; no home in America has a hidden kitchen. Â . . When you first walk in, there is no hostess to bombard you. A clean, straightforward bakery/market entertains those waiting for a table. Buy a few lemon or lavender macarons. But if that's too aristocratic, there's also a bar which makes a very strong Manhattan. . . Like others have said, servers, bussers, and runners are ubiquitous. Try to sneak an empty plate from them. . . The menu presents choices for all tastes. I'll be brief but the portabello fries were delicious (especially the dipping sauce that comes with!), the white bean hummus was fine, the vegetarian lentil soup was hearty with a great broth, and the pasta pomodoro with fettucini was fresh and simply delicious. . . You can spend as much or as little as you want, with small plates and price options to suit all types. Share a pizza or have your own; get one small plate or four; combine soup, salad, sandwiches, or a main dish. Have a small taste of wine, a glass, or a bottle. . . I left with a tummy tame from satisfaction, and a mouth looking forward to my next visit.
