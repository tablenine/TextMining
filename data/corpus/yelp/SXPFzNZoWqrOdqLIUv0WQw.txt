Spring is heavy on style, foams, seafoods and awesome.  Well worth the bucks or wait for your dad to come into town on business (wink).  . . From the amusee, a tuna tartare and grilled zuchinni with a yellow foam I can't recall to the dessert amusee, a shot of basil infused hot chocolate, everything was perfection.. . Kumamoto oysters with a carrot and tabasco caviar are a must!  Try a couple (they are tiny, sweet and salty) at $2.95 ea if you've never had them before.  Baby octopus in a hoisin sauce- just the right amount of chewy and flavory.  . . My prawns and morels with a wild mushroom foam were great but I wish I'd gone with the seared scallops and braised oxtail entree.  The scallops came with a heavy golden sear ON BOTH SIDES! Why more chefs don't insist on this I'll never understand.  The braised oxtails underneath were almost creamy in consistency.  . . Incredible desserts include a spicy chocolate sorbet and a cheese menu with 6 or 7 choices.  Not everyone at the table ordered desserts after dinner but I noticed they were still hungry enough to have a couple bites from the plates of those who did.
