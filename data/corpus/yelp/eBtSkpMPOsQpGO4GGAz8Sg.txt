This place reminds me of the beer garden in new york. It's so cool that they have something like this in LA. It would be even cooler if the whole place is outside (but it'd probably be hard to have business during really cold/rainy days).. . I heard their bratwurst is good but didn't get a chance to try it. I had a mango one and a hef. They also had really yummy sauces to dip the fries in.. . It's a very relaxing joint to hang out w/ friends. The crowd seems very chill and hip, and I wanna go back to try the bratwurst!! :) :)
