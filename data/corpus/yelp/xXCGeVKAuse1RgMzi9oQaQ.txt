Restaurant: Caf√© Agora
Category: Turkish
When my friend and I walked up to the counter to order dinner, Al showed us a print-out of the Yelp Atlanta home page listing Cafe Agora in the coveted #1 spot for Hot on Yelp restaurants. I've noticed it highlighted there several times the past few months and that's what lead me to his restaurant. He's definitely proud of the support he's received from the Atlanta Yelp community.. . Suffice it to say the food was fantastic, just as others have described in their reviews -- from the sampler plate of hummus, baba ganoush, tzatziki, etc. to the gyro meat, rice and pita there was not one thing that was a miss for me.. . Thanks Yelpers for leading me to a fantastic experience, and thanks to Al for showing us the hospitality that is abundant for all your customers.
