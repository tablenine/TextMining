Love love love this addition to the 'hood.  The wine list and mixed drinks are outstanding. Great infused vodkas.  Outdoor seating, pleasant indoor seating with a fireplace by the bar.  Never had an entree that was disappointing. Good community minded place-frequent sponsors of neighborhood events.  Live music.  GO
