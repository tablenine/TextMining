Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Philippe's -good, hits the spot, but not anything to rave about. After reading some yelp reviews, it seemed the recommended way to go was double dipped with cheese. So I had beef, double dipped with swiss. The beef is pretty bland, actually. It is tender, but not melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sandwich is not very hot so the cheese wasn't melty at all. I expected melted cheese on hot beef. The sandwich was good overall, but not something I will crave or go far out of my way to get. This is suppose to be one of LA's finest, but I think any Chicago italian beef blows the Philippe dip away. Although, I must say, that hot mustard is friggin fantastic - painfully fantastic. I would go back for the mustard. And the sides are good --very yummy slaw.
