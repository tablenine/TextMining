SO AMAZINGLY GOOD. Been craving hainan chicken ever since seeing my sister's pics in Singapore. Anyway, just get the hainan chicken and you will be satisfied beyond belief. What a gem. Lather it up with the oily chili and ginger sauces and you'll be in heaven. Even when all the meat was gone, I ate the rice with the sauces. . . Bf and I were just as amazed at the rice as the meat. On top of chicken broth, I dunno what else they add to the rice but it's also addicting as hell. . . MUST. COME. BACK.
