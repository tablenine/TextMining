Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
I'm fortunate enough to travel to Chicago for work 4 times a year.  Whenever we're in town, we get the rental car, and go straight to Gene and Jude's.   They recently raised the price to $2.00, and have cut back on the portion of fries, but the food is oh so good.  If you're looking for ketchup, forget it; it's non existent here.  2 years ago, I witnessed a woman bring in a bottle of ketchup, and she was asked to leave.. . I find it hilarious that a previous reviewer gives G &amp; J 1 star, yet gives Taco Bell 3 stars.
