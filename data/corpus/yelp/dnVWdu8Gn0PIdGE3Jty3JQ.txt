I had the same experience as Victoria C! READ THIS BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY AT THIS CRUMMY RESTAURANT. I've been here before too - it's a staple of the mediocre Tex-Mex, decent margarita Â joints but paying customers should never be treated like this. After a round of drinks at the bar and an early dinner (around 6:40) and two more round of drinks with dinner we too were asked to leave becasue people were waiting! What the F@#K?! The second time he came around I said "are you offering to buy us a drink at the bar" He said "no". So I said "Then leave us alone we are paying customers with drinks still on the table - you're being rude." He said "I am the owner and have been running the place for 30 years!" I said "Well then you should know better." . . Time to call this place what it is - played out. Take your business elsewhere - I'll never set foot there again - and better yet - if you have a similar story write it up here so they stop getting "crowds". They've obviously gotten complacent on service and manners and forgot how they got successful in the first place. Try Mexicali Cocina Cantina. right down the road in Studio City 818-985-1744 much cooler atmosphere and no one will ever ask you to leave.
