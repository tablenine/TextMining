Hmmmmm what to say about Red Light? Well to begin with, I didn't think it was that spectacular. The restaurant was cute inside but the food wasn't impressive at all, or at least the three dishes that I ate. . . Of the three appetizers that my table shared the main dish that I tried was a lobster roll. The fried dough on the outside tasted a little like a funnel cake and overpowered the lobster in the dish, if there was that much lobster to begin with. I also tried a pad Thai veggie roll, which was spicy but not my favorite. My main dish was a traditional pad Thai meal complete with rice noodles, pork, shrimp and tofu. It was pretty much a mushy mess. The only part of the meal that deserved a full 5 stars in my book was my cocktail. I ordered "The Mandarin" cocktail which was just the right amount of alcohol and sweet goodness. I'm not sure if it was the Asian or the Fusion in this restaurant that I didn't like, all I know is that I wasn't a fan.
