I really forgot what I ordered last time, since everything on the menu I cannot pronounce, but it was delicious. Breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and a type of gravy with soft mushrooms. But before all that comes a bread and olive oil(with SO much seasoning, lots of garlic and herbs) which was SO good. AND we didn't have to ask for more, cause it was obvi that we were in love with this simple starter. Well, not that we make great noise when we are out, because I don't like loud when I am eating din.. The parking is a pain if you are cheap like me and don't want to pay valet. and. The place is always empty in the restaurant because everyone wants to sit in the back where you can smoke.. Plus it was not that expensive at all. I came here for my last birthday dinner and I had to pay for my friends, and it didn't leave a huge hole in my pocket, just a tiny one.
