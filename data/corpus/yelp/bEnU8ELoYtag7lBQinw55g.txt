Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
I went to El Tesoro for a friend's birthday dinner last weekend. The service was excellent and I loved the location (in an old house), but the food just didn't do anything for me. The ingredients didn't taste fresh. It's an easy place to go with a big group, but if you're looking for quality Mexican food, look elsewhere.
