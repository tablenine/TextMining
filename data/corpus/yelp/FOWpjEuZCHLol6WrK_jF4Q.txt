I come here all the time now that I live in the neighborhood.  Some words of advice:  . -If you come after 10am on a weekday expect all the stroller moms and their kids to have snatched up the croissants (especially chocolate).  . -Try the chocolate banana cake.. -Try the vegetarian chili.. -Order a coffee, they brew it great here.. -Did I mention to try the chocolate banana cake?
