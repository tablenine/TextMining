Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Their waffles are bomb, the chicken makes you feel sick after but it's delicious while it's happening, the chicken omelette is unbelievable, and the food ALWAYS takes under 10 minutes to arrive after you order it.. . Prices are fine and they give you a most towelette when you're done eating. Done deal.
