What more can I say about this place? If you want good asian styled lobsters, go here. I've been going to newport seafood for years now. I'm glad they moved to a bigger location. Even though its a bigger location, parking is still pretty bad. I recommend you grab the first street parking you see, especially on the weekends. There is still a wait but compared to the old newport, it's fairly short. Expect to wait 20-30 mins, depending on the size of your party. . . Here's what I typically order when I go there.. 1. Basil Clams. 2. Bo Luc Lac ( French style beef cubes), one of the best I ever tasted. Be sure to use the pepper and lime dip.. 3. Pea sprouts w/ garlic. 4. Deep fried Sole, awesome with the dip.. 5. House Special Lobster, how can you come here and not order lobster?. 6. Crab with fish maw soup.. . A meal like that will run you about $140 but will feed about 4. It's best to go with larger groups so you can order different dishes.
