I can't believe I forgot to review Canter's!  I come to this place whenever I am in LA, which is all too often.  The matzho ball soup is to die for, the potato pancakes are crazy good, they are open 24 hours, they have this insane Napoleon pastry dessert that you can split with two other people, and, and, AND. . .they have Rodney Bingenheimer!  Eleventy one!!! See this link if you don't know who he is:. . . http://en.wikipedia.or....  . . It may be a freaky coincidence, but he's *always* there when I go, which is just too cool for words.  I'm such a lame fan girl sometimes.
