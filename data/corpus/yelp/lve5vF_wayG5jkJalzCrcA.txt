Great first date place or if you are trying to impress someone. It is very Hollywood and the waitresses are all hot!! But you will leave hungry and/or with a broken wallet. Place is pretty quiet and picks up around 11. Obviously it is more of a bar than a restaurant ... 4 orders of sushi and 2 orders later sample sake the bill was $165. GO figure.
