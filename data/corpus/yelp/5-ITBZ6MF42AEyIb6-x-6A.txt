I loved this place.  First off, they have my favorite drink, the Lava Flow (mixture of strawberry dacquiri and pina colada.  Foufou but so yummy! Dessert in a glass).  We ordered the fixed menu for what was $33 I think--had macadamia nut encrusted walu, which was so yummy, and I was able to take more than half home because I was full from the sampler appetizer and the drinks.  I highly recommend this place, but make reservations because it can get crowded.. . Update 12/7/07: Came here for a lunch function and the food was even better than I remembered.  Had the mahi mahi again and it was fabulous, and lava flows still the best drink.  Servers were a little harried but good natured.
