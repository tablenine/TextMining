it wasn't terrible, it wasn't great -- it was ok.  i have to agree with Skyler N. about some of the tables -- me and my fellow bears were posted right near the kitchen, adjacent to a small dividing wall the barely separated us from the latrines.  Overall the meal is not worth the sugar you need to pony up, but Fraiche certainly has an ok atmosphere (if you're on the patio or nearby it) with some fine dishes (if you order carefully).  I ordered a seabass special that was bland as water, but Mrs. Bear ordered pasta -- it was ok -- and my fellow bears ordered the stew and the ravioli (good).  The wine selection is ok, and the service was fine.  We may go back, but just not anytime soon as L.A. has so many other choices to offer.
