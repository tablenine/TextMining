Just thinking about Sinbala and my stomach growls. I am filled with angst because of my distance from the homemade sausages and icy cold bing.. .  After my friend Pat dragged me there on our trip to LA, I have not been able to rid myself of this addiction. The sausages are delicious with a just the right combination of salt and sugar. We tried the sausage with chocolate  and while it was an experience, I say nothing beats the authentic dish of raw garlic.  . . I enjoy just sitting there oogling at other people's food and listening to people who actually spoke Taiwanese. It was comforting.Their spicy wontons were really good as well as the oyster pancake. The best part was the bing. Oh, the bing was huge and I had a major brain freeze from it, but on a hot day, nothing beats it.
