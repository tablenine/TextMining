Category: Dim Sum
Phoenix has the best dim sum in Chicago for sure!  I love the eggplant stuffed with shrimp, man it's so good!  Also, the gooey rice noodles stuffed with meat or seafood are great!  If only I didn't get full, I want to eat everything.  Stupid stomach holding me back like a deadbeat husband! There's nothing that I haven't tried that I didn't like, and I try lots of stuff!  Plus, dim sum is really fun for kids and it's a great way to get them to try new things.  . . If you can, order a side of the greens.  I've never seen it come around on carts, but they're really good.  I think they're pea tendrils and they're delicious!  They're probably seasonal.  . . I've only had on bad experience here where our table was literally ignored.  It wasn't even crowded, but everyone kept passing us by.  The person I was with had bright pink hair and the thought crossed my mind that this may have been why we were avoided, which is a really shitty reason.  I could be wrong though.  Expect long waits if you don't get here really early.
