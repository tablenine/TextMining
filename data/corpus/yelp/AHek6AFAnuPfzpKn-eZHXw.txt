Came here in the evening one night just to grab some after dinner drinks . ended up paying a cover charge which i don't expect especially if i am heading out to a restaurant bar. The drink menu was cool but the drinks it self were particularly weak i would say. I don't like to support lettuce entertain you restaurants very much so i don't know if i'd come back anyways
