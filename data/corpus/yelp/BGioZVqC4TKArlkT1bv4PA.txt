Went there last night with some friends.  We had the hot &amp; sour soup, tostones, brussel spouts &amp; chorizo, bbq koji sandwich (w/ kimchi), tilapia sandwich, and soft serve w/ bacon and chocolate and cookies.  I can't really say anything negative about our meal.  Basically everyone at the table licked their plates clean and left very very full.  I'm trying to think what the standout at the meal was and am having difficulty.  Everyone seemed to enjoy everything, but each person had their favorites.  . . The one thing I'll say is that the ambiance kind of bothered everyone in my party... and their website kind of sucks.  The food is so happy-flavored and vibrant and the space is just not.  Also, I have fears about how cold that place is going to get in the winter.  Perhaps they should set up some sort of waiting system with Green Eye?   . . Very good.  Welcome welcome.
