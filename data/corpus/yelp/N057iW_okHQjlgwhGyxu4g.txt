Restaurant: Porchetta
Category: Sandwiches
I just had the Porchetta sandwich tonight, which was by far, the most disappointing $10 that I have spent in NYC. After taking a bite of the sandwich while walking along Ave A, I thought about returning to the store and demanding my money back. Except, I didn't because I got a girl's number while ordering my sandwich. I detract. This is my first review on . http://Yelp.com.  and I must be blunt and say, I joined to write this review because Porchetta is an absolute blunder and petri-dish of all things gone wrong in a meal. The food gods just simply cannot let an establishment such as Porchetta continue to churn out one dry, tasteless and cold pork sandwich after another. The bread is old, cold, dusted with too much flour on top and too chewy. It comes buttered, except the butter hasn't melted. On top of the slice of cold butter is the dry, tasteless (god knows how old) chunks and slices of pork. I am embarrassed for Porchetta to be on 7th street.
