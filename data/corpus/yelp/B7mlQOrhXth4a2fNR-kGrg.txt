After having my Macbook partially mixed in the connecting mall and starving for some good food, I went to this seafood place after seeing that my only oter option was maggiano's and I didn't feel like eating a huge amount of so-so italian food, as I had had some pretzel sticks from auntie anne's, which were good when you don't have them for two years.  But they really shouldn't be eaten more than three times a year with the amount of butter on them.  Anyway, back to the restaurant.  They sitted me quickly and it looked like a really upscale bar or something, which was really good.  I think you have to request bread, but I didn't need any after those pretzels.  I had a house salad and a shrimp cocktail to start, which were both good.  I've had better shrimp cocktails but this was one tasty and unique in that they served both the red sauce and a remoulade sauce that was pretty good.  The grilled salmon I had was very tasty and packed full of flavor.  For dessert, the peanut butter and chocolate cake was great and was a nice end to a healthy and much-needed meal.  The only drawback was that it took a lot of time for the food to be served, as I was there for over two hours.  Other than that, great experience and definitely better than the maggiano's, unless you're in the mood for stuffing your face full of bland italian food.  And they're open pretty late for any stragglers out of the mall, like me.
