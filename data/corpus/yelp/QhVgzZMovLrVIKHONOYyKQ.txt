For the most part, Kogi exceeded my expectations.  Fortunately, we were near the front of the line, so we didn't have to suffer a ridiculously long wait.. . Being our first time, my brother and I got the kalbi and spicy pork tacos, kimchi quesadilla, the Kogi hot dog, Kogi sliders, and the tres leches dessert.  Didn't get the burrito because it sounded like it would be overkill on top of all the other food we were ordering.. . Favorites were the quesadilla and the sliders, hands down.  Both were very savory and were nothing like I'd ever eaten before.  The quesadilla had a fabulous spicy sauce on top (and c'mon, who doesn't love kimchi + cheese?!), while the sweet meat and spicy sauce in the sliders created a really pleasant blend.  . . The tacos were disappointing.  I know it's their signature dish, but totally didn't see the hype in them.  The meat in them was just eh, and they just weren't very flavorful.  And $2 for one taco is overpriced.  At that price, I was expecting that one order would include at least two tacos.  . . The hot dog was delicious, but really messy to eat.  The dog itself was very juicy...but the cooks went a little crazy with the veggie topping.  Was not happy that it fell on my jeans!!. . Tres leches dessert was fabulous.  Anyone who loves dessert/chocolate won't be able to help but devour it!. . Love the fact they have Korean drinks, too.  :). . The amount of food we got was perfect for sharing for two, but at $28, it's a bit pricey for food you're buying off the street.  But would I eat Kogi again?  Absolutely!!
