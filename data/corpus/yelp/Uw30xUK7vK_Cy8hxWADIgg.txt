Salt and pepper would do this place wonders!  I have never had such bland 'Mexican food.'  We tried it for brunch and ordered the chilaquiles -which I believe the translation is 'leftover garbage cooked on one plate.'  I took my leftovers home and added seasoning - salt, pepper, salsa, more red onion, and tobasco...not bad.  We gave it another shot for dinner because we thought that maybe it was just a bad brunch...wrong.  Tasteless Mexican food for dinner too- who'd a thunk it?!  The atmosphere is pleasant and I really wanted to like their food.  Maybe it's a good place to drink???
