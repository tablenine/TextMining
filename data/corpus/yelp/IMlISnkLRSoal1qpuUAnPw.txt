Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
I cannot get enough of Blu Jam. I try and make it there every weekend for brunch. Kamil is the nicest guy and runs an amazing restaurant. Everything is always fresh. I try something new each time, and am always amazed. . . A foodie's paradise. Even on a teacher's salary, this place makes it worth it to go out on a Sunday morning.. Get this place its beer and wine license so it can stay open for dinner!
