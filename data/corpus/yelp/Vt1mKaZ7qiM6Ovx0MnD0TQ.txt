This is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  Everything here is good... they often have specialty drinks made with fresh seasonal fruit and their mojitos are among the best you'll find in the city.. . Be sure to try the Boniato Croquetas and the Ahi Tuna Watermelon Cerviche.  The heart of palm salad rocks my world and I'm a big fan of both the pork cubano and the tenderloin medallions.. . They're great for group dining (make sure to make reservations in advance though).  I have brought my entire family here several times and they absolutely love it.  The food here has a wonderfully interesting range of spices and flavors but can still be appreciated by people with a more "limited palate" (the picky / plain eaters I've brought here still seem to like the food as much as the "foodies").. . If you like to dine out during the week, they have some great specials.  The Wine-Down Wednesday is a five course tasting menu with wine pairings for under $50 a person.  They often have adventurous choices such as sweatbreads or pork cheeks on the tasting menu but they're always delicious.  Tapas Tuesday is a great way to sample some appetizers with your meal and for early diners, the late latin lunch is one of the cheapest meals (at least with two drinks included) you can get at a fancy sit-down place in the Chicago Restaurant district.
