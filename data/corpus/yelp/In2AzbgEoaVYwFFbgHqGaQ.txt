I have been going to Gene and Judges since before I knew how to talk. My older brother was a peeler - for those of you who don't know.. the guy who peels the potatos. I love Gene and Judges, now living in Homer Glen I make the hour plus drive out once a month to enjoy my double dog with everything + sports and a tamale.. can't beat it..
