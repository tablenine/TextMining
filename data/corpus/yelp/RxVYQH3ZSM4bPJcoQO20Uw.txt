I decided to try something quite different than what I'm familiar with when it comes to desserts.  What better way to challenge my sweet taste buds is at Porto's.. . So instead of the popular sweet treats I chose to bite into masareal, a guava-layered pastry, and mille-fleur (forgive me that I might spelled it wrong), which reminded me a bit of a banana creme pie.  Both were scrumptious; guava filling was so flavorful and the texture of the bananas in the mille-fleur was soft but not mushy.  And it doesn't hurt to pay $0.95 for the masareal in particular.. . All in all I'm very glad I tasted the other dessert items.  So in case you're wondering what other treats, both dessert and savory foods, I tried so far... . Faves: Potato balls (duh), fruit tart, cheese rolls, masareal. Good: Mille-fleur, Cuban sandwich, blueberry muffin. Alright, but glad I tried it: red velvet cupcake (one of the best frostings, though), empanadas
