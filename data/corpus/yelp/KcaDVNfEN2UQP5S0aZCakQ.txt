Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Orochon Ramen is known for their spicy ramen, made famous by Discovery Channel's "Man vs. Food" when the host took on the Orochon Special 2 challenge. A challenge which involves downing the entire contents of a rather large portion of ramen and soup. . . I love spicy foods, but I've never tried the Special 2 challenge for a couple of reasons, I like to enjoy my food rather than stuff it into my face in a frenzy, drinking all the soup just can't be good for the kidneys with the amount of sodium intake and I just do not have the bladder to contain all that liquid. I opt for the Special 1 on the menu, just below the Special 2 and still quite spicy. For me, the spice level is just right to hit the spot but novices to spicy foods would do best not to attempt to finish any of the "Special" level ramen. Just ask one of my friends who was on the spicy level of 3 and almost choked from the heat when he took a spoonful of my broth. . . As much as I like the place, there really isn't anything much to Orochon's ramen except for the extraordinary spice levels. The soup is rather simple, the noodles acceptable and the toppings are good but nothing stands out. If you want a fix of spicy ramen, Orochon is your first choice, but for other times when you want just plain good ramen, you're better off choosing Foo Foo Tei in Hacienda Heights.
