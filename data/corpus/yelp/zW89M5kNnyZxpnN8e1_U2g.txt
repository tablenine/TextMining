My husband-like entity and I were out on a walk the other day and got drawn into The Bluebird by the sun streaming in through the windows that were open to the street.  I was stunned to see the extent of their beer list.  Belgian ales for a mile, one's I hadn't even heard of -- and I've been paying attention.  We didn't order food because we were going lounge hopping that night, but the menu was creative (in a good way) and offered a range of small to hearty bites.
