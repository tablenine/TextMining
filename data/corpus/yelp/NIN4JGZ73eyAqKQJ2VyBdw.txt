This place is a pretty typical Mexican spot. I have had a hard time communicating with the servers at this particular location. Be sure to order things as they are on the menu. Every time I have asked for something special they have screwed it up. One time I asked for shredded chicken instead of the diced chicken and I ended up with no chicken. It wasn't even worth trying to explain to the server since his English was terrible. They do have a nice bar area, bathrooms, and televisions though so its a decent spot to grab a bite and watch a game. Other than that it's not really all that special.
