Delicious sandwiches, pastries, deserts, etc. Every time I've been here, there's a line out to the door, but the food is enough motivation to stay in line and wait the 20 mins! They have a wide variety of sandwiches on their menu. If you're around the area and are looking for somewhere to eat, definitely give this place a try. I recommend the Cuban sandwich and trying out their potato ball as well.
