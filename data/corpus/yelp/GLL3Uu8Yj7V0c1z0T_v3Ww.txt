Obviously, this is a hugely popular place - and as far as diners go, Fred's is the best. They do great interpretations of classic foods and their staff is efficient and seem to possess a certain amount of wit. Meaning: they aren't always friendly, but get the job done. It's LA. . While it's not exactly a date place, it has a great location to the movie theater. I've had many drunk-dining experiences here; and was never let down. Their breakfast sandwiches, chicken pot pie, mac 'n cheese balls, and Lucy Juicy burger are all winners. Sometimes the wait isn't worth it to sit inside, but inside is far better than their thisclose-to-the-street seating. Either way, it's a damn good diner!
