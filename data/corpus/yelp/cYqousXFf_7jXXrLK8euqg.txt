Restaurant: Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
I go here on Sunday brunch/lunch for the Thai street food, they are really really good! I'm Thai, so it's good to get something that's authentic and different from the standard menu for every Thai restaurant (pad thai, curry, etc.). That's why I gave it 5 stars.. The regular menu is ok. I've never really ordered raw sushi from here but the spider roll was pretty good.
