Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
A great place to grab a great NY meal at a great price (3x great).  You can definitely stretch your dollar here, and the food tastes outstanding.  It can get pretty tight inside due to the lack of space, but to me the food makes it well worth it.  Very affordable and very good Chinese food!
