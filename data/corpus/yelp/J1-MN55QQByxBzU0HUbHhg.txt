Went here for their happy hour and ordered the hamburger and belgian fries combo along with an ube shake. Everything was superb! My hamburger was juicy, the belgian fries had just the right crisp to them and the ube shake was pure heaven! . . I'm a fan of hamburgers although I don't have it too often (maybe 5 times a year). So now I know where to go when I need a hamburger fix!
