Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
with the money i spent here, i think i would of been better off eating lunch at cpk... or louise's for that matter. . . i took a client here and had to pretend to enjoy my food when really all i wanted to do was chuck it down the street.  i had written a longer review than this, but realized all i needed to say was simply a few words.  those who love, know, and live for italian food will agree with me on this. . . italian food (and restaurant) basics are: having a good red sauce, pesto, gnocchi (pasta over all), and mozzarella.  it shouldn't be rubbery or taste like paste.  if a basic knife can't cut through it... what will?
