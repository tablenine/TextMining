Such a crazy Friday night when I went to visit this place at around 8pm.  Like everyone else we put our name on the board and continued to wait to be called.  Fast forward over an hour later where I'm beginning to feel VERY hungry and grumpy.  To make matters worse this Caucasian group of three tries to cut the line by claiming their name was called.  You have got to be kidding me?  Doing this in an Asian restaurant, really?!  Quite frankly I saw them just walk in and ask about putting their name on the board.  I nudged my bf to tell him what happened and he goes on and marches up to the manager to discuss what happened.  Hahahahha, if there's anyone you don't want to mess with when he's hungry it's my boy.  Long story short there was an exchanging of words about showing ID, the police, inside cameras, and eventually the party left.  The end result, we got a table.  =)   . . I will give this place props for having very fresh sushi, but that's about it.  I wouldn't say I was very impressed with the miso soup that some ppl say is the best you can get (really?) or the yellowtail w/ scallion roll that some reviews rave about.   Everything that we ordered was average in my opinion.  Also, we had a new waiter and he forgot our order and a few other things that we had remind him about which was somewhat annoying.  . . For the amount of time it took to get a table, I would have opted for something else.  Just don't come here on a Friday night, because the wait is crazy.  Beware of shady cutters! =)
