THE FOOD HERE WAS PRETTY GOOD, BETTER THAN YOUR HOLE IN THE WALL THAI JOINT.  THE PRICES WERE ALSO SURPRISINGLY LOW.  THE ONLY PROBLEM.... . Oh sorry, let's stop outside.  That's better.  The only problem was the loud music.  I don't understand how anyone could turn the music on that loud and think "Yep, this is what people want when they eat Thai food."  While I liked the food, I can't see myself ever going back unless they fix the noise.
