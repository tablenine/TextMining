My fiance and I love to come here after a fun night at The Grove.  To die for corn beef sandwiches...and true down home jewish style food!  mmmm....thank goodness they're open 24 hours because I have the feeling that one day I'll crave this when I'm preggers...lol.  . . Little on the pricey side, but worth it!  Try to cornbeef/pastrami combo and fries.  yummers!  Top off your night with a drink at the kibitz room bar next door.  Definitely a hipster hangout, not as rough around the edges as the pantry.
