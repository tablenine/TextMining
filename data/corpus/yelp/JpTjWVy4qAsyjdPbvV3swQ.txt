Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Cuban bakery/eatery. . . I started going to Porto's when I was a wee Colombian pup. The original location is on Brand Blvd. in Glendale. I would visit with my mom and sis. The bakery was a horse shoe shape. People grabbed a number from the big red number thingy and they waited in droves as one of the friendly counter helpers called out their numbers. Serving everything from Cuban bread, beef filled potato balls or puff pastries to Cuban sandwiches and birthday cakes, this place made me happy. . . So they opened up a new Porto's in Burbank. This one is fancier and Â a bit more organized. I was afraid that the new digs would affect the yumminess of the food, but everything is still as amazing as I remember.  . . I love SF, but I miss my Porto's . . I RECOMMEND: . . Potato Balls: ground beef mixed with tomatoes, olives and God knows what else, surrounded by creamy, yet firm mashed taters, lightly breaded and fried to golden perfection. . . Meat Pies: Same filling as the potatoes, but in a nice little puff pastry. I think they brush the top with a thinned out sugar glaze. Sounds weird, but it is what makes you want to buy 50 and freeze them for later. . . Guava Pies: same amazing puff pastry filled with sweet guava paste. You can also get them with cheese.  . . Cuban sandwich: Cuban bread, crusty and oh so good. Thinly sliced pork loin, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickles. Pressed gently in a hot flat Cuban sandwich press. Heaven. . . If you are ever in Burbank or Glendale, stop by Porto's and you'll forget you are in Burbank or Glendale. . . There is so much more to talk about, but you can see for yourself.  . . check out the photos I took and look at their web site too. . . . http://www.portosbaker.... /
