Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
No Greek place I visit ever seems to be able to top Papa Cristo's.  Now that I don't live in LA anymore, I'm confined to just stopping by during visits, but it's still held up.  Same awesome crew of family workers.  Same excellent pita and gyros and souvlaki.  Same excellent baklava, same fun place to eat, same awesome entrance through the back walking through storage.
