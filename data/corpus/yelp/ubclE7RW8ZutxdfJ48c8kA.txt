Alright alright, I already know this is going to be perceived as blasphemous (Although "I've experienced better" isn't really that damning) by most and I'm a little ashamed to do it because I hate that people have been ripping them off and its a shame that other places are doing so (it is a landmark without question). BUT, with that said... . I had the 'carne asada'/steak burrito, it was unquestionably mediocre by SoCal standards. They use really cheap cuts of beef that are stewed in order to make them tender and the flavor is definitely not my style. I've lived in SoCal my entire life and this flavor and quality does not measure up. Now, I know there are obviously people here who are fans of this 'style' if you will, but all 3 of my friends were in agreement that there was absolutely no reason we would ever go back.. . The BIG burrito is really impressive though, obscenely huge (albeit $25). My buddy finished all but 3 inches of it (he's 6'6). Its like eating a small dog in terms of proportion and the regular burritos are already too much for most.. . Again, my friends and I only had the steak so maybe my review is skewed slightly.. but honestly, that's the bench mark I measure all Mexican restaurants by anyway so don't be surprised if you're let down too. I warned you. *Puts on Flame retardant suit on*
