Had a friend up to visit and we decide to try this place out.  Great service, and very affordable!  My friend had the chicken pad Thai which had an awesome peanut sauce and noodles.  I forgot what mine was called but it was the beef and vegetables in a garlic sauce, which was great...   Dont forget the calamari either...  So overall the meal was perfect along with the price and the atmosphere was chill with a soft decor that wasnt too much.
