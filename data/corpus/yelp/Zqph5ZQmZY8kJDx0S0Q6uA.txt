This Place is GREAT!!!!!. . I have tried multiple dishes and all are wonderful. The drinks are DELICIOUS, especially the ice cream ones (try banana). I personally enjoy the orange beef. Serving size is huge, so please don't be gluttonous and devour the entire plate, save some for later. The appetizers are a B-.. . The staff can be rude at times, but are very busy. The place is cramped and a lot of people show up. So do expect to wait 30-45mins to sit down. I heard they moved to a new place in the same complex; hopefully they got some more room.
