Everytime I want to eat at this place, it's crowded and the wait has always been at least Â an hour to the minimum.. I've been to this place 2xs in total. Both times I've gotten the veggie dumplings and green beans. The veggie dumplings were really good in taste. I like the tea they provide and the fresh ginger to add the vinegar and soy sauce for dipping the dumplings. . Their grean beans are awesome - flavored with ginger and garlic and slightly stir fried. . The last time I went there I got the sesame bun dessert. I ordered it thinking it would be one where it's a fried bun with white sesame on the outside. But was I wrong. When they brought those out, the bun was steamed with a few black sesames on top. When I ready to eat it, I bit into a black sesame paste filling. It was great.. I would go back here again for their veggie dumplings, green beans and sesame bun.
