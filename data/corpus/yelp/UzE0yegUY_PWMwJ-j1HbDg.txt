We started with a charcuterie plate with headcheese, which was the best of the starters. The cured meats are good, but no surprises. They also have my favorite aged cheddar cheese (Hooks'). All our entrees were great. I love my friend's kobe beef cheeks more than my own black cod, which wasn't bad at all. The chicken looked very moist but with crispy skin. I didn't sample it or the Pub burger, but they both got high marks. The mac-and-cheese is not too saucy and has ham hock.  I had to tell myself I shouldn't keep digging into it because I didn't order it.  For desserts, we had a cola cake with jack daniel ice cream, which was a great play on a jack-and-coke cocktail.  The service was relatively on the slow side, but it was a Friday night, and we had a lot of fun just catching up.  But I like to space out my meal more than most Americans anyway.
