Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
My friend and I had dinner at Tender Greens yesterday.  I love that the menu is simple, the restaurant is clean, and it's walking distance from my place.  There's nothing over $10 on the menu, which is great!  I ordered the Grilled Veggie salad.  It was so good!!!  My friend had the free range chicken hot plate and was happy with his dish.  I can't wait to go back.  . . There are alot of trees outside so if you sit on the patio, be aware that foilage may fall into your dish.  The only gripe I had about my meal was the garlic bread that accompanies your order.  The bread was so hard.  It was crispier than a crisp bread!  I took one bite and left the rest for the trash receptacle.
