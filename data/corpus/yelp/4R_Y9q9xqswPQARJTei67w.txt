Restaurant: Tender Greens

After coming back from an event in Culver city. I went on yelp to find a place to eat &amp; I noticed that Tender Greens had a lot of reviews and mostly positive ratings so I decided to check it out with the boyfriend. I was looking through the menu and didn't know what to try. I finally decided to try the "hot plates". I got the steak along with ceaser salad and potatoes. While I was waiting in line to pay I noticed that everything was pre-made and I was disappointed because I knew the food was going to be cold and I was right. I barley got any salad compared to the ones in the pictures. The steak was bloody red for medium and cold. I mean I saw the workers heat up other people's meat on the stove at least. It didn't have much flavor =( I was really disappointed. I mean there's not much left to eat except for the garlic bread which was so hard I barley touched it. Lastly, the only thing that I liked was the potatoes, but for some reason they tasted like they were made instantly because I've had it before. I guess I had really high expectations for this place, but seriously $10.50 for 4 slices of steak which was the only thing expensive is not worth it at all. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but I'm glad my boyfriend saved his money and went over to Kettle honey chicken to get real food.
