How happy am I that I yelped for a new sushi place?!  Totally great place.  Yes we waiting to sit down, yes it takes only cash but it didnt really matter.. Our server was really friendly and attentive and the food was fantastic.  I guess I dont need to go into too much detail since clearly from all the other reviews we know the food is good...but here's what we had:. bottle of cold sake (def recommended). tempura appetizer (everyone seemed ot be having it). tuna sushi. albacore sushi (totally melt in your mouth). special scallop sushi (very tasty). yellowtail sushi. ..... deciding it was too good to pass up a little more we got:. another albacore sushi. toro sushi (so glad we went for it). . leaving full and happy for $51 plus tip.  What an awesome deal!
