I just went here a couple of weeks ago and picked up a couple of pizzas for a BDay party.  I decided to go with some specialty pies b/c I am special like that and din't feel like texting my friends to see what they wanted.  I got one McLeod Nine  which was good, but the birthday boy is anti-garlic and didn't like it.  I LOVE garlic and since  I am the one who paid I decided that I didn't care if it was his day.  No, the pizza was good and garlicy, just the way I like.  Crust was good too, but doesn't stick out in my mind.  I also got the tranquilo which has pesto as a base.  I liked that one too.  My friends were more a fan of the McLeod nine though.  Oh and the birthday boy.. hates pesto.  Guess his party was more about me than he.  oh well. The pizza was good.  Not as good as Everybodys, but much cheaper, though not as cheap as Pizza Hut.  But really, who is as cheap as pizza hut?
