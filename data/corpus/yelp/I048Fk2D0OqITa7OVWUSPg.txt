I have tried quite a few things on the menu, and have never been disappointed with any of my selections.  I will give a special shout out to the Cajun Chicken pita sandwich and steak fries... it's great!. . however.... . The service is close to awful.  If the place is super busy, or if there is hardly anyone in there (like 7PM last night), it seems that our waitress disappears somewhere, never to be seen until it's time for the check.  I don't think any waitress I've had has ever come back to ask if everything was ok.
