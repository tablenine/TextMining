Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Great atmosphere, awesome crowd, nice Argentinian eye-candy, great food. Went here on a Tuesday night, sat in the patio, and it was packed with fun, beautiful, worldly crowd. Nothing fancy, but this is one example of how simple can be oh so gooood. I love this place.
