A truly great space with a solid menu - built for a really cool time out.  A small unassuming space with 3 floor and secluded booths for all tables.  Great music and ambiance.  The service is informative, friendly and top-notch.  Lots of variety on the menu.  Omakase is the way to go as long as you add a few more random dishes.  This restaurant is how restaurants should be, what you imagine a night out would be like out of the country.  Spending hours eating great food and enjoying great company.
