I took my wife here for a late Mother's Day celebration on 5/15/10. Mastro's is definitely a scene/be-scene type of place.. The service was extremely attentive without being overbearing and our server Jessa was perfect. . . My wife started w/ the Warm Spinach Salad while I opted for the Ahi Tuna Tartare. Both plates were excellent. The Tartare had just the right amount of spiciness to offset the raw Ahi Tuna. . . For entrees we chose the Bone in FIlet and the  Fish Special of the evening which was Wild Columbia River Salmon. The Filet here was exceptional but the Salmon was amazing!!!!. . Sides we choose were Potatoes Au Gratin, Sauteed Mushrooms and Steamed Asparagus. Portion size on these as well as everything else was very large. We had lots of leftovers for lunch the next day.. . We ended our meal with the Warm Butter Cake Ala Mode. My wife now refers to this as  the best dessert she's ever, ever had! Hands down.. . Overall we enjoyed a wonderful evening and will definitely be returning. . . My only complaint would be that couples of two are seated at a banqette with small tables so close together that you are in effect dining at what could easily serve as a communal table. You'll be finishing your fellow dining neighbors sentences before the end of your meal. Depending on your luck of the draw this could easily make or break your evening.. Also, the noise level here is very high.
