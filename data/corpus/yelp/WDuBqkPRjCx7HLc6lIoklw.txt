Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've lived in LA pretty much my entire life. That said, I had never been to Pink's until last night but yes, I heard about Pink's a lot and seen people eating outrageous-looking hotdogs here.. . The good factors are that it's opened late, the staff from the parking attendant to the workers are really nice. I came here pretty wasty and I had to use the restroom. I asked the worker if he had a key and he said yes and got it for me right away which was fantastic because I hate waiting. Then I was trying to open the door but for some reason, it wasn't opening and the parking attendant asked if I needed help and came over. Just great! . . I ordered a turkey hotdog even though I usually don't eat meat, but it turns out they have a veggie dog. Maybe it's because I just ordered a plain turkey dog with ketchup and not one of those smothered-looking Pink's dog that I usually see, but I just thought it was really lackluster. It tasted kind of boiled although it clearly had been on the griddle.. . We came here around midnight and there were no lines but I've seen pictures of lines at Pink's before and this line was pretty short. . . I guess at best, I can give this 2 stars because the people working there are great and also because it's pretty entertaining how they have a wall of famous people who have eaten at Pink's. The most famous probably being Nicole Kidman, Tom Hanks, and Elmo.. . I think I would much rather have a Costco polish sausage.
