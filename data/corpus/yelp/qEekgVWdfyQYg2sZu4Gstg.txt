Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
It's been years since I went back to Porto's and the one thing that hasen't changed about this place is the amount of people lined up to eat lunch here. Luckily the place is large enough to fit you, your family, your extended family, your friends and your friend's family. . . If you live in LA it means that you've been here before and you've tried the potato balls, meat pie, cheese rolls and chicken empanadas. After that you've taken them home to eat at 2am while watching Adult Swim and you probablly had the rest for breakfast in the morning. Even if you don't remember ever going, you did. In fact go look in your fridge right now because you'll find a box from Porto's.. . Not in there huh? That's because I got to it first.
