Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This place is ok.  Never saw one celebrity in all my times going there. So dissapointed ;) You know, it;s funny how all these celebs go there and have hot dogs named after them because it looks like they wouldnt even eat a half of a half of a quarter of the dogs named after them.  Anyways, pinks is good but very overated.  The food is uber greasy and  while I know the line is part of the decor, lol, its too freakin long!! Not worth the wait or calories!
