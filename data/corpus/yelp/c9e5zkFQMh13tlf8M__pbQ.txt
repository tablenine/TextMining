Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Very traditional style Japanese Ramen place, which is not for me :P. . Also come early as it can get crowded.. . Food:. It's def more price effective to go for lunch, but other wise it's a bit pricey for me for a bowl of ramen.  If you don't eat a lot I suggest a 1/2 bowl, otherwise your in for $7 without any extra things to put inside.  . . They also have a fried ramen which is pretty much like yakisoba, which I actually like a little better.. . The cool part about their ramen is it's cooked to order: . Noodle: soft, med, hard. Sauce: mild, med, strong. Soup: light, med, salty. . Creme brule isn't worth it, the inside tasted like jello pudding :P.  Still to the ramen and then hit yogurt land or something. . . Service:. I would say their staff is highly trained as Japanese places should be and they do the whole greeting, yelling, thanking, yelling, welcome, yelling, etc.  . Though their service gets worse as the amount of people pile on in.. . Atmosphere:. Along with the yelling, the benches are made of wood and in general it's not super comfy in their.  I guess it helps to get people out.  Also it's kinda small so if you like eavesdropping it's not very hard to do.  It's def a hip place to be though, esp if your asian or like asiany things :P
