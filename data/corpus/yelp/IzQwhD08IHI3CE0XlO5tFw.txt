When I write a review please Believe that I tell the absolute truth, and you will not be disappointed  if you check out the places I give 5 stars to. So LOTERIA GRILL....Great Food! Every time I go to the grove I have to eat here its just human nature because the food Rocks! the only thing is  that they sometimes don't have that favorite dish everyday, like I ordered some sweet corn Tamales one day, and they were the BOMB! and I came back the next week and they didn't have any and told me to check back tomorrow, but I wanted them that day! Its gonna be a crowded so come early and avoid lunch hours during the week. The rice and beans are heavenly....the down side is the price....A lil pricey. but save your pennies cause this is some good eaten...That's the low down around town....Do you wanna be down??.....Smooches:)
