Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
This place seems to good to be true.  ...But, I have yet to find the flaw.. . According to Kevin B. (. http://www.yelp.com/us.... ), the "entire menu is plant-based and free of cholesterol, animal fat, trans fat, and high fructose corn syrup" without losing the sight of flavor.  Take for example, the sweet potato fries.  They have a higher nutritional value than regular potatoes and naturally sweetened.  The Veggie Grill bakes them before being flash-fried in canola oil.  Thus, the oil is a facilitator of the fry's crispy exterior, and does not saturate it.. . And, if you're on a gluten-free diet, this would be a good spot to fill your tummy as well, with several options.  Ask the staff for a list.. . Some Helpful Advice:. . 1.) If you're like me (that doesn't like to wait), I recommend that you call in your order if you plan to stop by for lunch.  The wait or the line/wait can get quite long between 1130am - 12:30pm.  For the menu, use this link: . http://www.veggiegrill.... . . 2.) If you're planning to go to the Bowl, a Dodger game, or a picnic sometime in the near future.  I highly recommend take out.  They come in these cute, brown paper boxes... and the staff automatically separates the dressings and vent your fries.
