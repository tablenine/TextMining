Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
Atmosphere is great, an open-to-the-market counter with movies projected on to a tiled wall. The burger - just ok. I ordered a double with bacon, chili, and green hatch chilies. The bacon didn't make it on to the burger. I wanted to like this place, and I do, its just not a "come to jesus" burger in my opinion.
