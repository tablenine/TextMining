Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
After a sun-beaten trip in the rented convertible from San Diego we arrived at Pink's. Parked. Put a quarter in the meter (1 hour for a quarter, people!!) and made our way to the line that wrapped around the building, ending in the parking lot. Some things never change.. . In about 45 minutes we discovered that some things really never change. We got our dogs.. . Well, sadly I've changed... and what I did discover on that hot summer day is that this sort of hot dog (like the infamous SF Mission bacon-cart dog) tastes better after a night of drinkin' and clubbing. . . Not that I didn't enjoy it... the staff was quick once they got our order, and the dogs hit the spot. Plus, the fries were pretty good, too!. . Good dogs, efficient staff, and tasty fries = 4 stars for the time-capsule experience that is Pink's... . . p.s. Still think the Wiener Factory (R.I.P.) made a better dog, but what are ya gonna do?
