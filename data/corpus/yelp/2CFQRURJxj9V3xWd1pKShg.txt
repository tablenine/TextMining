This place is pretty cool. The food is good &amp; so are the prices. I've been a few times. The first time I went I had a great, down to earth server. However, the second time I went, the server was horrible. She got upset because my mom and I wanted to order appetizers. She told us we had to go upstairs if we wanted appetizers. However, the upstairs area is more of a singles, mix &amp; mingle area. We weren't there for that, that particular night. We didn't care what she said so we still sat there.. . I would not recommend this place if you're trying to go to dance and have fun. They have an upstairs area with a dance floor and music playing, however it isn't live, AT ALL! I only recommend it if you're going out to eat for lunch or dinner.
