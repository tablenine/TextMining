I'm Mexican so its hard to find a good Mexican restaurant that is authentic, this place is pretty close to the real stuff. . . The food was pretty good, I ordered the shrimp tacos, the Spanish rice was good , black beans where good the fresh tortillas where really good but the shrimp where small and not to much flavor. . . Try it out to see what you think about it.
