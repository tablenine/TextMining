Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Gastropubs
If you want your mind and your taste buds to explode with deliciousness, go to Umami burger.  I have never in my entire life been so satisfied with a meal as I did when I ate here.  They serve Coca-Cola in the old glass bottles, so it makes you remember the awesomeness of your childhood while you hound down the burger.. . I ordered the Truffle burger.  I was nervous about it, but the waiter said that it was his favorite, so I trusted him...and he was RIGHT.  It was beautiful.  I wanted to eat as slow as possible so the experience would not end.  If I could sit all day and eat burgers at Umami, mark my words I WOULD.. . Only thing is you can't add anything to your burgers.  They come as is, you can only request certain things taken out.  My friends ordered their burgers and wanted lettuce added, but they waiters said they couldn't because it would ruin the taste.  Weird, but whatever.  It was worth it.
