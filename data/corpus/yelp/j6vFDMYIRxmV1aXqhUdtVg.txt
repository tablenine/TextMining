I don't have much experience with Ramen, but I love anything with noodles and one day, instead of sushi, I really searched for some noodles in Little Tokyo.. . I first went here after an exhibit at MOCA. Being evening on Saturday, the wait was about 45 minutes but boy was it worth it. That stock they say they cook all day is beyond delicious. My friend described it best when she said it tastes like, "Butter and Bacon." Yum!
