Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
It deserves five stars for being an LA institution, a vestige of What Was, a rather charming little place and certainly for the sentimentality it engenders in a lot of people who grew up here. The overall quality of the burgers is reasonably good, probably three stars, but at seven bucks a burger The Apple Pan just isn't that stellar. If you're passing through town, it's worth a stop; it has a charm and the experience (even the crowded part) can be fun. If you're a local, dropping by once a year or so for the sentimental reasons is probably enough. One thing you'll probably come away with is how surprisingly well a hamburger and cup of generic coffee can complement each other.
