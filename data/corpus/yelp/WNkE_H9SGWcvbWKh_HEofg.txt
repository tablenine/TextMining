Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I went to Toro because Green Tea was closed for the holidays. Its really nice inside and I was enthusiastic given the crowd at 11:30 was already large. . . Watching others order, I quickly figured out most were ordering one roll as their entire meal. The roll menu is gigantic. If you've eaten at sushi in Chicago, you know there are only so many traditional ingredients one can use to make rolls. Toro's rolls feature cute names for permutations of your standard Americanized rolls, Dragon being a key focus. Personally, I knew I was in a yuppie restaurant when I discovered an "Oh My God" roll which has to be one of the most irritating expressions of the North Side bimbo. . . I ordered sushi and it wasn't up to Green Tea standards. Not bad by any means, but certainly not worth the wait. By the time we left, the place was a madhouse. . . So if you are looking for a roll restaurant, you have died and gone to heaven at Toro. If its sushi you want, there are far better alternative. A lot of the mob is also driven by the BYOB.
