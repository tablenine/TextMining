Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
This stretch of Western has a gang of Thai restaurants, but on Friday night Sticky Rice is the only one that's busy--wonder why? Maybe it's a combination of fresh ingredients, powerful flavors, sizable portions and surprisingly fair prices.. . First up was the Northern Thai sausage, dressed with cilantro and lemongrass--a splendidly sharp combination of flavors unlike any sausage I've hitherto tasted. I was curious to try the crab ragoon, since it's a must at my favorite-ever Thai spot in Winnipeg, Lao-Thai (see my review), but Sticky Rice's cream cheese-heavy rendition didn't quite measure up. The pad prik khing catfish arrived Thai spicy in a cute porcelain fish-shaped dish in an amount that belied the mere $7.50 price. . . Pad phet scallops were a classic variety of this red curry dish, but the Ka Nom Jeen Num Ngiaw (pork and cubed pork blood cooked with curry served with thai pasta noodle) turned out to be spiciest of all the dishes. Thank goodness I had a Thai iced coffee to extinguish the flames!
