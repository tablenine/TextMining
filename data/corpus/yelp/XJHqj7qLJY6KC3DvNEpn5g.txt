Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
The reason to go:. Everyone's been clamoring about this place because food media darling Nancy Silverton (La Brea Bakery) is back in the kitchen and Mario Batali (of orange clog fame) is an owner.  Hype?  YES.  But the food meets the expectations.. . The food:. New Yorkers will scoff at the "Silvertonian" idea of pizza, but these perfectly crisp individually sized pies will haunt your taste buds long after the wine is gone.  I had the fennel sausage pizza and the mushroom pizza, albeit greasier than I expected, was aromatic and delightful.  The fried squash blossoms also rocked my world.  Dessert was simple and delicious, though I was sad my friend was allergic to pinenuts and wouldn't let us share the butterscotch pudding.  Expect to pay about $20-35 per person, depending on appetizers and wine.  . . Meh factor:. Wine bar is cramped if it's busy.  Reservations are difficult to get, but will get easier as giddy foodies get tired of playing with their new toy and move on to the next big thing.
