People weren't kidding when they said the lines could get ridiciulously long. Lucky for us, we decided to heed to these warnings and arrived at the location 30 mins early. . . There were already two people waiting ahead of us. After waiting for a while, the truck finally came. However, we decided to visit the kogi taco truck on a rainy day so we had to wait around 30-40 extra minutes in order for them to heat up the meat. The line behind us kept getting longer and longer and we were more thankful in coming early. . . The only sucky part was that the guy who was waiting first in line, let 10+ of his buddies cut in front to order with him so we waited an additional 20 mins or so... so i had to take off one star because we basically waited more than an hour for this.. . Since this was our first visit to the kogi taco truck, we decided to order all three types of taco, a short rib burrito, and kimchi quesadilla. I'm not sure if it's because of all the hype I've been hearing, I actually thought the tacos were good but not great. The short rib tacos were definitely my favorite. The burritos were OK. But the kimchi quesadilla was GOOD! I really enjoyed it. But I don't think it was worth the one hour wait. . . I'll definitely go again but it's not something I would like to eat every week. I would prefer the OG mexican taco trucks over this but it was still good.
