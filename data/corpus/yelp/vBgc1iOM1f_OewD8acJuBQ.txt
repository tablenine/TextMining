Restaurant: Surin of Thailand
Category: Thai
I don't understand how this place is so consistently packed. Â They have the blandest thai food ever. I have eaten here multiple times and refuse to go back. I want to like them b/c the restaurant is 3 blocks from my house but Surin is like the Applebees of thai restaurants- boring.
