The first deep dish pizza I'd ever had was from Zachary's in Berkeley, California, supposedly the best deep dish in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was like, eh. It took a trip to the birthplace of the deep dish to convince me that it could be as satisfying as it was. . . I waited in line for about half an hour (though waits seemed to go up to an hour) for an individual spinach and broccoli pizza, which I ate slowly and FINISHED (yes, I ate the whole thing.) The crust was perfect - no hard, burnt parts - and the cheese was plentiful but mild, more something to hold together the "meat" and tomatoes of the pizza than anything else. . . Tiny spot and long wait (heat lamped, enclosed waiting area provided) but great, friendly service (I'm always a sucker for being addressed as "honey") and a real sense that I was eating a food that was worth pilgrimaging for, that this was something truly "Chicago.". . Bill came to about $10 for pizza and drink, so it was an inexpensive, filling meal, too.
