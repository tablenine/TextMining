Went to craft a couple of Friday's ago.  The restaurant space if very large and open with a "modern decor".  It was very comfortable and not stuffy or "busy" at all.  My wife and I went with one other couple and shared the dishes "family style" as our waitress recommended.  We started with oysters, short-rip potstickers and a tuna sashimi dish (sorry, memory is failing).  The short-rib potstickers were okay, skin was a bit thicker than I like for potstickers.  The tuna was really nice and had an delicious poke/salsa on top.  For our main course we had the John Dory, sole and the potato gratin side. Though I'm not a big fan of John Dory, this one was really good and was served with smoky mushrooms which were fabulous!  The sole (which I thought I would like more of the two fishes) had marcona almonds and was very good (I liked the John Dory more but my dinner party was evenly split between the two).   All in all, very good dinner not heavenly but everything tasted delicious and worth a repeat visit!
