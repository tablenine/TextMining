wow i loved this place. kristina b and i got in and sat right down. i loved the decor and the food. and the service. oh man so so yummy!. . i got a eleven city burger with a side of ranch dressing and the burger was HUGE. and so so yummy. and so were the fries. i also got a strawberry shake and it was by far the BEST shake i've ever drank. . . kristina got a chicken sandwich and it was equally as huge as my burger and just as good.. . the only gripe we had was that it was a bit chilly.. . oh yeah! they serve breakfast. all day. everyday.
