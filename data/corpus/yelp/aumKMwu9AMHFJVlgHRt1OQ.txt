"Wait just a minute, are we still in Wrigleyville?" . That is what you'll be asking yourself once you enter Uncommon Ground, which is anything but a Wrigleyville hang out. More likely you'll feel you're in Roscoe Village. (Which is a good thing in case you're wondering.) Recently celebrated a birthday dinner with my bf.. . Drinks:.  I ordered the Tree-Tini. Featuring Rain organic vodka &amp; Veev Acai spirit. For every Tree-Tini you order they plant a tree!  To date, they've planted over 7,300 trees.. So I had a great drink and I planted a tree (or four). Yup, that's how nice I am.. Apps:. -Crispy braised pork belly -Creamy herb potato salad, house made stout mustard, pickled cucumber salad, crostini. Nice, but I pretty much love pork belly and would be hard pressed to have anything negative to say about any pork belly.. -Sweet potato fries, goat cheese fondue.. Now, lots of the reviews raved about these, but for me they were just meh, just okay.. My entree:. -Duo of duck - duck confit, seared duck breast, black river gorgonzola, 'crunchy' potatoes, farmer's market onion &amp; port wine duck jus. Holy poultry Batman! I'm not a big fowl gal, but this was delicious. Juicy, tender, basically  melted in my mouth. I may have been moaning audibly while consuming it.. Dining companion had:. -Bacon wrapped midwestern meatloaf - Yukon gold mashed potatoes, demi glace, caramelized onions, sautéed spinach. Didn't try it, but looked great, and how can you go wrong with bacon wrapped anything? Answer - You can't.. Dessert:. Everyone 'round here knows I hate chocolate so I ordered the. -Seedling farm apple crisp-salty peanut gelato. Again, clearly audible moaning involved. I wanted to bathe in that gelato.. BF had the:. Chocolate chip banana bread pudding- whiskey gelato &amp; caramel sauce. Whiskey gelato? That can bring about world peace I assure you.. . As other reviewers mentioned Uncommon Ground CAN BE a bit pricey, but for great drink selections &amp; a unique dinner in the middle of Wrigleyville it is certainly worth a visit.
