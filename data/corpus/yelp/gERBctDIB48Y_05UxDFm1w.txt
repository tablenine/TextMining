The Buns here are excellent... I got the Pork Belly, SLAMMIN. TENDER Pork Belly (which i'm a fiend for), and various Taiwanese condiments is awesome!. . The people working here are sorta slow though... i waited like 10 minutes for a bun. This white dude was making it delicately, if it was an asian guy from hong kong, he prolly would've been able to make it at 1000% faster pace... lol. The music they play in this tiny shack is cool too. . . Price-wise, definitely a rip off.. 4 bucks for a bun?! No Thanks.. . I recommend to try this place ... I know I'll be back when i have the craving for pork belly gooodness and want to be ripped off.. . P.S. - I think I've had better in Flushing, NY, but this is convenient and close to me. AND i think my mom can 1-up this place!!
