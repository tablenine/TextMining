I had a birthday party here a number of years ago, and have always loved this place. Chef Randy is an acquaintance of mine, and he is super charming, cute and REALLY knows how to cook. Everything is spiced well, delicious and very memorable. Late night the vibe is great, and it's fun to watch people on the dance floor shakin' their salsa bootys. Fun place to go if you're in the mood to eat and then dance, dance, dance. The bar is stylish, many great South American drinks - YUM!
