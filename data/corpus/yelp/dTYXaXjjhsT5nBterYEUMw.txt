"OROCHON LEVEL 1 RAMEN - THE SPICIEST CHALLENGE". . I have tried the level 1 Orochon Ramen, which is the spiciest ramen you can ever, EVER get in Los Angeles..... . ....I do NOT recommend you to get it, unless you know what you're doing. I literally burned my tongue from the spiciness and could NOT taste anything the entire day and the next day.. . In fact, after having 1/2 of the bowl of level 1 orochon, after a while I noticed I couldn't taste anything and that was because my taste buds were burned off. . . Imagine getting a habanero or raw jalapeno, slicing it in half so that the seeds are exposed, and then rubbing it on your entire tongue, then drinking hot water..........that is Orochon ramen lv. 1. . . If you're still willing to try, bring a tissue packet, and some heartburn medication or pepto bismol, and a camera.
