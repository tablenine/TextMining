It's always a good time at Fred 62,  I don't know why but it does.  Maybe it's because the neighborhood vibe, oh I know, it's their yummy greasy burger!  I love it!  They don't served the kind of basic lettuce and tomato burger.  A lot of stuff has put in to it.  A variety of choices is alway good and the burger size is just right, meaning not too big.  I love their fries!
