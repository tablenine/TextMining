Went here for a bro fest. The food was good, but nothing memorable. What was memorable, was our waitress going through the menu and telling us that every item either wasn't very good, or not something she would eat. While i appreciate honesty, why am i in this restaurant if the employees admit that the food isn't good. She was sweet but my expectations were severely lowered, and the food just met them. Mussels were cooked well, but i would have enjoyed more broth for some post-mussel-bread-soakage.
