Actually, I wanted to write this review because the listing says they don't have outdoor seating and I distinctly remember seeing outdoor seating on my last visit.  It's Lettuce Entertain You, so like Vong Thai, it's going to have a certain relative high-quality dining experience.. . People might not think we have much authentic Chinese food in the USA, and they're probably right.  My sister who visited said she prefers the flavor of American Chinese food in any case.  I wouldn't know, but pizza is American, so what the hell, right?. . If it tastes good, it is good, don't ya think?. . I had the scallops, they were excellent.  I had the BBQ pork, it was really excellent.  I had a drink or two, the bar keep poured very professionally.  I'm a fan and lucky to have such good Chinese food nearby.  Three stars, easy, maybe deserves four sometime.
