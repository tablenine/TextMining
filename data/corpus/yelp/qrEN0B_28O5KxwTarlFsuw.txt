Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I went here after my sister, my coworkers, and Mexican friends raved about it.  Brought my cousin from out of town, and I raved about the reviews I heard.  First off, this business is not efficiently run as we can tell by the long wait lines.  We ordered an enchilada and two hard shell tacos (no soft shell tacos here according to the lady who snapped at me at the counter).  So when it came out, we were really excited to see what it's all about.  My first bite was not impressive at all.  The hard-shell taco does not look like it came from out of a box, probably made by the workers, but it didn't live up to my standards.  The hard shell was more stale than having a fresh crunch.  It was also too thick and hard.  The beef inside is nicely flavored, but nothing that blows my mind away.  The sauce is good though.  As for the enchilada, we threw away the other half we didn't finish.  So overall, customer service needs major improvement, ambience - nihil, food - I've had better.  Would I come again?  Probably not.
