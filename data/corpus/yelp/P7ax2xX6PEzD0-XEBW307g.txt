Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
My boyfriend and I used to laugh at all the trendy hipsters packed into this place when we drove buy; then a hipper than thou friend invited us here for an afternoon drink (plus one star right there), and we were forced to reconcile this mind with the fact that we were actually going. . . My brain hurt for a while afterward.. . So, what can I say? It's a café &amp; bakery. They sell alcohol at four in the afternoon. There are hipsters. Some are tools, some are not. Such is life. . . Prices were pretty good, but can get expensive; my friend ordered an $18 glass of a beer brewed by monks--cool, but slightly excessive. . . Three stars, plus one because Alcove will sell me booze in the middle of the afternoon.
