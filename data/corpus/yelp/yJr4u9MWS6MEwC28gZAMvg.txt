Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you are going here for a hot dog, you should know that you are going for the experience/tourist attraction.  It's one of those things that you just have to do when you are in LA.... . It's fun to do this once, but not a place I would repeat visit.  There is ALWAYS at least an hour wait because this place is "famous".  They have specialty hot dogs, which basically means they have funny names and unusual toppings.  Example: I had the "Lord of the Rings" dog, it had onion rings and bbq sauce on it.. . These hot dogs are good, but not any better than what you could get at any other sausage hut without the wait.. . Again, good for the first time experience (go with a big group, it makes it more fun), but not a place at which you want to be a regular.
