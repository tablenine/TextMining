Went here for lunch today. I was with a party of three. We ordered a combination meal, it came out to $80 and was MORE than enough food for 3 people. I thought the food was really good. The parking kinda sucks, but the restaurant inside is very nice, well kept and clean. I was a little disappointed that none of the staff spoke any English. I understand that's not to be expected in k -own but it really would have helped.
