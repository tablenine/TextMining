This is the best place to attend for HAPPY HOUR!!!. . I never liked happy hours or cared for them until I ran into Yardhouse in Pasadena. It's a haven for those who like beers, because they have the largest selection of beers on tap from around the world. . . Happy hour you get appetizers and pints of beer all half off from 3-5pm weekdays. . . This place is awesome to hang in the afternoon with friends! Especially if you don't have work or school or anything to do...it hits the SWEET SPOT!
