Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
kobe beef? mmm...yes, please! wolfgang puck did it again..Cut is absolutely amazing. the kobe beef is worth every cent and trust me, it's a lot of cents.. . with the interior architecture completed by Meler who designed the getty center, i enjoyed the simplistic, yet classy interior of the restaurant.. . started off with the filet mignon "carpaccio", celery hearts, and black truffles salad and then the rest of the night went uphill from there. pricey, but well worth it!
