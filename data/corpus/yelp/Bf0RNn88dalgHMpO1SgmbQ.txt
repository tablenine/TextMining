Oh. So that's the name of the joint. . . I just walked from down the street at La Dolce Vita because we were drunk and got kicked out. No. Just kidding. But we were a bit loud for that intimate setting and looked for a little more boisterous place. I didn't bother reading the sign, but in any condition you could tell this was a sweet joint.. . There was a trio of jazzists up against the wall in the front room playing a reasonable set of contemporary measures. Not quite all the way to The Wave, but more like Sting when he redoes a standard. I seem to recall they did a James Taylor and an Isley Brothers. Right on. . . I myself had something that I ordinarily wouldn't, a Grey Goose and Red Bull, but there's an air about this joint that allows old school brothers such as myself to indulge in a little trendyness. So I did. Service was prompt. . . So me and my gang went out onto the porch where there were several tables, only a few of which were occupied in the December chill, and began to smoke and drink. We were reminded that this is a no-smoking state and millenium but that outside the wrought iron gate of Crustacean, nobody will arrest us - at least not right away. Bah. . . The crowd was not overly Beverly Hills, which is to say, a reasonably well-dressed everyman will fit in just fine. I'll go back and eat next time.
