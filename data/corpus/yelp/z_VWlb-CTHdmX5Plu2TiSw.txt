you MUST must get the bone-in filet. it is a must.. . the petite bone in filet. medium or medium rare melts in your mouth.. the mastro's mashed potatoes are good if you like mashed potatoes+ bake potato stuffing.. the wasabi mashed potato is usually good.. . the seafood platter is overrated. the presentation is good, but i'm grading the taste. the king crab legs were way too salty.  the shrimp cocktails are huge but over cooked. and the oysters aren't the freshest.  and the lobster tail was Ok. . .. . the fries are OK. not as good as mcDonalds.. haha.. the sauteed mushrooms are delish.. . everyone seemed to enjoy the mac n cheese but me. i'm not into really cheesy. . . Their spicy tuna tartare is good. very chilled though. . The sauteed asparagus was OK. it was supposedly sauteed with olive oil and garlic but couldn't taste the garlic. . . Their chocolate sin cake was rich and very dark.  but the whipped creme... YUM! . . oh yeah, and i saw larry king with his young wife?. . BEST FILET ever. so far...
