oh where to begin.... . most seems to be covered but just to add my tid bit. . The food lives up to the H2S name and was tasty and clean cut. We decided to sit outside and there were no candles normal or citron . to ward off the plentiful gnats . The server had about 4-5 tables but was really realllly really slow. Even more annoying then reading really 3 times. Any ways. I was planning on staying for drinks but with the service. I was either going to enjoy my food or wait another 15-20mins. to get a drink order in.. People were dressed fine so I have no idea what those prior reviews reflected there. Next time I want sushi I will go to Prime or Nikemotos . hell even twist. I almost wish I sat at the bar, but overall its a nice spot. I just didnt get the delay in service maybe thats where the pretentious vibe people sensed came from. 3 for food being tasty
