One of Lakeview and Wrigleyvilles best kept secrets! Thank God for places like PMU Cafe. Wrigleyville is laden with Corporate Bars and Restaurants and this is the last great family run place. The owner, Lavinia cares about her food, her service. She keeps its tasty, with big portions and works hard everyday to make sure you enjoy yourself and your meal. The best Huevos Rancheros in town! Get it with a side of Black beans.The staff is very good, intelligent and reminds me of one of those great college cafes we hung out at when we were in school. They play really good music too! Mostly hand picked by the wait staff. I got turned onto "French Lounge Music" there one morning...pretty cool stuff. Highly recommended. Enjoy.
