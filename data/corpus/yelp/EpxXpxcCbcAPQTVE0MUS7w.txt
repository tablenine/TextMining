3.5 stars. . As much as I love Ciudad it's somewhat overrated. I have indulge here quite a few times since 2000 and it can be a hit or miss experience!! For some reason, things rarely go smoothly at Ciudad. There can be a wait for a table, then the drinks can come slowly, then a dish may be served lukewarm. When all is right, the food can be quite imaginative, though, and the patio and music can be delightful. I have had lovely meals here as well as frustrating ones.. . Amid colorful pastel walls and abstract designs, exuberant crowds gather to revel in a menu that brings together cuisines from the world's great Latin urban centers: Havana, Rio de Janeiro, Barcelona, and so on. Standout dishes include the tortilla soup, Argentine empanadas, Swiss chard with tomatillo sauce, citrus-roasted Cuban-style chicken (served with Puerto Rican rice and fried plantains), and a Brazilian moqueca-- shrimp, mussels, and other seafood in a coconut-lime broth over coconut rice.. . Daytime is for office workers; at night, you will find aging hipsters. . Between 4 and 9pm on Sundays, Ciudad presents happy hour tapas served at the bar; it's easy to make a meal of several, choosing from carnitas tacos, goat cheese fritters with sherry-soaked cherries, lamb meatballs with chimichurri, and more. Desserts are worth saving room for and are large enough to share.. . Tip: Tuesday through Saturday Ciudad provides free shuttle service to the Music Center, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and select STAPLES Center events.
