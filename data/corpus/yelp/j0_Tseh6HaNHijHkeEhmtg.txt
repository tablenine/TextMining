good lox.  delightful poppyseed cake.  my dad loves the matzo ball soup.  canter's is right around the corner from my dad's old office and it brings back a lot of comforting memories of sitting in the booth with my father and watching him sip a cup of coffee and eat matzo ball soup.  i wish we had a really good deli in san francisco.
