Its been awhile since I've heard my heart beat. I fell in love the minute I entered the sliding doors of Portos and everytime I do I feel my heart beat faster and faster. I mean hell, even the walk to the cash register was like crossing a perilous mine field. A little overwhelming i might add... Love. love. love..love. love. Heavenly chorus sings and i was comfortably numb for a good 15 minutes...and in addition to the magic, the price is the most reasonalbe price i've ever seen. I yelled to myself "there is so much cheap stuff here, it's unbelievable!" Buying my first lunch was better than having that sunday afternoon delight or the exhilirating cliff diving experiencing. Having my first bite of turkey croissant and cheese roll was like rediscovering a deserted island and realizing its just you and Johnny Depp. And when I snap myself back to reality, Â I look around and notice how happy the staff are here which means the company must pay them well with good hourly and wage benefits...and little to my attention I start to doze off in silence with my eyes wide open. I then start to pray about how much it is a blessing to have portos near work.
