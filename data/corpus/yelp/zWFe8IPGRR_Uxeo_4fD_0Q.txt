Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
I consider Mermaid Inn is the go-to place for fresh fish, oysters, and of course the lobster sandwich.. . Chunks of lobster in light mayo, overflowing on a grilled bun (smothered in butter I think) + old bay fries - in my humble opinion Mermaid Inn bests both Pearl's Oyster Bar and Ed's Lobster Bar.. . Given the lobster roll is a lobster sandwich here - the larger bun means more room for lobster!. . If you aren't big on lobster - go for the sauteed skate or the pan roasted mahi-mahi. Both are quite light and flaky - and most all Mermaid Inn succeeds in eliminating the dreaded "fishy" taste.. . If you are an oyster fan - Mermaid Inn offers both East and West Coast oysters.. . Finally, interestingly Mermaid Inn does not have a dessert menu.. . Before you have an outburst of rage at the idea of no dessert...the restaurant surprises you with complimentary homemade chocolate mousse. Delicious and perfectly sized in tiny espresso cups.. . For fun - Mermaid Inn leaves you and your partner each with a little red Fortune Teller Miracle fish that curls at the ends depending on your mood. A great conversation starter for a first date :). . I know I'm probably not describing it well - you'll just have to go see it for yourself!
