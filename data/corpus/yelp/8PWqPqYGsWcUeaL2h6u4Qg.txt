Can't understand the complaints from people who thought this place was way too expensive. This is Beverly Hills and it should have been expected. If you're looking for a bargain, then go to McDonalds or Burger King. Crustacean's is a place to be pampered and forget about diets. Their cracked Dungeness crab and garlic noodles are the best. That's their specialty. Drinks are expensive but damn good. Stay home if you're counting calories and pennies. You're there to splurge at least for one night.
