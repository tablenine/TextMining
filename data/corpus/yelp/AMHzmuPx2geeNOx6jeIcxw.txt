Good authentic cuban food. I've been there a few times and love the garlic chicken. Most dishes come with rice, beans and plantains. . Not nice enough to take a date, but good for lunch, or a casual night out. They have pretty good portions and the garlic bread they bring in the beginning is good. Very reasonably priced.
