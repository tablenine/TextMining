Geez, watch your step as you leave. I missed the step, and I could've sworn that my uterus popped out. . . . Thankfully, it hadn't.. . Okay, on with the review.. . Someone please tell me why the caprese salad cost $9 for 5 slices of tomato and 4 slices of mozzarella. It was yummy, but the portion was way too small for the price. . . The butternut squash soup was good, but not bowl-lickin' good. . . The pizza was just okay (had the carbonara). Toppings were good. The crust was thin and hard. Pizza looked nothing like the pictures here. New chefs?. . The sausage calzone was bigger than the pizza, yet cheaper and better tasting. Get that instead. . . Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, really. Pizza wasn't worth it . . . average taste with astronomical price. And I almost lost a uterus. That should count for something.
