I went to this place for brunch because everyone kept telling us it was SO great. Even though there were only like two other tables in there, the service was not very good and the coffee wasn't refilled nearly as much as I'd like. The real horror was the food. I ordered a smoked salmon, egg thing. The salmon was not smoked, it was cooked. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to eat cooked salmon on a Sunday morning. It really grossed me out.
