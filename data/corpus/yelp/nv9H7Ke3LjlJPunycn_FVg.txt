I have now eaten at the famous truck something like 6 times... (thank you Kogi for coming to Silverlake!) I make a point of trying as many specials as possible and everything has been delicious. . . Kogi is getting more publicity as I write this updated review. They have been on the news, and heck, Jonathan Gold was there this week (if you follow Â KogiBBQ on Twitter you will know these things). The lines are getting longer and longer but I am still happy to stand and wait 45 minutes- 1 hour for those tacos. My BF calls me a Kogi-stalker and he thinks that I will burnout soon. Well, maybe I will, but in the meantime I am not going to miss out on a good thing... I need to eat as many Kogi tacos as possible before the they go totally mainstream.
