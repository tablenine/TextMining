They didn't let me special order my burger.  What if I don't want the caramelized onions?  What if I'm allergic to them?  What if I'm paying 12.50 for a damn burger and you're telling me I can't get it without onions?. . Madness.. . Okay, so, I pay 12.50 for the burger and opt to pay the extra 2.00 for the slim fries.  Sweet.  . . Me: "Can I get some ketchup for these fries?". . Snooty looking waiter, who is a boy, so he shouldn't look that snooty: "We don't have ketchup here.". . Go to hell, Father's Office.  Go to hell.
