Met up with an old friend of mine at Hide. I had been meaning to check it out for some time but never got around to it. My friend coincidentally suggested it and I knew immediately it was going to be good. We came at dinner time which he said normally requires waiting in line...we lucked out and got immediate service due to the Laker game.. . What I loved aside from the great quality, and reasonable prices, is that the menu is no frills here. The most complex thing we ordered was the Toro (fatty tuna) Scallion Roll which contained exactly that. No cream cheese or "volcano sauce"...just perfect, minimal ingredients enhancing the quality of both the rice and the fish. We stuck to various Nigiri which was great.. . Don't get me wrong, sometimes mayo and cream cheese can be good in lower priced sushi places. At Hide, take advantage of the quality...the menu is designed to highlight this. Â . . I'd like to go a few more times before committing to a 5 star rating...but so far, this is the best mid/affordable price ranged sushi place I've been to on the West side.
