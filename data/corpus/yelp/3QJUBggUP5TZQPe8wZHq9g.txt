SO whas 1 more review for this place?....Dessert Heaven. Quality and price in the same location.. . Great for lunch too. For $10 you can get a sandwich, dessert and a drink.. Even thought the lines are huge they go through fast! and seating is never an issue. You just have to look for one. . . I wish they were closer to me so I can go EVERY DAY! seriously its a must try.
