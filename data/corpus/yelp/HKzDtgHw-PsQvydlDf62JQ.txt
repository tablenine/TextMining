Despite my previous post, my roommate dragged my to the taco truck in Jtown. So there we stood, waiting in the cold for 40 minutes, fearful that they would run out of food before we got to order. "Pork sold out!" someone yelled. Damn. . . Ordered the tofu, beef, and kimchi quesadilla. The tofu taco was a waste of carbs. The beef was the best because of the typical kalbi marinade. The kimchi quesadilla was so weird! Cheese and kimchi are such a weird combo; plus, they do not cut up the kimchi so there are huge pieces of kimchi sliding out of your quesadilla with each bite. Eventually, you are just left with a spicy quesadilla. The soda in their soda bins was not cold.. . So I gave in and waited in line once. I would not do that again. Fool me once, shame on you, but fool me twice...
