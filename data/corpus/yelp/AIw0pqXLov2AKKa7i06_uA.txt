Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
I wanted an excuse to dress up for dinner so my boyfriend chose Rathbun's  last night. First off, they have valet and you'll always see at least one attendant ready to take or bring you your car.. . (One of my pet peeves about certain valet services is waiting around for the attendant to take your keys ;). . The atmosphere is dim lighting, close knit seating and pretty cozy for a restaurant of its size. . . We ordered the open faced meatballs and Mediterranean mussels for starters and our taste buds were not disappointed.  The Pecan Crusted Goat Cheese, Butter Lettuce , Ruby Red Grape Fruit  RAW plate was just the right precursor for our amazing short rib dinner.. . Rathbun's short rib plate was the most tender piece of meat that I've had in a long time.  To compliment our entree we ordered the cauliflower mash dish and if you're a fan of butter, then you'll enjoy this side.  Personally, it was a bit too buttery for me but I'm a fan of cauliflower so I figured it was worth a try.  *If you prefer that type of meat and the way its prepared, I highly recommend the short ribs. * . . Our waiter was extremely patient with us as we took our time to order our drinks, appetizers and entree.. . And of course, I'm a big H2O fan so making sure my water glass is always half full is key. The waitstaff did a great job of making sure it was so for all you fellow "camels" out there, you won't be disappointed ;)
