Man.  I came all the way from Canada for this and I'm not gonna say it was bad.  It was tasty.  The texture of the tortilla was good  but the fillings are definitely not as meaty as the pictures.  The short ribs in my humble opinion should taste like kalbi or at least bulgogi but I didn't really find any true Korean flavours in this taco 'cause the salsa which is a little over -powering didn't really taste particularly Korean.  I mean, it's really tasty but kinda not what I was expecting...maybe it was an off night...I mean, they ran out of kimchi which is sort of sacrilegious when it comes to eating Korean food and I couldn't get my quesadilla which sort of sucked ass.. . The line up was as expected, redonculously long but they had a really decent dj blaring out music to distract us from the fact that we were in line for a half hour for something that took us a minute to ingest.  And it was friggin' cold and I was getting whiplash from the wind and it would have made it all worth it had they not run out of kimchi!  C'mon! . . They should offer a choice between their salsa and just chopped up kimchi and maybe a little sprinkle of cojita.  Man!  C'mon!  . . I'd probably go back though 'cause it's still tasty and super cheap and I still wanna try that damn quesadilla.
