Perfect idea, perfect execution.  Good chicken, good bbq, tasty sides and easy counter service.  It's changed a little since inception and added brunch with table service.  I just wish that you could order off the regular menu and didn't have to wait until 3pm to get what you came for in the first place.  Appreciate the good food and the smart people (from wherever they come from) who eat there.  Great choice for cheap good food.
