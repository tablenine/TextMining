Delicious!  This is my favorite thai place in the city.  I love the tom yum noodle soup with pork, the curry fried rice, the seafood salad (yum seafood), Oxtail soup, and sticky rice dessert!. . The last time I went, my tom yum soup was off for some reason, but still alright. . . Anyway, definitely the yummiest!  The only bad thing-  I have a limited tolerance for all the "run of the mill" thai places in chicago now.  I live by noodles in the pot and I can't stand it. yuck!
