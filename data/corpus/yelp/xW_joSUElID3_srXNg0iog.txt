thier name is like thier food...stupid.  First I must say Whats up with the water! I did not know it was imported from Mexico.  I took a drink and almost spit it out on my girlfriend.  Went there for breakfast.  It was about 10am and we were immediatley shown to a table.  That was good but I am not sure if it would always be like that because No one in Hollywood ever wakes up before 1pm on a sunday anyway.  The service was Excellant, the waitres was nice and helpful.  She was a little too cheery for that early in the morning.  She would look at you and smile but the kind of smile like you have something on your face but she was too nice to tell you that you do, smile.  I was constantly wiping my face. Felt like a breakfast sandwhich.  I ordered the Eggwhich, (I am the Cult leader of Bringing the Dagwood back to Denny's). Now when it comes to food there is not many things I do not like.  Not a big fan of Bacon, Pesto Sauce, and I am just recently getting into Mayonaise.  I recieve my food farely quickly and it contained all the above such drama. I ate it anyways! it was not that bad,   I bet if I would have paid attention to the menu I would have ordered something I liked and it would have been good.  My girlfriend orded something wierd and it tasted a little bland to me. she said it was ok.  I was not really impressed with this place.  I would rather go down the street to Cayenne cafe.  That place is awesome.
