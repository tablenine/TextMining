Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
Cho Sun Ok is a classic Korean bbq restaurant.  Although frightening to look at from outside and inside, the food and service is great!  Every time I go there, I always get this lady in her 50's as a waitress and she takes care of me like her own son (perhaps because of my good looks).  I always leave that place with a slight tear because she reminds me of the old lady in the Korean movie The Way Home.  Of course, I leave her a VERY generous tip :). . Other than the lack of ambiance, I would say the food here is the best among other Korean restaurants.  If you want Cha-dol-Gui  or Neng-myun, this is the place to hit it.  . . p.s. Don't mess with the owner dude.  He is a master (or used to be) in Tae Kwon Do! WATAHHH!
