This was an enjoyable dining experience.  The food was good.  I had the seared tuna, which was the perfect state of lukewarm that it should be when it arrived at the table.  The crabcakes were awesome.  . Two things though: . I ate downstairs and I felt like I was in a basement.  I'm not sure how I feel about eating in a basement, but it was dark and kind of stuffy. . They were playing terrible 80s metal (!) when I was there.  They have a relaxing ambiance that I don't think quite matches the sound of 80s metal and I was very distracted by that.  . Otherwise, food was good.
