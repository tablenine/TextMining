went here for Dine LA.  Food is pretty solid. . . This is what I had:. . Foie Gras:  Was not bad.  i usually get ones that are dense, but this one was soft and not too strong in flavor.  the daikon they put under it however, had TONS of flavor.  i like it a lot.. not the best, but i liked it.. . Chilean Sea Bass:  Im not a fish lover to begin with.  so the portion size was just right for me.  and if i were to eat fish, it would have to be this chilean sea bass... texture was dead on perfect for me, a bit firm and LOTS of flavor.  its been a few days and i can still remember the taste.. . Warm apple tart:  i dont like desserts.. i rarely eat the stuff.. but this was mighty good.  extra crispy on the outside, moist on teh inside, delicious all around.  and for me to say that, must really mean it was good.. . my friend had the steak and scallops... which were just ok.  they said the carpaccio was pretty good too.. . lobster bisque looked good, but i didnt taste it... dammit it was the soup that got away...
