Bob is in the middle of my sushi pricing scale.  When I want a step up from sushi buffet and I can't afford my beloved Sushi Wabi, this is the one and only stop for me.  I often start with the cucumber salad or tempura snow crab and then move onto the candy of sushi, the House Crunch.  Mmm eel sauce.  I usually get one other roll and sometimes the king crab nigiri.  I am such a crab beast.  Even though I am stuffed I always have room for the mango mochi ice cream AND the complimentary oranges.  Oh Bob, how I love you.
