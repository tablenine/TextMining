I've never had a bad experience at Yard House. I really enjoy the huge selection of beers and their food is always a hit. The atmosphere is great, and its always popping. . . In my humble opinion, Yard House has the best happy hour PERIOD. Here are my reasons why:. . 1) Not only do they have regular happy hour, they also have reverse happy hour from 9ish- close. This works out well for me when I have late nights at the office and need a cold beer to relieve some stress. . 2) HUGE food selection at 1/2 off. This isn't like swanky places where they only put three items from their starter menu on sale. Yard House pretty much puts the entire appetizer selection, as well as the pizzas, on a great discount. They certainly don't disappoint. . 3) On Monday Night Football days, happy hour runs ALL NIGHT LONG!. . As an added bonus,  (and I don't know why I've even ordered this at a restaurant bar), but I think the CHILEAN SEA BASS at the yard house is better than most high end restaurants! This is my favorite fish, so I know my Chilean sea bass. Seriously, if you have an extra 25 bucks to spend, get the chilean sea bass here!  You won't be disappointed I promise!. . Only downer about this place is it can get crowded and there may be a pretty hefty wait. But they don't really limit the amount of people at the bar, so we usually just kill time with a few beers.
