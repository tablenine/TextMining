Restaurant: Crust

This seems like the place for me, right? I love veggies, i love whole wheat, I love pizza, vegetarian options galore.. . But, the magic just was not there. The pizza is just kind of bland. The Crust is good, but the choice of toppings seems uninspired and most pizzas have no sauce and the few that do it isnt great, so everything just tastes rather dry.. . The salad was good with tasty fresh vegetables, but they smothered it in way too much dressing.. . Brunch was awful, everything was a combination of eggs on a pizza crust.
