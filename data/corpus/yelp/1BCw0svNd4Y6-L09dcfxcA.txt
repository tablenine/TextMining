who would have known that they make the best margaritas here?  all the ingredients are freshly squeezed juices, no syrups.  their spinach/artichoke dip, pine room salad (a chicken salad with garlic ranch dressing which is not on the menu but is available if you request for it), bbq ribs, and fries are my favorites!  it's always busy but worth the wait.
