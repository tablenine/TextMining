Saw this on triple d and bookmarked it to come here. I work close to this place every once in a while.. . Order the reuben special, fries, and a white ale.. . WOW!! The pastrami was off the hook. Awesome - some of the best I've ever had. The meat quality was top notch and the brine it was cured with was really tasty. The whole sandwich was quality and just tasted great - the rye bread, cheese, and the sauerkraut - just shocked - did not expect it to be that good.. . Finally a place that cooks fries right. Super crispy, fresh french fries. Awesome!!. . Aioli sauce was good - really enjoyed the house ketchup - the chipotle ketchup had a sweetness to it - unique and good. The regular ketchup was my favorite.. . If you like pastrami and french fries - gotta come check this place out - worth the drive if you are far away.. . My first triple d recommendation that paid off - really happy.. . The restaurant looks nothing like it does on tv - at least at night. Place looks like and old tasty freeze or burger joint on the outside. Small on the inside with some character - but gives and old homey feeling when you are eating there. They have a couple flat screens. Parking sucks and the place is fairly busy - there was a small line of people ordering food the whole time I was here.. . The beer was good and they have a decent selection of micro brews on tap - just a class set up and darn good food. Still can't believe it.. . Wish it was closer to my house. Great joint. Not cheap - but well worth the price - food did not take long to arrive.. . Will be back!
