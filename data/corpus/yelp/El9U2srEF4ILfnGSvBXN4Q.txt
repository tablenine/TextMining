Great service, ambiance, pasta, and of course the mozzarella.  . . However, I now stay away from their other entrees.  It's like someone played a practical joke and unscrewed the cap to the salt shaker in the kitchen.  If it's their ploy to sell more wine and dessert, then brilliant!  But for me it back-fired since I had to drown my stomach in water to wash out all the saltiness.
