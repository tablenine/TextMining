Soooo....I have wanted to try Bakeshop for some time being a huge European bakery (and Concentrics) fan, but i'm not sure they hit the mark I was expecting them to. I like it enough that it will save me a trip to Theo's Brothers in Roswell, but they didn't have anything that compares to the sourdough and multigrain boules they have at Theo's. It's possible too it was late in the day and they were out so I will report back and up the rating if things change. The coffee I ordered was tasty, but took longer than I would have expected it to, especially considering there was noone else there. Still not a bad addition to the Concentrics group and not a bad location, though don't get me started on the parking!
