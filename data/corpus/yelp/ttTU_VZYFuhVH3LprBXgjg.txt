so... i really wanted to have fried chicken for some reason for the longest time. Actually I would eat chicken 24/7. Yes I do love chicken especially fried ones. My good friend took me to Roscoe's Chicken &amp; Waffle. Anyways as a FOB (fresh off the boat; just for those who are not familiar with the term), it was such an American place. My friend and I were the only Asian there lol. Felt so weird. BUT!! the chicken rocked!!!! what made even perfect was the GRAVY!! YOU HAVE TO GET IT ON THE SIDE not on top of the chicken. Although it was soooooooo good, I give four stars jus cause it didn't seem like they were using clean oil. Nevertheless, I would love to go back to get some more chicken.
