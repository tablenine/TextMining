Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
are u effin kidding me????? wth are these tacos? they are hard overfilled and the meat is dry. they were kinda good t 2:30 am after a few drinks but other than that i think if there were a taco bell near by id much rather go there. it is cash only which isnt too bad if you plan on going there. its is also cheap. the place is an old restaurant so you get what you get. i dont think ill ever go here nor would i recommend it. wheres a taco truck when you need one????
