Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This place has pretty good ramen noodles.  I've been here a few times with my boyfriend.  The wait is not too bad for two people, but if you go in a larger group you can end up waiting for half an hour before getting seated.  . . We usually order the miso 2 and 3.  I like spicy food, but in this case the spicy 3 level is good enough, when I tried changing things up, it became too spicy for me to enjoy my noodles.  I have tried the noodles with cha shu and eggs, but I find that I never really finish the pork, so now I just get the eggs in my noodles.  The portion is pretty generous, so you usually don't have to add extra noodles.  The bowl is huge and it comes with fresh green onions, beansprouts, noodles, and whatever you want to add in the bowl.. . I like the quality of the food and when we're in the area, my bf and I usually come to this place.  Plus its been cold lately, and nothing fills you up better than a hot bowl of spicy ramen.
