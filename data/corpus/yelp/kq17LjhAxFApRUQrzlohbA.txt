going into this place i knew bout the weird sausages but nothing else.. turned out to be a cool little trendy place. there was some weight and confusion. not a lot of places to sit we had to stand around for a bit to eat, so that sucked but the food was great really liked the belgian fries with dipping sauces. good place to go with friends!
