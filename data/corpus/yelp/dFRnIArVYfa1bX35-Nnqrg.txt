Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Drink lots of water.. . I had a special #4 which wasn't that bad on the scale of spicy ramen you could have (numbers from 1-10 determine the spiciness of the ramen with #1 or #2 being the highest - you get a picture on the wall if you're that daring to try), but I have to admit it was quite spicy even at that level. The broth was spicy enough that I could say it overshadowed the taste of everything else in the ramen bowl. . . In a nutshell, Orochon ramen isn't what you are looking for if you want traditional ramen (even if the interior has the looks of a traditional ramen place) but it definitely is a UNIQUE ramen experience to try out.
