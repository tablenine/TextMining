Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
The bread with seasonings that they bring ot the table is pretty good, although it is kind of hard to get refilled. I wish the waiters would be better as far as that goes. My girlfriends and I all tend to have our "regular" dishes, mine: Bauru sandwich (egg, ham, cheese, iceberg lettuce, tomato - I order mine without mayo) or Tiriri's pasta (sundried tomatos, chicken, not-too-creamy white sauce). The fries are really good as is the Sunset pasta (asparagus, mushrooms, chicken). . . Side note: Ive never been to Brazil, but I really doubt this is the kind of food they cook at home on a regular basis (having fried plantains available on the side does not make you a Brazilian restaurant!) Still, I love this place! Hearty portions for good prices, AND they have a fountain inside! How cool is that??
