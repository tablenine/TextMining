breakfast food is my favorite food and this, to me, is as good as it gets.  while the long IS long it's not THAT bad and totally worth it!. . their pancakes are an obvious favorite and the scrambles are really good too.  i've never had an omelet here because the pancake selection is too good to resist.. . also, you must get the french pressed coffee. soooo good!!!
