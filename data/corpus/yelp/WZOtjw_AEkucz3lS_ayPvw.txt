Ok so I am trying so hard to like sushi.........the rolls I can do but the real thing is a bit harder for me to adjust to. In any case, I still enjoy going to sushi restaurants, and so I visited Bob San's. I thought the House Crunch roll was terrific........but the only thing is the mayonnaise.  I hate it when restaurants put mayonnaise in their rolls..it just doesn't make sense to me at all.  The atmosphere here is great, but it is just a little over priced I think.
