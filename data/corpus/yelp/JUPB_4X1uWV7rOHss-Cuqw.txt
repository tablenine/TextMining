macaron ice cream sandwiches.  all i need or care about when i go here.  even at $4.50 a piece.. . i've tried three.  coffee toffee is fantastic, cookies and cream has a wonderfully understated sweetness (which is to say it isn't cloying), and i could do without the ladybug.. . the sweets concocted here are definitely the kind of things you wished you could've had as a kid, not to be confused with what you wanted as a kid.  . . my experience with the baked goods is that they're on the dry side but flavor/sweet tooth satiation are in not lacking.
