You can't go wrong with this place. Everything is amazing. I like to get my meat extra marbled. It melts in your mouth. I would suggest going for lunch because it's a much better deal. Under $10 for a medium during lunch time. Only problem is this place is always packed. Do what I do and get here an hour before it opens and just write your name on the clipboard and walk around. I've been coming here for over 10 years. One time we came we sat across from William Hung. Good times. If you want to see how this place stacked up with other Shabu Shabu places check our my post at: . http://ate-ate-ate.blo....
