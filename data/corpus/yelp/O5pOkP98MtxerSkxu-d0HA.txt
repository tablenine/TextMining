Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
They always have excellent service and food. While you're waiting, they have some of the best meatballs in the waiting area for you to sample. The prime rib speaks for itself, which comes with your choice of two sides, yorkshire pudding, and their famous spinning salad. In my opinion, the mashed potatoes and creamed corn are the best sides, perfect balance with the meat. All the host/hostesses and waiters are very polite and nice.
