The whole idea of this place really sits well with me. In theory, I love it. In reality, it's just OK. I don't know, their sausage should be more stand out incredible. I've had a duck and bacon one and I think a jalapeno and...im not sure what kind of meat. It just wasn't as memorable as it should have been.  Actually, I find those dogs wrappen in bacon with peppers and onions that you get on the street way more exciting. Shucks, huh? well, it seems like many others are having the experience I've expected, so maybe you will too. Good beer selection, though.
