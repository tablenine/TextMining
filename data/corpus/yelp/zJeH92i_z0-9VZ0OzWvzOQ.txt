I have been holding off on reviewing this place for a couple days and I am not really sure why but here goes nothing. My food was amazing and I cannot give it enough praise. I had the signature dish which is the Tortelli di Mele but the serving was pretty small for the price I felt. I mean whoever thought to put granny smith apples and sausage in ravioli deserves three stars at minimum. We sat down at like 8pm and ate outside and they never bothered to turn on the lights as the sun went down....I could barely see my hand in front of my face by the time we were down at 9pm. I don't really like the venue which I think docked it a point along with a slow wait staff (that was entertaining however) just couldn't bring me to put them in the 4 or 5 club.
