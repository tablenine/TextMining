Wow I could've sworn that I wrote a review for this place a long time ago. I frequent this place a lot and I love it. The foods always good, its moderately priced and the service rocks. One of the best Thai places around in my opinion.. . We usually order the same 3-4 dishes and we do it family style so everyone gets to try everything. If you come here on a Friday or Saturday Â night, there's even a singing Elvis. I don't understand a word he's saying but he's still cool in my book.
