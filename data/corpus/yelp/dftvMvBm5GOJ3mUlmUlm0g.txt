Hmm... now I must say I am torn. I'd say this place is a VERY close, if not tied, with Shin Sen Gumi for my fave ramen house. I don't know what they put in the ramen broth here but beware because it is DANGEROUSLY addicting. I think that's what I love about this place.. the fact that they get it right without you having to customize anything (like at Shin Sen Gumi). Â . . Noodles are perfect, broth is perfect.. Daikokuya, you are perfect.
