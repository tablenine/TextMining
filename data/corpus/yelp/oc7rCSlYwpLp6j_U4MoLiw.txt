Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Maybe my expectations was to high, maybe my dreams of waffle, syrup and chicken was a fantasy but my first Roscoe experience was a disappointment. . . I was excited to get my Roscoe cherry popped since so many of my friends love this place.  . . Parking was difficult since they had no parking lot and only street parking was available.  . . There was a crowd of people in the front waiting for tables so a good sign no doubt.. . My wife and I were seated right away since there was only two of us which was a plus.  . . I ordered the two waffles and dark meat combo with a side of cornbread while the wife ordered the white meat combo.  The waffles were big but flat and limpy...I prefer my waffles crispy.  The cornbread was dry and I only took two bites of it since it needed so much butter and syrup to make it moist.  . . The chicken is what I really like and even though I am not a fan of white meat the breast was done perfectly and juicy and not dry at all.  . . Overall I was a little disappointed but maybe that's because I over hyped it.  But it wasn't bad just not the enlightened experience I was hoping for.
