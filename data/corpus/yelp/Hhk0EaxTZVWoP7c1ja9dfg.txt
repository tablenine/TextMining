Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Yes, I am surely a fan.  Gloria's has a dingy interior that is filled with the smell of food...and a strong dose of love.  I have been here a number of times, and each time after the first the main man has remembered me and my companions.  The food is satisfying and well flavored, and there is a wide variety of options for all taste buds.  OF COURSE try the pupusas, little yummy dough balls filled with goodness.  Gloria herself even came out to take our order last time, and was as accommodating and sweet as could be.  The prices are right, the food is good, and the people are friendly and welcoming.  Why are you still reading this!?
