imagine the last time you went on vacation.  close your eyes.  think.. . before you left to the airport, you had to have that VERY LAST BITE OF SOMETHING.  what was it?  . . after you finished it, you threw the white napkin down like a touchdown football.  rubbed your belly.  and said..."that hit the effin spot".  Then you happily took a cab to the airport and start wondering when the next time you'll have that bite.  Like the cheesecake of new york.  Or perhaps the sushi in Vancouver.  Or even that poor puppy in Vietnam.  . . whatever that might be, for LA, Daikokuya can possibly be truly one of those gems.  Why?  Well, literally, I saw two guys with their suit cases eating on the stand.  And judging by their fobblicious haircuts, they looked like ramen fanatics!. . Well besides tourist having that last bite before the airport, why does the F. Slut like it?  They took my world of ramen (world's #1 broke-man food) and SMASHED it.  . . Waah?  The ramen was moist, flavorful, and tasted....err...orgasmically wonderful.  And the sides?  Everything was a HIT!!!!!!!. . Go ahead. Is the  long wait worth it?  Yes.  . . Go ahead.  Is the combo too much food?  yes.  But order it!. . Go ahead.  Is it really a destination eat?  yes.. . Go ahead.  Say thank you food slut.
