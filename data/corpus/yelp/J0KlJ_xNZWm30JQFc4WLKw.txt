After walking by this place while they were working on it I was so excited to try it when they opened. I was able to go in the weekend that they were doing test runs and try stuff before it actually opened. I was a huge fan from the moment I got my sweet potato fries. I'm a huge fan of them and these turned out to be wonderful. I tried a regular burger the first time I went and was told that it is cooked medium, but is more a medium rare and asked if that was ok. I figured I'd give it a shot, and my burger was delicious. I walked out stuffed. The next time I went back I got a turkey burger and it was awesome! The veggie burger is wonderful as well and I'm definitely a meat loving kind of girl. . . The only negative comments that I would have to make about the place would be in relation to the staff. I had a wonderful server one night but the other few times they've been a little off, or odd to say the least. That however will not keep me away!
