Great food...great prices...because I did the $34/person at the bar special. I realize that the normal prices are very very pricey, but Sunday through Thurs if you sit at the bar, you get:. 1. Any appetizer from the mozz menu, and there are a ton and they are amazing. 2. Any pasta from the primi menu (see comment above). 3. Any dessert from the dessert menu (again look up). 4. A glass of wine. . This is by far one of the best deals around. I've done the McCormick happy hour and everything else, but for the quality and the money, this can't be beat. Normally at least $60 for all this, its only $34. I highly highly recommend it.
