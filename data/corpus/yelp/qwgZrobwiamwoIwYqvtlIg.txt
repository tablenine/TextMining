I took my roomate here for her birthday. I made a reservation for a Tuesday night at 8:30 but wasn't seated until a quarter til. This was made up for by the host when he came back to our table with two glasses of bubbly.  Our server, wow, very enthusiastic but you wonder if he's really paying attention to you. Think of the radio DJ in Wayne's World 2. Mmmmhmphh. And everything was "very nice" according to him. The mushroom salad was probably the best tasting thing I had that night. My roasted chicken was more like pan fried chicken, I didn't expect to have to use my knife to eat this. The peach cobbler was aight, I wish they used full fat ice cream instead and the olive tapenade w/ french bread was OK. My roomate liked her entrée so I guess that's all that mattered.
