My friend Dave said that Leons was a great place to eat.  Well, I decided to try it with him on Sunday Evening.  We started with the Lug Nuts.  This appetizer is peppery pecans, peanuts and cashews.  I thought I would enjoy this one but unfortunately, I just did not.  I am a very picky eater but I thought I could not go wrong with nuts as an appetizer.  Texas Beef Eater that I am, I thought I would give the Burger a try.  It was a good size burger but it seemed to be missing some seasonings to give it that extra taste.  The addition of ketchup and mustard on the bun gave me that McDonalds feel.  Now do not get me wrong, I did enjoy something at this dinner.  The pub frites were wonderful.  I love the garlic aioli dipping sauce.  I love that there are lots of different sauces to try but I do not think I will be going back any time soon.  This is a trendy place with a great staff.  I just think the food could be better.  That's just me.
