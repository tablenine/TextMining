hesitant to write this review, because i was here once, and probably won't be back for awhile unless i'm in the area or making a conscious effort to. i didn't buy my drink, so i don't know about the prices. the gin and tonic was...odd. but it got me in good spirits, so there's that. don't remember a thing about anybody who worked here, the crowd, or even the sitting situation. i was more into the jazz band playing; they were great. it's fantastic that part of the bar is open to the outside, and there is seating outside that looks in toward the band area. the bathrooms were nice.
