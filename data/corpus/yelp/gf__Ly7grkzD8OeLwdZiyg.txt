My general opinion is this: best for brunch; okay for dinner. If you would like more details, read on. . . I really like the brunch here. They have good entrees AND really good drinks. If you love bloody marys that are nice and dirty spicy and aren't too thick/saucy then you will love Parish's take on this classic morning concoction. They also have a blood orange screwdriver that I really enjoy. Good stuff. I also love that they have gumbo available during brunch. My husband, the Cajun was pretty impressed with their recipe. . . As for dinner, I have to give them credit and say I haven't ever had a bad food experience here. I think, for me, it's more the logistics that always seem to bother me. It's pretty dark for dinner, but the dinner menus are on the wall. I have bad eyes and I always get annoyed having to ask my husband what's on the menu or crane my neck trying to see around some tall guy's head in my way of the bottom of the menu. I also haven't had the greatest luck with service at dinner. I was here once with a group of women (about 8) and I could tell the server was getting annoyed with us because we were taking too long to sit down and order. . . Overall, I will probably go back again, but just for brunch.
