Great local sandwich shop!. I'm lucky I live right around the corner.. . You order, you pay, and they bring your food out to you.. Water is self-service, which means you don't have to ask anyone for refills while you're trying to nurse the hangover.. . Most sandwiches are $4.95 and come with chips!  Anything with pesto and provolone is delish!  Tuna salad is also very good.. Definitely worth the 10 minute wait for their sandwiches.. . The seating area is very tight - I actually like Panes better in the summertime because of their outdoor seating on Sheffield.. . It is annoying they don't take credit cards, but if that means $4.95 sandwiches, I'll take it!!!
