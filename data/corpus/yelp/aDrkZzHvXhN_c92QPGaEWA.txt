Lobster roll: I gotta say, the lobster was a little rubbery.  I don't think the roll is the type served in New England.  At $20+ it was overpriced.. . Chorizo with cockles:  plenty of cockles, little bits of chorizo, brothy,  delicious.  At about $24, again, overpriced.. . Cocktails:  excellent! some of the best fresh juices/handcrafted/creative cocktails in L.A.. . The ingredients are beautiful, the food is great.  The atmosphere is casual, relaxed.  But  I am just so tired of overpriced food.
