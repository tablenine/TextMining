Category: Diners
Any place with "Mac Daddy and Cheese Balls" on the menu deserves 4 stars just for that. This is a great place to go in the middle of the night after partying. If I went here while sober, I might give it three stars. Most of the diner-fare meets Cali-fusion entrees are good to decent, but everything tastes better when you are tipsy.. . I happen to think boys look hot in eyeliner. If hipsters bother you, this is not the place for you.. . You might see one of the Fred's driving around the neighborhood in his over-the-top classic Cadillac and cowboy hat.
