maybe its just me... but i really dont have anything great to say about this place other than their food rocks and the pitchers are moderately cheap. the few times ive been here i went with chicks that i thought were hotter than everyone else here (at the time, now i really dont like them at all). so the guys here are nice... not amazingly attractive. gets real busy so the waitress is always hard to find. why the hell did i even go to this place again...? i dont really like drinking pitchers of beer, i suck at pool, and i cant stand having a conversation with semi-interesting people. im not snobby... i guess this just isnt my thing. i like dancing and loud non-rock music, both of which dont apply to this place.
