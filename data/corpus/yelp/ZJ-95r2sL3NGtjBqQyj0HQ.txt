What's not to love about the roasted crab, garlic noodles, and a bottle of chardonnay?  I can't speak to anything else on the menu.  I go there only for the crab and noodles.  I've eaten at the original Thanh Long in San Francisco and the other Crustacean there, too.  Of the three, this is my least favorite because the staff lacks the warmth of the other two restaurants.  Still, it the food is well prepared and delicious.  I've been there twice, never waited for my reservation more than 5 minutes.  I sat upstairs once and much preferred it to downstairs, where it was busy.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that for the price you pay, I want a warmer, more welcoming atmosphere.
