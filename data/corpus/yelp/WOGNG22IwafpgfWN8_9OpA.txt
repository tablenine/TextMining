Check out that garlic god in the women's restroom...... I didn't dare to sit on it, I rather rely on at-home test kit =P. . I am not a big garlic lover, but since my friends love garlic, we gave this place a try. Their entrees are all pretty good, we had the bunny, lamb, and beef rib(?) All have nice flavor, and the rabbit meat is not tough. All of the meats have nice but different flavor (assuming they didn't cook everything in the same pot)`` I love those creamed green veggie!. . The decoration is nice and different, somewhat unexpected for the first-timer. I think I'll check out the one in SF sometime when I go back home.. . warning:: if any one in your group loves raw garlic, keep them away from that bottle of sauce they put on the table (some garlic and parsley blend i assume - i did not dare to even touch it). my friend ate more than 1/2 of the bottle, and i can smell her breath even the next morning.......
