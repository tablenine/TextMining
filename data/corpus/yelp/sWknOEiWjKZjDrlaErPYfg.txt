Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
Hello, all! . . Crust - a place with no service structure/organization. It amuses me to see waiters argue over who will serve me, i didn't  know i was that important.. . The "hot"  Food tastes very bland and is often over-cooked or slightly under-cooked. It is very inconsistent. The "cold" food is a little better seeing as it doesn't have to be cooked. . . The drinks, which are painstakingly measured, (no, the owner doesn't care about your health, he cares about his profits) are weak and exceedingly expensive. I had to buy three of their "Wat margs" to get a buzz. Trust me, i have a low tolerance. . . In conclusion, this (PIZZA ) place is just riding the "green wave" and bases its restaurant quality and image on it. They have no innovative ideas. And it seems like their first priority is profit based. . . There are way better organic places to eat than crust!
