Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
The red snapper is the best thing on the menu here (I recommend the chipotle sauce). My friend ordered the king crab legs, which were good but nothing to rave about. The ceviche appetizer and grilled octopus with diabla sauce were also delicious. I came here over a year ago, and the food and service was top notch. . . The quality of the food and service at El Barco have diminished while prices have shot up since then. The homemade earthy red salsa has been replaced by a green, creamy salsa that packs some heat but is otherwise boring. The black salsa has become oilier and less tasty. The shrimp soup is no longer served in a cast iron pan and is not as rich as before. The lunch menu is smaller and cheaper, however, the grill items are not served on hot plates like at dinner. The steamd fish and scallops dishes are no longer on the menu. . . El Barco is still unique and delicious but clearly not the amazing restaurant it once was.
