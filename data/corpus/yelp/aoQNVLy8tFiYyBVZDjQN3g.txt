did i just give a chain restaurant 5 stars? oh yes i did.. . why? simple: Garlic Fries.. . it's not on the menu, but it's there.. like a delicious magical mystery dish.. . if you love potatoes, just order it. you will understand.. . i also dig the fact that you can sample beers for $2.. . OH and though it's not authentic, i love their korean bbq.. perfect portion if you want dessert afterwards.
