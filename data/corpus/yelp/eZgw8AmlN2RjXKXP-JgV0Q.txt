This place has potential, but there are quite a few bugs still to be worked out.  Our drink delivery took a while, and then was delivered twice.  Subsequent drink orders were also delivered twice.  We had to ask for place settings well after our food was delivered, which was annoying.  We ordered the Hippie Hummus, Mac and Cheese Muffins, both of which were pretty tasty, and Bench Warmers (lamp lollipops which I did not try but was told they were quite good). The Cosmpolitan Ice Cream Sundae was HUGE and very good.  . . The outdoor seating area was crowded and the staff appeared to have a difficult time navigating the tables. . . Right now I give them a 2 overall, but I'll try them again after they've had some time to get it all together.  It's a very clean, trendy place in a great location, and I really want to like it.
