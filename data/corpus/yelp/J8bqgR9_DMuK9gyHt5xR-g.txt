I had an early reservation, 6:30 and was seated immediately. I started with a Mista salad which was good. I wish I had another option of a noncarbonated drink other than sweet/unsweet tea. The marinara and bread was a hit at the table, I believe that could have been a meal itself. I had the ravioli and was disappointed. There wasn't a lot of flavor in the sauce and the ravioli was a bit watery tasting. That would've been a great dish with some additional herbs added.
