Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Shady location. Atmosphere akin to an underground brothel. Overpriced, relatively basic menu.. . Cosmetic shortcomings aside, I still love Roscoe's. The food is pure greasy, heart-attack-inducing heaven. You can't live in LA without having tried Roscoe's chicken and waffles at least once; you just can't. It might seem like an odd combination, but just give it a chance. I don't know what Roscoe's puts in their waffles, but sinfully good when doused with melted butter and syrup. My friend said they put cinnamon in the waffles, which might explain why they're so tasty. Best thing is they're not crispy at all -- I hate when a waffle is so much crisp that you can't taste the batter. The fried chicken is great, too, although for $8.50 it'd be nice if you got more than three wings.. . Service was surprisingly good for a place that looks so sketchy on the outside. They have a lot, too, which pretty much cements the fact that Roscoe's is the best place ever.
