1.  Poor beer selection.  What? ONLY domestic and Heineken?  I knew this would NOT be good.. . 2.  The "Sea Bass" was tough as shark.  . . 3.  The stuff all around and on top of my "Sea Bass" was crappy, tasteless and smelled awful.. . 4.  The entire entree was standing in a good 1/4" of olive oil.  . . 5.  The service was difficult to track down.  As nice and pleasant as our server was, it was forever before we even saw her once we sat down.. . 6.  My date's "filet mignon" tasted more like and had the consistency of an inferior cut of meat.  They butterflied it without asking.. . Good news:  parking was free.
