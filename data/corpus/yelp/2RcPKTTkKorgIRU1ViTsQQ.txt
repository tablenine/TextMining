I spent my 25th birthday at Tokyo Delve's.  . . I agree it is really, really insanely loud and in your face.  If you aren't in the "mood" it could definitely feel like you want to hide in the corner and wait for the 2 hour seating period to end.  Yes, they have 3 seatings, one at 6 pm, one at 8:30 pm, and a later one at 10 pm.  You have 2 hours to sit back and completely surrender to the madness.. . A lot of people at my birthday did not know what to expect including myself, but the energy of the servers/bartenders just rubbed off on everyone and before you know it, we were all standing on our chair doing Saki Bombs.  . . I even got pulled up to the front to a special serenade from the bartender singing "Bye, bye, bye" to me.. . It was a great way to kick off the night and I was completely warmed up and ready by 8 pm to continue the celebration.. . Just to give you an idea of price range, because what would a review be without that, our party of 15 cost about $35 a person with lots of food, 3 table kegs and Saki.
