Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm a native--so no hype here.  Just the harsh truth.. . Pink's Sucks.. . Costco is ........sadly............ONE MILLION TIMES BETTER.. . If you love standing in a line to be part of "history" then this is your place. . If you love fighting for parking on small city streets--this is your place.  . If you are a big fat hick who saw Pink's on a Travel or Food Channel Special and can't wait to tell yur' pals back home you "thought ya' saw Tom Cruise preachin' from Dianetics in the parkin' lot" then this is REALLY your place.. . You get the point.. . Pink's demystified.  It is a half-assed establishment that thrives off of its fame simply for being famous.  The culinary Paris Hilton--who probably tastes similar to this worthless LA pit.. . Stay in the Midwest and enjoy a nice juicy Costco Dog for $1.50 with a watery Coke...and onions churned out of a silver tub--trust me...you'll thank me later.
