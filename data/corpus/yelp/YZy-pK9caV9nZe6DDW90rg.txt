Category: Japanese
This place serves what I call comfort Japanese food.  Lots of fried dishes, lots of saucy dishes, and lots of rice dishes. Everything was tasty, but unfortunately their service is very, very poor.  . . Half the restaurant was sitting in the dark because they forgot to turn on the "dinner lighting" until 9pm and no one refilled our water after our meal was served... we sat chatting for 45 minutes and no waiter/waitress came by until we called one over.
