I went here about a week ago for my friend's birthday.  We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp with the whole sha-bang seasoning and added corn on the cob and sausages in our bag.  We also ordered a side of the cajun fries and an order of a half dozen oysters for myself.  Everything tasted delicious during dinner, but then I got stomachaches throughout the night and I felt really nauseous in the morning.  I spent the entire next day throwing up and had a fever of 102 degrees.  My friend felt fine, which meant I got food poisoning from the oysters since my friend didn't have any.  Do NOT eat the oysters!  They are not fresh!  You can get fresh oysters down by the beach.  Yes, they may be a bit more expensive, but it's definitely not worth the pain to eat the oysters at Boiling Crab.  Although I enjoyed my dinner, I will definitely not be going back any time soon.
