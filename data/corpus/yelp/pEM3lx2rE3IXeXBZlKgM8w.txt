Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I ordered the portabello mushroom burger, fries, and a soda. When the burger finally arrived I thought someone was playing a practical joke on me...Did someone take the all-mighty umami away from the chef and replace it with a jr. whopper? Nope. The burger was actually that TINY. Even as a female, i thought i needed two...Whats happening to me?
