Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
what do i got to go to eat my pastrami and enjoy it with peace. i felt nauseous after. not a pleasurable pain. a mexican lad offered to hit me hard in the gut to relieve me. sorry, i meant cuban. back again, whatever happened to the good old cpr, man to man or woman to woman you kiss me and i kiss you and we all live again?. . don't misunderstood me. that was some good 11 dollars i spent on. so huge and yet so good. no disappoinment whatsoever throughout the process. what went wrong? could have been that lil cup of oil i dipped my sandwich into.. . yes. i would totally do it again in a heartbeat. and then re-live the whole moment again. i would have totally give this thing a 4, but because 12 hours later and i'm still greased up from that meal, i'm staying with the 3 bling bling.
