I'm not really a fan of the murky broth, but there was something about the ambiance, the small tight knit corner. the chefs, and everything that the restaurant embodied that made this a better experience for me. . . i love that they soft boil their egg, and the broth is super rich and the noodles have a great chew. super impressed. I definitely can see how people who love the rich broth would love this place. I'm more of a shoyu broth kinda gal =). . this is not my kind of ramen, but I did enjoy the experience!
