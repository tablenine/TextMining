*Delivery review only*. . The good:. -- Fast fast fast. They will say, "oh about 45-1 hour, ok?" Sure, no problem. As soon as I get out the cash, I get the call saying the food is here. What? They do take credit cards for delivery, but I usually like paying by cash. . -- Food is pretty good. Because of the fast delivery and location, food is still warm, esp. on cold nights. My favorites so far are: the Tempura Shrimp roll and the cashew chicken. Cashew chicken is okay, but for some reason, I'm addicted to it. Sushi seemed fresh and was really tasty.. -- Can order directly through them or use . http://grubhub.com. . It's $10 minimum order if you order directly or $20 through grubhub. Choose wisely. . . The so-so's:. -- Portions are small, I think? For most places, I feel like I have enough food for a week. Maybe the containers make stuff look smaller? I'm not sure. The sushi rolls seem normal compared to most places - about 6 large pieces (i.e. tempura shrimp roll and another roll I can't remember). . -- For some dishes, like the pepper steak, I notice there are more veggies than the actual meat. While good, I just wish there was more steak! . . It's been awhile since I've been here and I have yet to try their other location. It's one of the places I order from regularly when I'm feeling lazy and/or craving delivery food.
