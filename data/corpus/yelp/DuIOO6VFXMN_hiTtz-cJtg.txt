this is the fast food of chinese steam buns.  My friend and I were stranded after shopping in downtown and were contemplating of eating this stuff or walking over to Big Bowl. well, let's just say we should have walked!. . we ordered their bowls -cashew chicken and chicken terriyaki, that were both around $7 each with tax.  . . Their bowls are filled with 90% white rice and "chicken crumbs" seriously it wasn't even like ground chicken meat, it was like sprinkled crumbs with scallion onions and sauce!. I think they were to afraid to use real chicken meat and opted for mystery "chicken crumbs"  - I do not want to know what parts of the chicken were used!. . the bowl size is very small too, and a bit overpriced for what you get.  They should price it at $4.50 per bowl, or include a small size with it at the ongoing price. . Anyways I did also try their "steam bun"  and it was small and o-k.. If you really like steam buns you are better off taking the red-line train to China town, which is only a few stops away anyways and getting the real deal!. . the buns tasted like an average steam bun you would get an asian grocery store chain, - I really don't see the Rave of this place- only that it's the only asian fast food in the vincinity.. . so just go to Big Bowl or Chinatown.....
