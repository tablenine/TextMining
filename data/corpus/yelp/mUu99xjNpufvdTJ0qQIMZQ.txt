I love the original taco truck. I also love korean bbq. When that truck was parked out front I thought I had died and gone to taco heaven. The beef was tender and perfectly seasoned -- not too salty!! KBBQ taco truck is something I would expect to find in the heart of little Saigon or in the alleys of Ktown, but in we-ho, outside of a club? BRILLIANT!!! Cheap. Delicious. Waaaaay better than crusty pizza after the club!
