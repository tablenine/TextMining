Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Love the dogs. I don't know where you people are getting your dogs, but the ones I buy at the store don't snap like that (  I'm looking at you Hebrew National/Oscar Meyer). I even tried Hoffy and they didn't snap. Turns out Pink's special orders the dogs from Hoffy.  And I love the chili. And I did see a celeb there, it was Alicia Keys. But who cares? I go there to eat.. Having said  that, I wish all you haters would stay away so I can get my dog faster.  Stick with the classic chili dog and just get two with a root beer. Better still have someone order it while you get a table.
