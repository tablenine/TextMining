Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Coalfire Pizza came very highly regarded... and I must say it has lived up to all of the ballyhoo!  It's hard to explain Coalfire pizza to people... It's not quite Neapolitan, it's not NY style, it's not California.. and it's definitely not Chicago style... It's just really, really good. . . After dining in multiple times, I can't think of a single thing that I have disliked.  As a BYOB this place was a hidden gem - now with a liquor license, they're just as great.  From their amazing oven fire pizzas to calzones to salads - everything at Coalfire is great!!
