I don't understand the overly positive reviews. The food here is fine, but anyone giving it 5 stars is nuts. They make a pretty good fried chicken with gravy but its nowhere near orgasmic. Its just fine, not particularly juicy on the inside nor crispy on the outside. The chicken is kind of skinny, not to meaty. The waffles were good, the butter was great temperature for spreading. The syrup had the right amount of sweetness. Its fine but its really not all that special. I'd come back though if in the area and I couldn't find a new place to try out.. . I'm tempted to give it 4 stars but since a bunch of people are nuts and gave it 5, I'll give this a 3 stars.
