Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
Roy's is an authentic high-end Hawaiian fusion restaurant that happens to be a chain.  . . Everything we had here was delicious, including the expertly prepared guava martini.  We ordered the spare ribs (a little salty) and the Ahi tuna appetizer.  The tuna was flown in from Hawaii earlier that day, and was a completely different texture than any Ahi that you get at a regular sushi restaurant.. . Don't miss the chocolate souffle, as it's not overwhelmingly chocolaty nor overly sweet.
