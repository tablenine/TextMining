Good for late night drinks.. . While strolling up Division we decided to try Crust, we were looking for a late night drink and a nibble. . . Don't be fooled by the table umbrella's that say "Peroni" they don't have it. Only organic beers. My friend that loves Peroni was disappointed.. . We ordered a basic basil and cheese pizza. Which was fine for something to nosh on with drinks. As light fare or called a dressed up flat-bread fine. Calling it a pizza, imo it doesn't measure up.. . Service was fast, attentive and friendly.. . Overall, I'd go back for drinks again and a light meal. If there was a long wait I'd skip it.. . We did love the clean, sleek and open decor.
