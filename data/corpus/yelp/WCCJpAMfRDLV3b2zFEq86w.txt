Love it!!!  Great food...both Thai and Chinese.  Attentive service.  Friendly.  Will customize meals for you.  You will enjoy this restaurant.  Somtimes crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but worth the wait.  Good Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea.  Love the Avocado Shrimp!  Very casual.  Good for a date or a family outing.
