Had to downgrade after my second visit. Couldn't resist the fried chicken again. It was good, but not the knock-your-knees together  good like last time.  Oh well.. . ----. Best fried chicken I've ever had. It's been several months since I last ate there, and I still think about that chicken.  My dinner companion took a sample bite of my dish, and the next day I received an email that said, "I can't stop thinking about that chicken!". . The Cayenne Fried Chicken was 5-Star all the way. Everything else was good, too, though I would more likely give 4 stars.
