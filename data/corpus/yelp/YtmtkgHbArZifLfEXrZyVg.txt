This was my second attempt at indulging in the sinful deliciousness at FO.  My first attempt at the Santa Monica location was derailed by a long line and a strategic misstep, but this time I would not be denied my burger, even if it was game 4 of the NBA finals!  Note: for those considering coming here for a game, I have on piece of advice.... DON'T.   There will be no place to sit and they only have two tiny TVs a the end of the bar.  . . Now for the goods stuff...I rate the burger between very good and excellent...I won't say it was the absolute best I've ever had, but it was big, meaty, and cooked perfectly.  The only area of improvement could have been the bun.  Regardless, the burger went phenomenally well with the uber hoppy IPA I adeptly indentified on the beer list (Drakes).  I also tried the pork belly, which was melt-in-your-mouth good.  Served in a bowl with greens, the fatty goodness sent me into a state of cholestoric euphoria.  A huge and varied collection of beers on tap plus insanely good burgers...I must say that FO gives Kuma's some serious competition.  Now all I need is a Father's Office in Chicago and my life would be complete!
