I was so excited to go there and sit outside while enjoying some rose and oysters. The rose was great, the oysters not so much. The frisee salad was just ok. I did love the lobster sandwich but the fries sucked and it wasn't the seasoning - not sure if they were too thick or just not friend long enough - they were kind of dry though - very strange. I'm still wanting to go back and try the Taco Tuesday as I heard some good things about those...
