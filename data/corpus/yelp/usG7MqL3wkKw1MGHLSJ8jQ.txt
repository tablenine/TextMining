Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
When you go to Chinatown, you are going to get top notch food across the board. Its just the way it is; the good chefs come here, the takeouts don't. Noodle town is no exception, but its a great quick stop to have beef stew noodle soup especially late night (in agreement with other reviews here). As cheap as any other place on or off the Bowery, step over if you live around the Financial district or close by.
