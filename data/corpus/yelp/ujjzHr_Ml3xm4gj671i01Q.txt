I'll call this one a safe choice for the mixed group, i.e., those who love thai eating with those who still aren't sure where thailand is.  I like my thai much spicier than this, but the meal was still pretty satisfying.  The service was fine.  Not a big selection of entrees or alcohol but they do serve Sapporo beer, so not bad. . . I'll say this - good value.  Four of us had two appetizers, an entree apiece, a soda and four beers.  Total paid was $60 including tip. . . Well-scrubbed dining room with pretty paint and nice floors.  A little loud for chatting.  Plenty of elbow room and you could probably careen around the tables pretty quickly without hurting anyone if you had a rocket tied to your back. . . Inoffensive, but not offensively so.
