I forgot how much I like this place after not being here for a while. I used to work a few blocks away and would often meet with my boyfriend afterwords but since I work in Chelsea now I barely made it to BONDST despite living in Tribeca. . . Well, I randomly ended up here last night with two friends and had a blast. Warren is still at the bar and he's great! The food is seriously delicious and the drinks are fantastic. . . I do get a bit claustrophobic in those tiny bathrooms but that's not the worst really. I feel like there is a fair amount of posers and weirdos from Jersey City or who knows where they come from and where they got a great parking spot. Ugh.
