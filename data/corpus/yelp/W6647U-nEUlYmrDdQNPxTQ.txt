Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Food: is awesome, lots of it, 1 dish can really be shared. The Machaca is the best, be prepared for some serious food coma.. . location: Its is a really really humble area of boyle hieghts, keep in mind the place is a LA landmark, so you have all walks of life going there from doctors in scrubs, policeman, business people and of course the local's. I have been going there since i was a kid and have never seen anything that would prohibit me from going back, just beware the area is very poor. . ambiance: total greasy spoon place, not fancy, go their for breakfast that is the best. . service: top notch, the waitresses and busboy's have been their for years, they are all very nice and great with people.
