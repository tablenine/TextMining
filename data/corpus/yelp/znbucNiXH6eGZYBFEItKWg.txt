This place has a chef renowned for his breakfast dishes. He does not fall short anywhere on the menu. He gives each dish his special touch. One time he came and took back a plate from our table before we touched it because he saw the cook miss a detail. The blueberry cream cheese french toast is worth the trek and the parking. I have never ordered something I didn't finish here. AMAZING!!! I actually crave it sometimes and have to make the drive...
