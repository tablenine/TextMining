Good not great.  I just can't give this place 4stars - 4stars means yay I'm a fan.  And I just not that enthused.  I'm currently in transition from strickly carnivore to eating fish so I was hoping to add Devon to my rotation...not so much.  . The service was friendly, but not spectacular.  The menu options were abundant. The biscuits - don't waste the carbs.  My salad was ho hum.  . . My macadamian nut encrusted monchong was great, everything else on the plate ill conceived - the accompaniment of berries and asparagus in what was supposed to be beurre blanc not enough of it, just odd.. . The carrot cake - standard.. . Half off any bottle of wine, best part!. My fiancé really enjoyed his fried oysters, as well as his striped bass.. . So our evening had highs and lows.  I would go again, but it's definitely not somewhere you go to knock someone socks off.
