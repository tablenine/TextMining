In a city where finding good bread can be a challenge, this place fills a real need.  I walked over for breakfast this morning and had a very high quality ham-and-cheese croissant along with a tasty mandarin orange danish.  I would have been happy with either were I in France or Belgium (where I have lived previously) - consider that a strong recommendation. The outside of the pastries were perfectly crisp, without totally falling apart, while the interiors moist and flavorful.  They also used good-quality ham &amp; cheese, and the mandarin slices were certainly not bog-standard.  The [American style] coffee was very good as well, although I should have had an espresso so I could really compare against the patisseries I enjoyed while living in Europe.. . The employee I spoke with told me that fresh baguettes are ready at 2pm in the afternoon.  I will certainly return to evaluate their lunch and other breads, and have confidence they will be similarly excellent.
