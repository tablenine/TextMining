I was sitting at my desk last week , chatting with our lunch crew via Skype about what we should eat for lunch that day. Mind you, it was 10:30 in the morning - hey, we get an early start! Suddenly, another IM window appeared: "Hey guys - we're ordering from Versailles today to celebrate a birthday, who wants in?" I quickly scanned the list of recipients in the IM window - the entire lunch crew was included. It was unanimous...Versailles for lunch it was.. . A lunch crew bud/Yelpy friend and I decided to split the "Famoso Pollo Versailles" - Versailles' famous garlic chicken. I've tried a few other things on the menu, but the garlic chicken is my favorite. Frighteningly enough, I could eat the entire entree myself on a normal day. :O Today, however, was not a normal day - I had actually eaten breakfast! needless to say I was up for splitting the entree...and I was not left hungry.The moro is yummy, but the beans and rice separately does the trick as well. The best part of all? The side of plantains. :). . Versailles is not the most convenient place to order lunch from (because of where the office is), but it's always a welcome lunch distraction. . . 4 shakas!
