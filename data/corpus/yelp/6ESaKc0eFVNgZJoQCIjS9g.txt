I hadn't been here in probably close to 10 years and the food had not been that memorable the last time.  We came here for Father's Day dinner b/c my brother-in-law had made reservations here.  We were so shocked that he had taken the initiative to actually plan something for Father's Day that we all went along with the plan even though we all had our doubts about how good the food would be.  . . So I came here with a pocketful of money and very low expectations for the food.  Well, we were all very pleasantly surprised.  Both the sushi and the cooked entrees turned out to be quite good.  We ordered the Darth Vader roll solely on the basis that it was called the Darth Vader roll.  It came covered in black caviar and was very tasty.  We also had oysters on the half shell and they were very fresh and cold.  My filet mignon was cooked just as I liked and the mashed potatoes were very creamy.. . This place is pricey and I would probably never come here again just b/c for the same amount of money, I'd rather go elsewhere. And I feel this place is a bit too touristy.  But the view is pretty nice and it's a decent place to take a date who doesn't know any better.
