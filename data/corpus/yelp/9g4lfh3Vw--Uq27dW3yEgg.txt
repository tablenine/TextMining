Go for the food, not the service... It's too bad this place can't have both - great food AND great service.  Plan on having a fantastic and tasty meal, but don't plan on the employees on being excited and pleased to serve you.  Every time I go I feel like I've inconvenienced them by paying money to eat their food.  However, the food is really good... messy, but good.  The flavors and spices are amazing.  Great place for kids too, unless you've got to wait for 2 and 1/2 hours, then the kids get a little impatient.  Be sure to get the "whole shebang" seasoning, and "medium" is plenty spicy!  Great cajun fries and fried oysters... goes great with a cold beer!
