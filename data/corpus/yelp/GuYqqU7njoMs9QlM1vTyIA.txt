deciding between the two ramen places across the street can be quite difficult especially if one has a long wait...  so here are some tricks to make your decision faster:. . 1. they accept credit cards. 2. do you want thin noodles or something different than the classic ramen they serve at ramen houses?. 3. are you on a date?. . if you said yes to all of the above, then i would definitely suggest coming here.  the ambiance is nice and they have a good variety of appetizers as well.
