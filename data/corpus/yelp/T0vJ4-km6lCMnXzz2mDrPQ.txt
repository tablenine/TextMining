i had DTF for the first time in shanghai of 08. i had it again in australia of 09. good experiences both times... and even though research has shown that memories of experiences are usually remembered to be better than the actual experience, in this case, i had actually forgotten just how good the xiao long bao's were.. . the red bean dessert is also a must-have. i'm rarely satisfied at the the red bean to bun ratio of these desserts, but DTF really has it down. fully satisfying mouthfuls of red bean without the overflow and the bun was not too thick. heavenly!. . one start gets knocked off becuase everything else i've ever had at DTF has just been "a-ok".
