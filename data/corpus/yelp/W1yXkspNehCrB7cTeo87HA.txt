Garlic Breath! Haha soo worth it!. . They have AWESOME chicken wings, great oysters, and yummy Cajun seafood! The only thing is, I wouldn't recommend the crayfish so much -- it's small and has the least amount of flavor out of all the other shell fish. The shrimp is my favorite and the wings are extremely spicy and flavorful. Nonetheless, the service there is OK..could be better if they had an extra person around because it's always packed there and getting a refill when your mouth is burning from spicy chicken wings and Tabasco oysters, you're in trouble..
