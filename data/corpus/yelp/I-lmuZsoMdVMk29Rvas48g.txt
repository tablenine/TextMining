Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
2 stars for the food. +1 star for the experience lol. . To be honest, Manna has to be my least favorite KBBQ place I've been to in terms of quality of food.  It just didn't taste that great.  . . However, this is a great place to come to with a large group just because the place is huge and can seat all of you with no problem.  Come here for someone's birthday!  They'll get sprayed with champagne.  I went here for a cousin's birthday last night and it got a little crazy when they decided to get 3 other bottles to attack me (because I recently turned 21 and they felt like they should 'celebrate' it), another girl, and one of my other cousins.  The waiters were great sport to go along with our ridiculousness.  . . Fun times.
