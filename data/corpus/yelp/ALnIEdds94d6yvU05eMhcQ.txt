I only ate here once and took the somen noodles to go after reading about them in Time Out.  So flavorful!  It was an amazing spicy, limey, garlicky cold noodle salad with shrimp, orange slices, and tortilla chips.  I was surprised and delighted with the combination.  The only thing was it was a big let down on the portion for $10, but I guess that's what I get for the shrimp.  The restaurant itself is interesting--so painfully "urban," it makes your heart hurt.  Perhaps Bill Kim is into the ironic hipster thing?. . It's right off the Western stop on the Blue Line.  I'll probably be back.
