Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Friend:  What do you want to do today?  . Me: Eat Ramen. Friend: Where do you want to go?. Me: Shin Sen Gumi. Friend:  But that's a 45 minute drive........ Me: I know but we have to burn off all those calories.. Friend: Um how does driving burn calories?. Me: LA traffic burns some calories don't you think?. Friend: hm maybe. . Shin Sen Gumi makes a nice meaty complex broth.  Each bowl is individually made, from what I heard this is a transplant from Japan. . . I've spent many meals here, sit at the bar and watch them work their noodle magic, or go with friends have some sake and relax.  . . It can get kind of loud at peak times, and there is often a 20-30 minute wait.  I always get my noodles hard with a medium flavored broth, and then I douse it with sesame oil cause I like it spicy :).
