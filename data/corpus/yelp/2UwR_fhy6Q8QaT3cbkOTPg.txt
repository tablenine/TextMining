What else is there to say that hasn't been already said in other reviews, they have the best Hainan Chicken. But surprisingly their pasta dishes are good too.. . Parking can be tough during busy hours, and finding a table to sit at can be worse. And despite being such a popular location, NO CREDIT CARDS! Cash only.
