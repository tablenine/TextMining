I've been here quite a few times and thought the food was ok.  But keep in mind that the menu is the typical Americanized version you see in Thai restaurants all over Chicago.  If you want the authentic stuff, you have to go elsewhere.  Their pad thai, pad see eiw, bamee garlic chicken noodles, and lard na are all safe bets.  And Thai iced tea, iced coffee, and bubble teas are pretty good, as well.  It's conveniently located near the Belmont Brown Line stop.
