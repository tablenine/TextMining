Great sushi. I also have a preference for BYOB, which this place is. If you go with one other person or alone, sit at the bar. The sushi chef, Mitch, is great. . . It's small, so it can definitely get crowded on pretty much any night. I have recently witnessed several large groups of Lincoln Parkers trying to sit together and getting very pissed after waiting for an hour and not getting seated. The place is a tiny storefront - which makes it so charming. If you want to eat out with 10 of your girlfriends go somewhere else, don't yell at the adorable hosts!. . I go during the week, with good friends and a couple good bottles of wine. Makes going to work the next day that much easier.. . I had to change my review to 5 stars (from 4) - after going so many more times since my first review, the consistently great sushi deserves that final star. While you may have to wait to get a table - it's totally worth it.
