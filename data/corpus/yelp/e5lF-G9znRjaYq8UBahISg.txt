yes, it was a silverlake weekend for me.. . but of course 5 stars since michael cimarusti consistently delivers culinary genius. his signature style of elegant yet forward thinking dishes is embodied in the house-cured tasmanian sea trout salad. the fish was laid out in the most gorgeous manner; in the center, salad of chives and watermelon radish delivered a fresh crispness along with the crushed wasabi peas and brown rice crackers which gave the dish the starch crunch. the wasabi creme fraiche was the perfect "binder" to bring everything together. . . it was the best salad that i have eaten in my entire life - the portion was perfect and i was in heaven.. . thanks again chef michael for your amazing talent!
