Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
We're not hip.  We don't try to be.  So we come to Geisha House earlier in the evening and bypass any "scene" aside from the scenic design Geisha House so cleverly employs.  . . If you're in the mood for atmosphere (and willing to pay for it) and excellent sushi (and willing to pay for it) your tab will certainly add up-- but it's worth it now and then.  Try the eggplant appetizer; it's the best thing on the menu.
