Restaurant: Gibsons Bar &amp; Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Steaks are great, but very expensive and annoying croud. People are pushy and think it is "the place to be" and its not.. No where to park, and fight traffic to sit in this impersonal tourist trap restaurant, not my idea of a good time.
