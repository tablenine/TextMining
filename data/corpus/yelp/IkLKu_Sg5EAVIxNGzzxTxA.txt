I went here for dinner with my roommates to celebrate one of her birthday's, as well as to have a first official dinner after moving in! We arrived around 6:30 pm and waited less than five minutes to be seated, and we were promptly served still/sparkling water and some bread/butter. . . I ordered a salad (name I forgot) that had butter lettuce, candied walnuts and goat cheese. My only complaint is that it was on the $12 salads part of the menu instead of the $9 salads, since this didn't have any meat or anything substantial in it. Regardless, it was really delicious and filling! The others got pasta dishes that were reasonably Â priced ($9 and $12) and filling, too. We also ordered the portobello fries as a shared appetizer since I'd seen great reviews about it, but since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, they weren't that great to me. . . Plus: We dropped a cake off earlier as a surprise, and right after dinner they brought it out with lit candles and later cut/served the cake for us! . . Minus: Our waitress was incredibly inattentive - we barely saw her during our meal, and the managers were around pouring water, serving the cake and giving us menus instead.. . The atmosphere of the place was new and interesting - kind of had a cafeteria vibe with the huge ceilings, but the only downside was that everything echoed and so it was hard to have a conversation since it was so loud. . . Nevertheless, we had a great dinner that was reasonably priced and closeby to home with good food and good service (from the managers, hm), so it's worth going back for a casual dinner in a fun and new place. Next time, I'm definitely going to order a pizza and try the chocolate souffle, and if I'm in the area for lunch I'll definitely stop by and see what the deli/shop is like. 4 stars!
