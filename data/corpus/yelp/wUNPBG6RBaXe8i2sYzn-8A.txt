Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Decided to check this place to see what the hype was about. . We waited for 20+ minutes to be seated, which was unusual because the seats we eventually sat in were opened the whole time. They have a unique way of sitting people, but seems to us they were just being lazy.. . We both had the umami burgers which at first didnt taste that bad. After halfway the meat began to fall apart and the burger were soaked. . The onions rings and fries we EXTREMELY bland. . Overall Id rather go somewhere else to grab a $9+ burger and bland poor tasting fries.. Not really anticipating to go back again.
