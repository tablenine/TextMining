$3 split entrees? I've been here years ago and most recently I got two recommendations to give it a try again. So today I made a reservations to check it out with my gf. When we arrived the place wasn't packed at all. So we opted for the patio since indoors seemed stuffy. . . We looked over the menu and I looked through Yelp and no menu item recommendations. I was thinking back to what my friend mentioned but oh well I couldn't remember what she said.  Since my diet means no red meat atleast until my birthday I decided on the Braised Lamb Shank. The meat was really tender and flavorful but the shank itself tasted a bit dry. How can a meat be tender but dry tasting I ask myself. The flavor was the other items that they covered the shank with on delivery to me. I dunno if that makes sense but that's how it tasted. My gf ordered the Santorini Pizza with goat cheese, mozzarella, tomato, onions and beef sausage that was just okay because she barely had two slices. Now those were our main dishes so as a food snob it was better than okay. We also got bread which was complimentary and that was good, It had a garlicky tastes to it. . . Now the BOMB dish of the night was the Isalata Frutti  Di Mare which was sauteed  black tiger shrimp, bay scallops, calamari and salmon served with mix field greens and lemon dressing. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Damn it was good!. . Overall this place had good service and I'd give it a second try for a five star if our entire meal was Da' Bomb!. . Oh yeah we both got red sangria but it was okay.
