Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I waited for the Pink's experience and thought, this is it?  So I went back when I didn't have to wait (like at 11am when you're getting your oil changed across the street).  And again, that's what they call a chili dog?  Meh.  SoCal can do burgers right, but our pizza and chili dogs (Pink's anyway) blow.
