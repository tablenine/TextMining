Category: Southern
YUM. Sigh... Oh Roscoe's why are you so far away from my hometown???. . Ninja was in town to hit up the Ellen Show at WB Studio's and was feenin' for some Rosce's. Â With the appetite of a beast Ninja orders the "Carol Special" (Chicken breast &amp; waffle), Cornbread, Potato Salad and an Ice tea.. . From the pictures you can see that the food was AMAZINGLY Deliissshhhhhhh!. . .::Overall::.. . Carol Special - So Soo Good when it hits your lips (Chicken - perfect seasoned, not greasy, juicy.... Waffles- light, fluffy, a hint of cinnamon). Cornbread - Good. Potato Salad - Very Good . Ice Tea - Solid brew very yummy. . .::Recommendation??::.. . Yes! Go! and when you go bring back some for me!
