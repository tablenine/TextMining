Cinnamon rolls were excellent, otherwise it was just OK. I ordered a breakfast wrap, which was basically an omelette wrapped in a tortilla. It was an average tasting omelette and you can choose your ingredients. They could improve it my adding some secret sauce? Anyways the cinnamon rolls are fantastic and large. They are covered in icing, which overflows off the plate. . . Service was adequate for a breakfast joint. IT IS BYOB (mimosas). Would go back and order pancakes.
