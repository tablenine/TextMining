Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
I've gone to Antico Pizza several times and have to admit, I really enjoy their pizzas. The ingredients are very fresh and the pizzas are made to order. The Margherita D.O.P and Diavaola are my favorites.. . On the downside, the space is tiny with very little practical seating. You're almost forced to carry out the pizza, especially during the lunch rush. Due to the piping hot, thin crust, the pizza steams in the box pretty quickly. The sooner you eat it; the better. If you're lucky, you can get a seat at the large, communal butcher block or stand at one of the counters.
