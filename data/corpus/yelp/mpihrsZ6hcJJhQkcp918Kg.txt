Incredible food.  Seriously.  The only reason that I wouldn't give it 5 stars is the noise, the wait and the service.  It is extremly loud there.  we ended up eating at the bar because the wait was way too long, you'd think that you'd get better service sitting at the bar, but you don't it's just that busy!  i would definitely recommend their Carpaccio! It's enough for two, but next time, i'm not sharing.
