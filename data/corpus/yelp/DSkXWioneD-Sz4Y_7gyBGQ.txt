Restaurant: Zuma Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
With a late night craving for sushi, we decided to drop in on Zuma around 10 PM and even with it being late, service in no regards was sacrificed.. . We ordered the soft shell crab for our appetizer and it came out piping hot oozing with the goodness of freshness served with various vegetable tempura. We ordered sashimi for two and the both the fish and clam used was extremely fresh. . . I love how Zuma keeps it simple and strays away from serving the food in a distracting array- opting to focus on the food. When our check came, we were given (2) $10 coupons to used in the next month so I will definitely coming back soon. Definitely one of the best sushi places in Atlanta!
