Thank god for Ciudad and their economic recession specials!!  The happy hour drinks and food menu is CHEAP...and decent!!  Something like four dollar mojitos and tacos?  Fabulous!  The potato crispy tacos were delish with a tart corn vinaigrette on top.   . . Also, the restaurant provides FREE shuttle service to and from the Staples Center or music concert hall.  We took advantage of this complimentary service and our driver Freddie was prompt and friendly.
