Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
First let me say that my wife loves the Veggie Burger, without bun, in a bowl on top of lettuce and tomatoes.. . But since this is a hamburger restaurant, let's focus on the burgers.  The gimmick here is that you can design your own burger, including size, with an assortment of toppings, cheeses, sauces, and buns.  . . The problem, however, is the hamburger.  I ordered mine medium rare and with no bun.  It came medium rare but it had zero flavor, juices, or taste.  . . Hey Counter, you're a burger place.  Fix the burger!
