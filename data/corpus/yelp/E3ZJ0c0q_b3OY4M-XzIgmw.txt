For a salad place, I was hoping there would be more veg*n options.  Luckily they did have 3 veg options-- one of which was the Happy Vegan.  It was amazingly delicious.  Yes, it was costly, but I really enjoyed the meal, the atmosphere, the convenient parking garages, and the quick service.. . The Happy Vegan costs $10.50.  The ingredients are:  tabbouleh, hummus, pasta pearls, farro wheat,  young kale, and "tender greens".  It also comes with a piece of crostini bread.
