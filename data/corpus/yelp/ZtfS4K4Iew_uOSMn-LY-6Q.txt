Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I've been here about three times now but I try not to go so often.. . When I came back from a long term trip last fall, I noticed that downtown has changed so much since when I left, the December before. The first thing I noticed was the large glass facade restaurant, glimmering with candle lit tables. I wanted to try Bottega Louie immediately !!. . First time we tried on a Thursday night, the wait was 45 minutes for a table of two. We decided to come back another time. The next time, we actually waited for 45 minutes and finally ate. but noticed that though we were sitting at a small table, it was impossible to have a conversation because of the noise. It was the same the second time I sat and ate there. Today, I came in with a friend at 2:30pm and it was much more pleasant. But still found myself yelling because the acoustics are so bad.. . On the contrary to its fancy look, the restaurant is pretty casual with friendly waiters and a nice bakery counter. I can't complain about the service here though, the management tries to make everything as efficient as possible and they're always refilling your glass. Food is always good and the whole place is a show. Tall ceilings, pristine white interior, open kitchen, fast paced workers.... . It's just that I always come home tired from this place.. ...Only if I didn't have to yell during my whole meal...
