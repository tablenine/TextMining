After hearing the hype, I had to try these tacos.  I'm a fan of Korean BBQ and tacos from taco trucks so when I heard you could get both in the same thing, I was there.  I tried all of the tacos but the best one in my opinion were the spicy pork tacos.  I was surprised that the short rib tacos were not the best ones.. . The only thing I can knock them for are the lines and I guess that's not necessarily their fault.  We got to The Brig at 11 and found a line already forming WAITING for the truck to show up.  Once we got in line it took a total of 30 or 40 minutes for the truck to set up, start cooking food and start serving.. . If I'm ever in the area or if any one of my friends asks about these tacos, you know for sure I'll be down.
