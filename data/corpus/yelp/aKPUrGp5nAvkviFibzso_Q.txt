I don't know about "hipster-magnet" but this is where I go with the girls on Sunday to gripe about the men. . . When you see the good-looking brunette chicks with cool shoes talking dirty over obscenely large mugs of frothy Zombie coffee served with tasty brunchy items like the Breakfast Burrito (yum, not quite southwest authentic, but yum) or French Toast with Crispy Bacon... that would be us... you've got some hot evesdropping ahead.. Plus- ladies, this is not to be ignored-  the waiters tend to be cute, flirt-a-liciously so and will join in on the competitive bitching. The winner earns the "prize" of a warm, dense, syrup-doused brownie.... . . The messy disorganization of the space is somewhat comforting...  and the ritual is faster and cheaper than therapy.. . Oh yes, you WILL be warned, the raunchy talk has escalated enough to scare some rambunctious guys recovering from an all-night bachelor-party (I don't know if we sufficiently terrified the groom from lifelong wedlock- but it is entirely possible).. Decent food, good coffee, generous servers plus workings of the female mind make for Good times!
