Restaurant: Uncle Julio&#39;s Casa Grande
Category: Mexican
As far as Tex-Mex goes, this restaurant was pretty decent.  Not usually a huge fan of Mexica, but the Hello Stiletto shoe club got me through the doors.  The restaurant itself was festive larger than I expected and the staff was very welcoming.  I enjoyed the complimentary appitizers of quesadillas and nachos, but I can't say they were the best I've ever had.  I did LOVE their signature drink, the Swirl.  For anyone who likes margaritas and/or sangria, I highly recommend you try this drink!!. . Based on the experience I had, I would go back and try a few more things from the menu.
