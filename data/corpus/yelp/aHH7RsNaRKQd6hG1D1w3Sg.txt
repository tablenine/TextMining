Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I wish somebody had warned me. . . Worst restaurant experience of my life. I find it a little awkward saying that seeing as how I'm 1 out of 3 people that didn't rate this place highly. So, what's wrong with me? Let me list them out:. . 1. Our waitress:. SOOOOO RUDE. Granted we were the only people in there actually LAUGHING instead of mulling faux-intelligently over shitty French wine, so I guess that was enough of a reason for her to be less than civil. You're a waitress, not a rock star, so drop the attitude b****.. . 2. The wine:. Don't bother ordering anything under $70, and DEFINITELY do not order anything in the $30 range. It tasted like rubbing alcohol. . . 3. $30 dinner minimum per person. What a f***Ing waste. We ordered food that was just thrown away. Like many, we just came for the ambiance and wine, not to fill our bellies. Our waitress refused to budge on the sudden dinner requirement. So we ordered food we just wasted. . . Maybe I was raised in a barn, and I don't have the social etiquette to bump rumps with the bourgeoisie, but at least I don't pretend to be something I'm not, which seemed to be what the majority of people and staff here were doing.
