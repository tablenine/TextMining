High five for veggie sausages! I really appreciate that Wurstkuche looks out for the veggies. I had a Vegetarian Beer Bratwurst with spicy peppers and caramelized onions on a roll. Really yummy, even if the sausage was a little dry for my liking. Topped with their super variety of mustard, with a side of the fantastic fries and dips (curry ketchup and thai peanut get my thumbs up) and washed down with some Belgian beers or a bottles of old-school/organic pop, it's really a happy time. As for the pop, I recommend the Fentiman's dandelion soda. If you like red vines, you'll be in heaven. One of the gals at the counter recommended it to me, and it was really crisp and happenin'. The Fentiman's ginger beer my friend had is also yum (yeah, I stole a sip!).. . And for the adventurous non-veggies, Wurstkuche serves up some really interesting meat sausages. Rattlesnake and Rabbit (one of my companions had this and said it's delish), Duck and Bacon, etc. My worst nightmare. Your culinary paradise?
