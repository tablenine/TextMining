9.11.07: It was a long wait for a bigger party. We sat outside luckily there's benches. Watching a tv show that completely does not match the audio. The parking Suck ASS...There's 8 of us. We ordered a grip of food. shrimp, cathfish, wings, crawfish, corn, fries, and oysters. There's no meat in the crawfish. I think its all about ripping it apart and just tasting it. The sauce was great, we ordered medium, but it was spicy in my standards. I think this place is alright. Its fun to be all messy and that's what really makes this place good. That's all there is to it. Messy fun..
