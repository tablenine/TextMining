Restaurant: Los Nopales
Category: Mexican
My wife and I consider this to be the best Mexican restaurant in town.. . The menu is pretty straightforward with most of the usual dishes you expect in a Mexican place.  Los Nopales stands out because the food tastes freshly prepared.. . In addition, the cost is very low for the quality of food.  We have done takeout numerous times and unlike some other restaurants, it doesn't seem to impact the taste and quality of the food at all.. . BYOB also helps keep the tab down.  Overall, great value and quality for the dollar.
