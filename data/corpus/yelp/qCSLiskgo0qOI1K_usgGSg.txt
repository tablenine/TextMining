I first heard about Kogi when it was profiled in Newsweek.  That was about two years or so ago.  I totally forgot about it until last night, when my friend, who I am visiting in downtown LA, suggested that I go to the Kogi Taco truck and I was immediately up for it.  I wanted to see what all the hype was about.. . When I got there at around 12:30, there were two trucks, so the wait was really minimal - 10 minutes max.  I feel pretty lucky, since many people have complained they've waited for up to three hours.  Needless to say, the tacos are worth the wait.  I got two Short Rib Tacos and one Spicy Pork Taco and my friend got two Short Rib Tacos and one Chicken Taco.. . The Short Rib Tacos are very flavorful, especially with lime juice sprinkled on it.  It's a unique fusion food that I would be up for trying again.  My favorite though was the Spicy Pork Taco.  It wasn't spicy, but it was bursting with flavor.  A bit oily, but still, very yummy.  I might have to go back before I head back home.. . Granted, my rating might have changed if I had to wait an hour or two, but like I said, I was pretty lucky with the minimal wait.  I haven't tasted anything like this before, so I'm glad I got to do so.
