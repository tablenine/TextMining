Restaurant: Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate
Category: American (New)
Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate, you are conveniently located caddy-corner from my friends' apartment.  Once there was a time we decided we should go visit you AFTER a party and I got to try your food for free.  By that I mean I asked a fellow at the bar if MB &amp; I could have a hot wing.  The wings on the plate near the man did not belong to the man and were not his to give away, but generously he recognized the needs of a skinny tipsy girl and gave me food anyway.  I ended up eating half.   In an alcohol-glittered haze, the wings are WONDERFUL.  Hard to say if I'd like the place if I were my usual normal, sober self.. . All the same, thanks for the memories.
