A jump away from the Logan Square Blue Line stop and you've got savory fish tacos, or if you prefer land based toppings, try the al carbon, al pastor, choriso, or lengua (that's tongue - oh yeah, give it try), etc. Some of my other favs are the whole fried fish, tamales and sopes topped with anything they've got. . . Some of the menu is rather uninspired.  I was never a fan of the burritos, and the chili relleno had some serious freezer burn, the straight-from-the-can octopus offerings can be a bit of a turn off, and the guacamole was too expensive for what it was worth... BUT if you head to the more authentic side of the menu, you have a treat (and a good buzz) that won't break the bank and keep you out in the neighborhood.. . The patio is the best - away from the street and nicely shaded with incense wafting through the gangway leading you in from the street.  In the winter, when sadly, the patio has to close, the inside is warm and welcoming.  . . It's a place you can go on a regular basis and always get a good bite.  How I miss this place, but when in the Windy City, I head to Logan Square's El Cid 2.
