Restaurant: Bone Garden Cantina
Category: Mexican
We go to Bone Garden for the posole soup and the laid back urban atmosphere. The occasional squawking rug-rat notwithstanding, the clientele here tends to be young-ish and hip-ish and pretty darn nice-ish.. . If you've never had posole soup, you owe it to yourself to try it here. It's about the only way I'll eat hominy from a can - and it's even better when it's hydrated from its dried state. I went on a national search for the best hominy a few months ago and found a really cool Indian reservation that has preserved heritage versions of this ancient kernel. At $11/pound, everybody that I served it to thought it tasted reeeeaallll good, and I made sure by force-feeding them very strong margaritas for 2 hours prior.. . Back to Bone Garden. This place also has some of the best tamales in Atlanta. The salsas are good, too. Add to that an inexpensive wine list and fun house music, and you've got a winning combo. It's a standby for us - we don't patronize typical Mexican restaurants because of the plate-o-fat factor. (Not that this is a "healthy" restaurant, but everything's relative, right?). . Recommended for everyday use - read instructions carefully before eating...attitude not included.
