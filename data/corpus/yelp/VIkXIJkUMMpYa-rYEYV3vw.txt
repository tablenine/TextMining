Restaurant: The Foundry On Melrose
Category: American (New)
My rating breakdown: Not a 5 because it's generally too expensive for the quality of the food. I would say 3.5 -- extra .5 for good service and because we got an extra glass of wine on the house.... . Cost: Like Irene C., I also enjoyed the Blackboard Eats 40% off. (I probably wouldn't have eaten here otherwise -- it's a bit shi-shi...definitely for the 30+ crowd). If you're in Los Angeles' $30K millionaire club*, cross The Foundry off your list...wine by the glass is in the $9-15, and their prix fixe menu runs around $50-80 a plate. . . My friend and I ended up paying $40 each (including tip) -- not bad due to the discount, but way out of our range otherwise. Cost aside, the food was pretty good (not amazing) and the service was great -- be prepared to tip well (and on the full bill) because you'll feel guilty if you don't. . . My meal: I had the Market Menu seared Ahi, Duck confit (what is confit?), and the Banana Bread Pudding with rum raisin ice cream / caramel sauce. If I did it over again, I would have gotten a different dessert -- because it was raisin city.. . *$30K millionaire club - Angelinos who make $30k per year, live like it's $300k.
