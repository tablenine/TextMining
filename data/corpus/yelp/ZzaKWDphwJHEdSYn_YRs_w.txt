Maybe it's because I'm not vegetarian but I was not impressed. Out of the 6 people that went, 3 didn't like the entree they ordered and the other 3 of us were apathetic to our entrees. The appetizers were good though. Service is pretty good too. They didn't charge us for the risotto that one of us couldn't eat because it tasted like oatmeal.. I kind of like my entree but then again I was STARVING.. Tiny portions of pretty gross food. Not worth it.
