Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Mario Batali, this restaurant lives up to your name. The prosciutto pizza was salty, but my friend's asparagus, bacon, onion pizza was BOMB DIGGITY! Oh how I love Mario! These pizzas are inventive, unique, and delicious! I believe everyone should try a slice. MAKE RESERVATIONS bc you won't get seated at a regular table if you just stop by and the wait is long. save yourself some time and make a phone call. It'll be worth it. . . Save room for the butterscotch budino!!!
