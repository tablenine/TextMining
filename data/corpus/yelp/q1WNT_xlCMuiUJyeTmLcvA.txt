Restaurant: Fritti
Category: Italian
Another place I've been going to for years and years with no review. Fritti's strongest points come from its location, outdoor dining area and thankfully, pizza selection and quality. They must have 20 different types of thin crust and all of them are good (at least the veggie ones which are 4 or 5 different varieties).. . I'm not going to say it's the best pizza in town (I like my thin crust a little crispier), but it's definitely number two or three. Probably one of the best outdoor eating areas in town.
