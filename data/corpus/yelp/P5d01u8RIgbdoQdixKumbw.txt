This place gets my goat.. . Conventional produce for 2x the cost of Publix / Kroger. . A wine department that is almost always 20% higher than anywhere else. . The prepared food counter and bakery looks great, but everything I've ever bought has been sub-par (same with bakery). . I will go in if I need some sort of specialty ingredient and don't want to drive to YDCFM, but it hurts me.. . This WF is a few steps below B'head, and even a step below the smaller La Vista.
