Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Wow, an entire year has passed since I encountered my first breakfast love, The Griddle.  It's been a very good year.  A year filled with Peanut Bubba French Toast, The Golden Ticket, Banana Nana, Teacher's Pet, Black Magic, Hear Me Roar, and of course my favorite, Cheesecake French Toast.. amongst other sweet items I've fallen for.  The French fries are pretty darn good, as well.  I can't help myself.  I adore the Griddle.  It will always be my amour when it comes to Sunday brunch.  It's a true testament, when asked before having surgery "Where would you like to go for breakfast?" And contemplating my impending lack of appetite for a couple of weeks, I immediately responded, "THE GRIDDLE, of course!"
