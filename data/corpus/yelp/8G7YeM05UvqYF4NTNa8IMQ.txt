This place is all right. Food is good, but you don't neet do spend that much money for  Dungenous crab or tiger prawn. So many people brag about the garlic noodle..its not bad..but I'd rather eat pan fried chow mein instead.  Check out my other review on Tan Cang. Their food is 10 times better, price is 3 times cheaper, with an ambiance that's 50 times worse than Crustacean....go to Tan Cang for real vietnamese seafood...just remember that you have to park your own car there.
