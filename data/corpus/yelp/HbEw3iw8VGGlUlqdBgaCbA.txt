I love Roscoe's... I really do. But for some reason, the food here just doesn't taste as good as the other locations (Pico or Gower). Â It could be the chef's, it could be someone forgettin to add somethin in the mix... but just doesn't taste GOOD to me. Just okay.. . The Pico location is my favorite...
