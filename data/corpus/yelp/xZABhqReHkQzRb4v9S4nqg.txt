Another revisit to JCT...and during lunch so there was no annoying valet to ruin the experience. There was, however, enough slow lunch service issues and small things here and there to reduce a perfectly lovely lunch to 3 stars.. . One the big things that bugs me at JCT is the napkins - they always have. While I love the dishtowel/cloth idea for a napkin...please make sure they are of high enough quality that they don't turn what you're wearing into a snowglobe. I had on a black sundress at lunch and didn't think about it until it was too late. I *asked* if they had a black napkin - which they do - but a server should bring it to you if you have black on (or at least ask if you would like the option of one). My server's response was...."Oh I'm sorry...I didn't know you had black on." . . Moving on.. . The food was quite good. Both of us had the salmon sandwich, which was cooked perfectly. My one issue is that the texas toast size brioche slices weren't toasted enough to hold the weight of the salmon so there was sagging and buckling. It was tasty and the mayo &amp; arugula on the sandwich were awesome. We substituted the regular fries for the Truffle Parmesan fries - delicious, as always. We split a terrific dessert, which were the "ice cream sandwiches". In actuality, they are more like profiteroles with butter pecan ice cream in the middle. Still way yummy. A great experience food wise but - as usual - service is only "ok" Â at JCT.
