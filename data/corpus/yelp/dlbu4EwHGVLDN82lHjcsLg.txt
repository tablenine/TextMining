Seriously, I love love love their chicken sandwich between 2 crispy pieces of fresh toasted bread, lettuce, tomatoe and chipolte mayo...to me that's the final prize on the sandwich!  It always comes with homemade chips that are lightly salted.   To die for iced latte's and a cute patio or indoor seating. You do have to wait in line and order, take a number and then your food will be served. It's self service for your water and utensils, but works for me!
