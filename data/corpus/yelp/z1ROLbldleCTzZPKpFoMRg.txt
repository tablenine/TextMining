I'm so torn. While the food is amazing, the wait and rude hostess definitely keeps me from going back too much. Is oil/garlic/cajun spice drenched sea food really worth it? I usually ask myself this after 30 minute mark of waiting. The staff seems more concerned with getting you in and out to keep the line moving outside. Which is nice for the people waiting, but can come off as rude and annoying for everyone eating after their hour+ wait. And because of that, I really can't give it the full 5 stars.. . Obviously, the food is good. Great, even! You get down and dirty with other restaurant patrons, and you'll never feel silly wearing a plastic bib. I usually get the whole shebang, medium spiciness, with a side of the lime juice for dipping. Cajun fries are also a must. I have yet to try the corn and other sides, but mostly because I would rather fill up on the lovely seafood than corn :P is that so wrong?. . I say give it a try if you're curious. I recommend going out early to avoid the insanely crazy wait outside. Also, maybe smile at the hostess, no matter how rude she may come off to be. She does control that wait list you know,
