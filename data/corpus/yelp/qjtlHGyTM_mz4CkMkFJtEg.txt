Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Ah, I remember when this place first opened up with the insane crowds waiting for their turn at a table and the incredible xiaolongbao; steamed, not on a big nappa cabbage leaf but on some kind of parchment paper. Â Ooh!! Fancy! Cosmopolitan!! In fact, this place was a "nice place", clean and modern.. . During those first few years, I'd salivate like Pavlov's dog whenever I'd hear the word "dumpling", and I'd think of those bao, the soup inside flooding my taste buds (after they've cooled a bit) with that incredibly delicious porky flavor. . . What makes me sad is that past several times I've eaten there, with that memory is still firmly entrenched in my mind, I'd take a bite and it's just not what it used to be. I probably kept returning thinking that I've gone there on a "off day", but when it first happened it was a WTF moment for me. Something had definitely changed and not for the better.. . I think this place is still good, with deceptively pale fried rice hiding a nice flavor, the pork chops on rice, the soups, the sauteed veggies, stir fried ricecake... It's all pretty good. Crowded, yes; and the wait staff are accustomed to peak time rushes negotiating the table and chairs the best they can, but I still think of how Din Tai Fung used to be, that first burst of flavor inducing sighs of contentment; xiaolongbao bliss.. . I've returned here several times, just to see if the magic's returned and every time I've said, "it's not as good as it used to be", and "it's not worth the wait now", yet the passage of time has a way of sweetening memories and inevitably, I go back hoping that things will return to the way they were.. . Hell, maybe I should just "let go" and try the other location next door.
