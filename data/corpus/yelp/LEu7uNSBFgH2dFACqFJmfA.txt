This is one of my faves for authentic cuisine de May-he-co. Very crowded most weekends! Awesome combination platters make it easy to decide what to eat. The "Taberna" across the street handles overflow now, but the service away from the bar there stinks: we had our pitcher of margaritas slammed on the table by the server and glasses handed to us empty, for example. What's that about??? Crowd in at the bar while you wait for your table, or suffer the consequences! :-)
