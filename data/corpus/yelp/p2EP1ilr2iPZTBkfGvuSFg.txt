We arrived to a forming line on Thursday around 8pm on the northwest side of Cloverdale &amp; Wilshire. Kogis arrived around 840pm and couldn't find a damn spot to park. So, note to the other locations, if you can save a parking spot for them - do so. Or you're pretty much waiting AGAIN until they find a spot. Luckily, the owners of Wilshire Beauty lent us their parking lot. Very nice! (So, for all your beauty needs go to Wilshire Beauty!) By then the line scattered and made a crazy dash to the new line in the parking lot. I was one of the lucky ones who only had to wait 30 minutes in line and 10-15 minutes for my food. And then the moment of truth...dun dun dun. I tried one of each taco ($2 each) and burrito ($5 each). And I have to say, the portions were small but DELICIOUS (mainly due to its unique marinate and cabbage mix)!!! This is definitely a must-try experience at least once. . . I do have to knock down one star for lack of a better operating system. There has to be a more faster and efficient way to get through that line. I would love to become a repeat and loyal customer, but that line and wait dissuades me from doing so. . . So, Kogis is basically the Asian version of Pinks. Long line, freezing cold wait, generally inexpensive prices, &amp; greasy food. And god help you, if you are surrounded by bunch of knuckleheads. Impatience + HUNGER + annoying bastard = bad combination.
