=) the pork belly and and chili-rubbed prime rib were succulent and perfectly seasoned. i love rice bowls and chego's had all my fave things: fatty meats, runny egg, various fresh veggies. the location is AWESOME as its walking distance from my house..... . =/ HOWEVER, the rice was kind of soggy and maybe bc it was too mushy and not dry enough to soak up the sauces i found the overall rice bowl to be overly saucy in a way that detracted from the truly delicious flavor of the meat. i kinda had to pick around the rice and sauce to get a good taste of the water spinach and other fixins.. . i was hoping this could be a regular pit-stop for me since its so close by, and spending money on rice bowls is a totally reasonable (and quick) way to feed myself. i don't think its going to go that way with chego. i LOVE the meat but am not a huge fan of the rice and super-sauciness. plus it hasn't had the same withdrawal-effect that kogi has on me...in fact the sense i'm left with is best described in one word: Â overrated...
