A bit overpriced and the menu leaves a lot to be desired.  I love sushi and know that you pay for quality.  The quality was mostly good however the menu seemed a bit limited, overpriced and the service was slow.  We went there at 5:30pm, the place was still empty.  We placed our order and it seemed like the sushi came out in spurts every 10 to 15 minutes.  At one point we thought they forgot about one of our nigiri orders.  I don't expect "fast-food" service but with 5 sushi chefs standing behind the counter seemingly doing nothing, our order could have been processed a little quicker.. . I took my mom (who is a native of Japan) and she wasn't impressed either.  I mean come on! $2.50 for a "bowl" of miso soup a little larger than the size of a tea cup and it wasn't even that good.  A cup of green tea was $2.50 (which is normally free in a real Japanese restaurant or sushi house) and was served in a Western tea pot and mugs.  In a Japanese restaurant, Japanese tea should be served in traditional tea cups!  . . I also ordered a teriyaki chicken dish on the side.  The chicken was OK but the rice was crap and was served in a tea cup sized "bowl".  I don't care if this is a Sushi restaurant, if you are going to charge $19 for teriyaki chicken, it better be good and come with high quality rice.  High quality rice is very important not only for sushi but for regular entrees as well and it's expected at a high-end restaurant like Mirai.  . . If they are going to charge high prices, then everything needs to be spot on with great fast service, authentic presentation, top quality rice across the board (for both sushi AND their entrees) none of which was true.  This place would never fly in Japan.
