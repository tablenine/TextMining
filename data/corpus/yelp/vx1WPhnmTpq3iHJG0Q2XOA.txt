I've been coming here for years, but until last night, hadn't been in a very long while. Stopped in for Happy Hour, but then decided that I'd order drinks off the regular martini menu as the HH drink list is a tiny one. . . Had the Fleur De Lys, an interesting combo of grapefruit &amp; elderflower liqueur, the Toasted Almond, which tasted very much like sweet cake frosting...but in a good way; the Washington Apple (an appletini made with whiskey &amp; grenadine), and two orders of the hummus &amp; pita.. . All in all, I left buzzed, full &amp; happy. The bartender, Tec, was nice aswell. Added an extra star for playing STP and the Pretenders on the iPod playlist, too.
