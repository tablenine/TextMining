Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
We hadn't gone to Reza's for a while because we had been regular take-out customers up to about a year ago, but then, it started to go downhill.  Anyway, we've dined here twice in the past few weeks and the food was excellent, fresh, and delicious.  The wines by the bottle are reasonably priced and so are the beers.  Delicious kabobs and lamb shank.
