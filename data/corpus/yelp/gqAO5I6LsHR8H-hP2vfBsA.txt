When my girls come to town this place will likely be an option to take them to.   The scene here was wonderful, pretty people, pretty location, pretty food.  I had the Peachtree Sunrise to start things off with.  I enjoyed the drink, however it reminded me of those first days of drinking when you could have one oj + 1 shot of peach schnapps and you were wired for the evening.  My SO (Bill) had the Drunken Palmer.   I sampled his drink, but liked mine more.   For dinner I had the Crab Hash.  Which I would say qualified as going outside of my food "comfort zone" which I find scary when spending more money then normal.  However I was delightfully surprised by the taste combination of crab, potatoes and tomatoes.  The two poached eggs on top made me think I was having brunch, but as I saw the line forming next door at Opera Nightclub I remembered I was not having fourth-meal.  . . Last but certainly not least dessert of Pecan Pie with ice cream.  Now I have to say that I have 2 gourmet cooks in my family who both can serve a mean pecan pie..or fudge pecan pie on occasion.  Sadly I have to say this version of the pecan pie while good, however was not the best I've ever had.  Therefore the title of best pecan pie in Georgia remains at large.
