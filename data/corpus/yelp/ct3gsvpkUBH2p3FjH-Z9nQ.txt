Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
Had a fantastic meal here while traveling on business.  Hugo's is great because you can order seafood AND get a great steak from Gibson's next door (same owner).  My coworker and I split the Seabass w/miso glaze (amazing!!), the filet medallions served oscar style (crab on top, yum!), and 1 large sweet potato.  Honestly, its the best meal I've had all year - so far.  Location great, food fantastic, service impeccable. Need I say more?
