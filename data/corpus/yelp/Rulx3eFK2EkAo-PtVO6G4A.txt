We ordered delivery last night. I vaguely recall ordering once before and liking it. That was not the case last night. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. The food was really bland. I added some chili pepper paste that I had at home to give it some flavor. My boyfriend ordered Pad Thai. He said it was one of the worst he has had. Once he put some spice in it, it was a bit better. He didn't finish it though (and he always does). I ordered the Harvest with tofu and shrimp. The tofu was really good. I would advise to stay away from the shrimp. They Â were bland and tough (and a little fishy tasting). The summer rolls were decent enough. There are too many good restaurants in Chicago, so I probably will not go back here.
