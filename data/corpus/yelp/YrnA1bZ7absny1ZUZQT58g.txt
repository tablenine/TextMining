I've been hearing about this restaurant opening for months and when I happened to be in Decatur last night, I figured I'd give it a try. Â I admit, pork products aren't my favorite part of the food pyramid, but I'll try anything once.. . I was seated immediately with a nice view of the square, which ended up being great for people watching. The server explained pretty much everything on the menu you to me from how they organize the house wines to his favorite small plate. I appreciated the fact that he took the time to suggest things that he liked rather than what appeared to be the most popular. He wasn't the only attentive staff member. Both the hostess and the owner came by to check on me. Now on to the important stuff.... . I ordered the bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer and the burger for my entree. Anything stuffed with cheese will get my attention and the dates were a nice mix of sweet and gooey. The romesco was delicious. I was eating it with a fork after I finished the dates. The burger was also one of the best I've had recently. I ordered it medium well and it was actually cooked properly. I find when I order medium well, I end up with one or the other. They topped it with a nice gooey cheese, crispy shallots (at least that's what they looked/tasted like), and the bun didn't get soggy. The eggplant fries were a nice change from regular fries. They were well fried, not too greasy.. . They lose a star simply because the service was slow. I'm sure it's just getting the swing of things as they've only officially been open for 10 days. I walked in at 7:15 and walked out at 8:20, which I felt was a bit too long for just lil ol' me. I look forward to going back when they've had a little more time to smooth things out. The food and the staff were absolutely worth a return trip.
