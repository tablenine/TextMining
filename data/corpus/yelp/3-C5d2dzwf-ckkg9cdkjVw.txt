Cupcake in an ice-cream cone! Revolutionary! . . A fun, delicious dessert shop with a wide variety of yummies.. I would have given this place a 3.5*.. . Summary:. - Chocolate Cupcake in ice-cream cone: fun and tasty. But i have to admit it was cuter than it was tasty. - Red Velvet Popper: good. i liked the concept of a small cupcake...so i could try a variety of diff things!. - Strawberry Shortcake Malt Shake: Humongous. I wish i had someone to share this with. It was definitely too big!. - Banana Split: My friend's order was huge. The nutella ice-cream is divine. Very silky and smooth. - Blue Velvet Cake: Interesting, tasty but a tad too sweet. . I'd come back here to try other dessert options, but probably won't do it if there was a long line
