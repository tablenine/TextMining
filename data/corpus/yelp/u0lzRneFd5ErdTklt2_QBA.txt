Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Prolific! . . Never before has there ever been such a great burrito as the `Hollenbeck` for a spicy beef burrito drenched in a red chile sauce. You will need a knife and fork and a designated driver. Not for every day eating, but certainly to be remembered as the day you ate at Manny's El Tepeyac Cafe . Make the trip and say hello to Manny who personally sits most of his guests. He will remind you of your grandfather.
