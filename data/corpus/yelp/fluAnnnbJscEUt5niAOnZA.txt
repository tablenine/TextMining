Restaurant: Nakato
Category: Japanese
Nakato is an all around superb dining experience. The garden is gorgeous, the service is entertaining (if you opt for the hibachi) and most importantly, the food is scrumptious. I had chicken with rice and vegetables - loved every bite. Â I wish I could toss knives and meat around to produce a delicious meal. Who doesn't love good food coupled with entertainment?
