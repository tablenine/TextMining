Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Ate at Boiling Crab on Saturday night... it's Monday night now and I still think there's a faint scent of garlic on my fingertips... but holy canoli was it worth it.. . Between four of us, we ended up getting 12 oysters, 12 pieces of sausage, 4 ears of corn, 2 baskets of cajun fries, 2 lbs of crawfish, 1 dungeoness crab, and a partridge in a pear tree.  Our crawfish, corn, and sausage swam in Shabang seasoning and oily goodness.  Lemme just warn you that if you get the same, you better have a drink with some substance to wash it all down (which is why I'm guessing people suggest ordering a Corona).. . I love that the only utensils you get are wooden mallets.  I love that I can squirt the ketchup for my fries in a big gloppy mess on the table.  I love that they leave you with a roll of paper towels at your table.  I love that they pile on limes on your table to go with your food.  And I really REALLY love the fries.. . Go here with friends or family... not with someone you're looking to impress, unless they're into the whole garlic-y oiliness smeared all across your hands and face.  And if that's the case, lemme know if he/she has a brother.
