Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Lala is a lovely place but it has its downs. We were seated right away but the location of our seats wasn't the greatest since the place was pretty packed. It was pretty loud because of the background music so I felt that we had to yell to have a conversation.. . Besides those factors i would go back for the empanada's, bread and garlic spread and Sangria. I had a specialty plate and thought it tasty but i really wanted to get something a bit unique, that was more "Argentine" like. Will try again and pick a different item. . . Definitely go back Â and give another chance.
