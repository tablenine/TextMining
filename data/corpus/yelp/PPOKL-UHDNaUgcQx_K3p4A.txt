I give this place a 3.5.  I came here for lunch the other day, it was a beautiful day out, so eating out on the front patio was very relaxing.  Cool, trendy atmosphere.  The staff is super friendly and helpful which made for a very enjoyable experience.  The food we have was good, but a tad pricey for what it is, but still very affordable.  About $12-15 for a sandwich.  I had the tuna sandwich and salad, both were good.  The chili was very tasty, but a bit dry.  Overall, a nice place for lunch.
