Restaurant: Kamehachi
Category: Sushi Bars
Despite the international Kamehachi name, I feel other sushi spots in the city have done a better job of maintaining a contemporary look in their restaurants and on their plates.. . Kamehachi is great for a standard, average-yet-good experience. The most memorable dish I order every time is their steamed dumplings, the shumai appetizer. They have inspired me to start making them because I cannot get enough! I have been at this location a few times, because I live in the area and twice because of Groupons.. . It sometimes takes a while to get a table, but most nights are very low key and you'll have a lot of space to yourself. It just depends. Call ahead.. . As for their sushi, it has always been fair-to-good quailty, but nothing that I remember. My husband raves about the green turtle roll, while I typically go for one special roll and a few nigiri.. . No outright complaints, other than the decor feels outdated and cheap. They have beautiful custom wood panels in the stairwell and second floor walls, but they lined them with visible rope lighting.. . For the money, I have had stellar experiences at Mizu Sushi (right around the corner from Kamehachi on North Ave.) and Oysy. The decor and interesting special roll presentations delight me at those places.. . Now for a much less stellar review for the downtown Kamehachi.....heads up for this location, there is a HUGE difference between raw salmon and raw tuna. Please don't serve me a Philadelphia roll with tuna and try to convince me otherwise......
