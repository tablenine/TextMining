What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said... I will throw in my two cents into this restaurant as that is all I had left after eating here.  Took a friend from out of town, heard it was good, thought we would check it out.. . No parking anywhere, I just valeted as it was killing me to decipher the West LA street signs.  The wait took forever and it felt like a club in attitude and clientele.  I don't need to go to a restaurant to be seen.  The service was moderate and the food wasn't worth the wait.  I am a people watcher and that is the place to do it.  . . We left and chalked it up to experience and to be honest as I left the restaurant my memory of what I even ordered faded away... and that is never a good thing.
