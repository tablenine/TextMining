Mmmmm, thinking about the beer selection here brings a smile to my face.  I appreciate any place with a large selection of microbrews on tap.. . Not wanting to take up a booth as we weren't eating (although I've heard great things about the food!), my date and I sat at the large-ish, triangle-shaped, communal table in the center of the bar.  Service was great - I'd ordered our beers up at the bar and they came promptly.  Our server was easy to flag down whenever we needed anything else.. . Overall, a very laid-back place.  There were other couples on dates, large groups of friends enjoying dinner, and a couple sports fans up closer to the TVs.
