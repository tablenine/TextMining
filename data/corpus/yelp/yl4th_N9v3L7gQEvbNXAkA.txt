Good, good food.  Pretty spendy though.  The staff is always nice too.  A plain bagel with cream cheese will cost you $4.  You want a tomato on there?  $5.50.  And that's probably the cheapest thing on the menu.  . . Millman burger is good.  I really liked the duck too.  . . Nice to eat outside too.
