Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I'm definitely a huge fan of this restaurant. Prime location, prime meats, prime sauces, all around great experience when eating at Shabu Shabu house.. . The vegetables are fresh, the meat is at the point where it melts in your mouth. The prices are the only thing hindering me from eating here every week. The lines are long if you're trying to eat here during lunch or dinner time. When you do get in the place, you know they got the right combination of decor, raw meat, cultured service, and taste to make you come back. Man, I think I might go there tonight...
