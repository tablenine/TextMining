I have been here twice during the week.  Both times I have been seated right away and immediately brought coffee.  The service here is superior.  All of the staff are always on extremely helpful, sometimes a little too good.. . The food is amazing and very good.  I've had the blueberry pancakes and french toast.  The sassy eggs were def something not to miss.  The menu has most of your breakfast staples but everything does seem to have a unique flair to it and there is a lot to choose from.  Presentation of all the food coming out looked amazing.. . what i really like about this place is that its in a quiet neighborhood and feels very homey.  It is kind of small but thats not an issue.  The decor is modern but yet very comfortable.  I've read that the weekends have a long wait.  I can confirm that there is no wait midweek.  However most good brunch spots always have a wait.  Now if they could only get some outdoor seating.
