Awesome food and I was there for half-price wine night, so even tho I was eating alone it was cheaper to order a bottle and take home the left overs than order two glasses.  I dig that.  Anyway, both the soup and the pizza I ordered were daily specials, so I hope if I go back I get food as good.  The chicken tortilla soup with chunks of fresh avocado was amazing, as was the zucchini/sun dried tomato/pepper/goat cheese pizza.  YUM!!  Slow service at the end when I wanted my check and to get out, but I had the wine to keep me company.  I'll def return to try the brunch... :)
