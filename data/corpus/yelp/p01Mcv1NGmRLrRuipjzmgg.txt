We were lucky enough to not have one of those "New York attitude" waitresses I have heard about that are short and rude with their service.. . I had a pastrami sandwich... HUGE portion of meat and tasty too, probably one of the best I have had, outside of Carnigie deli in NYC.. . The potato latkes were very tasty and nice size portion also.. . We sat in the huge side dining room and were not rushed at all thru our lunch.. . My friend had the Matzo ball soup, the ball was huge, I am not a fan of this soup, but he said it was very good.. . This place is just fun to go to because it is a landmark and legend in LA.. . The bakery was hard to pass on the way out without getting some of their yummy looking cookies on the way out.
