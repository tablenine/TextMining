This beet-lover loved the roasted beet cubes with horseradish as antipasti. If you're into cauliflower, try the gratine which is done just right. . . Now the pizza. The crust is superb. Thin, tasty (on it's own), crispy with big air pockets (a good thing). We had the squash blossom with burrata cheese. A+. Then since they were out (wasn't on the menu that night) of the clam pizza which I was going to get, I opted for the fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions pizza. Excellent, though I sprinkled some crushed red pepper to kick it up a notch. For dessert, the butterscotch budino (pudding) was flavorful and rich. . . My only disappointments (which knocked off the 5th star) were the host/hostess and our server. For a pretty small (but packed) space, there is a host and a hostess at the door. They're not very friendly nor welcoming and not very pleasant when you're leaving, for that matter. I expected alittle smile either way...As for our server, she must've been trained by the same person who trained the host/hostess. Doing her job but not going out of her way to be friendly or terribly sociable. I always felt like apologizing when I had to ask her something. Maybe she just had a bad day?!!. . But all in all, I would definitely go back there again despite the wait, the unfriendly door reception and service bc I'll be going back for the food with no other expectations but great pizza! . . Oh and we spotted Sacha Baron Cohen and his wife with another couple having dinner.
