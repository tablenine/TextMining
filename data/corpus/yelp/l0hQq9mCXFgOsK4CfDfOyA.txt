Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Father's Office this, Father's Office that.  It's all I have been hearing from people in the know.  Tried it out.  Pretty dang good.  I am really into beet salad right now, so we got that.  Tasty!  The beets could use a little more vinegar or something though.  The walnuts and blue cheese did make it delicious.  Finished that baby off.  Next was the beef bone marrow.  It came out really cute looking, two big beef bones with a tiny spoon and small parsley/cilantro type salad with...capers!  I was disappointed in the beef bones though...there was no marrow!  It was all fat!  I was looking forward to the grainy/mushy marrow, but the bones only had a bunch of white fat.  I hope people don't think that is what marrow tastes like.  Too bad.  Main course was the Father's Office burger cooked medium.  It was pretty delicious and the fries were good too!  No ketchup in that place though.  Maybe because ketchup is the universal cheapener?  They gave us a garlic aoili dip.  It was good, but a little mayo bland.  It was worth a shot.  Cool atmosphere.  Lots of yuppies.. . I would give this place a 4.5 if there had been marrow in the bones.
