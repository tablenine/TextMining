I used to eat here once a week when working in the Union Sq. area. You can't go wrong with a pile-it-up-yourself salad bar. I ALWAYS get the salad box with nothing else (because I'm a cheapo), so I can just pile it on and not feel a bit shameful.. . The falafels are nice and crispy, even after sitting under a mountain of salad bar toppings. I usually pile on broccoli, cole slaw, cucumbers, red cabbage salad, tabbouleh and then drench it with garlic sauce+tomato and onion.. . Now if only the store front was larger, it always gets so crowded during lunch time. So if you're looking to get some bang for your buck, get the salad box and just pile it on!
