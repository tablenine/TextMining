+Seems pretty healthy for "fast food" -- though I don't think the mashed potatoes are that healthy. +/-Everything's farm grown...as opposed to being grown at the supermarket. +Why's the toast taste so good!?!. -The chicken soup is pretty tasteless. -The ordering process is really weird and unorganized -- you really need to focus and pay attention
