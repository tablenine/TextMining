The Moody Bleu Burger is way overrated.  It's one of those places where you're not sure if you should trust a medium-rare burger.  Trust that the bleu burger sucks.  I ate about half of it before the inch thick bleu cheese that was dominating the crappy meat started to make me nauseous.  I don't know where this burger reputation is coming from but it's overpriced, overrated and just plain awful.  They should have paid me to drive up to edgewater for a one window pub with crappy food.  If I ever suggested this to one of my friends I would expect nothing less than a swift quick in the genitals in return for wasting their time and money
