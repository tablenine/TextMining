Restaurant: Baraonda Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
Took my sister here for pre-Nutcracker afternoon show at the Fox. At first it looked like a chain restaurant but once we settled into two seats at the bar it started to grow on me. . Odd music but fabulous place to split a pizza and a salad. Everything was very fresh, cold when it should be cold, hot when it should be hot. Moretti on tap, skip the bloody mary.. Big windows to watch people freezing their behinds off, pushing through a windy day. . I'll definitely go back for the pizza on another day, no show at the Fox required.
