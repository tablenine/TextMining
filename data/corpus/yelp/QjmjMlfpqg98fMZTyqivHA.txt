We came here before a show at the Empty Bottle.  Thank you, Yelp, for once again helping me navigate an area I'm not that famililar with.. . First off, the place is small but friendly.  I don't want to know what this place is like during brunch.  Even though it was pretty packed, it wasn't loud or uncomfortable.. . The boy had the veggie burrito, which he said was pretty bland, but the salsa on the side was awesome.  I had a burger since I was being indecisive, but I got it with goat cheese.  I love goat cheese and I've never had it on a burger.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a nice combination, even though I would have liked my burger cooked for a teeny bit more (I ordered it medium-well and it was pink all the way through).. . Overall, will we be coming back?  Probably not, unless we're going to the Empty Bottle.
