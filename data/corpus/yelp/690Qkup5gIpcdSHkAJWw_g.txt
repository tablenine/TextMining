This is the type of place that you think to yourself this could be a great breakfast joint. Sadly after eating there I have  to say my opinion has swayed the other direction. The service was pretty bad, and that's maybe because the servers seemed like a group of self important hipsters. I mean when your at work you can at least pretend that you care about something other than trivial personal drama, and not ignore your customers. Also, I found the food to be haphhazard at best considering the price, roughly $10 for a Tuna Melt you gotta be kidding me. A lot  of the other items on the menu were equally overpriced and  unappealing. They seem to be a whitewashed hodgepodge of urban ethnic cuisine,  ranging from tacos to noodles. Trust me, I'd rather have the original stuff , rather than this safe bootleg version. Fred 62 gets my 2 stars only for its location,hours, and elements of the decor.
