Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
this place is so damn good, on the way to la we detour just to come here for dinner. the manuel special is by far the best deal you can get. it can easily feed four people! this place IS tiny, and you will be lucky not to wait a few minutes for a table. the staff is wonderful and really nice, and when you're all done and ready to go, they come by and offer you some candy. if that aint good customer service i don't know what is. although it is situated in a dodgy neighborhood, most of the time you won't run into much trouble. i have seen people of all races waiting outside and never once seen anything dangerous. this is definitely a plus, since i have seen a lot of tourists flock here for dinner and boyle heights has always been talked about as dangerous. you don't gotta trip when you're at el tepeyac :)
