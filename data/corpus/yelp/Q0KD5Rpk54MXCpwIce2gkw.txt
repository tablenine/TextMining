Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I must agree with some of the other reviewers, there are better Mexican spots in Chicago...I still love Uncle Julios! . . Never go on a Saturday night, it is always jam packed with at least a two hour wait...NO BUENO!!! But while you wait you can snack on some of the wonderful chips and salsa they put in front of you, I could eat baskets of them...or drink my favorite margarita swirl (a swirl of sangria), I love them! But by the time you have snacked on chip and had drinks for two hours, who needs to eat any real food, you are pretty much stuffed and wasted. But if you are anything like me, greedy that is, you will still go to the table and attempt to stuff some more food in your mouth. Most of my food ends up going home with me, but it is just as good the next day. . . I personally love the mix of different things, for example, tacos and quail...who would have thought that would be so good together. One of my favs. The portion sizes are great, I never leave without a doggie bag. And I love watching them cook the shells. . . I hate paying valet, hate waiting, but I can't stop going...damnit I love Uncle Julios!
