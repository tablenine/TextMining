Its 2 am on Saturday. The music has stopped and the lights turn on. At that moment I realize my feet hurt and I'm starving! The ghetto dogs smell good from a mile away but I've been eating ghetto dogs every weekend for the past five years. I really want to go to Hodori in Koreatown but its sooooo far. And I don't feel like waiting and spending more money at Kitchen 24. What am I going to do?. . Alas, my prayers have been answered. Pulled over on the street, I see a taco truck with a sign saying "Kogi." As I stumble over, I realize this is a Korean BBQ taco truck. Genius! I order two tacos, a korean short rib and spicy pork for $2 each. The tacos are topped with onion, salsa, and lettuce/cabbage that have been tossed in a Korean chili-soy vinaigrette. It also comes with a wedge of lime and orange. At first I just squeezed the lime on my taco and ate the orange separately which was good because who doesn't like oranges? Then for my second taco I squeezed both the lime and orange on to the spicy pork and it was even more delicious. Everything all together creates a great blend of salty, sweet and spicy.. . A Korean BBQ taco truck is such a great idea! It adds a new flavor to LA late night dining. You can find the truck at . http://kogibbq.com. . I can't wait to eat it again!
