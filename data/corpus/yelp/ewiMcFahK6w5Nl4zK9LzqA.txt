Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Joined several friends for happy hour. They had already gone through several small bites, or 'edibles' as Ugo called it, when I got there. But one of my friend's ordered a linguini vogole with clams and lemon pesto after I sat down -- and it was so FAR from edible, we sent it back. The dish smelled like Lysol lemon from the other end of the long table, outside on the patio.. . I ordered goat cheese-filled zuchinni flowers, which were so overpowered by the cheese, I couldn't finish it. Also shared a salad with grilled shrimp, which was decent, even though it was awash in a slightly lemon (again!) dressing when I had asked for it on the side. By that point though, you've already given up on the restaurant, and just eat it, as you will. . . Everyone shared a peanut butter chocolate bar. The chocolate on top was a half-inch crust, it took two forks to break it, which inevitably squeezes the peanut butter mousse out from under it. FAIL. . . I do have to say, the drinks were good, and the prices are very reasonable.
