Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
Good Tapas. I am craving their sweet potato fries with aioli really badly! Everything we ordered was delicious. Including the Albondigas ( meat balls?) and Bacalao (cod cakes). Don't get me started on the churros with hot fudge! Each thing on the menu is a unique delicious creation. After writing this, I have decided I'm going this week for certain! Great restaurant for a double date. Cons- no cocktails, no full bar.
