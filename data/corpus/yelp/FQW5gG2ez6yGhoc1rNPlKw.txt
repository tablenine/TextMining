Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go for a late brunch. Thoroughly enjoyed my Toscana scramble - pesto &amp; mozzarella in my eggs? Yes please. The staff was very friendly and the clientele was very good-looking. I'll be back for sure. Great brunch spot. The wait to get in was about 20 minutes, and this was on a cloudy day at 1:30pm...so I would imagine it's pretty packed on a typical sunny LA morning.
