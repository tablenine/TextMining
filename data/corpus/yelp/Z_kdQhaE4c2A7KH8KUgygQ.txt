Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
They do a good job of catering to 100+.  Beef gyros, beef and chicken kebabs, pita, spanakopitas, and dolmades (grape-leaf and rice) arrived on time and tasted pretty good.  Baklava are delicious and flakey but in general are reallllly oily.. . i've seen Papa Cristos come out of his store once...he is a cute little man!
