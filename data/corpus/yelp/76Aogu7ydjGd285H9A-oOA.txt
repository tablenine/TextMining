Oh Oinkster. Tsk tsk. What should've been a culinary Disney World, turned out to be a half inflated Bouncy Castle in a hornet infested Ranch 88 parking lot. Here are the low-lights:. -The Pulled Pork sandwich had the consistency and flavor of a boiled, shredded newspaper. The BBQ sauce was 1 part vinegar, 2 parts Robitussin.. -The Pastrami smelled like the tire department at Sears. My girlfriend took one bite, put the sandwich down and said "No." She then called the women's outreach center for counseling.. - The buns were incredibly soggy. Upon taking a bite, they fell apart like a North Korean missile launch.. - The "Belgian" fries had all the flavor of packing foam. Perfect for returning that Blu-Ray copy of Transformers 2 your mom got you for Christmas because she still thinks you're twelve.. . So, the next time you want to spend $34 to feel queasy and disappointed, go see "Paranormal Activities" 3 times.. . (So as not to be all hating, the staff were nice and the outdoor patio was a pleasant hang.)
