Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Since I work for a PR company, the obvious thing when going to a new restaurant is to discuss what their slogan would be.. . At the Apple Pan, it's "Right away."  And they mean it.. . You order when he hits the counter and says 'Ready."  If you don't respond, he walks away.  You gotta know what you want.  How many fries?  Which burger?  Cheese?  Coke?  If you ask for something, the immediate response is "Right away."  He drops it off and leaves you quickly.. . Lunch for 5 co-workers = 20 minutes in and out.  And that was eating IN.  Brilliant.
