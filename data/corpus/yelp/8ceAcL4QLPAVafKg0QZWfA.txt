I headed to Devon Seafood Grill for a light lunch.  I know they serve primarily seafood but I didn't feel up to a large meal so I opted for two smaller dishes instead.  I ordered the clam chowder and mozzarella salad.. . The soup was creamy, thick, and very delicious.  Piping hot, it went well with the biscuit the server placed on the table earlier.  I also enjoyed the salad.  The hierloom tomatoes worked well with the light balsamic vinegar.. . However, for $25, I'll definitely be heading elsewhere.
