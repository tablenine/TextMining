It did its job. Good portions, comfort food, but not really that memorable in terms of dishes.  I only say that because it was not very creative in terms of ingredients but food was tasty/delicious.  The ambience was great.  Very appropriate for a business mtg.  A good date spot if you want a quiet place to talk.
