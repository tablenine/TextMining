I usually don't go to places like this. It's like a Cha for Tea, but hey, I came here with my buddy Adam and his mother. I can't complain, just that it was small and I felt packed in. The food was okay, what can I be so wow about with simple dishes. The shaved Ice was pretty okay, not my taste. I find it a bit pricey for what it's worth. I am rusty with cantonese already everyone in here speaks Mandarin... I anit hating but I don't want to be pointing at the menu and feeling like a loser cause I can't speak my own native langauge =( I should of studied harder in chinese school. lol Back to studying. I give this place a 3 stars for just a plain experence.
