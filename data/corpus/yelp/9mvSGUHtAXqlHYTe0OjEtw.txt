Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Finally was able to come here for lunch since MK from out of town was IN town and was up for whatever for lunch. Yay.. . We met on 1st and Harper, where I like to park (don't hog up my free spots!), since everywhere else is metered or permitted. Be careful where you park on 1st though, since almost every other block or so is permit-only. Read the lengthy signs thoroughly.. . With that said, we moseyed over to Joan's and at noon on a Friday, it wasn't crowded at all. I ordered up a tomato basil soup with the tarragon chicken salad sandwich, chased by an iced mocha. MK had the arugula and spinach salad with ice tea.. . We found a seat inside alongside the left side of the restaurant, next to the deli area where you could mix and match salad stuff, and food came out relatively quickly. It was nice and bright inside and the staff came by a couple of times to bring us water and bread, and to refill drinks. The food was awesome, and my sandwich was definitely big enough to fill me up, even if I hadn't gotten the bowl of soup.. . As we were eating, the lines were definitely building, running the length of the room. Can't wait to go back and try all the other soups and salads.. . Four stars just because when you go in, you really don't know where to go. They should put up a menu so that you see it right when you walk in. If you didn't know any better, you wouldn't know to go to the left side of the room to look at the full menu.
