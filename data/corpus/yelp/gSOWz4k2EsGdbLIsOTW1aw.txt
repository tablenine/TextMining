This was my first experience as far as ramen houses go. and i must say it was very enjoyable. . . Came here again with my bff after some morning sample sale shopping, of which we found some amazing finds, but anyways... she had told me about this place before but had never had the chance to come and check it out, but this day .. we did. Walked over to the little shop to find it overflowing with people out onto the street ona rainy saturday afternoon.... my first thought  was this place must be pretty amazing for people to risk getting sick over it.  Luckily we walked in to sign the wait sheet and snagged a couple chairs inside to wait. . . This place was very small with only a couple booths to sit at and a couple stools at their bar area.  Appeared very cozy and smelled absolutely heavenly..... the wait itself wasn't that bad at all, and we were seated at a booth near the back and ordered immediately.  to my pleasant surprise..... this place was super cheap! =) and the food size was HUGE! I'm used to ur microwavable Maruchan from the store as ramen... this was a totally different animal...... . . so i ordered their Daikoku raumen combo... which comes with a small salad and choice of small rice dish from fried rice to tuna sashimi... i got the chicken teriyaki... was feeling simple that day.  Oh Lord was this meal insane..... i barely got thru half of my raumen and didnt even touch the chicken teriyaki... and it wasn't cuz it didnt taste good ... it was the complete opposite, everything was NUM NOM NUMMY GOOD! and did i said the raumen was a big serving.... thats an understatement. all this amazing food along with free refill soda .... $13.00 ..... thats a bit rediculous in my book.. i ate the rest of my soup for dinner and had the teriyaki the next day.... 3 meals for $13.00!?!??! that i say is a S W E E T deal!  . . go forth and enjoy the noodle!
