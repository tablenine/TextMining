Like most places with sub-10 entrees Fat Cat is nothing haute, nothing too special. But let me tell you what you get for that small price to pay.. . I ordered the tuna melt and a miller lite and sampled the buffalo wings and hummus from friends. As mentioned before, nothing too spectacular. . . But the fries oh the fries; I'm not sure how they were prepared but they were delicious. It tasted like they were either fried in a different type of oil or made of sweet potatoes. And the spicy vinegar that came with: yummy touch despite being rank. Just be careful to pour it slowly out of the bottles they give ya (it's fast!). . Ok, and now why I gave the 4. Our waitress was stunning. Cute, yes, but I mean stunning service. It had been beyond memory since I had experienced such a stellar combination of friendliness and willingness. She never said no and always found a way to fulfill our weird but simple requests (few extra fries for the table, coffee at the end, etc).. . I think her name was Kim, at least that's what the receipt said. Ask for her. You won't be disappointed. Then tip her well!
