Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
They've certainly got the flying party right - the service was extremely fast. A great spot to grab lunch with a co-worker - without that hoity-toity feel of some other Buckhead eateries.. . The biscuits were flaky and fluffy, and the apple spread is quite tasty. My omelet was cooked to perfection, and the grits were nice and creamy - none of that lumpy bottom-of-the-bowl stuff.
