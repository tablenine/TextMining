Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
While the tables could afford to be bigger for the amount of food we wanted to get, that would mean the restaurant wouldn't afford the seating capacity of all the people who want to eat here. . Well, as everyone knows it's byob at Cobras, my friend was a little overly enthusiastic about the prospect and brought three bottles of Spanish wines that he said we had to finish, which he kind of did on his own. . That said, the food was pretty fantastic and not at all what I was expecting from a tapas place. The beet salad was amazing, the bacon wrapped dates were definitely something new and rewarding, and the mussels were succulent in the wine sauce, which I soaked my break into and thoroughly polished off. . Great first date spot~ loud enough where you won't feel all awkward and weird :)
