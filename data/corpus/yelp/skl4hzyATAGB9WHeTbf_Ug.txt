Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
this is by far the best Korean bbq I've ever had. $16.99 for a BUNCH of side dishes and the tastiest meat ever. Seeing birthday boys/girls get sprayed with champagne is the best part haha. my only complaint is that it takes a while for the servers to fulfill your request for more side dishes, but they are super duper nice when they come back to you. it's a party atmosphere. one of my friends said that she didn't know whether to drink or dance haha. i totally love this place!
