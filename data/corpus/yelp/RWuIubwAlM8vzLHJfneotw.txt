This place is overrated. I may be biased because I don't like waffles or syrup, but the chicken is not all that either. As a matter of fact, I'd rather have the chicken at KFC, Popeye's, or Church's. This place does have a nice atmosphere though and it still is a fun place to take out of town guests.
