Even though I've never eaten here I've spent many nights in the Lounge area taking in the scenery and the Music.  I was severely disappointed however when I went a couple of weeks ago and found that the DJ had Changed.  I love going in there and Talking With the bartenders who always seem to mix my drink just strong enough that I think they're trying to do my boyfriend a favor ;)  Brian is great an conversation and is always a pleasure, and Steven's magic tricks keep many patrons entertained for hours.  However the change in the style of music has changed the vibe and made it hard to go and hang out to have a conversation.  I miss the nice mellow trip hop jazz vibe that used to be there
