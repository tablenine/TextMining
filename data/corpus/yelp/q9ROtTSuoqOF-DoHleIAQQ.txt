I grew up getting bday cakes from Portos.... What can I say? Momma's always had good taste and she passed that good taste on to me =)!!! I remember being 5 and 6 and being soooo excited for a trip to Portos... Aside, from their delicious cakes, they also have great baked goods... My faves:. . Refugiado: guava &amp; cheese pastry (POSSIBLY MY FAVORITE DESSERT IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.... IF NOT THAT, DEFINITELY TOP 5)... I could eat a half dozen in one sitting!!!!. Cheese Roll: cheese filled pastry. Potato Ball: stuffed potato. . I am also partial to their sandwich Cubano (the best in LA for sure), Media Noche and their Ropa Vieja dinner plate... But really, you can't go wrong with anything you order here... It IS Porto's ;)!!!!. . Porto's is a testament to the fact that you can BLOW UP, be uber successful, and still serve quality food and pastries at great prices... (hint, hint: Versailles!!!)..... ta ta!
