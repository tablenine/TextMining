Marvelous place!. . This restaurant has some of the most tender pastrami ever. It's not piled on like a shredded bunch of meat scraps; it's actually sliced like pretty pieces of bacon. And it's pretty lean. . . My group of 4 ordered the pastrami platter, which serves 2-3 people (though we think it could serve 4 moderate eaters) and a brisket sandwich. The brisket was aiiight, but the pastrami plattter.... MMMMMMMMMMM!! My friends could not stop raving about it. We had the fries and the cole slaw on the side, both of which were SUPER GOOD (we dipped the fries in the au jus from the brisket)!! If you do get the fries, don't forget to add the CHILI CHEESE!! Also, I don't normally like coleslaw, but this one was delicious. And it came with warm rye bread, small sweet pickles and large crispy pickles, and a big ball of chopped liver. For a person who doesn't like ANYTHING liver, this chopped liver wasn't bad (though I still don't fancy it since it's liver). The pastrami seemed endless, but the 4 of us were able to finish it happily. . . Last, but not least, one would expect a diner-like place to have so-so service. This place had the warmest, friendliest servers and hosts I've ever had in a diner. We were greeted and served with a smile from beginning to end. =). . Parking is on the diagonal block east of the restaurant on 7th. It's $2, I think. . . Yum, yum, yum! You will not regret coming here.
