Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
This place is seriously not a first date place.  Unless your date has a bib fetish or is totally cool with watching you suck out shrimp brains and dribble bright orange juices all over yourself.  Plus, you WILL smell like garlic for the rest of the day, no foolin'.  . . That being said, this is a GREAT place to eat so much cholesterol that you probably just knocked a good 4 years off your lifespan.  Delicious shrimp, crab legs, lobster, crayfish, you name it; all drenched in butter, garlic, and magical cajun spices that are so worth the imminent heart attack.  Really good sweet potato and cajun fries, and the corn on the cob is freakin delicious too (they cook it right in the sauce).. . TIPS:  Wear really ratty/old clothes, and shelve your pride and wear the damn bib.  Girls (or guys) with long hair will probably want to tie it up.  Tear out at least 3 sheets of paper towels per person BEFORE you start eating (trust me).  Go for the whole shabang sauce for the authentic Boiling Crab experience, unless you are a vampire and hate garlic.  Mild is relatively spicy IMO, medium makes my lips start burning after the third shrimp.  Drink refills are free so don't be afraid to ask for 3rds to wash down all that sweet, sweet butter.  Enjoy!
