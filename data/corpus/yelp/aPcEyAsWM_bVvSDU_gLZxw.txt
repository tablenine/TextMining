Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
The Pick Me Up Cafe... what is there to say. . . This is a very good place to go if you are looking for food for everyone. I don't eat meat and I love it here. The look of the place itself is amazing with so much color. Sometimes the service can be slow, but that is because they only have one person in the kitchen doing everything.. . Always enjoy what they have on the menu and when it gets cold again make sure you try the soup, it comes with great fresh bread.
