Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Went to Manuel's yesterday for a group function, which is a specialty at Manuel's. They have a large group room with a false wall that opens up for even more space. . . The beer is decently priced, and if you are the broke side they have Miller High Life and Natural Lite at under $3 a beer. Roughly 10-15 beers on tap. . . I had the hot wings and was pleased. They weren't huge but they were fried well enough...I can't stand a soggy chewy wing. I like em deep fried. . . Overall a good place to go for food, beer, sports watching, or any group function, small or large.
