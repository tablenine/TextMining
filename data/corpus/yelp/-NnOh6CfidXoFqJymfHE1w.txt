Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I've been here over 100 times (literally) and it never fails to deliver. You come here for one thing and one thing only: The Prime Rib. The side dishes are fantastic as well but the prime rib is where it's at.. . Don't even bother with the other entrees like the fish and the lobster, totally not worth it and really sub-par compared to everything else.. . With your prime rib, make sure you order the creamed corn and creamed spinach (or a double order of whichever you prefer), and to keep asking for the Yorkshire pudding if you run out (it's free and there's no limit). Their spinning bowl salad is included and I still think the croutons they use are some of the best I've ever had.. . For dessert I usually go with the Creme Brulee but their sundae is pretty decent as well.. . This place is very consistent and I've never been let down after a meal. Highly recommended if you've never been.
