Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I understand that there are many variations on the same kind of food, especially when it comes to Chinese food where every region has its own take on something.  How Din Tai Fung makes their dumpling is totally not my style.  Their dumpling skins are rolled super thin to be able to get a bunch of intricate tiny folds when they assemble the dumplings.  This also makes for a dryer tasting skin that feels almost paper like.. . I've had people tell me there's some Japanese influence and others saying that the Southern regions of China also have something similar.  Eh, okay.  I can accept there are places that like their dumplings like this, but I'm definitely more fond of the Northern Chinese style dumplings with a good bite and chew to the skin, and juicy flavorful filling.  Din Tai Fung, to me, is more bland and dry.. . For those who didn't find Din Tai Fung up to their taste, I recommend checking out  Dumpling 10053 (aka Yuan Bao) on Valley Blvd.  Their boiled shrimp dumplings are the best, and I love their spicy bean sauce.
