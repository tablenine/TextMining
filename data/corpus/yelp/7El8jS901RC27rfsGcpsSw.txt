Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
After mentioning Spacca Napoli as a reliable pizza source to a friend, I thought, "Hey! That's very unYelply of me. I haven't even tried it yet!" So to Italia we go.. . A little bit off the beaten path, parking is ample in warehouseville, and we parked right in front. Spacca Napoli is very clean, looks new, nearly spotless. The menu isn't huge--it's pizze, pizze, pizze! The list is divided into red pizza (with their italiano version of good ol' marinara) and white (no sauce). I don't know how to explain our waiter's demeanor, but considering the menu was mostly in Italian, I needed further explanation and recommendation--I felt slightly rushed by him to make a decision. I chose the Salsiccia e Broccoletti, with Italian sausage, rapini, mozzarella, and olive oil, my date chose the Diavola (itza pepperoni!).. . So I chose the wrong pizza. I should have had the Diavola, which was delightfully spicy. Mine tasted like the soup I ordered--the special Carozza soup--and while that was fine, it wasn't for me. All the ingredients were delicious and fresh, yet the flavor combo just didn't hit my palate right--maybe I'm a sauce girl? The crust? A little too burnt around the edges for me. . . I kind of feel like this place is trying too hard--I know you're trying to be authentic, you win awards, blah blah blah. But serving Coke and Diet Coke in mini European-style bottles at 2 bucks a pop with no refills? That's just shameless.. . Decent, but not totally impressed. Impress me.
