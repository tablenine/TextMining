To be honest, I don't know what the big hoot is about this place. I think what is appealing is its refreshing, upbeat ambiance (always crowded, energetic line of people preparing salads before you as you watch) and that it specializes in some pretty fresh food.... . There are some definite perks to be sure:. . 1. Really really fresh greens -- we're talking farmer's-market-fresh.. 2. Generous piles of grilled chicken, steak, even Ahi tuna.. 3. Fast, friendly service. 4. Good tomato soup. . . Drawbacks:. . 1. Expensive -- you WILL pay for freshness, which makes you wonder if you can just make a cheaper, equally fresh salad at home..  2. The Ahi tuna the day I had it was not very fresh and smelled spoiled.. . In the end, it's just a salad. Not a big deal but a nice place to go to for lunch if you're in the neighborhood or if you want a quick bite before watching a movie at the theater across the street.
