Restaurant: Panes Bread Cafe
Category: Sandwiches
Big fan of Panes Bread Cafe! Walked by it so many times since I lived down the street.. finally gave it a shot one day with a friend and sure happy I did. He got the goat cheese pizza and I had some kind of a veggie sandwich with hummus on their asiago roll, I believe. Absolutely killer. We also tried the tomato bisque soup which was incredible. I've been back a few times to pick up bread for dinner. It's not really a place you go to eat out at, more like stopping by for a snack or quick lunch. They have many desserts and cookies to choose from. Definitely recommended if you are in the neighborhood.
