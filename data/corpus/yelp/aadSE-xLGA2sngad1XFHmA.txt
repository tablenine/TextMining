So I've lived by this place for over a year and a half..and I FINALLY went!  I bought a groupon for Coobah a while back and just never had the chance to use it.  I had a good friend in town, and we were looking for something around my area with good drinks.  I took a gamble and made a reservation at Coobah (getting one the day of was no problem).  My friend and I ended up chatting for what was probably half an hour before we even looked at the menu!  But the server was still very attentive to us and gave us great suggestions when we were ready to talk food.  . . We ended up just getting a bunch of appetizers and salads: got the sea scallops, calamari and an appetizer special they were having (mussels)......OMG all were AMAZING!  Especially the calamari..even my friend said that this was quite possibly the best calamari he had ever had.  . . Now if we're talking entrees, I really have no input..but I loved the appetizers and service!
