HUGE inside.. fun for private parties.. they have Hoegarden on tap, which is always a plus.. . The food is good.. regular american bar food.. I really like their Hotdogs and their wings.. really can't beat it with beer.. . . also..its on a corner, so if you drink too much *ech em Â Aidan*, you can go around the corner, throw up.. then keep drinking.
