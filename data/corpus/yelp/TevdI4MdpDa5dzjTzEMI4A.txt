3.5 stars. . Please come here with one thing in mind...MEAT and lots of it!. We came here for dineLA and I must say, I left wishing I came home to a stairmaster.. That night, there were 15 variety of meats being hauled around the dining room. I swear waiters holding thick slabs of meet never stopped coming to our table (maybe it was the fact that we forgot to turn or little coaster from green to red because we were overwhelmed with the men and their meat sticks) I lost count after 7 types when everything started to taste about the same.. The picanha, top sirloin, and cordeiro were some of my faves.. The costela de porco and chicken were dry and the brisket was salty.. The salad bar was my savior. After awhile, I needed something green and refreshing to cleanse my palate. . The sides never stopped coming. The plantains were a little dry, the mash was pretty good, and the cheese balls were doughy on the inside. Everyone raves about the cheese balls, I still don't know if I like the taste of it. . The dessert was fabulous! Papaya is an acquire taste. Some of my friends did not like the papaya cream but I actually thought it was pretty damn awesome. It's basically papaya/vanilla ice cream. If you don't like papaya, I suggest you do not get this. The flan was equally awesome. It wasn't 'eggy' and it was thick and perfectly favored. . The service was definitely awesome. The staff catered to our every request and kept everything re-filled. Our server, Erin totally rock!
