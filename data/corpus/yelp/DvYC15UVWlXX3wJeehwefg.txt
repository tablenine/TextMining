Ok, went here Saturday after some friends of mine claimed they were "addicted"...To make a long story short this place has the best sushi that I've had in LA. I love that most of their menu are house specials meaning you can order things that are not the standard sushi items. Definately try the crispy rice w/spicy tuna and the rock shrimp. Took a star off though because the waitress overcharged us and we had to wait over an hour and a half (we were 6 though). Definately going back
