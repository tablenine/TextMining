I haven't been to Sal e Carvao yet, but from my experience both at Fogo De Chao and Brazzaz, I can definitely say I enjoyed Brazzaz the most. The choices they offer are more extensive than Fogo, allowing for some seafood as well as the roasted pineapples, and the a la carte lobster tail is fantastic. They have the same cheese rolls and other appetizers, but the service here is much more friendly and expedient. The decor is also much more modern and upscale than Fogo. If you haven't been to either, go with Brazzaz.
