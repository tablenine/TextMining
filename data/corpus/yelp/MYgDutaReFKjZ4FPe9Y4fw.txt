Since I work in Roswell, I don't get to try all these wonderful places that I read about very often.  So I took a half day from work to allow plenty of time to eat at Noni's before heading to the airport for Thanksgiving.  Noni's was definitely worth it.. . Jimmy and I even managed to get a parking space in the small lot in the back, and nothing puts you in a better mood than rockstar parking.  Except maybe friendly and immediate service.  We sat at the bar on the elevated part - gave the place a fun, homey vibe - like those old school split level houses with sunken living rooms.  The service was laid back, as if you were going to a friends house, and they were just whipping something up in the kitchen.  . . I looked at the menu, but I already knew that I was getting the Spinozzi.  I don't like chicken salad most of the time, but this was excellent - lots of flavor and not from extra mayonnaise.  Jimmy got the meatball sub upon my recommendation, and we split both sandwiches, so we both got to try all the goodness.  He got the side salad, I got the fries.  Everything was delicious.  But vampires beware, because as Deanna said, you will be tasting garlic for two days.  I love garlic, so I loved the flavor of the croutons on the salad and those parmesan-parsley-garlic fries.  But the meatball sub and the spinozzi both had enough flavor to hold their own against the potent spuds.. . Wishing I worked downtown, but realizing it's probably better for my breath and my thighs to only dream of those fries instead of eating them...
