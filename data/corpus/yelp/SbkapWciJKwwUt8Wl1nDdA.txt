Fish Tacos were good.  It draws a clean crowd, but the place is a bit small to draw any decent sized crowd.  At best, I'd say this place is best for a late night bite to eat just before you head home from a night of drinking in the Virginia Highlands.  I'm quite the tougher review though mates :). .
