Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I would have given this place 4 stars but for the service.  The food was good.  Admittedly, I am not Jonathan Gold.  I like good food but I am not upset when I get less than excellent food. To my novice palate the food here was quite good.  . . The service, however, eh.  We came here for an early dinner with our dog.  The hostess was great.  She seated us immediately and even brought our dog a bowl of water. . . However, our waiter was..uh..distracted.  Took forever at every step. . . Most annoying, we finished quickly to get out of the restaurant before rush hour so our dog would not bother anyone.  He brought us our check and we waited forever for him to bring our credit card slip.  On top of that, when he brought our check he took our leftovers to be packed.  Our credit card slip came and went and we waited 15 minutes at least and then politely reminded him.  He tried to blame the kitchen but we are not blind.  He was distracted by his conversation with his co-workers.
