Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
good ol Korean bbq i tried to come here any chance i get a friend of mine introduced me to this place and i cant live without it! i love coming here early for lunch because it is most definitely less crowded, plus the waitress are nicer when its not busy ... bbq beef is soo delicious they marinated the beef to perfection, bbq shortribs are yummy too eat it with rice and those yuummy sides.... im starving now.
