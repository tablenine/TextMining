Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Fat Matt's is a great place.  The ribs are tasty, good sauce, and the sides are pretty good as well.  I'd shy away from the pulled pork - it's okay, nothing to write home about.  If you're in the mood for pulled pork there are many better places to go.  The baked beans are really tasty, the potato salad is good, and I like the inclusion of white bread to sop up the extra sauce that you might have.  In fact, I just use the bread as a vehicle to put more sauce into my mouth.. . Coming here on a weekend night is a lot of fun just to listen to the blues band.  I'd definitely recommend doing so at least once, even though it's difficult to get seating on blues night.  . . Really fun place to go with a couple of good friends when you have a lazy afternoon to just kick back, relax, and laugh at each other when you're all covered in barbecue sauce.
