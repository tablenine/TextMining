My first visit was this past Sat. night with a girlfriend. It was nice enough to sit outside, but the atmosphere inside was appealing enough to sway our vote. It was not that busy...about 7:00, there appeared to be a lot of visitors dining here.... Our server was great, very friendly, all of the waitstaff was very attentive as far as filling wine glass, water, dirty plates, etc... We had a bottle of wine and started with the egg rolls, which were good, I had the kung pao chicken and my girlfriend had the special, striped bass. Mine was ok, it was good....but for $19, ahhh I'm going to say I could of ordered in at the local place for less than half that, my girlfriends bass was AMAZING!!! so maybe I was just jealous that I didn't order that. I would go again, maybe a weekday vs. a weekend. Let me visit again...maybe I'll try the special and hopefully change my rating.
