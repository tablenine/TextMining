Waited 2 hours on Mother's Day to get seated.  The willingness to wait by so many groups tells you how good this place is.  We tried the crab instead of the lobster this time and it had the same flavor as the lobster.  The preparation was very good.  The favorite among the kids was the pan fried noodles.  I'd like to come back soon.
