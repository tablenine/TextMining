The simplicity of this place is the key to why I like it so much.. Meat, bread dipped in brown goodness (everyone knows that brown is the best flavor of them all) and a small dollop of spicy mustard. No fancy green bits or garnish....just the basics.. . The pork and beef both go amazingly well with a tall glass of Stella Artois.. If only I lived a smidge closer and was less lazy I would be there more often.
