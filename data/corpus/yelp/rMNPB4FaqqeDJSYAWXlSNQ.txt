Cheap food, cheap beer and cheap (but weak) shots is a nice option. You cant wear hats inside which is kinda dumb for a run of the mill sports bar but whatever. The outdoor spot is nice if you can get it n the summers but closes early. I'll hit this place every once in a while. Scene is average at best but to be expected.
