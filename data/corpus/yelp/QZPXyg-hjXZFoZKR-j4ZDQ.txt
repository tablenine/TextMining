Best sausages in LA. For all you sausage lovers you've got to try this industrial little venue on the outskirts of Little Tokyo.   . . There's something for everyone here, conservative eaters as well as the adventurous. I've tried the rattle snake sausage (fabulous, juicy tender...MUST try) as well as rabbit, and mango jalapeno chicken. The sausages come with your choice of onions, peppers, sauerkraut and sweet peppers.  . . The drink menu is also another plus, they've got an assortment of beers to wash down those tasty sausages with. And don't forget your order of fries and choice of flavored dipping sauces to finish it off. Also if you need a little extra flair or are feeling a bit bougy, add some truffle oil to your fries. However, they're also delicious on their own - NOM NOM NOM!
