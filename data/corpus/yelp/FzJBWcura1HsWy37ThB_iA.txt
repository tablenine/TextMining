Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I like that milk is around to offer a break from the usual dessert joints.  I also like that they make their own ice cream sandwiches, cookies, and king cones or whatever they're called.  I also like that the size of the cones are so big that it's truly hard to finish one.  I haven't ventured too far into their ice cream department, however I did make an amazing discovery last time I was there.  Chocolate pudding!  Holy moly it's so thick and chocolaty it's almost like eating frosting!  But you know, in the best way possible.  Plus because it's so rich it lasts you a couple servings.  I also picked up an ooey goey cookie while I was there and it was delicious, but so tiny!  Two bites for over a dollar?  Really?  Isn't it a recession?  Three stars because it is what it is, but I promise them an extra one if they reasonably price their cookies!
