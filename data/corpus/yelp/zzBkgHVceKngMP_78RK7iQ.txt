Five words- Mac Daddy and Cheese Balls. Yummy yummy yummy. Who wouldn't like fried mac and cheese? Well that is just a small sample of the delicious things that Fred 62 has to offer. Delicious breakfast dishes, I personally love the Bearded Mr. Frenchy which is crunchy french toast. Great noodle bowls, sandwiches, salads and specialties. Their desserts are great, I have a thing for the apple punk tarts. . . This is one of my all time favorite late night dining restaurants in LA. The prices, while odd are actually pretty reasonable, the service is pretty good, and though there is often a wait for a table, they usually try their best to get you in ASAP. If you want some comfort food that thinks out of the box, come to Fred 62, you will be happily satisfied.
