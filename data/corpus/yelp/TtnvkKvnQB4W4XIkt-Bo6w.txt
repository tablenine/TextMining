Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
So me and my family wanted to see what's all the hype in this japanese restaurant, that we saw on Man vs. Food of course. I thought it was going to be like foo foo tei except only better...hell no! . . It took us quite awhile to find this hidden spot. When we did, we went up to the third floor and the waiters greeted us, so that was nice. . . I ordered the special #2 of course just so I can leave my mark on the famous wall that lots have tried to be on. When our special #2 came, my brother and I dugged into it while the others dugged into their wussy #6 ramen. My first thought was "when did the japanese started to use jalapenos in their dishes???" For a moment I thought I was at Albertos. . . Anywayz, the soup tasted like hot water mixed with korean pack of noodles seasoning. I ordered the miso soup and well I got korean soup??? I took three bites of the noodles and it was the same texture as the chinese fried chow mein. After the three bites, all the noodles and bean sprouts and meat was gone from my plate. The portions of the noodles and other crap was the portion of half a fist full. The soup on the other hand was humongous! So there's an unbalance there for sure. After 5 mins into eating the bowl of hell, I wanted to faint! My mouth was so numb that I couldn't feel my lips all the way to my esophagus. . . I had to run to the market across the way to get some milk. When I went back, surprisingly my brother was 90% done with his bowl! Well he finished it in 23 mins but it came with a price. He totally threw up and was kind of crying a little. Well at least one of us got their picture on the wall! . . We vowed to never ever go there ever again.
