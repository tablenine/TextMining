Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Really solid food with fun atmosphere. Don't go here if you're looking for a mellow night out. The mood is lively and a bit frantic. Not much in decor, but the Thai Elvis makes up that. The food isn't to-die-for all-around very good. Try the crispy fish, silver noodles, and red curries.
