Restaurant: Carroll Street Café
Category: Bars
Great.. . I love most things about Carroll Street Cafe: the neighborhood, the decor, the food (of course), the wine menu, and yes, the desserts.  . . My only complaint was that service is slow during the lunch rush (excessively slow).  Lots of options, even for the picky eater.. . If you're in the area, stop for food!
