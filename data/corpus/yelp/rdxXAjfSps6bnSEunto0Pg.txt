This being my first place i had dinner after moving to Chicago, I was impressed. We had made reservations, but when we got there it wasn't packed, which meant no issues with timing. Our waiter was so attentive the entire night and nice. I had Lamb Shank, which was amazing. Right size proportion, well done and the chef even came to our table to ask us how we were enjoying our food and suggestions on what wine would go with all three courses. Over all great experience, beautiful atmosphere, fine dinning for sure!
