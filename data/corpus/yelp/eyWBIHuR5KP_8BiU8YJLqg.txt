Went here today for lunch. Ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with cheddar and it arrived 30 (not an exaggeration) minutes later. Not one word from the waiter in the meantime. No offer to refill drinks, no apology for keeping us waiting for the same amount of time it would take to cook a whole friggin' chicken. And when it did arrive, it was a joke of a grilled cheese sandwich on dry bread with motherf**king American cheese. I'd have sent it back for cheddar, but I didn't have another 20 minutes to blow. Never again.
