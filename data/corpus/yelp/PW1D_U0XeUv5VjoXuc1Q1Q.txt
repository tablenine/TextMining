Category: Pubs
The personal attention you get at this place makes it pretty wonderful.. . There are 2 parts to The Glenwood -- a pub side and a wine bar side.  I've been to the wine bar side twice, and was delighted both times.  The food menu has some gems on it that will bring me back; the tur-duck-en burger for one.. . Check this place out.  You're likely to make a friend while your there.
