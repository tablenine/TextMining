Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I like Apple Pan .. it's sort of a kitschy thing to experience ... good burgers ... but I'm not sure it's worth the standing and hovering over another patron to get their seat ... I'd rather go to In-n-Out ...I'm also not sure why everyone's so crazy about the banana cream pie - I've tried it twice and it's just ok...
