Restaurant: Nakato
Category: Japanese
I dined at Nakato for the first time tonight.  It was an amazing dinner.  The sashimi was "spot on." The entrees were also on point.  . . I recommend the yellowtail cheek fried and served with ponzu sauce and the black cod marinated in sake and chargrilled to perfection.. . Finish the meal with green tea creme boule. very smooth and creamy.. . The ambiance of the place is a bit "retro" for me.  The place needs a facelift into the 21st century.  . . FYI, Nakato exclusively caters all Delta flights to Japan DAILY!!! isn't that awesome!
