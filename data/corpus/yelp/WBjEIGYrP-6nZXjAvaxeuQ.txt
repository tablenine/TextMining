Went back in December on a Sunday around 2pm...lots of tables available...great burger and sweet potatoe fries.Didnt like their regular fries.Tasted like potatoe chips cuz it was too fried.The burgers are pricey but worth going once in awhile.They served alcohol as well. 21+ to get in so no kids allowed.Which is great cuz no little kids running around or making a mess.Bathroom is nice.Although there is one long sink that both men and women shared after they fiinish their business.It's quite nice for a burger place. Minus one star since its in LA and the busboy never gave us an extra dipping sauce for sweet potatoe fries unless they charge extra.They DO NOT have KETCHUP.
