Restaurant: Wow Bao
Category: Chinese
Hmmm, If Wow bao was an asian person.. they would be the one that has only white friends with the exception of a few asian and other minority friends here and there that they met through their brother or in college, only dates white people, isn't the most well informed on their culture, can read some of their written asian language to get by but for sure not know how to write it. Sounds like ME!! The difference is that I'm not a phoney and all hype.. ya know, nothing to back it up with. It's just noise. . . Definently not all that! Nothing to call home to my mommy out in the westcoast and brag about. It makes me remember, Oh yeah.. I'm in the midwest... this kind of trickery should be expected. I mean I love my americanized greasy chinese food from time to time but this? No, no NO! I agree with the other native westcoaster, McDonald's would make a better meal. McDonald's Happy Meal can beat this shit. This place belongs in the same family as Panda Express. . . Phony ass bitch. I'll be damned if a co-worker or friend drags me here in the future.
