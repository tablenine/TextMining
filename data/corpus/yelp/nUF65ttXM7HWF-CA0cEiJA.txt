Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
OK Yelpers--. . Blu Jam Cafe has consistently served great food with amazing service. Whenever I have friends from out of town or want some really stellar brunch I head to BJC. The owner, Kamil, who has been there every time I am there has been gracious and makes you feel at home and goes above and beyond to make sure you leave with a fully belly and a smile from ear to ear. Plus they have the best Eggs Benedict in LA-- hands down! Whats not to love?!. . They dont take reservations, but trust me, it is worth the wait. You wont be sorry.
