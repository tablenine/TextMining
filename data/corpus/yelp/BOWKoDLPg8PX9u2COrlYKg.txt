Restaurant: Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate
Category: American (New)
Cypress Street Plate and Pint is a breath of fresh air!.  It's definitely got the feel of a neighborhood bar with friendly staff, good beer, and hearty food.  The patio looks awesome, though it was just a little too brisk for us to eat outside.   Can't wait for the weather to warm up just a little more so we can fully enjoy it. . . Once inside one of the first things I noticed is the lack of smokiness.  The wood is beautiful and very warm and inviting.  The lack of textiles did make it a little bit noisy, and the music was just a little too loud to be that social, but it was a Friday night.. . The food was delicious - we split the spinach fondue and it was gone in under 3 minutes!  I had the chicken picatta which was excellent and just the right size.  The salad was tasty and not just your typical greens with crutons - the artichokes and olives were a nice touch, even if they were canned.. . The beer special (Cypress Street Ale) was good, and just what you need at a neighborhood bar.  One of our party was disappointed in the wine list, but let's be honest, you don't go to a place with Pint in the title expecting a great wine list.... . One of my friends has been raving about this place, and I can see why.  I briefly met the owner, and he was quite friendly.  I'm very excited about getting to know this place even more in the future.
