Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
i always pass by uncle julios, but today was the first time i actually ate there (it was my friend's choice for lunch). i couldn't really find anything special about this place.. the food was ok. the service was decent. and the price was a bit too much for what we got. . . the tacos i had were pretty average. and the chips were a bit too thin for me.. i usually complain about the thick ones that can break teeth i normally see at most restaurants, but these were so thin i could see right through them !! the salsa and guacamole we had were probably the highlight of our meal. although i was not impressed with much else, i will say that this is the best salsa i've had from any mexican/"mexican" restaurant i've ever dined at. . . overall, i would go back here if someone wanted me to go with them, but i wouldn't choose to go there myself. not to mention the picture of uncle julio (?) on the sign kinda scares me.
