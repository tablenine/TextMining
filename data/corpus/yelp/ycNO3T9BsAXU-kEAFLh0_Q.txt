I love this place. The food is not authentic but then again it's not a "Mexican" restaurant. I'd say it's Tex-Mex at best. The thing that this place has going for it is its killer margaritas. Hot damn! They are sooo good. They also have good veggie-friendly options. FYI the cheese enchiladas are not vegetarian. They are made with chicken stock. The veggie tamales are good and they are my stand by. They also have a yummy grilled veggie "fajita" plate. If you're not looking for a place to dine, stay for the chips and salsa and get a few drinks. You will be so happy you did. Their chips are so thin that they melt in your mouth and the margaritas are just right.
