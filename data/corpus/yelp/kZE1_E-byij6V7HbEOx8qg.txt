I feel inclined to update my review and drop my previous rating based on my last two bad experiences at Crustacean.  I was there last night and the service was horrible and really slow (perhaps it was because there were a few Boston Celtics dining there and they were too busy attending to them, but that's no excuse).  First, we arrived at 8:30 for our 8:30 reservation. We were asked to wait a few minutes.  25 minutes later, I checked with the hostess whether our table was ready and it was clear that she had forgotten about us.  After we finally got seated we didn't get menus, because they had a "shortage of menus."  How does a restaurant have a shortage of menus?? So we sat there for awhile longer for some menus and the wine list. That's basically how the rest of the evening went... lots of waiting and waiting.... pretty unacceptable for a "fine dining" restaurant.. . On my previous visit to Crustacean, the garlic noodles were way too salty.  And now that I think about it, service wasn't all that great either. . . Unfortunately, I think it'll be awhile before I return to Crustacean again. :(
