love this place.  so cozy and charming without being pretentious.  the cookies are to die for and soup is delicious too.  i hesitated for a long time because i thought for sure it was crunchy and they were hawking "healthy" baked goods but turns out "natural" but means butter.  good ol' fashioned butter.  yum!
