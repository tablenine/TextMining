Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
I'm not an expert on authentic Southern food so I can't really speak that element of Heaven on Seven.  However I thought both the creamy chicken soup and the shrimp and grits were extra yummy! Plus the food came out really quickly which was great b/c I was starving. . . The thing that really put this place over the top was our server Amy. She was probably the best waitress I've ever had, ever. She was very friendly, didn't bug us too much and did some other hilarious and awesome things that I won't mention here in case her boss reads Yelp.  Plus she was cute as a button and thanked us for our generous tip.  Yay Amy!
