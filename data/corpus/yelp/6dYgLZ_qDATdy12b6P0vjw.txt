Absolutely Delicious!  I had the "Garganelli with Ragu Bolognese" which everyone at the table raved about.  Even though it was a simple dish, it had a certain something about it that made it an extraordinary dish.  The deserts (yes plural) we had were delicious as well.  Most of the clientele were dressed to the nines (little black dresses with strings of pearls, and perfectly coiffed hair), but there were a couple of slobs dressed like me who were still welcomed with open arms.
