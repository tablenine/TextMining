i like to consider myself a "regular" now cuz i'm here after work at least a few times a month if not more...so i can honestly attest to the consistency of their food and service.  still spot on.  . . always be on the lookout for their seasonal menu changes too.  right now they're doing beautiful things with heirloom tomatoes namely, the heirloom tomato salad!  also LOVING the maryland softshell crab.  do try.. . it's not the cheapest of spots to throw back a few but the indulgence is worth it...trust me.
