Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I've learned the only Japanese word that I will ever need to know.....kaedama.. . This placed was perfectly placed; on Valley just off of Walnut Grove.  I like it because any further down Valley, you get a ton more restaurants with an assload of people waiting to eat there.. . This place is so good, I went for thirds.  The only problem is (which really isn't a problem considering how satisfied I was), your 7 dollar bowl could turn into a 30 dollar bowl of ramen.  With all the add-ons and refills, your bowl of ramen could get pricey, but, as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.. . Also, I love this place because it gives me an excuse to visit my sis.  There's four of us (siblings) and she's the one who decided to live outside the 10 mile radius that the rest of us live in.  I drive that far to eat, might as well stop by her pad in Pasadena.. . In short, I get good food and I get to visit my sister; I don't think that should get anything less than 5 stars.
