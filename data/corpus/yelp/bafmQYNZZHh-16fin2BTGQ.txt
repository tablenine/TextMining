I had a good feeling about this place, but came away disappointed. I did not like the garlic chicken so much. I felt it was dry and rubbery. I found the garlic sauce that came on the chicken and the yuca to be far too lemony for my tastes. I would have preferred just olive oil and garlic. Beans and rice and tostones were fine. Service was good.
