RFD has one raw food dish---the Living Wrap ($10).  This wrap blows Leaf's wraps out of the water.  It's made with a red pepper sunflower spread, guacamole and veggies, and it's all wrapped in collard greens.  Sure, its guts spurt everywhere when you bite into it, but for just $1.50 more than Leaf's wrap, I'd say this bad boy is worth it.  I also tried the enchiladas, which are delicious, but slightly expensive at $14.  . . The service was exceptional.  Our meal literally came out 3 minutes after we ordered it, and our waiter was incredibly attentive and polite.  We dined outside, which was nice with the heat lamps, and were in and out in 30 minutes.  Fast food! And did I mention that this was a Friday night? Bonus points: It's right next to Largo. The perfect spot for dinner and a show. . . *See pics*
