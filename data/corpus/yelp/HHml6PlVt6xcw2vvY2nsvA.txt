This place brings out my inner fatboy.   Well, my outter fatboy too.   Their sandwiches are amazing - especially the pulled pork and the The Monster.   Excellent eats. . . Even though I'm lactose intolerant I cannot help but get the After School Special.   The tomato bisque soup is THE BOMB and the grilled cheese is def not the kind you make on wonder bread.. . I was saddened when they close because it was my go-to spot when people came into town and wanted some good anytime of the day food.  Then, they opened back up and using their bathroom was no longer a chore.. . Expect lines and so-so service from some cool folks, but suck it up and get fat.
