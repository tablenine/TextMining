Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
I love Doc Chey's.  Growing up in a place where the only Asian food was greasy Americanized Chinese, Doc Chey's was a revelation when a friend took me there when I was in college.  Needless to say, I kept going back.  The food is consistently good.  I love the basil rolls.  The pad thai is a favorite of all my friends - just make sure you order extra sauce because it's almost always too dry.   I almost always pick the Chinese Black Bean noodle bowl or the Japanese Eggplant.. . This location is particularly nice in the late spring and early fall evenings, when you can sit outside on the patio.  The service is pretty quick, but you can wait a while on those nights I mentioned due to the small seating area.  It's also a great place for takeout.
