Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
There is hotdog stand that had huge lines outside.  Everyone swears it's worth the wait.  When I finally tried it I was painfully underwhelmed and left to wonder if something was wrong with me or if Angelinos simply do not know what they are talking about when it comes to food.  That hotdog stand is called Pinks.. . I experienced a similar feeling from trying Casa Bianca. I had heard tales of this l.a. landmark for the past several years but had never ventured out to try it.  I recently moved to Eagle Rock and thought it would be a great time to finally see what all the fuss is about.  Once again, I simply don't get it.  The spices seemed a bit strange to me, the sauce was nothing to write home about and and the spices were simply not in line with my palette.. . I should say that my ideal pizza is Totonnos in Manhattan.  I obviously don't hold l.a. pizza up to THAT standard but I feel that I have had much better pizzas from chains like LaRoccos and DiAmores than from Casa Bianca.  Let alone from places like Zelo,Dinos, 2 Boots, or Masa.. . Not to say Casa Bianca is BAD.  I ate my share of it.  I just am confused why people line up outside this place.  3 stars.
