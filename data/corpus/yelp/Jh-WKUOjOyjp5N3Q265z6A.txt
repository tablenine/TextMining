i had a meat burrito with cheese and guac. it was good. but nothing i'd wait in a long line for. the way they take your order / prepare your food / and make you pay is HIGHLY disorganized and takes FOREVER. small ass menu too. if it were a dollar 50 cheaper.. i'd give this a 3 stars maybe 4 stars. but nope. don't see that happening, sorry tito!
