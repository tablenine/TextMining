A unique blend of flavors.. for realz.  loved the short rib tacos.  spicy pork burritos were fantastic.  next time i will have to try the kimchi quesadillas. . only complaint i guess was that the tangy flavor might of been over-powering.. but i still liked cause it adds something different never tasted on a taco before.. . marv. . http://www.marvaliciou....
