I recently hosted a birthday dinner here for the bf. We had an AWESOME time! :). . I called in about a week early to book a table for 9-10 people. Apparently, the only way to make reservations here is to download the "reservation request form" from their website and fax it over to them.(A credit card number is required.) On the day of the dinner, they called to confirm that we will be going there.. . When we arrived, the owners themselves were personally there to greet us and lead us to the table. The atmosphere is casual but still trendy. It can get a little bit loud in there though. . . Now I've heard people complain about the service here from time to time. However, our server was extremely friendly and attentive.  They also let us bring in a cake from Sweet Lady Jane and helped us serve it at the end of dinner. . . Now for the FOOD =D! They started us off with bread and the famous garlic/parsley oil. The dip is fragrant and delicious with just a hint of spiciness.. . For the main course, everyone ordered either. . Entraña al Ajo - Grilled Certified Angus Beef skirt steak, topped with sautéed garlic and parsley. . Or the. . Entraña al Champignon- Grilled Certified Angus Beef skirt steak, topped with sautéed mushrooms in a light red wine cream sauce, served with mashed potatoes. . The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked to order. I'm not even a big meat eater and I enjoyed every bite of my steak. The mashed potatoes were creamy with small chunks hidden in there. :) YUM. Even the rice was prepared with garlic, peppers and...a hint of lemon?. . And best of all...the price!! This place offers such great deals! Large portions of Yummy Yummy food...and most dishes are under $20!. . Would definitely recommend this place.  Will definitely come back in the future.
