Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
OK.. for some good daytime and late nite Thai that is generally all around pretty good, this would be the place.  Ordered some Kee Mao Noodles with shrimp, green curry and the spicy fried rice last night and it was great.  Their a la cart seafood dishes are great as well.. . I prefer take out, though, because if you go into the restaurant to eat, it kind of feels like you're in a very loud cafeteria.  That is until the Elvis guy comes.. then it can get fun.
