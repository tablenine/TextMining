I work 2 minutes from Porto's. I would be jealous of me too ;D I knew there was one around, but my jaw dropped as I drove by Porto's during an errand run. . . This location is much nicer and larger than the one in Glendale. They are open for breakfast and yes the lines are still long in the morning, but this location is very efficient. There is nothing like the cheese roll and coffee for breakfast or a pastrami sandwich and potato ball for lunch. The little cakes are delish too!
