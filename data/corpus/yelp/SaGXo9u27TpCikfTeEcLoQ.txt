I frequented this place when I worked nearby. Fries Â with the sauce are tasty and the pulled pork sandwich is the way to go. I never ate there, I always got it to go. Haven't tried other menu items since I love the pork sandwich so much. Not great if you're on a diet, but it's worth the extra time on the treadmill.
