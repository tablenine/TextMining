Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
Ciudad, why did it take me so long to visit your symphonic Latin flavors! Mary Sue and Susan, those 'two hot tamales', hit all the right notes with their perennial classic restaurant. . . We started with the Peruvian Ceviche and were amazed at its flavor and freshness. One in our party explained it as, "the most delicious food taste ever experienced"! Truly a 'moment' experienced! . . Each entree was shared amongst the group to symphonic 'oohs' and 'aahs'...and bravos! My carnitas was crispy and moist and served over the creamiest corn grits. Another highlight was savoring the perfectly charred grill taste of the gaucho beef rib eye. . . As have been all my experiences over the years with this talented duo, their creations are perfectly and richly spiced. Which explains the absence of salt and pepper on the table--they are indeed not needed! Everything is perfectly in tune. . . The space itself, albeit aged, still remains gorgeous and freshly stylized. . . The only sour note would be the high priced drinks served with packed ice in tiny glassware. I found the self-proclaimed famous mojitos good but not worth the ticket price. Â I guess if I want to drink, I should come for the happy hour.. . I truly enjoyed the skillfully conducted concert that is Ciudad.
