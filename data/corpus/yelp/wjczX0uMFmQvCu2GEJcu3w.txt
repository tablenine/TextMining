Restaurant: Wishbone
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
While I have not had Wishbone for dinner is quite some time, a few years, I have had brunch there more times then I can count.  Overall, Wishbone is kitchy, affordable, and quite tasty.. . Food:  As I remember it, the blackened catfish was really good.  The crispy french toast was not my thing, but very good.  While I would not order it again my boyfriend was obsessed with how good it was.  Overall the breakfast items are consistently good.  The price is right.. . Drink:  Coffee is kind of bitter, but it does the trick.  Skip the OJ.  I have never had a cocktail here, so I have no opinion on their bar.. . Atmosphere: Bright, airy, tongue-in-cheek. I like the crazy ass pictures of chickens.  This place has a cool, comfortable feel.  Very diverse, no one would feel uncomfortable here... except maybe an Evangelical...  At times for brunch there is a wait, but I have never waited longer then 15 minutes.  Granted, I don't roll in until after 11:30am.. . Service: It can be slow at times, but for the most past I have never had a problem.. . Closing:  Everyone should have brunch here at least once.  It is worth the trip and is becoming a Chicago staple.  I can't wait to try the one in Berwyn...  But that is probably because I am oddly obsessed with Berwyn..........
