Restaurant: Busy Bee Cafe
Category: Soul Food
This food here is truly delish.  Went for lunch before a meeting at a local university &amp; glad I got a seat.  The cafe is tiny-- seating perhaps 40 people.  I enjoyed the cornbread muffins with honey butter before the delivery of my flaky, cornmeal fried catfish with two sides.  Service was prompt with no frills.  Lunch ran about $10.. I've never sat at a lunch counter that wasn't a bar.  Enjoyed that, while reading the framed awards &amp; best of ratings hung on the wall.  There are also some tables &amp; booths with signs asking two or more people sit there.. Busy Bee is worth the trip. I waddled away with a full belly &amp; a sense of having gone to a regional authentic gem.
