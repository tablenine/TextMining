I met a large group of friends here for brunch a few weeks ago. (We had a big enough group to warrant making a reservation, but I'm not sure they'll do it for small groups.) . . The bloody mary wasn't just a drink, it was an appetizer! The salad in this thing was unbelieveable - HUGE chunks of provolone cheese, summer sausage, pickles and pepperoncinis on a skewer. Yum. I had the Old Oak burger, and it was pretty tasty too.
