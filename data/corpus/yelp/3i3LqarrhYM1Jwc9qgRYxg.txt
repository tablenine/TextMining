Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
If you have ever been to Hawaii, then you may know what the locals enjoy for a simple meal - Plate Lunch! (2 scoop rice, 1 scoop macaroni salad, and choice of meat) Oh how I love the Hawaiian plate lunch!!!. . The restaurant has a very clean environment; with clean, soft tropical colored walls with quaint island artwork and memorabilia. This fast-casual restaurant is very dear to me. It's the only restaurant that I know of in Atlanta that serves this style of food and is very reminiscent of my years in Hawaii. The restaurant is not huge, but not too small. The menu is simple to understand with pictures of their popular items. If you're feeling adventurous, try #39 SPAM Musubi a delicious Hawaiian treat! Â I gave this place 5 stars because it makes me proud to have this cuisine in this city. CHEERS!
