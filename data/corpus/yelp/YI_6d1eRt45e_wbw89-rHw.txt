Still pretty new to Atlanta and originally from California so i was dying for some authentic Mexican food. So my friend told me about this place and I decided to try it out with a friend. In my opinion the food was spectacular. Everything Â was cooked perfectly the fajitas were delicious and the salsa a queso were decent to hold us while we waited. I love the vibe it gives cause it reminds me of home. I would want to recommend this to everyone but I like the atmosphere so ill just tell a few select friends.
