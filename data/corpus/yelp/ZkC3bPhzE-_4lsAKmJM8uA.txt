the people that filled the list felt a form of collective anxiety as we waited for our number/name to be called out. please, please let us be next was all i could think as i was getting dizzily hungry.. . everything tastes amazing when you are a starving child. honestly Â the ramen was ridiculously amazing regardless of the fact that my stomach was eating itself as i waited.. . she called everyone with a party of 2 before us. i would highly recommend not going on a friday night with a group larger than 2. i felt so bad for the group of 4 and 5 before us because they waited even longer! the group of 5 guys cheered once they got seated. i felt like doing so too once we got a booth, but i was too weak and hungry! . this is because we (a group of 3) waited for literally 1 hour and 10 min.. . first off, once we got seated, so did 8 people at the counter and 3 other tables. spots are clear for what seems like forever and then they seat everyone at the same time. they were highly understaffed and that definitely contributed to the long wait. luckily, it didnt take too long to get our food once we were seated but honestly, i wasnt sure if it was worth it because i was feeling so faint. none of us had dinner, we got there around 9:20 pm and got seated at 10:30 and we were all feeling woozy. . . then again, the ramen was SOOOOOOO good. and its a huge bowl of tasty, cloudy yummi-ness. . . we all decided that nothing could be worth that long of a wait but just be prepared to wait if you go on a fri, sat night and all is well. we left with full, happy bellies in the end. and thats what matters. service is a luxury! 5 stars for the food
