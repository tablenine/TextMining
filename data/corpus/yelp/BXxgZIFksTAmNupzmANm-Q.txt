Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
I visited Parker's with my family for Easter Sunday buffet. I have eaten at Parker's several times, but this was my first time experiencing the buffet.. . What a treat! There were waffles and pancakes, fruits and berries, candied bacon, turkey sausage, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, shrimp and grits, salmon, roast beef, potato salad, pasta salad, an omelet bar, assorted pastries and several kinds of cakes.. . My favorite was the shrimp and grits. The shrimp are plentiful and come in a spicy, gravy like sauce with bits of spicy smoked sausage and are very flavorful. They are a regular menu item that I will be sure to order again. Be sure to make reservations, there was quite a crowd.
