It may not be my idea of superb seafood, but it sure is a great place to go grab a drink and snacks on the roof. It is a great casual place for a date or to hang out with friends, especially in the spring and summer. Some of the food that I recommend are the calamari tacos, the fish stew and the fish and chips. I've had several menu items, but these are the ones that I liked the best.
