Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
How the heck do you not like this place?? It's awesome. It's magical. It's fun.. . If you like magic, you would love this place. There's a bunch of magic shows all over the castle. Some are scheduled every couple of hours and performed on a stage and others are small shows in every corner of the castle.Definitely, try one of the close-up magic shows and make sure they pick you to do a trick. It's pretty awesome. I got picked for a trick and somehow my driver's license ended up in the magician's wallet. It was weird. These people have fast hands, these tricky magicians. The shows definitely deserve 5 stars. No doubt. But because of the food...overall this place gets 4 stars. . . The food was not horrible but being a picky little foodie that I am...I must say that it was just edible. But ya know...being at the magic castle and all you have to do the dinner and show thing. I mean...you really have to...you don't have a choice if you get invited. . . They really push the drinks here which I'm sure no one really minds, right?? I haven't had a good buzz like I did here in awhile so it was a super fun magical night for me. . . So...is anyone a member or a magician?? Hook me up with an invite so I can go again. :)
