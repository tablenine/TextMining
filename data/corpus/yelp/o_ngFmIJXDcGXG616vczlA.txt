This review will border between 4 and 4.5 stars.  and that's just because i've been fortunate enough to go to other similar amazing restaurants like gary danko, etc.  . . spago gets a solid 4.5 stars for the food.  i started with an endive salad, moved onto the short rib which literally melted in my mouth, and finished off with some chocolate bread pudding that was in a word: amazing.  the food was so good it's really hard to explain (or remember since i'm writing this review a few months late), but i can attest with confidence that my stomach was wonderfully satisfied after the dinner.  the portions were larger than expected and the meal in its entirety definitely left me full and not wanting any dessert for the rest of the night.  . . being a non-elderly white male native to los angeles, i did not fit in.  and was thus looked at as though i got lost on my way to koreatown.  however, the waiter was more than kind and very attentive.  spago gets 3 stars for atmosphere just for the mere fact that it seemed a little bit uptight after building such a reputation.  i suppose if you go to eat at a legendary restaurant in beverly hills, you shouldn't be surprised when this happens.. . all in all, it was a wonderful meal that i didn't regret even after seeing my credit card bill.
