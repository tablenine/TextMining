I am in town 2x a year for 1 week each time.  We always stay downtown and never have a car, so tonight when friend I met online who lives here offered to take me to "where the locals go" I was very happy and excited.. . We arrived at The Earl around 7 and had no problem getting booth seating.  They pour the drinks stiff!  They had tons of salads and entree dinners.  Tonight's special was Chicken Fried Steak.  My local pal suggested that we get burgers and proclaimed them to be among the best in ATL.  Well, she was spot on!  I had The Earl with Cheddar Cheese and Wasabi Mayo along with a side of Island Salad (onions, tomatoes and cucumber) and all was delicious.. . 3 Captains, 1 Sweet Tea and 2 Earl Burgers later our bill was $36.32 before tip.. . This place was good enough, I might just have to fit a rental car into our budget on the next trip!. . Oh and being that I am a smoker I LOVED the SMOKERS WELCOME attitude of the joint.
