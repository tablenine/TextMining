Yum. Yum. Yum.  I loooove the Doner Plate.  Perfect combo of great flavors  (that I might not have put together on my own).  Sure, probably not like the great Kebobs I've gotten around the world but for a few blocks away from my apt, perfect.. Price can get a little high and is often overrun with students (sorry Oxy but you create a lot of lines around town during the school year!)
