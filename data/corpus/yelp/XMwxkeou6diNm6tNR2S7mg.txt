Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Why come here - the service is poor, the pizza takes over one hour to get to the table, the clam pizza - snack size and tasteless.. The one thing we enjoyed - the bruschette with liver got us sick. As for the service, it's non-existant.  . I had forgotten why it took us so long to come back to Mozza - . uncomfortable sitting and incredibly loud music and noisy.   Alltogether, an experience I would rather forget.
