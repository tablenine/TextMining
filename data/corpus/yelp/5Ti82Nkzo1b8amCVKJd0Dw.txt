Humm, the non-red meat eater than I am had a little hesitation about going to a place AKA slaughterhouse!  But in the end, we loved it.  We were shopping one day at Room and Board (more to come on that place soon) and stumbled upon the butcher knife sign outside the door.  Inquiring minds want to know so we went in and realized it was a restaurant!  The decor is very cool...very ala farmhouse for 80 of your favorite people.. . We decided to take a friend for her 40th birthday and we loved it.  We pretty much ate everything that was on the small plate side of the menu.  There were a few misses for us.  The pickled veggies and the pickled shrimp were just so-so.  However, the baby leeks, the watermelon and fennel salad and the fried chickpeas were awesome!  I could not put those dang peas down!  For entrees, we had a variety of items.. . The table loved the lamb trio, the chicken dish that I had, the salmon.  Jeff had a burger that he is still talking about.  I did not like it as much as him but he loved it.  It had several different types of meat which were combined together to make a large patty!. . The desserts were the highlight of the meal.  I had a goat cheesecake in a mason jar with fresh blueberry compote that was amazing.  The birthday girl had a fried blackberry pie with ice cream that was also delish!  The chocolate cookie that Jeff had was so-so.  Probably our least favorite item but the rest of the meal was so good that we did not car.. . Stuffed to our gills and ready for a nap, we left there thinking we would go back.  Which says something for this picky, picky guy!
