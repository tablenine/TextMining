An aged steak is awesome! The taste definately jumps out at you.  I went there about a year ago for the first time and I missed out on the Lamb Chops due to a friend forgetting to split their meal with me, which was completely fine because the Kansas City, which is a bone in aged for 35 days was quite satsifying.  Last night I wound up ordering the Lamb Chops and it was a good pairing with the bottle of wine that was recommended by the helpful waitress, Jennifer.  Not quite the fan of the wierd muffin/bread they bring out to the table, but the lobster bique is definately tasty.  Three of us went in hungry and longing for a good piece of meat and we all left smiling with a good meal put away.  . . There was no wait, as we were seated instanteously.  And everyone there is extremely helpful.  (ex. my friend ordered the salad and it came with ranch on it as well as a vingerette but he asked for them to rid of the ranch and blue cheese and load it up with the vinerette...they complied without hesitation). My other picky friend ordered his steak medium rare and then told the waitress that he would like it more rare...when the steak came to the table as instructed he felt it was a little to blue for his liking...he saw what a medium tempuratured steak looked like and asked them to do it for him that way as well...they did it quickly and with a smile.  I have picky friends that need good service all the time and David Burke's Primehouse fit the bill last night.
