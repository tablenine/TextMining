I would come here more often if the food was more consistent. Unfortunately, the onion rings tend to be served a bit soggy and just above room temperature, and some of the appetizers can be pretty disappointing. Service is okay, I guess. The milk shakes are great though, and the burgers are often exciting. Also, Mary's Attic (the bar upstairs) is pretty fun. If I could give 2.5 stars instead of three, I might. I definitely prefer T's, south on Clark St. about four blocks or so.
