ok so i notice my average rating for places is 4 or 5 stars: but that's because i really only yelp when i like people, places, and things. so i take this moment to hate on something so you all feel satisfied out there.. . so it only has 1 strike or my 3 strike policy and perhaps it was just a overblown experience while the majority of yelpsters average this place to 4 stars. key situation: restaurant week... this alone can make or break an experience and to be fair with all the madhouse chicago restaurants are in for this damned week it probably isn't the most telling impression. i went with a group of 15 people. so going as a pair might not quite compare.. . so there were a fixed # of choices to decide from. i can't find their shitty website to revisit their menu for what i chose because apparently they didn't renew their . http://godaddy.com.  subscription - they moved it to another site of which is unimpressive considering what their decor &amp; ambiance speaks of their "target market".. . the meal was meh. the only thing i actually do remember well was their sangria. also we had a bill well over $1000 and when we were a lil short we went back and inspected and found they over charged us for 3 meals! douches. additionally the seating was kinda accommodating for our large group but CLEARANCES weren't thought out: you were either stuck at the table if you sat on the wall side or were being brushed by staff passing through. on top of that our server was kinda a jerk. needless to say i was a lil cranky after this meal.
