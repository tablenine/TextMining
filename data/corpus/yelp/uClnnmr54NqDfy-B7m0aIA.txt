I went last night for the first time.   I've heard ravings about this place so I REALLY have been wanting to try this place.. . I was not disappointed by the food.  We had an appetizer and a couple salads to start.  Very intersting and tastey.  I'm not sure of the names, but one was a citrus salad of sorts with oranges and pomegranates and the other had red peppers (from South Africa, my South African friend said) that was devine.. . There were 5 of us and we all ordered something different.  I ordered the flamkuchen, but my favorite pizza was the mexicali with shrimp and cilantro.  The shroom pizza was also very tasty.  When they offer you fresh spinach, get it.   IT was really good, and made feel a bit healthier, as I ingested bite after bite of pizza. :). . We also had dessert.  3 carrot cakes, a chocolate cake and an apple tart.  All were delicious.. . The service was good, everyone was friendly and I think the manager (tall thin guy, quasi mohawk/spikey hair) came over and aksed how everything was.  Very nice guy, enjoyed talking with him.  . . I also loved seeing their oven, love the tiles. :). . Service was aweseome, food was great and I can't wait to go back.
