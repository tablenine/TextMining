Normally I don't like puppehs at my feet when I dine. Especially when it isn't my puppeh. But I do so love a cavalcade of canines in short view when I'm noshing on a Sunday afternoon. I ooo and ahhh all from the confines of the patio at Silver Cloud, a place where many a martini has been served aside ooey, gooey mac and cheesy.. . Because naturally, what better to accompany half of a veggie burger and a starter salad but carbs and queso? Precisely. It all balances it out folks. . . I love this place. It's right on the precipice of trendy and artsy that is the Crotch and I think the waitstaff is just marvy. It was a scorcher today, we patio'd and our waitress and support staff were all smiles. The salads are ample and void of iceberg, which might be expected, but no. . . a hat tip to Helena B. for clapping her hands at the leafy offerings too. Feta, red onion, ripe tomato and romaine for a starter salad? At $3 I could have walked away then. Instead, sipping on lemonade and cooing at Jack Russels and Corgis, we lingered for quite awhile. Long enough to have to pee twice.. . If I lived in the neighb (i.e. "If I had a million dollars. . .") I would frequent this place and Olivia's Market next door. Even though I don't and won't, Silver Cloud is warm and inviting no matter your zip code.
