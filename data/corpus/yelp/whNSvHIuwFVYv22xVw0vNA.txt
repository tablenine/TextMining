2.5 stars.. . I finally ran into this truck last night. It was in Little Tokyo, right by the MOCA. There was some Street Fighter 4 event there, plus the Downtown Art Walk.. . The line wasn't long, considering it was about 10:30pm, that's probably why.. . I ordered the beef tacos, and sadly, I wasn't very impressed. The sauce was watery, and overwhelmed the flavors. There was way too many onions on it, and there was hardly any beef. I really love the idea of it, but it just didn't live up to the hype. . . Fun idea, but not enough beef. No beef equals no love. Sorry Kogi.
