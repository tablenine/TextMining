4.5. . In need of a good brunch place? Check out Alcove!. . To be honest.. the price wasn't too enticing. But the food is delicious as well as very pretty! The outdoor seating is also very cutesy. The seats were just regular metal chairs painted in green or orange.. but just general decor of the place screams "BRUNCH." I wouldn't say it's my favorite.. I've had a lot better in New York (woot woot. don't mind my nyc pride! :)) ) but anyways.. not the best but definitely one of the good ones. . . I ordered the (kinda) classic benedict. Next to it was a medley of berries. LOVED IT. The colors of the fruit was just sooo pretty. And yumm hollandaise with poached eggs and spinach on top of huge slices of bread. so tasty tasty! Their house blend iced tea was also very good. It wasn't sweet but it wasn't bitter at all. . . My friends ordered salmon stack, salmon and mushroom omelet, and a ham, mushroom and onion omelet. everything was delicious! if your order comes with toast, they give you a small jar of jam. ADORABLE!. . One thing I should mention though is if you ordered a drink, make sure to pick it up from the counter that you ordered and paid. Because I thought they would bring it out with the food, but they apparently only bring out the food. . . At least they were nice about it when I went to go claim my drink. :)). . TRY ALCOVE! it's yummy!
