Restaurant: Ruen Pair Restaurant
Category: Thai
This place would taste awesome if...I were drunk. But I wasn't.. . Although I've had better Thai food in Thai Town, Ruen Pair did have cheap prices and the spiciest food in town. . . The order:. - Raw Blue Crab Papaya Salad (Medium spicy): Yes, real blue crab! OMG for being unbearably spicy. Oh! The agony! . - Deep fried whole pompano with a spicy chili sauce: Pompano had a tough, meaty texture similar to fish jerky. I'm not a fan of the fish, but I am a fan of the spicy chili sauce! . - House special pan-fried flat noodles with chicken: The chicken was tough, but the flavor was decent and very spicy. . - Sticky rice: Sadly, it was hard rice and became even tougher as it sat on the plate.. - Thai tea: I wished they gave refills to soothe my tongue from the chili peppers. I was sweating, crying, and in pain.. . Total bill: About $30, included three entrees, sticky rice, two thai teas, tax, and tip.. . Service: It was pretty good for a Thai restaurant. I was thankful that they came often to refill our waters. I must have drank 10 waters!. . Parking: $2 in the shopping center lot.. . Overall, 3 stars for cheap, spicy Thai fare. Cash only.
