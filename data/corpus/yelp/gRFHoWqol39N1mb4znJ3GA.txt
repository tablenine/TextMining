My long time crush was in San Diego for business and he drove in town for the evening just to take me out.  He certainly did his homework because this place was really impressive.  especially because he probably needed to plan ahead.. . When I ate here, I was coming off of my no carb diet, which was a good thing since I couldn't resist the mashed potatoes and the cream corn.  Also, I inhaled the rib-eye steak.  Its hard to tell that I really like the cocktails and wine selection.. . The pre-dinner cocktails were good.  I was feeling a little "sex in the city" so I had the cosmos. During dinner, he ordered a bottle of wine that we pretty much put away, which later got the best of me.  . . As much as the food was great, my date didn't eat much because he either was frightened about viewing the spectacle of me eating with irreverent disregard to proper eating etiquette (the food was too good to worry about being proper) Or because I was rubbing his leg with my foot.  I did say he was a long time crush and the liquor got the best of me.  Anyways, he was a perfect gentleman and took this obnoxious little English girl home without taking advantage of the perfect drunken moment.
