I don't remember what I ordered when I went here a couple years ago but I just remember it being good. Plus the interior of the place is just beautiful, with the tree in the middle with the lanterns all over it.. . My only disappointment was the dessert. This is where I found out that I'm not a very big fan of souffles.
