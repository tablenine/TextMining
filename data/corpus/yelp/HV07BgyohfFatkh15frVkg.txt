Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
If EVER anyone says to me (this basically NEVER happens), "Let's go to an amazing restaurant.  Money is no object.  My treat."  Spago, it is.  . . It's not even that it's that much more expensive than other nice restaurants - it's just that you just HAVE to get multiple courses, wines, desserts, tea service, the whole shebang.  You just HAVE to.  . . Sitting out in the courtyard late at night after the dinner-crowd has died down - sipping your tea while recovering from a mild food coma... It really doesn't get a whole lot better than that.  . . Dear Jonathan Gold:  This place is the epitome of "Essential" for Los Angeles.  If the "essentials" were ranked, I would hope this one would be listed as #1.  And actually, this one could be labeled "Essential" for the rest of time, even after it's existence.
