Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I had forgotten how much I enjoyed Giordano's stuffed pizza.  While I still prefer Gino's East, I was impressed by the density of the cheese and the nearly crisp vegetables in my Giordano's stuffed--and the crust wasn't at all greasy as it can be at some of those other places (ahem, Chicago's).  . . This location is very crowded, no matter the summer heat.  Last night, my out-of-town friends and I waited for about an hour but had the good fortune to be able to wait inside, unlike some of the Midwestern families we saw.  Because so many tourists go here, this is a great place for people watching. . The service is so-so, consistently.  The prices are decent; $20-25 will get you a large stuffed, $4 for beer and $4 for dessert.  Plus, there's always leftovers with a stuffed pizza.  Well, for most of us, anyway.
