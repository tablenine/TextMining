Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
Definitely a very good deep dish pie, from the home of the deep dish.  The location is historic and has some character going downstairs to enter the restaurant, but not a great place to sit and hang while waiting for your pizza to cook.  Only a few older TVs and a small bar area.  Great thing is that they offer an individual sized deep dish for those travelers who are in town by themselves and want to taste the taste of Chicago Deep Dish without wasting half a pie on a larger size (TIP:  take your leftovers to go... the Chicago homeless are appreciative of your donation).
