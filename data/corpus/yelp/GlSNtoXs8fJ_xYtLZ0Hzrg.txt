I have been eating at Porto's for a lot of years now and there is no better place to go and hang out for breakfast and lunch than Porto's for Cuban/American food and pastries!  Nice people amazing menu and great prices.  Leave your calorie counter at the door.  Pastries are decadent and you probably have guessed by now, the potato balls are scrumptious!  The lines look long but move fast.  Venture into menu, it's diversified and oh so good!  The new store in Burbank is catching up fast to the original!!!
