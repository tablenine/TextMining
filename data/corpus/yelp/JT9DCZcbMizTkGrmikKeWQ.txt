After connecting with an old friend, we decided to grab a nice brunch to catch up. After reading many reviews, I decided that this would be the best place to get a nice, filling, good old fashioned southern breakfast (Just like grandma use to make!). I ordered the wishbone omlette with cheese grits and my counterpart had the fried catfish and grits. . My eggs were a little dry but the cheese grits were DELISH! My friend allowed me one bite of his catfish and I wish I had ordered that instead. Very moist and well seasoned. . I didn't think this place had the greatest food I've ever eaten (based on my overcooked eggs and the hard muffin that came with my meal). Nor did they have the best service (our waitress was very eclectic and a little awkward at times as she stood over our table in silence for 5 minutes while we got our money together for the bill...ummm...have we been here that long or are you rushing to get us out of here because you have somewhere else to be?) Not to mention they moved us out of our quaint booth because a larger group was coming in. (however they made up for that with free dessert which was very tasty!) . . I wouldn't say it was the worst, I'll just say it is "AIGHT". As long as you don't get the eggs and there isn't a big crowd, you'll be satisfied.
