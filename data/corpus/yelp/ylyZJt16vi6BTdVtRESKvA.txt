Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
I didn't actually have ramen here, I had cold noodles.  I had a cold noodle plate with chashu, bamboo, green onions, a (smoked?) egg, and bean sprouts.  It was tasty.  The chashu  (pork) had a bit too much fat and wasn't terribly flavorful, but I imagine it's better in a bowl of ramen.  My girlfriend had a fried noodle plate with shrimp, which was arguably better than mine.  The noodles were thin and a bit crunchy, and it was slightly spicy.  The restaurant itself was clean and simple inside--it had the right atmosphere without trying.  I'd go there again, next time I'm in Sawtelle and not exploring another place I haven't been before.
