Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Breakfast and Lunch/Dinner combine in to one fantabulous meal.  I wish I could have this this every day it's that good.  . . They have a handful of ways you can order your chicken combo with or without waffles.   I'm a fan of the Scoe's with gravy, the stubby, and the Jeane Jones Omelette.  The omelette is simple yet perfect - cheese and chicken.  How can you go wrong?  They load up on the cheese, so i usually tend to have them ease up a little.  But the chicken chunks are huge and tastes great.  If you like that little combination, defintely give this a whirl.  I always order this bad boy with a waffle. The waffles aren't think but they're huge.  I'm not a fan of fluffly waffles, so these are perfect for me.. . If you have room, may I suggest adding a cornbread to your meal. It's a huge piece that's fluffy and moist.  Pure perfection.. . Here's a tip for you newbies...keep an eye out for Big Mama, she's super sweet, but don't you dare put your elbows on the table!  She's got eagle eyes when it comes to that, so she'll be quick to correct you and point out the rudeness. :)    LOVE IT!!!
