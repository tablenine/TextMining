The best veggie burger evah!  Really a veggie burger NOT a "garden" burger that is all soy protein.  You could taste the the fresh chopped vegetables and grilled flavor which is why I will be back.. . Highlights. Fries...more please. Great condiments: BBQ sauce, garlic aioli, chipotle ketchup. cheese selection NO kraft singles here :). Awesome beer selection. . Lowlights. PB &amp; J Cupcake:  A little on the dry side for my taste in baked goods. . Suggestions. Texas Toast grilled cheese....PLEASE!!!. . I was impressed and the food lived upto the yelp reviews.  Enjoy!
