There are two kinds of sushi places: places where I would consider ordering omakase, and places where I would never consider doing such a thing in a million years. I'd estimate that 90% of the sushi places around L.A. fit in the latter category. One rule of thumb: if they have "philly rolls" on the menu, don't order omakase. . . I'm not so snobby that I avoid places where I'll order some rolls, I just think the two types of places should be rated differently. Sushi-Gen is an Omakase spot. This has an important implication for customers (and reviewers): If you go to Sushi-Gen and order spicy tuna rolls or the typical round-eye "sushi deluxe", you're not making the most of the place. Not only do you miss what they have to offer, Â you usually overpay for what you get. It's like going to be best wine bar in town and paying $12 for a beer instead of $15 for a great unusal wine you wouldn't have known to order yourself! . . With that backdrop, I think the first criteria for Omakase is that the ingredients should be absolutely stellar and fresh. No problems here: Sushi-Gen's fish is very high quality and fresh, as others have pointed out. Additionally, the rice is a bit warm - when combined with the cool, fresh fish it creates a very nice sensation on the pallatte. . . The second is an interesting mix of selections. If I'm giving the chef carte-blanche to choose my meal for me there should be some surprises. Indeed, there were a few dishes I'd never seen, and some I'd never heard of! One example was a spicy scallop sushi, which is to be eaten WITHOUT soy sauce. It had a lemony flavor to it with a subtle mix of spices. . . Finally, I we live in a showbiz town and I like some drama in my Omakase. Surprise me. Make it a conversation! My friend I had lunch with told me while we ate that he liked chopped up tuna. The chef overheard this and made a special toro roll that mixed chopped up tuna with some little fruit pieces - it was phenomenal!!! There was a flow to the meal and the sequence of dishes was as exciting as it was fufilling. . . Bonus points: we said we wanted to spend around $50 each, and the tab was $51 (pre-tax). . . So, that's why I give this place 5 stars. I think the price is reasonable for what you get when you make the most of what Sushi-Gen has to offer. It is unfortunate that people order a salmon roll, give this place 3 stars, and say it's overpriced. Fortunately that leaves more seats at the bar. I will be back...
