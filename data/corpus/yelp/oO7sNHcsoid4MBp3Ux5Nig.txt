Good 24hr joint in LA.  I can't remember what I had, but it was good. . Better than Denny's or Norms any day.... . I remember having a long wait to pay the bill.. and I had to walk to the other side of the restaurant. . . Parking is a MAJOR bitch!!!  Their private lot was full, and it's pretty small! We ended up parking illegally and praying not to get busted.. we got lucky!
