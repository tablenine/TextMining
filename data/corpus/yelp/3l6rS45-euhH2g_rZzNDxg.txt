If I came directly from the sushi mecca of San Francisco, then this place is about average.  But coming from sushi-starved DC...this place was awesome.  They say they are the place that introduced sushi to Chicago (and probably all of the Midwest for that matter).  Sushi was well done, I ordered the kamahachi sushi platter #2 which came with a variety of sushi, and if you eat it in order you finish off with a nice sweet taste.  Service was fantastic.
