I actually really enjoyed almost everything about the food and experience here, but had the evening wrapped up by one of those WTF moments that I can't help but to leave a 1 star review.  . . The appetizers were nothing special, but solid all around.  The aged ribeye was out of this world, and our server was great.  . . I came here for a refined and relaxing atmosphere though, and a camera crew set up at a table in my line of sight and turned on a 1000 watt tv light (I am not a cameraman, just using a bit of hyperbole here so you can get the picture). . . We initially laughed and figured it would be a quick thing because of how obviously obnoxious it was, but after 15-20 minutes it became less funny.  Our waiter was great, apologized and said he wasn't sure what it was.  . . The manager came over and told us there was nothing he could do and it was totally out of his control... ???  It was.... a small Irish review show filming a review.  . . Nothing was comped, nothing happened - the manager just blew us off with "There's nothing I can do, what do you want me to do?"  Wow, ok.. . I'm not easily disturbed at restaurants, and this is my first one star review.  I'm not a great writer, so it's hard to describe exactly how weird this experience was.   When the bill is over $120/person, I would hope the manager would have more control over his restaurant and  could or was more apologetic to his patrons.  I would love to come back and re-review and give 4-5 stars, but with so many other classy and great options that make me feel at home, that's very unlikely.
