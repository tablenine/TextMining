This place is nearby my house so I decided to give them a shot because I am definitely a supporter of creative neighborhood businesses. I like the way they designed the place starting with the exterior to the interior use of the space. It is kind of small but good use of what they got. Parking kind of sucks though. You have to park across the street in an alley but you are also competing with El Coyote customers. I felt like a good burger so I asked them about the burger. This is where the problem lies. The employee over hyped their "ish" to me. He told me many claim it to be the best burger in Los Angeles. That is a very bold statement, I thought to myself. I started going through the mental Rolodex of my favorite burger places in LA. As I was getting introspective, the employee picked up on this and  reclaimed his statement about the burger. Even so, I had great expectations. When I got it, I was very disappointed. It was not a burger but more like a panini. I took a bite and expected the rush of great flavors from a new find, but it was average at best. The only reason I give it 3 stars if because of the friendly staff, cool customers, and nice decor. I doubt I will be back there again, even for the novelty. IN A NUTSHELL, MILK  IS LIKE A NICELY PACKAGED CHRISTMAS GIFT YOUR GRANNIE GOT YOU, BUT IT ONLY HOLDS THAT KNITTED SWEATER SHE MADE.
