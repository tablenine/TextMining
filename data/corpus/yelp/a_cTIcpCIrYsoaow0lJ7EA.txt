Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
So good. . . The prices are a bit steep, but the portions are generous ... but the noodles are *delicious* and you'll want more than is good for you. Skip the sandwich, go straight for the ramen. You have to dig in as soon as the waitstaff brings your food because the ramen is best when it's fresh. They also have ramen salads for the summer. I was a bit skeptical, but the salad is actually quite tasty. . . Our waitress was a sweetheart. We had four people in our party and we only ordered three dishes, so she offered to bring us extra plates without waiting for us to ask her or giving us a hard time about ordering short.. . **. . So I went to Chabuya again the other day, and I don't know what happened, but the noodles just weren't as good as they were last time ... perhaps the chef had a bad day or a break up or something. Mr. Noodle Chef at Chabuya, if you're reading this, I just want you to know that if she dumped you, she's crazy, because if I have the right person in mind, you are a total hottie and next time I will accidentally-on-purpose leave you my phone number. You know, all in the name of good ramen.
