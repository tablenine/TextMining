For the majority of people dining at Toast there is one goal: Trick other patrons and passers by into thinking that you are a celebrity. Bring at least one small animal (preferably a Chihuahua), a pair of sun glasses that cover half your face, and a purse that could fit a pair of skis. When you have collected all of those items you will be ready to schmooze with your best gay friend at a table for two on 3rd Street. . . Despite its reputation as the see and be seen local, the food is delish! My favorite is the Caprese Sandwich... Order extra vinaigrette and hold the cucumber. When choosing your side look no further than the fruit salad. I know what you're thinking. Fruit salad is usually a mixture of stale melon and grapes that have lost their flavor. Not this fruit bowl. It's a seasonal mix of berries, apple, fresh melon, mango, and sometimes coconut. It puts all other fruit salad to shame. . . Now, I want you to be careful with this next item because it can be quite addicting. You will find yourself going completely out of your way to have the hot barista make you a cup of their chai latte. This stuff isn't just good... Its orgasm inducing! You'll never look at Starbucks the same after you've had a sip of Toast's chai.. . Oh, before I go I have to get this off my chest. For the last year or so I've been hearing the wait staff say that their cupcakes are what they are famous for. If I were them I wouldn't go around advertising this. They are not the best thing on the menu. Not only are they dry, but I can taste hints of baking soda in them... Bleh! Then, they try and cover up the fact that they have mediocre cupcakes with frosting that is far too sweet. There is enough sugar in that frosting to kill a small family of squirrels. Instead of a cupcake opt for one of their chocolate muffins.
