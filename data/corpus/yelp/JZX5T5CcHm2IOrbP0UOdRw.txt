Meh. This place is another notch in a long list of over rated places I've been coerced into going to. I always come with high expectations and I typically leave dissapointed. Maybe it's the hype that kills it. I've been to this place three times, and it would take some sort of miracle to warrant another visit. I guess the ramen is solid. That's why I can't rate it one star. I don't think I have the heart to give any place one star. But man, this place comes damn close. The noodles don't seem to be very fresh, and the service kinda sucks. My friend asked for a refill of his noodles and the waiters completely forgot. We waited about 20 minutes until we struck up the nerve to ask another waiter. I guess a lot of the fame of this place is derived from the special number 2. That stuff isn't appetizing at all. I convinced my friend to try it last time and I took a sip from his broth. Chalky and powdery as hell. It was thick and the bits kind of dredged onto my throat. It was awful. Plus the special number 2 had about twice the contents of a regular bowl. Real talk. They do that to make the challenge especially impossible. . So yeah, heed my warnings, there are FAR better places to go for ramen, believe me. Even the highly acclaimed spicy fried rice wasn't that great. The challenge is impossible as well, I wouldn't really bother unless you're hardcore.
