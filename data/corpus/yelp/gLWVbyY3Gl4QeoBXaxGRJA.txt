My husband and I thought this place was great! WE had no complaints at all! . He had the moo shu "chicken" I had broccoli with garlic sauce.. wonderful!!! Great flavors!! huge portions and very reasonable prices... The service was fast and friendly. . We are actually planning on eating here again before we leave for Knoxville.
