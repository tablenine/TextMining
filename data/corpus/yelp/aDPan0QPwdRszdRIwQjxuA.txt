For the Buckhead area, this is the best we've got going.  I live in Buckhead so Buford Hwy joints are sometimes too far for something quick and close even if there are better deals out there.  . . What I order:  Ramen(!!), agedashi tofu, sesame spinach, sushi, sashimi, and tempura.  . . Pros: ample parking, convenient location, very very casual, authentic cuisine, and great service.  I think they have Kirin on tap. . . Cons:  small and cozy place - quite a wait at prime dinner time.  . . If anyone knows of any good ramen places in town, please spread the word!
