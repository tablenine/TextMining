YUMMM. i crave daikokuya. Some of the best ramen and the best part about it is the pork soup base! Once you get seated with that steaming bowl of deliciousness in front of you, it is easier to forget about the wait. . . yes, ramen should, perhaps, not cost as much as it does HOWEVER. for the experience of awesome ramen its okay to splurge ! if you dont want their ramen then i highly recommend their donburi which is soo tasty :)
