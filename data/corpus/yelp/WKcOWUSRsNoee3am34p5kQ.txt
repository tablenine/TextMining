Y-U-M. The only bad thing I have to say about Alcove is that it's too darn far from West LA. This would definitely be my Sunday morning ritual if it were closer. I do love me some breakfast so I was overjoyed when my friend brought me here. The outdoor patio was awesome and despite my initial worries with this "just-in-time" seating, my worries were unfounded. She and I found a nice spot under the tree and despite Alcove being located on Hillhurst, conversation and the leisure of the day was great. On to my order: I should've gone with my gut feeling and gone for the omelette but I'm a sucker for a french bread. I wasn't disappointed though... I also couldn't figure out what to do with the super tangy dipping sauce. Her dish, though, was definitely a hit with me. You know how there's that saying of, "someone else's dish always looks betters than yours", and I will say was quite true this time. Usually when I have as rich and filling of a meal I turn into the human Chinese sloth but this wasn't the case from the Alcovian breakie. That probably speaks to the quality of the ingredients. After Alcove we ended up taking a walk in Griffith Park but then felt a little more ambitious and drove all the way up to the Observatory. Great sunshine, great food, great things to do in LA. All you Right coasters are missing out!
