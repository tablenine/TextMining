Service is great, you will never have a half full glass. The waiters sure work for that tip. . . Had dinner with my wife and her friend who was visiting from out of town. Â If you've never been to yamashiro you should go atleast once. The views are great. . I was disappointed with our meal. The meals are extremley expensive and the portions do not justify the cost for your meal. . Becareful driving up that mountain it's a narrow street!
