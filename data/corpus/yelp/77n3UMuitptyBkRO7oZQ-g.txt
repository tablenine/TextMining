Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
For my 100th review, I shall devote it to Savoy! Because it is special enough to be glorified, as can be seen by the 280+ reviews here on Yelp!. . Before I had Savoy's Hainan chicken, I disliked any type of Chinese-style chicken. I thought it was dry and bland. Even the few Hainan chicken dishes I tried was nothing special. That is until my tongue became acquainted with Savoy's.. . . OMFG, it is sooo delicious. The chicken is so flavorful, so tender, and so moist that it melts in your mouth. You have not tasted chicken until you've had it here at Savoy's. I normally also do not favor ginger, and tend to avoid it, but that ginger oil sauce is out of this world. If I could, and if it were healthy, I could eat this every day. It's excellent value for what you get. I'm a heifer that likes good food, and good value so I usually take a box home to savor it again another day.. . The chrysanthemum tea here is also very tasty. Just the right amount of sweetness amidst the floral flavor. It's too bad they don't provide refills for these like they do the ice-tea. . . Because of Savoy, I'm like a horny teenage boy. Everytime I see "hainan chicken" on the menu of any asian restaurant, I can't help but automatically start fantasizing and craving hainan chicken. And to momentarily satiate my craving, it would be difficult not to order it and hope that it's comparable. Unfortunately, each time I do I'm disappointed because nothing comes close. If anyone knows of a place as good as Savoy's, please let me know. Because I don't. For now, it is the undefeated champ of the Best Hainan chicken!
