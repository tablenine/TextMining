I recently went there for their "burger week" and tried their signature aged prime burger. The food was amazing. Burger was well prepared and came on a great bun. . . That being said, there were many issues that would prevent me from going back. First, the service. I met a friend there for lunch around 1 on a weekday. She said the hostess ignored her until I arrived. Apparently they ignore single, pretty ladies in their 20s but will respond to a boisterous man's voice. In any case, after calling the night before to make a reservation and learning they did not take reservations, we were told it would be a half hour wait. So we decided to sit at the bar. Thankfully we were able to snatch up the last 2 seats. . . The bartender/waiter was terrible! We were sitting at the bar for cryin' out loud, how bad could service be?! But apparently we weren't the most important customers in the place because it took him way too long to take our drink order. Then they were out of Sam Adams beer (how can you be out of a beer that's specifically on the menu as a special?) Then too long to take our food order. Thankfully the food came out quickly. . . And one thing about the burger week menu, everything is a la carte. Cheese, $1. "Asiago/Truffle" fries were $6 and were a pathetic serving size. Heck, even ketchup and mustard was a la carte and cost $5. So the $5 burger week is deceptive. It's only $5 if you want a lonely burger on a plate. Â . . Overall the food was excellent but the service, ambience (it's in the lobby of a hotel) and cost were terrible. Needless to say, I won't be going back.
