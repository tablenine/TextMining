I didn't like this place at all. First of all, its super crowded and really loud. The food was wayyy overpriced. I got a $9 duck and it was about 5 thin slices. Really? I could've gone to Sam Woo's and gotten a whole duck for that price. I tried some of the chicken, it was really bland and dry. The only thing I will say was good, was some sort of roll that my friend ordered. Lame that I can't remember what it was hah. I shouldn't have had so many beers.. . Before going here, I knew it was going to be super expensive so I can't really say I was that disappointed. I hate these hipster upscale sushi places that charge an arm and a leg for some sub-par food. Alan's getting mad.
