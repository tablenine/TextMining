Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Do you have out of towners wanting a great LA dining experience? This place will definitely give them a new taste of LA. Not pretentious &amp; trendy like the rest of LA's restaurants. It's just a great overall dining experience. This place is in the heart of WeHo (la Cienega and Melrose); It's got a combination of creative favorful dishes with great presentation; dim lighting with hip decor; interior and patio seating; what more can you ask for? I love this place and come back time and time again with a new group of friends. They never disappoint ;o)
