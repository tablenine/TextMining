Yes - we watch DDD's just as it seems alot of others had. We tried to get a Cemita last Friday and were out of luck. The handsome looking son dude who was the main guy on the episode of DDD's was there- telling us how sorry he was that they were out of Cemita's. I told him it was totally okay! I could understand how their restaurant's life probably got flipped upside down after DDD's aired. . . So - we decided to eat their anyway - I had 2 tacos - 1 carne asada, 1 Al Pastor. My husband went with 2 carne asada tacos. The carne asada tacos were delicious! The salsa's they had on the table were great too - I really liked the green sauce. I guess the other was a hot sauce and the other a chipolte sauce. The pork (Al Pastor) was good as well. My husband thought it was a little over flavored.. . My husband had his favorite Coke in a bottle. It's sooo much better than american coke in a can I think because it's make with real cane sugar instead of the high-fructose crap we have in the US. I ordered a cup of (H)Orchata - it was great! It's made with real cinnamon shavings so there are little brown things floating in it, but it's really cinnamon - the cute owner dude assured me.. . I can't wait to go back and try a cemita and some new goodies!
