Went here for an early Saturday dinner... We had 9 in our party so they seated us at a large table towards a semi-secluded part of the dining room. Nice space... Dark and eclectic decor. I liked it. Reminded me of a large restaurant in the City. . . Our appetizers were Fiori di Zucchine which were fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with ricotta and parmesan cheeses. Delish. I highly suggest it. About 6-7 pieces with garnished cherry tomatoes along side. I wish it came with more. The other app was baked oyster mushrooms with parmesan, balsamic vinegar, garlic and olive oil. Also tasty.. . I ordered a pizza... I got the pizza di sofia which had genoa salami, tomatoes and mozzarella. It was good. But a lil salty... And I like salty. So if I'm saying it, it might be too much salt for the average diner. Only ate half the pizza. Not because of the saltiness but It was suprisingly filling for a thin crust pizza. It was a good sized pie for one person... But hard to slice on your own with just a knife and fork. . . On to dessert... I ordered the Nutella stuffed "fritters" served with hazelnut ice cream. It was DAMN good. Came with about 4 of these slightly bigger than bite-sized doughnuts of perfection. Wish the order woulda came with more... . . Overall. I liked Terroni. Will have to try other things on the menu besides pizza. Stay tuned....
