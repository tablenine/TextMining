Restaurant: Stats
Category: American (New)
The newest spot by Concentrics Group (One, Two, Trios, Tap, etc)., Stats is a sports bar with a refined edge. Located close to Philips Arena and  The Dome, Stats serves fancied-up versions of American classics like fried chicken and open face turkey perfect for pre-gamers who want a more unique experience than previously available in this area. . . The atmosphere is comfy but posh, with leather booths and low lighting. Unique to this spot are the Table Taps - high top tables with built-in, self-serve taps that keep track of how much you pour. Flat panel TVs line the walls and game scores scroll below to keep you up to date on all your teams. Stats also offers multiple room options for private parties.  . . The menu offers variety in a reasonable price range, with a full range of starters, entrees and delicious desserts. The drink selection is vast- with a variety of beers, wines and mixed drinks. While the specialty drinks will run you $9 a glass, the beer prices are on-point. . . Recommended: Mexican Butter, Open-Face Turkey Sandwich (like Thanksgiving on a plate)
