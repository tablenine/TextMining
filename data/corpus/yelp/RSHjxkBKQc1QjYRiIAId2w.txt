I'm not a vegetarian but I love the food at Mana.  The sliders are by far my favorite dish.  Between the two of us we ordered 4 dishes and split them. I left full and happy.  However, the place is TINY especially in the Winter since there isn't any outdoor seating  We went early on a Thurs. night and had to wait 45 min. for  table. HOWEVER, they take your cell number and call you so you can walk to any of the bars in the area and have a drink while you wait.  You could have a drink at their bar, but seriously, there is NO room so I suggest going somewhere else.  Food is a 5-star, location/venue is a 3-star, so I'm averaging them into a 4-star revue.
