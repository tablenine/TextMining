Sweet potato fries are bomb bomb. waffle fries are inconsistent but 4 stars, I mean its a fried grid of potato, how can it be bad?. . burgers are alright considering theyre $1 but the best thing is the concept because its pretty fun if you're looking for a laid back night with some friends. I enjoy their music as well. . . shots arent really worth $2 because theyre pretty non-alcoholic but beers are $3 so stick with those!
