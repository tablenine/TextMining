I came here with some friends after a UCLA graduation for dinner. The place is in the middle of Westwood and is simply gorgeous inside. Really modern, new-age like decor. Since the place looked so good, I thought, "Wow, I hope the food tastes and looks as good as this place.". . So we get to sit at this long table, on the lower floor and get our menus. "Geez.. the prices are outrageously high!" I sit there and calm down that thought, and replace it with, "Well, perhaps the food is just THAT good." I'm not hungry so just order a plate of pasta. I can't even remember the name of it. I just remember that it was BLAND, NOT GOOD, and SMALL. There was barely anything on my plate and it was an entree. I really felt I got ripped off, and was just helping them pay the rent for this place. . . The service was alright and I only give this one star for that service and how gorgeous the restaurant is. I heard from friends, that this place has got a new owner and supposedly improved the place. Â I wish it was improved when I went.
