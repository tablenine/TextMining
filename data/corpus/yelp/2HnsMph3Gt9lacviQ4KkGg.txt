Wow. There's no point even writing a review, everyone has pretty much covered this place. I never order salads. My friend forced me to order the mexi-chop salad. I never wanted to stop eating it that damn salad. She got the veggie enchiladas which were soso good. . . Very reasonably priced, parking on side streets, middle of everything, worth a trip.
