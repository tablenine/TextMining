Mmmmm..... . . Went with the plate of boiled shrimp and two sides. . The shrimp was medium in size and plentiful. I wish I had counted, but I am guessing there were 10. Seasoned with Cajun spices and cooked to perfection. . . For my sides I chose the potato salad and Cajun corn. The potato salad was standard, being a little on the sweet side. Not my fave, but still good. The corn was boiled with Cajun spices and we agreed to the addition of butter. I really liked the corn, but I think I will skip the butter, as it did not necessarily enhance this already flavorful corn.. . This place is not fancy, but sparkling clean and you can expect service with a smile. Orders are put in at the counter and your food is brought to you on Styrofoam plates, which can be eaten at the three tables inside or at the two tables on the sidewalk outside. . . Fancy or not, who can beat a delicious plate of shrimp, potato salad and corn for $6.95. You can bet I will be back.
