So the disclaimer is i've never had f.o. anywhere so this a review about the first time.  . . My group of friends and I got here around 8pm on a Friday night.  I'm hungry, starving, wanting my burger now.  You got to be kidding me...there's a line?  Is this a club?  Maybe we should get a bottle so they'll let us in.  . . Well the wait wasn't all THAT long but it felt like eons to somebody who was hungry enough to eat a horse.  . . Order at the bar.  There is no table service, oh and tables are first come first serve, so you may need to be a vulture and park yourself near a table that looks like they'll be done soon, but then there's the gamble of how they might just stay at the table for drinks.  . . The burger is to die for.  I haven't had many burgers as good as this one.  Red and bloody, just the way we ordered it.  The regular fries are the little tiny thin ones, too crispy for my liking, good thing we got the sweet potato fries on the side.  The sweet potato fries are the best I've had. hands down.  Don't ask for ketchup, they will scoff at you (not that I did, I heard this from somebody else).  Instead, dip their fries in their signature white sauce... it is garlicky, aioli-y creamy, delicious.  . . The beers are delicious and on tap, so is the wine.  The hard apple cider isnt too sweet and tastes great.
