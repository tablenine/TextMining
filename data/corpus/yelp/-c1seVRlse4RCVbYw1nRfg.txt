Just a few comments I made during dinner at HB last night:. "How have I not been here before!". "I want to come here every night!". "Hmm...maybe I should just move in?". . Yes, it's THAT good! HB had me at the cozy, romantic atmosphere and that it's BYOB, but it was the food that really blew me away..... . Appetizers:. Shrimp cake (a special of the evening): um, delish!. Almond stuffed dates: Yep, the hype about these is true. And I didn't even think I liked dates, but apparently I do once you wrap them in bacon and bake them in brown sugar.  . . Entrees:. Salmon for me: I ate every last bite. Chicken for my friend: loved the mushroom risotto that came with it. Mussels for my friend's man: Largest portion of mussels and fries I've ever seen and I think he enjoyed it because he ate it all. We were hoping for a free meal since he's probably the only person able to finish those mussels, but not so much.. Pork pie special for my husband: He only ordered this after making sure my friend dining with us (who works for the Jewish Federation) wasn't offended.  I had a few bites (sshhh- don't tell my rabbi) of this dish that resembled a shepard's pie, but was so much better. YUM!. . Dessert:. 2 orders of bread pudding, because we couldn't get 1 after reading the rave reviews for it on Yelp.  And OMG, we should have ordered 4 orders of it.. . The portions were quite large and it ended up being about $75/couple (love that byob makes everything more affordable), which is quite a good deal for the quality of the food/service.. . Yeah, I think I may just move in.  Don't worry HB, I'll bring my own air mattress...just get some bread pudding ready for my stay!
