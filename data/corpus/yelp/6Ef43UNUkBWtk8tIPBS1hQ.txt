I went with a hangover and left without one. I think it was the bowl (literally) of chai. . . I went to Uncommon Ground with two friends for a late Sunday lunch. We started with the mac and cheese for a hearty appetizer. Yum! I enjoyed the burger with sweet potato fries. Holy mackerel, it was sooo good! I completely forgot about my previous headache. The decor was nice and cozy, and some weird paintings gave it that quirk factor. There was even a fireplace, where I would have parked it if I were alone with a book. I didn't think it was overpriced at all. There was a lot of food on my plate. I was also jealous of my friend's tomatillo soup. Yummy! I would go again, for sure!
