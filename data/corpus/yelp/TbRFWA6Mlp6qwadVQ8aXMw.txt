You want the best bread-meat (and possibly cheese) combination in Los Angeles? Then go to the place that has been serving french dips for over 100 years. . . Philippe's is that old school spot, where you stand in line and order from a snappy woman who expects you to know what you want and state it clearly and immediately. I am never let down by the dips or the sides.. . For me it's usually a lamb and blue cheese, although the beef is just as popular, or the pork and swiss. Man do I love their pork. Double-dipped, always double-dipped. And it's right up there with Canter's for my favorite potato salad in LA. I like my potato salad a little sweet and that's how they do it at Philippe's.. . Don't forget the sinus clearing mustard that is available at every table. Use cautiously because it can wreck your taste buds for a bite or two, but it is very complimentary when used with care.. . Don't forget to grab a pack of peanut m&amp;m's from the candy stand on your way out, or some pie, coconut cream is the best.. . Not changing their formula has kept Philippe's in business for 100 years and it will keep them around for another century because it's that simple and that good.
