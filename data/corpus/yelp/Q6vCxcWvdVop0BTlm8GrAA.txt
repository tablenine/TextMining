I really liked this place. It reminded me of NY. . I went with a group of 4 girls and we just did family style.. we ordered:. - this RIB EYE PASTA (is was my FAVORITE)- it had rib eye (obviously) but it was so tender. it reminded me of pot roast. the kale in it gave it great texture.. the best thing was the three-sided pasta which seemed to be baked. it was crispy.. but not too cripsy. the tomato sauce was perfect. not too heavy. i would definitely order this again. -the BLANCA pizza- yummy. i susally like pizzas with a tomato sauce.. but this was excellent.. - the PIZZA WITH OLIVES ON IT (don't remember the name)- if you like kalamata olives, then this pizza is for you. i thought it was ok. -PORTOBELLA FRIES- this was tasty.. i'm a fan of mushrooms... so this was great. ... but seriously.. anything fried is yummy.. -BEETS with GOAT CHEESE- good. -CORN with SWISS CHARD- good. also the FRENCH MACAROONS were ok. i prefer mine a little chewier.. overall...i will definitely come back
