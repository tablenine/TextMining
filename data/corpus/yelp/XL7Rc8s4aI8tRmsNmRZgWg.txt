Chances are if I haven't tried it....at some point in my life I will.... . I enter Papi's with a friend for a late lunch after a day of last minute shopping for my mother. I loved the authenticity of this place. The service seemed a little anti-social but not enough to get me fired up.. . The food was good (hence the 4 stars), I had a chicken wrap with black beans and rice. I'm not much of a bean eater so I was happy that the beans came in a separate dish. The Chicken wrap was huge and very tasty, and the seasoning for the rice was 'right on'. . . Overall I had a great time (with the exception of the barefoot screaming baby by the stairs, and the boys watching Mary J Blidge videos on their cell phones near the door) I will definitely return for another late lunch.
