Category: Specialty Food
This is the gourmet eater heaven for the rest of us who don't have the private chefs and deep deep pockets.. the food is superb. If you are taking it to go, some heating and minimal preparation might be necessary like pouring the sauce or presentation on your plate. if you are eating there - the seating is not the best since it's scarce and hard to find and seats are tight, but it gives you that european or New York feel.. their salads and sandwiches are exceptionally tasty, the deserts are awsome. You can find all the gourmet items you see in europe and exceptional fine quality restaurants or you have heard the name from people who travel. if you are have a eye for the celebrity crowd you will always run into some one there.
