Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
"Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Cherry Cola...". . Lola's boasts the biggest martini menu (that I have seen anyway) in a hip lounge setting. Two bars to choose from-- up front, more active, view to the outside-- and the back-- darker, closer, more intimate. We had a few different selections-- cucumber/lime martini, lemon drop, classic with blue cheese olives. All were excellent. Also had few apps-- excellent ahi sashimi and swordfish tacos. Service was decent, albeit a bit 'cool,' but hey, it's WeHo. Bonus? Pool table in middle room was good for a couple of quick games while we waited for friends to show up.
