OH MY GOD!!!! This restaurant is amazing. We went last night for the $30 prix fixe menu. We arrived a little late, but the owner, Johncarl, was there to great us and let us sit while we waited for another member of our party. An hour later, we were still sitting there waiting for our friend, but our waiter was gracious and continued to poor us our BYO wine. Â We had the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, edamame fritters and fried cheese to start. The dates were out of this world fantastic and far superior to the dates at Avec (which I love). The fritters were pretty amazing too. Next I had the beet salad. The flavor combinations were perfect and I could eat that beet salad everyday for the rest of my life and never be tired of it. For our main courses we had the mussels, the beef stew and the amish chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection and super fresh. . . The food was great, the service perfect and I have absolutely no complaints. If you cant tell, I love this place! GO!
