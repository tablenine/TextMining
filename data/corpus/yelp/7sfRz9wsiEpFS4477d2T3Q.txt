Last Thursday, started off at Rio Grande, got a couple margaritas (highly recommended) then headed to Rare View to cap off the night. Thought the view was amazing. The bar is set on top of the Shelburne Hotel with probably the best view I've seen in a while. The bar possesses a maing open section near the bar as well as tiny nooks and crannies that allow you to sit with a private party if need be. Drinks are a little expensive, but its Manhatten. Its less expensive then some of the other bars, but the clientele and view make up for that.
