Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
The food at Taste on Melrose is simply AMAZING!  My girlfriend and I went to Taste last night and ordered off of the Prix Fix menu.  The Mac and Cheese came out first, it was awesome, I definitely recommend it as an appetizer.  For entrees we ordered the Crispy Chicken and Meatballs. The Crispy Chicken was absolutely delicious, you should certainly order it!  Paired with a glass of house wine (for 5 bucks!) it was one of the best plates I have had in a long, long time.  For dessert we ordered the creme brule, it was great!
