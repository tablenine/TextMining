Went last night with a few friends. We ordered 4 different appetizers (the spring rolls, the polenta, crab cakes, and potstickers) and I have to say, I think the food was tasty enough, but not a big deal. I'd come back maybe for the prix fixe, but there are so many better restaurants in this city to spend money on.
