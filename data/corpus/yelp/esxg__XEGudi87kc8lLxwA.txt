Limit yourself.....to what you know is good. Burgers/Fries/Beer or Wine. STOP!. . This review is actually a lot fairer than my review of the SaMo location since I was able to sample a lot of different items that our group ordered. The result is disappointing.  To get started we ordered the cheese plate, mushrooms and sweet potato fries.  The cheese plate, served with the generic bread, and the mushrooms (which Eli commented tasted bland like you'd put on top of a pizza) were a huge disappointment.  Of course props for continuing their quality of sweet potato fries served with ketchup our table smuggled in. . . The burger was good, but we commented that the amount of bread on the bun is just a tad bit too much. If they would only put bacon on that sucker than it would be a notch better IMHO.. . The Scene:  Perfect.  The crowd is a great mix of wannabes, Chads/Trixies, industry types, emo's, cougars/kittens, and whatever. We arrived really early at 5:45, so no wait, but by like 7:30 the line had formed, which I think may be part illusionary on behalf of FO.  Given the big tables on the outside and comfortable seating, I'll never go back to the SaMo location and endure that ish over there. . . Bartenders-totally cool. No douchey dick head bartenders giving 'tude cause they can.  Trent was genuinely helpful and I appreciate that.. . So even thought the 3 stars, I'd go back and stick to 3 items only.
