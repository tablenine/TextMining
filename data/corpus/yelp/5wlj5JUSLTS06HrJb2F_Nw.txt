I don't understand why this place exists! Yes, it's an institution but so is prison really isn't it? The chili will give you the runs I can guarantee, the hot dogs are okay but the onion rings are pretty good. There's plenty of seating and plenty of parling. It's kind of gimmicky with all these souvenirs you can buy. . The people that work there are rude and incoherent. It's like they're bored and bothered that you actual want to eat there. I'd rather go to Chick Fil-A.
