This place used to be a 5-star for me (mentally). But as it turns out, the service and the quality of the food has really gone downhill in the past 5 years. I remember coming here when I was a junior in high school and loving it. I mean it wasn't busy at all, the service was fantastic, and the ramen just seemed to taste better. These days the appetizers retain the same good quality, but the soup and the ramen they use is just not as good as what you're paying for. I love the shoyu/miso ramen, and I'll still come here when I'm in Little Tokyo, but guys..don't expect much. You'll find yourself immersed in a huge bowl of soup with 1/4th of it actually being ramen.
