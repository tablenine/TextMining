Restaurant: Cafe 101
Category: Chinese
Cafe 101 is a winner in my book.  I have driven by this place way too often and finally had the opportunity to stop and eat.  I love the decor almost as much as I loved the food.  I even got a friend who is not the most adventurous eater to admit she really liked it too.. . The cucumber salad starter was really nice and I think that helped my friend's nervousness.  She likes spicy and sweet and this was a good way to start (not that the rest of the food I ordered was sweet).  I ordered the mustard greens and shredded beef and was really happy with my choice.  Gina C. said she thought it was too salty but I loved the salt.  It was perfectly spiced -- not too much but my nose was running a little.  I also ordered the pea shoots and they were great.  My friend ordered the stir fried vegetables and added chicken to it and had them cook it in a brown sauce rather than the typical white sauce.  Her dish was great but it could use a little more salt.  It did have a really nice 5-spice flavor, which I love.. . The decor is great -- the walls are decoupaged with some high fashion, artsy fartsy pictures.  One of our servers kind of laughed when she noticed we were staring at the wall and said, "there are some dirty pictures, huh?".  It's definitely entertaining.  Speaking of the service -- it was great.  Everything was super fast but very polite at the same time.  I will definitely be back because next time I want some bubble tea and a shaved ice dessert.
