Basically, I think these people need to get over themselves. That's what happens when you get too popular. I think they're up to around $11.00 for a pastrami now. If I wanna go skiing, I head to the mountains, not Fairfax. Translation: STEEP. . . There's no law that says "Must Go to Canter's." In my opinion, Langer's near downtown has a better pastrami. They're a lot friendlier, too. And if you bring a little extra cash, you can buy a fake I.D. or social security card from one of the "merchants" on the street. What could be better than eating a good sandwich and assuming a new identity?
