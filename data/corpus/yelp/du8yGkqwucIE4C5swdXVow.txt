This restaurant is a tiny mom and pop type of joint.  It opens at 1130 am and if you don't get there by 11 am to put your name on the list, you'll have to wait until the first round of people finish eating, and that can take anywhere between 20-40 minutes.  However, it's well worth getting there early, and well worth waiting if you don't make the first cut.  I think they make their own coffee or something - it's one of the best UCC coffees I've ever had.
