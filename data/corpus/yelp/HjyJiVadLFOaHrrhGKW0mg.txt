My boyfriend and I were cold and wet from a morning down at the Printers Row book fair when we decided to come here for lunch. It was busy but there was only one person ahead of us in line and seating was no problem. We orded the wild mushroom and parmesan soup with truffle oil, a crabcake sandwich and an avocado sandwich and decided to share everything. . . The crabcake sandwich was great! The crabcakes were huge and it had a nice spicy bite to it. I'd add some honey to it if I was making it myself for a bit of sweetness to mix with the chipotle but I will add honey to everything if given the chance. The soup was so yummy and so what we needed after the cold morning. Â The avocado sandwich was good but a little lacking. The cracked mustard on it tasted great when I tasted it but my sandwich could have used a bit more. There was just so much avocado that it kind of overpowered the other flavors. I ended up spooning a little of my soup onto the sandwich to give it some zip and then I was happy.. . We'll definitely be back. It's only a few blocks away from where we live and any crabcake sandwich that good will always have a place in my heart.
