the place was cozy, dim-light, &amp; inviting. there was valet, just as most restaurants in this area--but, my bf &amp; i usually find street parking. everyone raved about the calamari, so we just HAD to order that. they were ok. we have calamari at almost every restaurant, so we have a LOT to compare to. . . the main entrees were pretty tasty. i had the parmesan halibut. it was delicious! the portions are pretty big, so expect to be bringing home a doggie bag. for dessert, we had chocolate bread pudding. it was amazing, but it took FOREVER to come out. i don't know if they were still baking the bread, or what? but it seriously took like 20 min? . . all in all, the place was nice. ambiance was nice. our server was helpful. the food was tasty, though not amazing.
