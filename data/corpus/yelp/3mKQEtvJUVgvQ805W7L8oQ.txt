So the food is consistently okay/good. But the service is consistently not so great. Our group barely made it in for late night eats after clubbing and I never felt so rushed in my life! For this, I'm docking a star from my previous review. Since it was late, we parked in the parking stx and had to fork over the 2.50 AND parked the car ourselves. What's the point of that parking attendant guy any way? That night was so annoying...
