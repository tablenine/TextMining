Restaurant: Yard House
Category: Bars
Food: Didn't try any.. . Drink: It's a good starting point for people who imbibe beer. Great for newbies to tourists like me. Draft ranges from Bud (for the newbies who want something familiar) to micro brews from the west coast (great for people like me out on the east coast). Some breweries (don't distribute to NY) to try include Bayhawk and Lostcoast. For the hell of it, tried some Cali breweries (Stone, Bear Republic) that do distribute to NY, but it tasted the same. Wishful thinking never hurt anyone did it? . Decent place to go to, until I can find or someone can recommend to me a more traditional pub.. . Service: Average. . Crowd/Ambiance: Pretty packed the days I went, but square footage is huuuge, much different than NY, so expect to have no wait to a very short wait. Layout includes a large bar in the center that has all the drafts. The long line of draft tabs looks highly impressive and inspiring, in the way of "I want one for my place." Large table and booth seating, can easily kill an hour or two there.
