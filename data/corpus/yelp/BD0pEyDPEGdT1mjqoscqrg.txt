Went here with my friend from Texas who knows some good Southernesque food when he tastes it, and this is it.  It's comfort food at its best that puts a smile on your face.  Absolutely love the mac n' cheese, cornbread, and collard greens.  I love the waffle (for some reason I like this waffle better than the other location in Hollywood), but the chicken for some reason is the least tasty to be honest -------- BUT that doesn't mean it isn't fantastic already, it's just I wasn't AS wowed by it as the other stuff, but still absolutely delicious.  Grits are good too.  The only thing is, I think it is a little expensive for what it is.  But yeah, it was a happy Easter dinner.
