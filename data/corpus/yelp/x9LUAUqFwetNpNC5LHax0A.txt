A friend and I recently set up a 4 course meal for 10 people to celebrate our bff's upcoming wedding.  George (who I am assuming is the general manager) helped us to create a partially vegan menu and we had everything in place 2 weeks before the event.  We were put in a private "nook" where we obviously got a little bit rowdy, particularly after we were given complementary lemon drop shots.  Kyle our server was quick with bringing food and drinks and was such a good sport when we asked him to take our picture...with 7 different cameras.  . . Great place for groups, not a break the bank place and the leftovers were devoured in the AM by most of the bachelorette party.
