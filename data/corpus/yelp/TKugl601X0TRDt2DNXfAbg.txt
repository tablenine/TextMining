Restaurant: STEEL Restaurant &amp; Lounge
Category: Asian Fusion
There are certainly quite a few great sushi joints in Atlanta, but what sets Steel apart is that it is also a great restaurant. The staff is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, the sushi is delicious and unique, and the bar is a great place to hang out with $5 Ketel One and soda and a sushi roll. The entire restaurant has a great vibe (check out the water wall!) and it's also a good place to take non-sushi eaters because they have rice bowls and other Asian-inspired entrees in addition to the extensive sushi menu. The chocolate volcano cake is deserving of the name: it's a dense, hot, and dangerous way to complete a meal!
