Noon on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was completely empty - weird. But the food was very good. Not not not not greasy. All white-meat chicken in their sweet-and-sour chicken, but the sauce was unusual and not good. The sesame beef was great. They give a nice amount of rice, not just a tiny scoop. Lunch specials include a wonton soup option, which is awesome. Â They have high chairs for kids, but no changing table.. . Great place, worth coming back to.
