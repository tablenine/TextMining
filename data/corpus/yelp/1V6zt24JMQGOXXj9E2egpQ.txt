I've had Sunday brunch here twice now, and both times it's been excellent.  The Italian BLT is great, as are all the egg dishes.  All the plates come with a bit of salad which is a nice touch.  The food seems very fresh and delicate, without being pretentious.  Bloody Mary is a must have - comes with a celery rim in a pint cup, garnished with a pickle, an olive, a greek pepper and a beer back  - very nice.    . . This place is also large and casual, which is nice for brunch.  I've never had to wait, and the servers are friendly and don't rush you out.  A solid spot for interesting brunch.
