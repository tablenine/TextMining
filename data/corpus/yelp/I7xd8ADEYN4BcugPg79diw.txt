Why this place deserves a 4...maybe a 5 in time. Its all around very ideal sprts bar.. I love the matches with their therapy method suggestions... Is hilarious if you overlooked it.. I wont give it away,but rather use it as an additional incentive when you go...and I dont smoke..just to clarify. Soo!. The food is very good all around,but the thing that makes this place noteworthy is the tater tots!. It is the perfect greasy lil fill in when one has been at the bar maybe a wee bit longer than they should.. They give you a gigantic plate full,enough to share for four. or two really hungry drunkards haha. . Good service,nice bar,i like!. just to note the pic used is not for this location,dont go getting lost ;)
