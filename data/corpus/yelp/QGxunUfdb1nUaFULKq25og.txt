I came here for my cousin's b-day... and I had sooo much fun!  We sat in the back area where 3 big tables were reserved for us, and we sat down to a bunch of food set up for us.  I started chowing down before they even brought the meat.  It was a lot of fun cooking the food on the stove in the middle of the table... though I was a little worried about all the raw chicken juices that were overflowing off the plate that they brought over to us.  I just made sure that everything was cooked very-very-VERY well.  I didn't get sick, so it's all good.. Since they knew that my cousin was the guest of honor, they came over with two champagne bottles and "champagned" her!!! Basically popped open the bottles and sprayed it all over my cousin... it was friggin hilarious!!! Now I know why special occassions are seated in the back.  My only piece of advice... if you're the guest of honor, bring extra clothes and don't wear mascara!... oh, and come on an empty stomach!. ...maybe not the cleanest place to eat... but with the right company, you'll have fun and the food's really good
