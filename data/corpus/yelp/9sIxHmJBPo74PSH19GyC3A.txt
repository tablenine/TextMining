Now it is a large slice of pizza, and there was nothing wrong with it.  I don't. find it particularly extraodinary either.. Yeah, $3.50 - it's big but it just CHEESE.  Should you want pepperoni in your pizza, ( not that anyone would.) all of a sudden you're paying 4.75.  And is you want a soda, Fuggedaboutit, it's 1.75.  I bet Il Mulino charges less fro a coke.  For that price, you could get  slice of the best pizza in NYC.  ( Lombardis, possibly.)  Or you could get a slice of quiche from Bouley, which is surprisingly like a really good pizza.  The servers are pleasant, but I see nothing extraordinary or above average about it.
