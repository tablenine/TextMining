Ooof, it pains me to have to write this but in fairness I must. . . There is nothing more disappointing than taking friends to a place you brag about and having the experience be less than stellar. The atmosphere itself was still great but the food was a partial let-down.. . This past Friday night (11/27) it was packed with the usual mix of dating couples, young friends and families, which was cool because that's always part of the experience. Hookah to the right, belly dancer to the left and FABulous music.. . The bread was still a hit but the Tahini Red Snapper I'd loved so much the last time and recommended to my cousin was disappointing. The fish itself was actually well-seasoned but it had practically none of the delicious lime tahini sauce that made it so great the first time. What little sauce was there had a grainy texture and floury tase, like they really didn't have any tahini and were trying to improvise. No hint of lime whatsoever.. . So, it was embarrasing that my cousin ordered this for her bitrthday meal and I knew it wasn't all it could be. Her friend ordered the Chicken Iskendar. It came out looking like a crust-less frozen pizza made up of flat, 2-inch square pieces of chicken topped with sauce and a yogurt drizzle.. . The fiance said right away it was not authentic and the person eating it said the sauce tasted like canned marinara. He didn't even eat a third of it before giving up and resorting to the bread.. . I don't know what was going on in the kicthen that night but at this point I have to say consistency is a problem. Thank goodness the Mezze plate was great. I hope to be able to update again with a review of redemption for the kitchen.
