Good food. I've had Alice's Breakfast Sandwich which was pretty darn delicious. I ordered a mimosa which was cute because they brought out a little kettle of o.j and a baby bottle of champagne so you could pour it yourself. . . Homemade sausage patties are pretty delicious. Overall a good place with good food.. . Doesn't get 5 stars because too many hipsters who think they are all movers and shakers hanging out but service was good, great food and love that it's open 24 hours.
