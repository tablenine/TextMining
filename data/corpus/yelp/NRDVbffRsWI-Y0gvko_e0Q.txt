Being the 790th reviewer, I don't know how much more I can add to this place, other than it's one of my top favorite places to eat in LA, and if you're visiting or haven't gone, you need to. Especially on a nice sunny day.. . I've only been here for brunch (multiple times), and each time was impressed with the food. Orange juice fresh squeezed, yum. Big portions for the prices = take leftovers home and make 2 meals out of it. French vegetarian panini, American breakfast, huevos rancheros, you name it...it's allllll reallllllllyyyyyy good. Staff is friendly, and although the food takes awhile to come out, it's all good.. . Haven't tried dessert or really any other lunch items...so I'll be heading back here ASAP =) Cute cute cute decor and really good food, you can't ask for more!
