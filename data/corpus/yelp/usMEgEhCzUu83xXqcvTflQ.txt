Gorgeous space, amazing food, STRONG cocktails.. . Our waiter was a BIT weird, but hey, he's an actor - I'm sure.  He ACTED the menu and specials.  Very creepy Scientology stare.  (shudder). . My b/f and I like to canoodle, so they sat us at the corner round table to accommodate our kisses.  We were in a hurry, and they brought our food super-fast.  We had a great time, and I can't wait to go back to have a more lingering meal.. . It's a beautiful space - dark and romantic for a bistro.  Me likey.  No kids.  Do not bring kids to ruin someone else's special evening.  Get a sitter!
