Me and my husband went here for date night. The food is good, it lingers with you for days though. I remember it was still coming out of my pores the next day. Try the garlic ice cream.....where else can you say that? It was tasty! I liked the mood lighting. We got a table for two that had a curtain which made it more intimate along with the soft/dim lighting.
