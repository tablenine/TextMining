Restaurant: Green Sprout
Category: Vegetarian
Some friends and I were supposed to meet up for dinner at Ru Sans, but it was insane, so we decided to try something different, and so we found ourselves at Green Sprout. Now, I was extremely excited, because I recently went back to my vegetarian ways (I was a vegetarian for a couple of years in college), and so the prospect of a fully vegetarian restaurant was, well, exciting!. . The place itself is rather plain, but the food is well... how should I say this; out of this world?? They have pretty much every meat substitute that you could ask for (chicken, fish, beef), and of everything that I tried, NOTHING was short of amazing. Lettuce wraps? Fantastic. General Tso's "chicken"? WOW.. . Seriously, as my friend put it while we were eating, if you recently converted to vegetarianism, you could totally come to this place for your meat fix; everything is so close to the original without the guilt!!. . This is definitely a place for anyone that loves great Chinese food who wants the added benefit of eating vegetarian. I can't wait to go back!
