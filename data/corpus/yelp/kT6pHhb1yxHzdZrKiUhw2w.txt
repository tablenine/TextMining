The dining room looks tiny, and not terribly inviting, but that's fine for this takeout-junkie.  The first time I ordered from Green Sprout I tried a little of everything, and learned what I don't like, mostly faux salmon.  I think it was the Salmon Filets with Black Bean Sauce, but I seem to have blocked the experience from memory.. . In general, I'm more a fan of tofu and vegetables than anything resembling meat that is decidedly not meat, but one can eat a bit of both here, and cheaply!  The servings are huge, and the prices are seriously underwhelming.. . Amongst my current favorites are the Curry Spring Rolls ($2.75 for two) - what is IN those things?  They're amazingly good!  Tastes like curried potatoes, but I'm okay not knowing.. . Next, the Bean Curd Skin Filled with Bean Sprouts ($8.75 for a portion that will last me days, no lie!) may sound weird, but it's addictive, and even better cold the day after.  Sure, there are assorted dipping sauces that come with the Spring Rolls and the Skins, but since it's all in a bag I'm never sure which is meant to go with which, and I like both plain anyway, although it can be fun to experiment.  I love the texture of the bean curd skin, chewy and delicious, and the sprouts all crunchy inside!. . The Stuffed Zucchini with Chili Garlic Sauce ($7.50 for an enormous "appetizer" portion) is another favorite, also good cold the day after, but the sauce is cloyingly sweet.  I admit it can be hard to find a good sauce in most Chinese restaurants, but why oh why must that be?  Thick, syrupy, brown, unappetizing.  Eat these fried stuffed zucchini slices plain and you won't be sorry.. . These are my favorites, but it may be time to do some more experimenting, as Green Sprout has a huge menu, mostly of the faux meat variety, but worth exploring just the same.
