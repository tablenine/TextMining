Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
-This a review only on the restaurant and not the wine bar portion.. . This is not the best Italian restaurant in Culver city, there are way better ones. They don't have that much to choose from and what you choose will just be OK, like I said we have better spots in Culver city (surrounding this place there are plenty of other spots like Novecento Pasta &amp; Grill that is 1 block up from them and a few blocks over Giovanni's Trattoria &amp; Pizzeria + others). . If you want to come here for a drink/ appetizer (which aren't bad) before a movie or even a quick meal because they are conveniently across the street from the pacific theaters then I guess. . . The restaurant is not that good, but their wine bar is great and some of the appetizers when trying some wine aren't bad, usually we'll just have the pizza.. . There is street parking everywhere and there are two parking lots, one across the street from them and one less than a block away. Its in down town Culver City, so its in a really good location, just wish the food/ staff was better (staff is kind of slow.). . I recomend you try their wine bar and do appetizers or pizza and wine at the restaurant. . . The two times I've gone i didn't enjoy the food and I'll probably just be sticking to going to their wine bar that is in the back side of them.
