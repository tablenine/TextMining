These are my two loves:. 1. Picadillo a la Criolla. Ground Beef Cuban Style. EXTRA LEAN GROUND BEEF WITH POTATOES COOKED IN A TOMATO-BASED SAUCE TO CREATE THE PERFECT BEEF . 2. Bistec Picadito. Steak Strips. STRIPS OF SIRLOIN STEAK COOKED IN A SIMMERING BLEND OF BELL PEPPERS, ONIONS, OLIVE OIL, AND TOMATO SAUCE. . I wish they had places this good in the bay. If they do, someone please let me know.. I love the BANANAs. OMG, I wanted to go home and make some myself but I knew it wouldn't taste as good as the ones they make. There's something about the sweet BANANA taste and the salty meat and sauce taste that makes me HAPPY!
