Just about everyone in town knows and loves Portos. Last week, we had a corporate meeting.  Right before the meeting, I headed in to get their chorizo empanda and apple pastry with coffee for breakfast for about $3.50.  It was as good as always, and better than most bakeries in LA that charge double theirs or more, like Le Quitodiean, B&amp;;L's by Cedars Sinai, and too many others to mention.  Anyway, the corporate workshops and message was- work harder and we'll survive.  We've known that forever but the reinforcement was needed.. . After a stressful morning, came lunch.  As soon as we found out it was catered by Portos, the meeting planner got "thank yous" and high five from me, the place woke up, and the people snoring in the back of the room were refreshed, As soon as they said "You can now get in line", so everyone did.  But how did those older employees that use a cane and are given a handicap parking spot get into line before I did?   It was like the Amazing race for food. Our office always orders from there, and they've never been late or botched an order. . . Thankfully, there was a lot of very good food to go around.  We had several different types of sandwiches. There was tuna, breast of chicken, ham and two kinds of cheese, and chicken salad sandwicihes in various types of very fresh tasty bread.  Their warm potatoes roll stuffed with chorizo were awesome and were almost gone when I got there.  We also had green and potato salads and various cookies.  They ordered enough for everyone there plus 10 per cent, but except for the cookies everything was gone in an hour.Yeah, some people ate two sandwiches but they're on a low carb diet so they passed on the cookies LOL.. . It's funny how great food at a great price can change everyone's mood.  Eat happy, and you'll be happy.  After all, we are what we eat.
