Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Ramen doesn't have to be spicy to taste great. But there is a challenge here to complete their crazy spicy ramen under 30 minutes to get your face on the wall. If you've ever seen Man vs. Food, you'll know what I'm talking about. . . My review is based on the number 7 ramen, non-spicy and miso. All in all, it was average. I've had better ramen, and I've made better ramen. They are definitely big with portions and service is quick and friendly. This is very good on a cold evening and you want something that will warm you from head to toe.
