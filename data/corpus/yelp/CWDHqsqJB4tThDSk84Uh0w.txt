An out of town friend gave me the heads up on Oinkster after he saw it on Food Network. I had been planning to go but I was worried about the reported long wait. We arrived close to 10PM on a Saturday. We walked up to the counter and got our order in. After seeing Oinkster on Food Network myself I new I wanted to try the Belgian fries, pastrami and the pulled pork. My friend and I split a pastrami and the pulled pork. Both were excellent. I'm very picky when it comes to pastrami. My favorite is from Art's Deli in Sherman Oaks but I also like the wet style served at Santoro's in Burbank. Oinkster was a wet pastrami and the flavor was amazing. Pulled pork was terrific too but the pastrami won with my taste buds. Our food came quickly and we had a nice seat on the patio. After 10PM we watched a line form out the door. Apparently crowds can be a problem but we lucked out. I'm definitely a fan of the garlic mayo and chipotle ketchup too. My fries were good but I prefer fries crispier. Maybe I got an old batch. Bottom line is "I'll Be Back!"
