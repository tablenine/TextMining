Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
Sinbala is like American food with a twist.. . It's greasy, it's fried.. . Except that Sinbala tastes Taiwanese and makes you feel less guilty because they actually give you vegetables.. . I'll keep this short, the other million reviews will say exactly the same thing.
