Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Support your local hole in the wall food joints! This being one of them. Open 7 days a week.. .  Let's get to the point. $1.50 for a fish taco, $2 for a shrimp taco. I had three tacos and I was good, didn't want to over kill. From what I recall, no tax!. . All the different sauces look freshly made and you can put whatever and however amount you so choose. Be careful, some will tickle your pickle as in terms of spiciness. Also, you add your own toppings like the veggies. When you receive your tacos, it's just the tortilla with the choice of your fried, battered fish or shrimp and that's it. So be sure to add anything to your likings.. . Also, don't forget to add the special secret white sauce (no perv intended). It's really good. Not adding that will be like missing a key ingredient to yumminess. **Updated/edited - it's called "Magic sauce." Thanks Kiki for reminding me.**. . Water was $1. The ladies behind the counter and fryers are real nice and smiley.. . This is as simple as it gets. Cheap prices and a very petite menu. If the battered fish/shrimp comes out a bit oily, just wrap them up in the napkins a bit before adding toppings and devouring.
