Good hang.. I like the staff.. The food is pretty good.. . Get the normal wings.. . They're spicy wings are just black pepper spicy. Â The black pepper taste coating of the spicy wings brings out this weird...dishsoap? flavor that I know now is not worth ordering.. . The house salad is awesome. . The morokyuu is really good.. . Agedashi dofu and all their meat is ace!. . DING!. goodjob
