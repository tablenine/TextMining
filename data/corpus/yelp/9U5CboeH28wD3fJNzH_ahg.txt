I've heard of this place sooo many times,. finally tried it before going to disneyland on memorial weekend.. Like some of the other people on the review, I don't get the hype either.. I tried beef and lamb sandwiches, and cole slaw.. They weren't bad but really had nothing to rave about.. Our double dipped sandwiches were actually dry.. Meat quality however was pretty good, and we liked their hot mustard.. Cole slaw tasted like any other cole slaws... Our visit here was more for the experience i guess.. Oh, and the fact that its cash only kind of bummed me out.. This place must make hella bank, I don't get why they still don't take cards? X(
