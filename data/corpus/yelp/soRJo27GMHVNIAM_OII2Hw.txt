Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
We were excited to go to El Tepeyac ever since we saw it featured on Man v Food, because my husband couldn't resist the temptation of taking on one of Manuel's Special burritos. I like Mexican food, but he could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and still love it. That said, he got about a fifth of the way through his Machaca burrito and couldn't eat a single bite more. Not because of the size of the thing, but because it was so tasteless and dry. We waited outside for that? . . I got the Carne Asada quesadilla and the meat quality was really bad. I had about five mouthfulls and two contained chunks of gristle and fat. The flavor was pretty bland although the best thing about it was the cheese. . . This place was a huge disappointment. I think we'll be sticking with our local SFV Mexican joints from now on.
