Beer snobs will enjoy this place. . I went here one lovely friday evening after work. Didn't have any trouble finding parking. . The place has this great minimal stark modern feel to it, The chair's are pretty uncomfortable. My suggestion is sit at one of the long tables, grab a spot by the bar or your booty is gonna be bruised from spending the entire evening in that uber hip modern looking chair.. Thanks to the eye candy behind the counter for the beer tasting and suggesting Konings Hoven/ La Trappe.. . La Troppe was a great complement to my duck &amp; bacon jalapeno sausage. The fries with chipotle aioli were delish. I left satisfied, and ready for a nap! . . Thanks Wurstkuche, Best Sausage i've had
