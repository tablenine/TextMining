Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
I came here last night with friends to celebrate NYE and my birthday. We went to The Village, located upstairs, and it was lovely. The ambiance was romantic, dimly lit and the whole place beautifully painted with murals.. . The service was great, upon hearing me say it was my birthday, the waiter notified a manager and out of nowhere came this old, large, happy Italian man singing/screaming happy birthday with a piece of cake, including a pink candle, pink is my favorite color! When it came time to say my name, he said Miss America. Loved it.. . The food was pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but good. Portions are HUGE and prices are pretty decent for the area and servings. The martini I enjoyed was way yummy, but pricey. . . I'd love to come back and enjoy another dinner here.
