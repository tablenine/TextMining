Okay, so when you wake up in the morning thinking of brunch, do you dream of Chinese delivery?. . We arrived at Straits for Sunday brunch at noon (an hour after they open) and unlike Highland Bakery, Flying Biscuit or Eclipse di Sol....the place was empty.  We were literally the only table.  The service was very attentive (obviously) but we were quite surprised at the limited (and odd) menu.  More surprising were the prices.  Sides: cheese grits, fries, bacon were $5 each!! . . So, I ordered the $11 french toast expecting to get a heaping plate of thick, delicious sweet bread and fruit.  Don't you always think that you get sooo much food when you order french toast at most places?. . Well, listen.  Straits served me two slices of ordinary white bread with fruit drenched in a strange green sauce.  Apparently this is the Asian-fusion part.  We received a little cup of this sauce and well, it smells exactly like the fried wontons you receive with your Chinese takeout to drop in your soup.  . . Not good!  Definitely won't be back.
