Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Really fresh sushi for a great value -- and really, how many Japanese restaurants in LA can you say that about?  Menu is pretty basic, but it's all done very well.  The combo meals are a great deal too.  . . Plan to go really early.  It's also cash only - although there is a cash machine if you need.
