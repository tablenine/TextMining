I'm sorry, Johnny's, but I did not have the same great experience as the rest of the Yelpers here.... . I have seen Johnny's ordered by friends many times and finally decided to check it out. I'm sorry to say this is the worst pizza I can remember having, pretty much ever. Except for maybe Pizza Hut. Based on other results, I'm guessing we may just have gotten a bad pie, but here's what was up:. . - Thin, thin crust - it was more like a flatbread than a pizza. - My side salad tasted dirty/earthy, like maybe they didn't wash the mushrooms or something. - Our waitress took our order, walked away, came back about 30 seconds later and didn't remember a thing we had ordered. - She never returned to ask if it was good (they never do when I actually have a complaint!). - The toppings were horribly distributed - my bf's provolone was just a slice laid on top that only covered a portion of the slice instead of being spread around. . This is a cool looking neighborhood joint and I really wanted to like it - but I couldn't even eat the salad and the pizza was not even average. If I give it another try, I will update my review, but I don't know if I'll be back with other alternatives so close by!
