this place is fabulous, a bit small but they have the best breakfast burrito in lincoln square and beyond! in fact, i'm missing brunch right now because i'm at work, but that's off the topic. the waitstaff is great, it is definitely casual. my waiter was just beyond, enjoying his very own breakfast burrito in the back and it was fine! my coffee was full and i remember those days. lots of strollers and no screaming babies! maybe it was just my day. and unlike most smaller places, they have ample (ample, yes) seating for groups of four...possibly the most important of brunch requirements. . . loved it! and there's great chotcke shopping on the square, bring cash because it's mostly small independent businesses.
