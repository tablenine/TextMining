Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
My experience at Pops was somewhat colored by the fact that we were taken care of by a fellow Yelper. But all three of the people who served us -- Andy, Randy, and the woman who took over -- Mandy? -- were very knowledgeable about the shampoo, and able to talk about it to people who knew nothing. Speaking for myself, at least. There are champagnes and other sparkling wines for every budget -- one ran $62, and I'm sure that was only a mid-range bottle -- but the food is very reasonable. $6 salads and $8 sandwiches. Unfortunately, that's for the summer lunch menu, which ends soon.. . The location in Lakeview was cute and concealed -- a nice place to take your mistress. The downtown location is casual classy. Wall length windows open onto the active intersection of State and Ohio, offering views of workers, shoppers, and tourists. Seating is available at the bar, at cafe tables, and on comfy couches with little side tables. I felt like Ingres' "Odalisque." The room is open and airy, with highlights of silver, black, and gold. Take a date here, and you're getting some. I'm just sayin'.
