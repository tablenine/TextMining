I hit up GKB again and went with the Yankee burger and the sweet potato chips.  My first impression this time was that it is definitely a bit overpriced.  Not a lot, but I felt like I was getting a little less than what I was paying for.  . . Anyway, the Yankee burger was good.  I definitely enjoyed it as I thought I would, but it seemed like it could've been a bit better.. . The sweet potato chips were disappointing as all the sides have been for me.  The chips were unevenly cooked and unevenly seasoned.  The dipping sauce was pretty decent, but the chips just weren't up to par.  . . Overall, I like this place, but I wish the prices were a bit better and, more importantly, the sides were actually worth getting.    . . 3.5
