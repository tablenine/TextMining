Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
i guess the place is good because the hot dogs have a variety of ingredients and it's a famous landmark or whatever. . . but the line is TOO LONG! i waited about an hour and a half. and of course, by the time i get to eat, i'm starving and anything at all would taste good. -_- maybe that's their technique. lol. . This is the type of place where it's nice to try once, but i wouldn't go there again, just because of the long wait.
