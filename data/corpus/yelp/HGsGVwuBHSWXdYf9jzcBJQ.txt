Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
Pick Me Up has kind of become my second home over the last couple of years. I perform across the street at Stage Left with pH Productions improv comedy group, and before and after many shows this is where you can often find me. . . Pick Me Up, to me, feels misplaced. I think it would be much more at home on the campus of a liberal arts university. The place has a distinct smell of patchoulie and hatred of one's father. . . I think the coffee drinks are super overpriced and nothing to write home about, the waitstaff while all ultra cool looking (and mostly acting) are not attentive in any way, you'll sometimes wait 25 minutes before they acknowledge you are there. The food is pretty decent though. They have the best ranch dressing in the city, and coupled with their tasty cheese fries, this fatboy is just fine. The cheese fries and brownie alone get them another star.
