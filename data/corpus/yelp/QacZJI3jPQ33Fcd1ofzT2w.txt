Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
One word - Heart-attack!!! the food here is extra fattening and extra greasy which equates to good food! A lot of people enjoy the novelty of eating a crazy hot dog which actually taste pretty good. You can expect a very long wait since this place is a must try for locals and "tourist" -minus 1/2 star and another minus 1/2 star because parking can be very hectic.
