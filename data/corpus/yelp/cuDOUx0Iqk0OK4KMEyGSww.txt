This place is seriously overrated! Surprised to see that it's got $$ as price range while to me it's more like $$$$... . I only went once and hated the waiting! Service isn't that great, while you really couldn't blame them seeing how busy they are.. Most importantly, the dumplings are OK..only OK.. kind of a let down while you heard so much about this place and finally decided to give it a try, after waiting half an hour you are served only OK dumplings that you can get from losta other places for 3/4 of the price or LESS.. oh well :/. . Ohhhh also parking can be a b* there too!
