Cute, intimate, nice lighting.  Can be crowded at the end of dinner time but the crowd thinned out as it got a bit later (Saturday night...about 10pm).. Great beer list and we had some charcuterie but didn't actually try any of the other food.  Unfortunately I am pregnant and am not drinking, otherwise I would have taken a closer look at the wine/beer list and enjoyed something.... but I didn't.  I would probably go back here.  Easy street parking right on Damen across the street.. The staff was very nice and the host was especially nice.  Not too pretentious, which is good in my opinion.
