Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Went to this spot because of my school. I was in class and we were discussing umami flavor profiles and history...anyways. someone brought up this joint and I was really enticed by it. So a month later my girl and i were in the area and we went. The place is urban and the decor is modern. Small kitchen, i swear if they had more than five employees in the back it would look like a sweatshop. . . back to the restaurant, the food hahem...burgers. well they were amazing as my girlfriend so eloquently put it...and seriously they were! full of flavor!!!! They were a healthy portion filled me up enough for me to go home and make a little more to top it off. . . So.. if like everyone else has said, their burgers are 5/5 hands down. Some of the best burgers I have ever had! unfortunately i have to give this spot a 3!!!! Man their service was not all that great. Menu was tiny! not much variety... well with that tiny ass kitchen one more item on the menu and the kitchen would not suffice.. . Now... Â for the piece d' resistance we ordered a side of fries for three bucks and we got six... literally SIX, 6, seis, zes, sechs! that means each fry was 50 cents!!!WT* that thing must have been blanchedto cook them through and deep fried in truffle oil(which would not be smart) to make them crispy which they were not. and salted with the most expensice flur de sel in the world! . . Anyways, go there for the burgers and thats it!
