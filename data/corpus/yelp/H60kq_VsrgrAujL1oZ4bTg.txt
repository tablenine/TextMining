This is a pleasant brunch spot.  The atmosphere is airy, high ceiliings exposed brick walls and interesting art work.  Prices are tolearble and all the food was quite tasty.  They have outdoor seating but it's very close to the curb so I'd suggest sitting indoors near the open large open windows.  The waitstaff was very curteous/accomidating and allowed us to move indoors mid-meal because I became too cold.  The vibe was friendly and I will go back if I'm in the neighborhood.
