I work right down the street from Tender Greens and when I'm feeling flush I treat myself to their Happy Vegan salad and tomato soup. The greens here are so good, fresh, flavorful and organic and the soup is delicious. As previous Yelpers have mentioned, the line can be atrocious at and around noon but you can order ahead and just breeze your way to the front for take-out. . . For the soup and salad, it comes to about $16.00 which seems pricey but maybe that's just the cost of the quality stuff they serve. I never feel like they're ripping me off, I just can't afford to go there too often.
