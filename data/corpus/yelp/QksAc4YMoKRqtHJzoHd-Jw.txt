Restaurant: Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
I love sushi places that bring your sushi in a boat. I love thai food restaurants that can make uber spicy food. Now if these restaurants made sweet sweet love Â their child would be Thaicoon.. . The atmosphere is great. Perfect for dates or small gatherings. Thai food is pretty good, but a little bit smaller for vegans as there is not a huge vegetarian section. Nevertheless, the sushi menu makes up for it by having ... a few vegetarian options. But they do have a huge dinner tray of vegetarian sushi that comes on a boat. The boat is not only great to look at but as you're eating sushi you can sing the Lonely Island classic on top of your lungs.
