with a line so long, I expected good things-- and i wasn't disappointed.. . greeted by our friendly server our water was filled and drink orders were taken along with an order for two pastry appetizers. . starting first with the blueberry muffin - lets just say it was still warm, super buttery with hints of vanilla, and loaded with very fresh blueberries. . the second pastry was their "famous" cinnamon roll - creamy and luscious with heavy hints of cinnamon, vanilla, and butter the frosting was an additionally wonderful addition with its sour cream cheese essence lingering throughout the palate. . Cinnamon Roll French Toast - essentially one of Yolks previously mentioned awesome cinnamon rolls cut lengthwise and griddled, quite tasty and well complimented by the maple syrup. . Peanut Butter Banana Nut Bread French Toast - thick cut and crisply fried banana bread, a small degree of egginess, strong hints of cinnamon, and all the better when topped with peanut butter - yummo!. . me likes.
