I rounded down....3.5 stars would be best. I think we may have had a new waiter but our drinks took 15 minutes and one of my friends ordered a second drink half way through the meal and it never came. Not cool. The food was very good. The guac was very unauthentic...which I like...not spicy, no lime juice and very little cilantro...I like it that way but you may not so consider this a warning. Also the chips---which are not free----are super fresh, so fresh that they were delivered with the oil still very visible. I do not need a reminder of the crap I am about to put into my body so I would have preferred to have my chips oil free. I split a taco plater (eight) with a friend and I can highly recommend the shrimp and the salmon tacos. I also tried the veggie (which should have been more accurately referred to as the sour cream) and the beef tips tacos. I would avoid those...nothing too good about them.. . It took forever to have our plates cleared and even longer to have our bill delivered. The food is good but be sure you have plenty of time to eat here because you will have to wait for everything!
