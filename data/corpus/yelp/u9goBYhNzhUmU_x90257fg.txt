I wanna be Crustyyyyy! Went here last night, and loved it. The outdoor seating could not have been more pleasant, what with all the cute dogs and good peoplewatching on Division.. . The food . . . the food! Clambake pizza, Mexicali pizza and BLT pizza - perfect size for swappin' slices with your dinner mates. This restaurant is certified organic, and while I didn't notice a mouth explosion of organic goodness, that's not the point - this is a restaurant that is leading the charge to better eati'n for us Americans. The food was delicious, and I liked the unusual varieties of pizza. . . The drinks. Mmmm. Now, I'm a girl that likes to quaff a cool one now and then, and the Grapefruit Mojito is my new favorite. I could do some damage with this one, while still getting my daily intake of vitamin C. Mix up your vices, I say! Also had a Syrah with dinner that was quite good.. . Pricey? Not especially. Maybe a little steep for a pizza joint, but this restaurant is really more than that. Our bill came to about $45 per person for 3 people - lots of food/drinks. I will definitely go back.
