Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
We waited two hours to be seated (while people who arrived after us were seated before us). The food was simply mediocre. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH WAITING TWO HOURS or 15 minutes for that matter! Also, the service was just "ok". For a restaurant with such a long wait, I expected an amazing meal but was severely disappointed. I would never go back! Go somewhere else. In a city known for its pizza, there'se just no excuse for "mediocre."
