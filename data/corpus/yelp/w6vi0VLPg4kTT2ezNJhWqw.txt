Don't get me wrong, I still love this place, but it's definitely not a place for a party of 6. We ordered from one waitress, then wanted to put in a couple more orders, so another waitress took our order, saying they all pretty much work together. Well I don't think she knew that our previous waitress had JUST put an order in for us as well, bc all of a sudden 7 plates came out at the same time and before you knew it food was cold. And there's not enough room on the small tables for all that food. They should definitely have a better system for pacing the food, especially if all the waiters are double teaming tables and not communicating with each other about it.. . I felt bad for another party who had 8pm reservations and sat down at 9:30. Reservations don't mean much at a place like this. There's not enough seating for everyone who wants to dine there, and patrons take long dinners (which is totally acceptable, it's tapas and wine afterall), so go on a weeknight to avoid the hassle. . . And the hostess here is rarely friendly. She has a tough job with a tiny space and people kind of in the way all the time, but she should really find a better attitude about it all. I think all in all the whole staff needs a personality face lift, but that probably goes for most customer service... . Still worth trying! Get the bacon wrapped dates! And the mussels! And the churros! And the mushroom risotto!! And the skirt steak! And the Pears!
