Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I had been waiting for the perfect time to write my first Yelp.... . ...and like someone in a love affair I have thought AND talked about Bottega Louie all day since eating there last night.. . The service was welcoming, prompt, friendly, genuine...etc. etc. we thorougly enjoyed interacting with the staff!!  our water glasses were always refilled, timing was precise, and we were re-marked with silverware to the T.  . . Small plates and affordable, yet versatile, menu choices made it easy to share. The food was light and delicious, but my friend and I (the amazing elite yelper below me!!) decided that the apple torte dessert was the best part. The only drawback were the rosemary potatoes which were a little on the dry side.. . Complemented with a sophisticated sleekness and New York lofty feel, the ambience is A1. (how i met your mother fans ;) Everything from the walls to the bathroom is a pristine white.. . However, I will warn yelpers, the restaurant space is definitely an "all eyes on you" place, so be careful not to trip when making a bathroom trip. . . Bottega Louie stands out with a unique vibe, excellent food, and waitstaff so good looking I was about to ask if THEY were on the dessert menu.
