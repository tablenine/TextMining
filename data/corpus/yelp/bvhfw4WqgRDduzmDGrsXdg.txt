This Yard House is always busy because of it's location. If you're planning to dine here before a game or concert at the Staples Center, make sure you give yourself around 2 hours before the event. Otherwise, you'll have to find another place to grab a bite, or be late to your game or concert.. . Pros:. - Good location/walking distance to Staples Center. - Of course the Happy Hour. - Pretty good service (taking into consideration how busy they were). . Cons:. - Usually a wait (before a game or concert, usually 45 min or more). - Of course you will have to pay for parking
