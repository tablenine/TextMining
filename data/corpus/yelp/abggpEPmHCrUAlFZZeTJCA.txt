Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Every piece of pizza that I get at Ians becomes my favorite, only to be cast off once I try a new one.  Mac n Cheese pizza- yum.  "papa bandit" pizza (potatoes, BBQ, Ranch and bacon) amazing.  And if they have it- the smores pizza is all that you could hope for.   The vibe is great, great music, fun people.  Don't expect a quiet dining experience, or a seat, if your going late night.  But yum yum yum.
