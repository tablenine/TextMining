This is not your average vegan restaurant.  You know that stupid "I can't believe it's not butter" commercial, that's how I feel about this place.  I can't believe it's not meat.  I can only speak for the two types of "chikin' sandwiches I had, but they were really good!  They were damn close to being chicken.  . . I've only been to Real Food Daily once, but wasn't too impressed.  I was definitely impressed the first and second time at this place.
