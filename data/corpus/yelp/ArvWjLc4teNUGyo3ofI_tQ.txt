I had a good experience at TDS last night. It's an efficient operation - the line moves quickly, so don't worry if you see a ton of people in line. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. . . The tacos are above average - not a huge selection, but they pretty much cover all the bases. Their salsa was excellent and chips were pretty solid too.
