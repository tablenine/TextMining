Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Came here over the weekend to finally check this place out. My introduction to Pink's was when I first heard about it on one of those cheesy dating game shows where the contestants wins a date to this place. Any how, we were fortunate enough that it wasn't super crowded and was able to get our food right away. . . Our meal consisted of the following: . . PASTRAMI REUBEN DOG - Pastrami, mustard, Swiss cheese &amp; sauerkraut - Super yummy!! . . THE OZZY SPICY DOG - Spicy Polish Dog, Nacho cheese, American cheese, grilled onions, guacamole &amp; chopped tomatoes - it was an interesting concoction, could of done w/out the guac. . . Fries, regular hot dog &amp; burger . . Overall it was a decent. It's definitely a place to visit when you're visiting LA.
