Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Day 2 in LA. Saturday.. . Our friends took to Din Tai Fung for late lunch around 2:30pm. We had a party of 6 and walked in to take a number.  The hostess was like "15 minutes" so naturally we're like "OK, that's cool."  We didn't get seated until sometime around 3:30-3:45pm. Damn, we're thinking those dumplings better be worth it. It's not like they rush people out after they're done at the big tables because there was this one party (whom I assume we were gonna get their table after the original 15 min wait since they looked like they were done) who took their sweet time--it was like slow mo for them because by the time we were seated they just got up.  Be courteous please, especially if there's a crap load of people waiting inside the front entrance due to pouring rain (I left SF to get away from the rain, and it followed!!!).. . Ok, on to the dumplings =D, wow, now I know what the hype's about, the dumplings are JUICY and AWESOME =D... I think I could totally eat an order by myself, maybe even 2 but alas, it took another hour for our order to finally finish arriving.  If all our food arrived at the same time, I think we would've gotten fuller but since it took an average of 10 minutes per order (we had 7 and 2 orders came at our 2nd to last serving), we felt that our stomachs weren't fulfilled.. . The dumplings are great and if I wasn't flying, I'd totally take a few batches with me back to SF but what's up with the super slow service--all the waitresses, hostesses and busboys were all Chinese/Taiwanese and all the kitchen staff were Latino.. . I'd come back here again though, maybe even bring my mom here =]
