Restaurant: Nava
Category: Tex-Mex
When Kevin Rathbun left Nava, our Southwestern world came to an abrupt end.. . Last night - at the insistence of our birthday boy - we returned. After years of absence, it was a pleasure to rediscover this oddly-romantic restaurant. . . If you're ever been to Santa Fe, don't miss Geronimo Restaurant on Canyon Road. I could just be making this up, but I'd wager good money on the possibility that Nava was inspired by someone's visit there - right down to the original Carole LaRoche wolf series pastels hanging on the walls of both eateries. . . SERVICE: How shall I say this? - quirky. And nice. And as I've mentioned in other reviews: Nice goes a lonnnng way with our crowd. Quirky works, too.. . FOOD: Shrimp tamales were deconstructed - big servings of husk-encased masa with herbed shrimp atop. The tequila salmon lacked the finesse of the Rathbun years - substituting a cream cheese base for the more elegant fresh Mexican cheese of yore - but it was still delicious. An entrée of barbecued short rib was almost over the top - too bad the vegetables that came with it were an afterthought. Pork tenderloin was reminiscent of a trip to Sedona - perfectly cooked. For those who think that  portion size is something worth mentioning, this is the place to go for hearty appetites. My gosh, we were full.. . AMBIENCE: This room perfectly rides the edge of kitsch versus inspirational design. We find it to be romantic and elegant - in a Southwestern sort of way, of course. Think howling wolves and starry skies and canyons.. . Recommended for special occasions.. . P.S. This restaurant falls under the TEX-MEX category in Yelp. It does Nava a disservice to lump it in with typical big-ole-plate-of-fat Tex-Mex restaurants. This is upscale Southwestern cuisine - the best of its kind in Atlanta.
