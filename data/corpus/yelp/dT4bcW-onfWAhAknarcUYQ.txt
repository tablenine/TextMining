Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
After taking in a Kimmel taping I was looking for a place to get my grub on.  Didn't want to drive too far and wasn't looking for something too exotic and remembered about Birds.  . . Just a hop skip and a jump from Hollywood and Highland I almost drove past the place as I didn't see any signs as they were either not turned on or wasn't working.  Parking was a pain as it was late and there really was no street parking, so I just parked at the market nearby and bought a pack of gum.. . As we walked in the place was smaller than I thought, but in a cozy way.  Decor was loud but mellow and the music was blazing with classic, punk and contemporary rock... nice, I like it.  The waitress was helpful, accommodating and took care of everything we needed.. . The menu has pretty decent variety for a chicken place with the usual appetizers and sides (onion rings, mozzarella sticks, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes).  The signature rotisserie was surprisingly good and moist and comes with your choice of dipping sauce.  I recommend the chipotle mayo and the artichoke-garlic mayo they go great with the onion rings, hmmmm.. . Overall this place has a great feel and some pretty decent food.  I'd recommend happy hour Wednesday and Thursday nights as all libations are half off.  Its right next door to the UCB and makes a good pre or post food stop.
