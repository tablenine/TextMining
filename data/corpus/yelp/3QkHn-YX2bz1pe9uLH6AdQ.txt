I'm not a huge fan of pancakes and french toast, but I must say, that was some daaamn good french toast I had yesterday. I got the "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast..it was basically two humongous pieces of french toast with chocolate hazelnut spread oozing from all sides. I was basically eating dessert for breakfast. It was great. . . If you can, try to get a table inside. This damn bee kept bugging my friend and I. It kept flying around the syrup container and buzzing around our heads..I swear we spent half of our breakfast just trying to avoid the stupid thing. . . If you like the Griddle Cafe...try Hash House in San Diego. It's a must.
