#10.... that's all I need.. . Meat.. with a limey sauce... ok.. well it doesn't tame my need for heat but.. that's why they don't get 5 stars.. . I tried getting the rib eye once but maybe it was too fatty so it didn't soak up as much as the sourness of the sauce.. . . I always stick to my #10.. . At least I think it's the #10.. the sirloin i think that's what it is.. I haven't been in forever but I have done my share in paying it forward and everyone i've taken has been back several times, even if it wasn't with me.. . They sell the their marinade in bottles it's like $3.00.. but it just isn't the same. . . The caramelized onions go great with each bite of the meat and then you drizzle the black beans over your rice and then finish it off with some sweet plantains... . Oh don't forget washing it down with some dos equis. . . I had the garlic chicken the first time.. it's a good way to introduce the flavors but it's definitely not as good as beef.. . I keep trying other things but i usually regret it and wish I had ordered the #10.. . I had a bad experience once with the quality of food but I felt so bad because I usually love it but the waiter immediately noticed I wasn't liking it too much and came over and asked if I wanted anything else.. . I just got more rice beans and plantains to get through the night.. and it didn't stop me from going back the next day.. . Hey guys! add some grilled jalapenos or something to the mix.. it would make me go every day with no hesitation at all.
