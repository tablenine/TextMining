Good greek, good greek. . . This place is good. Or so I thought. After 5 minutes of chatting it up with a Greek granny, I learned of 3 other greek places that she claims are much better. She's a greek granny, so I dobt she was full of it. . . But Papa has it going on. Papa offers sit-down dining inside and a small patio, a full deli and a little specialty grocery store. I've never seen so many greek olive oils in my life. The greeks are underrated for their art in oils. The staff is supper friendly and the service is good for a place that busy. Parking isn't perfect but it works. The street scene outside is happening so this would make a fine place to kill an afternoon people watching behind the bushes seperating the outdoor patio from the sidewalk. . . And now for the falafel. It was okay. Not great, but not bad. Wraped tightly but a little dry. The search goes on.
