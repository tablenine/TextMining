It pains me to write this because I love this restaurant, but I must. Please, state your policy that tables are for entree ordering only before you seat people so as to not rush them to giveaway their table. Last night i went with 3 other girlfriends and we ordered 2 pitchers of sangria and 1 appetizer. Apparently that wasnt a big enough to check to allow us a table, because we were asked repeatedly to get up &amp; move to the bar for patrons getting entrees. It totally messes up the vibe and makes you feel unwanted. On top of that, the bar is tiny and get full pretty fast..so to squeeze all 4 of use would have been annoying. We paid our bill and went to SoPo instead. The hosts need to be more clear when seating people instead of playing this guessing game of will they or wont they order and entree. Perhaps if we ordered 2 appetizers that would have sufficed. Regardless, this is my only complaint about the place. The food and music are great, especially on Thursdays.
