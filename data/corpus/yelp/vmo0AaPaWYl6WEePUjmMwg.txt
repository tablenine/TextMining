Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The Prime Rib here is absolutely the best. This place is always crowded and I doubt that will ever change. The whole experience is awesome and will keep me coming back for life. The sides here are also awesome like the creamed corn and the spinning bowl salad. If you like prime rib then you will LOVE Lawrys. The food here is consistent and is worth the drive from OC to leave home happy. . . Recommendation: The Prime Rib, Spinning Bowl Salad, and Creamed Corn.
