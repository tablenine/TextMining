I love FO.  This place has the best burger on earth!  It's made to perfection...and the shoestring french fries (that come with a garlic mayo dipping sauce) are amazing!  And if you're a beer snob, this is the place for you...all types of beers.  Its a bit expensive, but hey, it's worth every penny.  (the burger is about 14 bucks, and the beers range from 10-20 bucks).  First timers beware though, this place is always poppin----and it's first come, first serve---so you have to fight to the death to get a table.
