Food was average, not bad, not good.  Ordered a calamari salad.  The calamari was fried.  Very odd.  The tea came out, and they had no sweetner... none literally.  They had to "go to the basement" - nothing there.  Then they told me it was already sweetned!!!  What?  Who sweetens their tea in Chicago - this isn't the south.  Service was slow.  Neat atmosphere.  Could use some cleaning.
