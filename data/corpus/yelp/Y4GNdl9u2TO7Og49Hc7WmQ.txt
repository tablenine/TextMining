Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
This location of Spago has a very different ambiance and feel to it.  My coworkers and I felt pretty young in this place as the crowd were late 40's age executives and groups of middle aged models and affluent housewives.  It was a Friday at lunchtime and the place was not packed, though every table seemed reserved.  . . The service didn't start off so well.  We were seated promptly as we had a reservation, yet once we sat down, we were not quickly handed a menu at all.  We sat and waited.  Waited...for about 7 minutes (though it felt like eternity) and oh look there is our waiter with some menus.  Hmmm, wonderful because I thought that is why I came here...to EAT, not sit and stare at the barren clothed table before me.  . . However, the service picked up quickly once we ordered some food.  I ordered the grilled prime stead salad and it was very delicious, the meat cooked perfectly, though the salad dressing was a bit overpowering.. . The best part of the luncheon was when I left.  I saw Wolfgang Puck himself!  He was at the front of his restaurant speaking to one of the hosts, next to the bar area.  Wow that is something I will always remember, that I saw him in real life.  I definitely prefer the Las Vegas location as it was more hip and had a more open kitchen, but here, you could get to see one of the most notable chefs in food culture.
