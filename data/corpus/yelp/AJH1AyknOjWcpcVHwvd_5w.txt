I've lived a mere 3 blocks from this place and have been vaguely intrigued for several months. Definitely not much from the outside, unless the surrounding surplus store, tire store, liquor store, dark, pothole-filled parking lot whets your appetite. . Tonight we took the plunge! And we were not at all disappointed!. . Starting with the hot and cheesy Papusas- more like cheese filled pancakes served with a side of tomato sauce- Cheese is my BFF.. . Moved on to the Bistec Encebollado- marinated skirt steak and onions in an adobo sauce served with a side of rice and the MOST INCREDIBLE black beans. God they were good, and I usually leave those on the plate. Five star dish.. . G. had the Sopa de 7 Mares- a HUGE bowl chock full of all sorts of treasures from the sea. Crab legs, shrimp, baby squid, fish...at one point I looked up and caught him gnawing on an octopus leg, suckers and all. Another 5 star dish.. . Service was incredible- knowledgeable and enthusiastic server, alert bus help, never had an empty glass. Well done! 5 stars.
