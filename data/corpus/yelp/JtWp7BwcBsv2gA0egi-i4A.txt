I am giving this place the "spirit fingers" for actually jedi mind tricking me into thinking I might like beer (key word MIGHT). My friend who I recommend getting a tattoo stating " God is Great, Beer is Good and People are Crazy!" ADORES this place, so I needed to know why because I was not left with a "come back to me" feeling when I have dined here in the past. The menu is organic so yes that had me for a second, yet she insisted that I drop my guard and sample a few of the brews- FINE! ONE SAMPLE-- no! Second Sample- HECK NO! Last sample- OK the mind tricking is working. Different not so yeasty tasting. I might like you, but I am not giving in to you Mr. Long Strange Triple. . . The Spicy Lobster Burger is my FRIEND! The staff here is pleasant and friendly! . . Note: They will give you a little tour on the making of brew.(Thursdays).
