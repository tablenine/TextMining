Eh, I came here one day while waiting for someone to finish getting a haircut.  When I walked in I was greeted like I was a jerk, so that was fun.. . Then I asked about the veggie burger offered, and no one I spoke to could attest to it being vegan or not.  So I stuck to a wrap, that ended up being rabbit food in a pita.  My favorite.  Blech. . . Some of you have said, "Oui" and many "Non"  so, me, being vegan, will say Non. As a vegan I felt out of place here.  And I was rudely served to boot.  So three stars is for my one trip there (and I may never go back) but I have hopes for improvement, even if the location is hard to get to if you aren't already nearby.
