Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The incredible bar with even better food.. . Surprisingly not stiflingly crowded for a Saturday night, we sat down to the absolutely incredible burger and (sweet potato) fries. With a variety of beers to choose from, I opted for a cocktail and had a pretty good version of an Old Fashioned. . . I love the way Father's Office looks, with its slightly colder paternal wood panels and straight lines. Still, I almost gave them four stars because it somehow attracts a crowd that is a little too cool for school, but I won't hold that against what is one of the best gourmet burgers in LA.. . Note: Everything on the menu looks good but I don't get out there often enough to pass up the burger.
