Yowza!  181 reviews?!  Now I know where all the Yelpers hang out!. . Brunch was decent, but I wouldn't be back for the food.  The coffee was amazing, and nearly added another star - but the price to taste ratio of the food just wouldn't allow me to do it.  Another gripe was the slow service.  My coffee was almost cold before we managed to get some cream and spoons, and then another 10 minutes after the first sip before we could get some water.. . Not the best impression.  But I will confess that I'd stop in for coffee if I was in the neighborhood.
