Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Living in abject poverty in Los Angeles has taught me certain things.  One thing I've learned is that I will never be too poor to afford great fish tacos.  . . A buck-fifty will get you a delicious fish taco here, and it only takes 2 - 3 to satisfy.  The fish is lightly battered, then deep-fried but somehow is not too greasy.  It has a mild flavor that is complimented by the eclectic salsa bar  (to be discussed later).  . . Now, if you're Mr. Moneybags you can try the more elite item on the menu, a $2 shrimp taco.  The shrimp also has a mild flavor that is appreciated more with the delicious salsa.. . And now, onto the salsa bar.  The selections here are more varied than your local taqueria, which usually has the choices of  Green, Red, Hot Green and Hot Red.  Luckily, at BFT in Ensenada, there is mango and pineapple salsa (hot and mild), hot guacamole, and an unforgettable radish salsa.  They're all great and they truly make each taco unique.. . When the day comes that I have more than three dollars and fifty cents in my wallet I might consider eating somewhere else, but then I'll snap back to my senses and get some awesome fish and shrimp tacos covered in radish salsa at the Best Fish Tacos in Ensenada.
