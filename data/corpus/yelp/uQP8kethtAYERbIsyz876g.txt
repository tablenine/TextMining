Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Alcove is an adorable bakery/sandwich/salad place in Los Feliz. Great for brunch but you might have to wait a bit to snag a table on the weekends. The mis-matched patio furniture is very "alice in wonderland" and the bright colors make you feel like a kid eating lunch outside. . . You wait in line and order at the counter and they bring your food to you. My favorites here are the brie and apple panini sandwich and the grilled salmon salad. Their lemonade is also delicious but refreshing on a hot day.. . I've been here once for dinner (I think they have beer and a wine list) but I prefer it during the daytime so I can get some sun while I eat.
