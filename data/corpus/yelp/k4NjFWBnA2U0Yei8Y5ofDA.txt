The scene is a sports bar - a place to come after work with your coworkers - have a beer or a martini watching the game.. . I came here to eat before watching the movie Terminator Salvation. It was friday night and wow was it packed! We waited for about 45 minutes until we got a table and we sat outside. The place is pretty big and has a lot of good looking guys.. . I had the classic cheese burger and fries. I really likes the potato bun on the burger - it was so soft and tasty and light - just complimented the burger soooo much! And the string fries are so cute and so much packed into one small string! I definately could not finish the burger and fries. I also ordered a honey golden ale??? but it was gooooood. Very light and tasty - on the sweeter side. Definately coming back here to chill and see a movie again!
