Worth a trip once in awhile, but you won't find me there often. . . I think it's an annoying but amusing system that people just stand around and wait for whatever table to free up. It's such a relief when you finally get a table, but trying to get one when it's crowded is pretty damn frustrating. . . The food's great. No complaints there. The burgers are different from the usual, and I think it's great that the Chef won't let you make any changes to it. It shows how confident he is in his burger making skills, which ARE pretty good. Everyone told me the sweet potato fries are a must, which they pretty much are. They're much better than the regular fries. I also got the Bone Marrow, which I had to get as soon as I saw it on the menu. It's tasty, and I'd recommend it. It comes out in the hollow of a bone and you scoop it out. I'd imagine that's exactly how a sophisticated cave-woman would enjoy her bone marrow back in the day. . . The selection of beers is excellent. SO SO SO many, and a lot of them are good. However, they are not cheap. . . FO is a great place to try if you've never been. Just try to avoid the crowds.
