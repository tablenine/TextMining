I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.. . The food could have been awful and I'd still give 3 stars for the Swirl - whoever though to mix frozen sangria with frozen Margarita is a visionary, a creative genius!. . The food was all very tasty - not the best I've ever had, but better than anticipated!  I had a combo that came with one tamale, one chicken enchilada and one chile relleno.  My only complaint:  the chile relleno was more egg than anything.  Seriously.  There was an inch thick coating, which I found to be WAY too much.  It took away from the pepper.  Boo hiss.. . Service was very fast and efficient, though not much more than that.
