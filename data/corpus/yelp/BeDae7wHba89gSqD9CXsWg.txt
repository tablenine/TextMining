Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Their Ramen is one of the best in Los Angeles area.  It's rare to see a Japanese Ramen Restaurant in San Gabriel Valley Area with waiters who actually speaks Japanese.  . . You can choose to have a thick/light soup base and thick/light oil.   The lunch combo is a great deal ($7.25-$7.75), you can try their appettizers in the combo, Ramen with one choice of Spam Sushi, Dumplings, Fried Rice, Chicken Rice Ball, and Grounded Chicken Bowl.  I personally like to have Hataka Ramen with Fried Rice combo ^-^.   . . The service is excellent~  All the employee will greet u in &amp; thank you on your way out.   I don't recommend big party because of the wait, it may takes up to 30 mins to 1 hours during friday &amp; weekends.  The parking usually crowded during the day.
