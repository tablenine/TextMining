Restaurant: Hatfield&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
What a delicious and special restaurant.  I came out here for a nice date with the ol' man and was not disappointed. Portions may look small but when you use really good ingredients and don't skimp on the butter (or bacon) some times it may feel like you've eaten at Outback Steakhouse and yet it was just 6 slices of perfectly cooked pork belly!  Would I like to come here again?  Yes, but it's not cheap and it's not just the neighborhood joint so I'd rather save it for something special.  . . Last bit...Hatfield's is "celebrating" the spring (if that's code for recession) with a make-your-own pre fixe.  It's $49 to get an app, entree, and dessert  off the entire menu. It's still pricey but compared to other restaurants of this caliber and whatever special celebration you may be tending to, this is a decent deal.
