Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
Birds is my neighborhood bar and I am happy to live so close. The happy hour is great, the bartenders are friendly and the outside seating is always a nice option. The sampler on the menu is a good choice for a taste of their appetizers and homemade sauces. I also frequently order their chili and chicken tortilla soup. They deliver in 30-45 minutes and the takeout is always ready in about 10. Good place for casual dinning and strong cocktails.
