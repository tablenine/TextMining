Yeah, so I've been here twice now, in my two years in Chicago. . . First time I went was Winter 08-09. Good/decent experience, savory taste. Split an extra large between four friends, and it was fine. VERY TIGHT SPACE inside and out, I'll admit, but the place is old and it's downtown, where space is hard to get, so I'll excuse that. . . [best pizza is deep dish sausage! the sauce is soo good!]. . Went last night. HORRIBLE experience. After waiting for 1.5 hours (put name down at 8 PM, for 2 people), we weren't seated til about 9:20. We were seated in the back in this room with an annoying low ceiling. It was unbearably loud. We asked to be moved; after waiting 15 more mins, we were moved to a table by the front window (much better view!), but we were LEFT UNATTENDED FOR 20 MINUTES! It was well past 9:45 at this time! . . We were finally served our pizza, and it was barely even luke-warm. Ridiculous! The cheese wasn't even cheesy. It was so easy to eat (this typically NEVER happens! - When I go to Giordano's, it's always piping hot and I can't chew for the first few mins it's out of the oven!), and ultimately I couldn't even eat half a piece. My friend and I spoke with the manager and she brought back the same pizza "heated up" in the "oven"--but it was maybe only 2 degrees hotter. Emm. Ok...? Why am I here? . . I didn't eat any more pizza.. . Ultimately, the manager took care of our bill and offered us a cheesecake dessert, which was only alright. . . Bottom line: Service here aint too great; it's luck, really, whether you get a good server AND, unfortunately, a hot pizza. It was an especially bad experience for my friend who I went with, who has been a regular customer for nearly a decade. At least the manager handled the situation, but I will not be going back anytime soon.
