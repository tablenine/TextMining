The only place I go for a giant whole fried snapper. It'll run you about $18-20 but its large enough to split. Every time I've had it, it's perfectly fried so the skin gets crisp while the flesh stays moist. The waits can be up to an hour on a Friday or Sat, so I usually try to get there early on the weekends. The portions are humongous and are served on foot long wooden planks. The service has always been friendly though with such a high volume of diners they can be a bit slow with water refills and getting you your check.
