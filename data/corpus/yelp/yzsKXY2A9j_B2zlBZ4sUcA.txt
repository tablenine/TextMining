Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Go to Alcove for its airy ambiance and nice outdoor patio seating instead of knock-your-socks-off food. The chopped salad with scallops was O.K. and the omelet a bit better. You'll see an impressive display of house-made desserts like red velvet cupcakes, chocolate souffle cake and a pretty, pale-green pistachio cake but they are also just O.K. . . Alcove serves mostly breakfast (omelets), lunch (salads and paninis) and cafe pastry type foods so it may not be the best place for a fancy dinner.  . . NOTE: Look for the little table in the back that seats two people -- It has a chess board surface with mini drawers and in it you'll find anonymous notes, love letters, stories, and every other whimsically written thing. Anyone can contribute!
