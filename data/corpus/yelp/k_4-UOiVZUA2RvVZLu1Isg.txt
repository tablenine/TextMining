YUMMY! =D This is a great place to grub on some traditional sushi. They don't "foo foo" it up like those contemporary/fusion places. The quality is great, especially for the price you pay. There 's always a wait, but it's well worth it. Their Ankimo, Sake, Hamachi is consistantly great. Also, try the hamachi + scallion roll...it's surprisingly delicious.  Fyi, you have to listen really carefully for your name.  =p. . PS-It's sometimes good to ask if you're unsure to order some of the better items..like mirugai, uni, amaebi, etc.. I always ask and they always tell you honestly, especially the younger sushi chefs. The older ones can get a lil grumpy and non-social.. Last time I had the best aji and uni here ever!
