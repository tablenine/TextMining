I finally got to Flo four months after moving into the neighborhood. It's another great brunch option in the area. I think it's close to as good as Milk and Honey, which is high praise from me. Obviously, it's in a different genre though.. . One thing that they have figured out which I think is huge is that they have Intelligentsia coffee sitting out for those of us who are waiting. You can serve yourself. For a caffeine junky, this is extremely helpful when waits are 30+ minutes. . . I had the bolsillos and my fiance had the Mexican Corn Cakes. The bolsillos (scrambled egg tacos) were better. It was just about the perfect portion size and a good value for the price. It was a simple dish and executed well. The Mexican Corn Cakes were a special. They were solid but the corn cakes themselves didn't have much flavor. The dish seemed overly complex with a lot of elements (grilled vegetables, poached eggs, the cakes themselves) not necessarily Â working together in the presentation or the flavor. . . The service was good but not tremendous. Overall, we dug it and we'll be back. I'm still trying to figure if I should try this Black Velvet Mimosa that was on the menu that is made with Guinness. Don't let the Atari age website fool you. Give Flo a chance.
