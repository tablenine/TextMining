Yes, it's a chain.  But... It's fantastic.  Great food and service, and on top of all that - value!  I had the Pasta Telephono for the Triple Chocolate Ice Cream Sandwich baked-to-order dessert.  The Pasta was flavorful and baked to perfection with breadcrumbs on top.  Yummy.  My only complaint for this particular visit was the overcooked cookies in the b-t-o dessert.  Too hard!  Otherwise, another exceptional visit.
