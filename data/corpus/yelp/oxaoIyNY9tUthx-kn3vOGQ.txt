Restaurant: Highland Tap
Category: Steakhouses
Intimate setting, almost like Cheers with the lights low, no Norm to be found though. Heard the food is great but never had it. Usually end up here at the tail end of a bar crawl in the Highlands. Can get pretty crowded on the weekends. Beer selection is typical of most bars in the area.
