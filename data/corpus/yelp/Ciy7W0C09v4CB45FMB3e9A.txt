Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Fave - fave - fave !. Don't call it red meat, or steak but rather artistic gourmet creation.. Who could tell s steakhouse would have incredible seared ahi appetizer ! . Filet ... Must must must ! Quite pricey.. girls get your date to take you on a romantic gourmet escape to the heart of Beverly Hills. All steaks are A la carde, but every single side I have had there has reached supreme excellence.
