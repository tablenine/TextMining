I would only recommend this place if you want to have drinks... they have a huge selection of beer. A must go for all Beer Drinkers. . . The food is OK and as the saying goes, when you have a couple of drinks, everything seems to look and taste better. Â However, this did not work to my favor, I was still a little disapointed with the food.
