I thought for a while about how many stars to throw at Big Star. There were definitely things I didn't like about the place, but most of those are symptoms of the neighborhood. I could have gone for a little more decoration, the walls are pretty bare, but I feel like in time we'll find art from some of the locals all over the place. It'd just warm the bar up a little.. . That being said, I can't not give Big Star a solid five. Great bourbon selection, and "mad props" to any place that has multiple options in the way of mezcal. Exciting, but reasonably priced drink menu topped off with the local bar special, 7oz Schlitz on tap for a buck. A buck. . . Sure, they have better beers, but there are times when a cold Schlitz and a warm taco are all one needs. (Well, that and sex). . Tacos, tacos, tacos, yeah... The tacos are great. Everyone has said it. I have to go with the tacos de panza. They're braised pork belly tossed in some delicious little sauce that packs a kick, cheese, cilantro, and delicious tortillas. 3 bucks. Excellent. Seriously, one of the better tacos I've had the pleasure of inhaling. My pal had the lamb, and said they were great (apparently so good there wasn't any left to share), and my chicken tostada was tasty, but nothing comes close to the panza.. . Again, three buck tacos, dollar beer. The service was efficient, not warm, but even on a Thursday the place was packed. It's new, there's a lot of buzz, so it would be stupid to quibble about the bartenders not being very chatty. . . PS, great tunes being played all night.
