Restaurant: Co&#39;m Vietnamese Grill
Category: Vietnamese
Fabulous. Delicious. Great service, great food and very friendly staff.. . Ground duck in grape leaves was so good.. Spring rolls with lamb were incredible!. The wine list is better than I was expecting with up to date "house wines" like NO Sauvignon Blanc.. . The flat rice vermicielli with grilled shrimp was mild and light and the sauce added a nice delicate flavor to counterbalance the grilled flavor of the shrimp, fresh veggies and herbs. I am taking my family here next time they are in town. We asked to see a dessert menu, but instead dessert appeared with three spoons. I guess it was tiramisu, and it was delicious. Well done Co'm! We'll be back soon!
