I guess last night was just one full of mishaps, because I was pretty disappointed by my meal here. The pastrami was on the dry side and the plantains were really uninspired. It was as if they were just rolled around on a pan a few times, and then served. I did however enjoy the chili cheese fries and chipotle ketchup. The chili was not heavy, if that's even possible. The green onions were a good addition as well.. . The wait for the three items (which were all shared between two) was far too long for what we got. I'm still willing to return and try the burgers and ube shake though. Will report back when this occurs.. . And just because Guy from Food Network stopped by doesn't necessarily mean that it's awesome. Have you seen what he looks like? I don't really trust a man who still frosts his hair.
