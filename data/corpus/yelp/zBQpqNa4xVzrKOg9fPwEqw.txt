Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
You know it's worth it when all you hear around the table are mixtures of orgasmic moans and "OHH MY GAHHD SOOO GOOD MMMMM GOOD CHICKEN GOOD WAFFLES mMmMMmmMMm OH MY GAHHHD." Yes.. . There isn't much parking; I guess we were lucky to find a spot quickly. We were walking toward Roscoe's and there was already a woman at the open door to greet us and take us to our table.. . The place is well air-conditioned - I was so cold! But you get kind of used to it once you start eating. Our waitress was so chill and nice! My friends and I all ordered SCOE'S and a few of us ordered a biscuit. I thought that it would've taken a while to get our food, but the service was surprisingly fast!. . Their waffles smell different than any other waffle I've had. They even taste different than any other waffle I've had. I don't know why this is, but man is it SOOOO GOOOD. They're pretty huge too; they take up over half the plate. The southern-style chicken is soo nice and crispy - I love the skin! It's yummy and soo crunchy, mm. Their chicken covered in gravy is good as well! I dipped my southern-style chicken in my friend's gravy - MMMMM. With one hand holding a fork of waffle and the other holding a piece of chicken, I was a happy girl. The combination is wonderful - whoever thought of that... man, kudos to you.. . I didn't get to finish all my food - I got really full, so I took some of my food home (the leftovers are still good to eat for breakfast the next morning!). When we were done, the waitress gave us toothpicks and those wipes in those little packets - good lookin' out, Roscoe's.. . A great experience, especially if you live in San Diego and you have to drive through all that L.A. traffic to get to your chicken and waffle destination.
