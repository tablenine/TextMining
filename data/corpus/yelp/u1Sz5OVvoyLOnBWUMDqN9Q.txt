Restaurant: MetroFresh
Category: American (New)
I really like the staff and the owner.  Unfortunately, I think that's the best thing I can say about MetroFresh.  I echo Adam H's thoughts; the food is bland and not particularly inspiring.  I have a hard time even differentiating some of the dishes from one and other - they all seem to taste the same.  It doesn't help that they low high quality bread for their sandwiches.  The menu changes daily, but they seem to have a small "rotation" and they don't ever venture outside of it.  It is a bit pricy, especially for a spot that is very lunch oriented.  Friendly and a good change of pace if you can't decide on anything else - but I find myself walking next door to Jersey Mike's a bit too often nowadays.  That's kind of scary.
