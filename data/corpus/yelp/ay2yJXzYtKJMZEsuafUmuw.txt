By far the best haunt at the Farmer's Market.  I had the taco sampler plate--a tad pricey, but each taco had a distinct, complex, and savory taste.  Do yourself a favor and branch out from the standard carnitas, carne asada, and chicken.  Only downer was that the tacos were a bit small for the price point.  My girlfriend had the chilaquiles, which were by far the best that I've had to date.  Top it off with some aguas frescas, and you're good to go.
