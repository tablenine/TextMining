As I've been on a Mexican food kick lately, I went to satisfy my craving since it came highly recommended. I was anxious to try it out. . . I first liked it that I could find street parking pretty easily. But this was on a week night so I'm not sure how it is on weekends. . . They had outdoor seating and a moderately sized dining room. The thing I really didn't like was the smell when I first walked in. I really didn't need to be greeted by smell of fish when I first walked in. I don't care how fresh the seafood is...I honestly can't say it's one of my favorite smells in the world. So we chose to sit outside. . . Menu was packed with things I haven't seen before and fairly priced. We ordered a pitcher of margarita at ~$9, which was only $3 more than their giant glass of margarita. So if you're with a group, definitely get the pitcher. I ordered Chilles Rellenos hoping my craving for Chuy's Chilles Rellenos I had in Dallas would be sufficed, but as I came to find out, this dish can be done in hundreds of different ways and it was not the same. BUT I was plesantly surprised by their version. It was packed with fresh shrimp and melted cheese on top and to top it all, they had this tasty sauce on top. Loved the steamed veggies that were served with the dish. My friends ordered chicken tacos and adobo salmon fillet and they loved their dinners as well. . . Overall, everything was delicious including the giant round corn tortilla chips with their unique salsa. Don't be fooled by their spicy mayo looking dip thinking it'll be less spicy than the uber spicy looking one. It's actually the opposite. I'll definitely dine here again and will order the dinner combo platter which looked and smelled amazing.
