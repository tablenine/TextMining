Man, some people need to take their chlll pills before they go out for breakfast.  You might be too old for this place if the silly, lighthearted banter of the staff and their manager is too harsh for you.  They are being playful and sticking to the rules of their owner. It is quite clear and everyone else abides by it....if your party is incomplete, you are not getting a table.  Stop complaining about it.. . If you could pay attention to someone besides yourself, you would see that the Parents let her hold their children because they know and love the Manager.  So many returning customers enjoy the atmosphere as much as the food.  Quit being so sensitive and you may find that you do too.
