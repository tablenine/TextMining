Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Two years ago I would have given the Bourgeois Pig a five-star rating, but they really need to replace the couch upstairs that died this year. That said, the cafe is still one of my favorites thanks to its comfortable atmosphere, which makes me feel as though I've just stumbled into a well-worn living room decorated by people who love literature, philosophy, and those things British (why I say that when the name is half French, I'm not sure--but it seems to fit). I've spent more hours here than I can count. . . The espresso isn't the greatest, but the exposed brick downstairs and the burgandy room upstairs more than make up for it. The chocolate scones are yummy too.. . Random aside: There was a special on Chicago restaurants that featured the cafe--my parents TiVo-ed it for me since I live here--and I was amused to find the Bourgeois Pig on Rachel Ray. It looks a lot bigger on camera.
