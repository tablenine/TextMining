Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I admit I only came to the Bourgeois Pig recently for the first time even though I've lived in Chicago for all but two of the last 19 years.  I'm not a big drinking-coffee-out guy, what can I say?  But the atmosphere in here...  man.  They make a fine Americano as well.
