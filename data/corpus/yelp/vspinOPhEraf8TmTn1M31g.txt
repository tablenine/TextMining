I wanted my 1st review to be a place that's really special. And thank you pizzeria mozza for making this virgin yelper's experience so freaking delicious it's orgasmic. Been here multiple times now and always start with chicken liver pate..love it!...and a little something else (mussels, salumi, etc. all good). I MUST MUST MUST get the bianca pizza! I didn't know cheese could be so good! The BF's a total carnivore and loves peperroni and salami but always ends up liking my bianca more than the pizza he orders. If you must have some preserved animal product..the fennel sausage pizza is also yummy. The wine list is super duper considering most their bottles are under $45 and servers/bartenders are pretty darn knowledgable (maybe that's because I just pretend to sniff/swirl/and taste) but they fooled me. If you don't have a seperate dessert tummy like me then remember to save room for the salted butterscotch budino!
