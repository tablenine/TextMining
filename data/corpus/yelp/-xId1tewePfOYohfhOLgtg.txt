Restaurant: La Fonda Latina
Category: Latin American
I had eaten at La Fonda on a previous trip to Atlanta and really enjoyed it. This past Saturday night, after a jam-packed day, we ended up swinging by to pick up some take-out.. . We ordered, waited about 10 minutes to get our food and went home to enjoy a late meal.. . My fiance and I shared the Reuben Cubano: Grilled boneless breast of chicken, Swiss cheese, Cuban coleslaw, pickles and Cuban dressing on Cuban bread. This was FANTASTIC. Served with tasty yellow rice and way-too watery black beans (we didn't eat those), this was the perfect size meal to split when neither of us was ultra hungry.. . My brother &amp; sister-in-law split the Fish Tacos: Three soft tacos with your choice of grilled, seasoned tilapia or fresh salmon, lettuce, tomatoes and a sour cream jalape√±o sauce. There was more than enough for both of them - she had 1, he had 2 - and we were all stuffed after!. . The only downside was that we ordered a side of guacamole, for $3, and they didn't give it to us!! We should have checked before we left, but it was on the receipt and it wasn't a big, complicated order, so we assumed it was in there. That sort of put a downer on it.. . But the food is so good, I would definitely go back despite the guacamole mishap!
