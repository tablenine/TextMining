Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Hide is probably the best bang for your buck when it comes to sushi on the Westside; the fish is fresh and the price is right.  i really like the scallops special and you can't go wrong with the basics (salmon, yellowtail, etc).  The bad thing about the place is that its cash only and the line can be pretty darn long for dinner.  Parking can also be a pain during the weekends, but that's the whole Sawtelle area in general.
