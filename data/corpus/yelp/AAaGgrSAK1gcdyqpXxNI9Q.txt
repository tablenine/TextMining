Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
There are a lot of great burgers in Los Angeles, and Apple Pan is one of the best.  I actually don't eat the burger, here, because even better than their burgers is their ham sandwich, the Combination.  I just  can't get enough of it.  Apple Pan also has some of the best sweet pickles anywhere.  I've been eating at Apple Pan long enough that they start putting together little plate of extra pickles and olives when they see me sit down.. . The cream pies here, especially the chocolate cream pie, are truly works of art.  The crust is so thin and flaky.. . It can be hard to get a seat, or more than one seat here at peak hours, but I walk in all the time for lunch and find plenty of seating.  The people watching here is unbeatable.
