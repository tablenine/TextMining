If you are craving for seafood or maybe just wanting to work for your food, please check this plate out.  It is messy yet fun.. Tasty yet dirty... So this is not the place for a first date unless you don't mind getting all hands on without knowing the person at the other end too well.  If you are a neat freak and do not like getting your fingernails dirty, please don't come here.  But there is a place where you can wash your hands all you want (it is called a restroom and an entire roll of paper towels at the table).  Last time i went there I had the fried prawns, the french fries, some sausages, pounds of snow crab legs (with the whole sha-bam or whatever you call the seasoning), some oysters in a half shell, more boiled prawns, and hmm..beer?? sheesh.. can't remember.. i just had a whole lotta good food!.. so check it out.. you will be surprised how awesome that place is.  It is quite small, so expect a wait time.  So be patient.  :)
