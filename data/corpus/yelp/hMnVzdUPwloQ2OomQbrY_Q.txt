I came here with 4 of my girlfriends for dinner on a Sunday night. We had our little room, I like the privacy. We all got the all-you-can-eat beef and ate about 16 plates of meat, that's how good it was! I love that there were plenty of veggies to go with everything. They give you a peanut dipping sauce and a ponzu sauce, both are good!. . I like this place alot, will suggest it next time if I have another small dinner group gathering.
