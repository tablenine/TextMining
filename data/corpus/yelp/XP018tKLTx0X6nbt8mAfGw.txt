Confucius say, man who walk through airport turnstile sideways going to Bangkok.. . Luckily, this shack is nowhere near the airport but you will have to walk sideways to enter this joint...watch the family jewels! Once inside, if there is no wait, you can grub quickly and on the cheap with your standard issued Thai dishes. If I didn't know any better I thought I was in a Mexican penthouse. This dive is small and the portions are decent but asking for Thai Hot is like asking for Pepsi in Atlanta. . . Fried Tofu- I always get Jedi mind tricked into this...but it's not bad.. . Fried Squid- who caught these tiny squid...Playmobil fishermen? . . Tom Ka- it's tasty even though I can put up drywall with that plaster. . . The Curries- quite tasty and rich given their pedestrian heat level. . . Pad Thai- isn't the generic clumpy gooey mess and has distinct flavor. . . Rainbow Duck- duck can be tasty one night and possum another.. . Catfish specials- Â when available, even Sloth will Love the Chunks of fried catfish.. . Avoid the Panda Express Chinese menu and End the night Happy with a F.O. at Varsity Jr. or a F.U. at Southern Nights.
