VEGETERIAN ALERT.... Not all of the veggie dishes here are vegetarian. I eat dairy, but I won't eat foods made with beef stock, chicken stock, etc. They cook their rice in chicken stock and add it to some of their sauces as well. So, if you care about that.... . DON'T GET the Arroz del Campo. It is delicious, but definitely made with chicken stock (sigh, R.I.P.). Also, don't get the salads that contain rice, the soups, or the ravioli with the sauce listed on the menu. If you are vegan, the mashed potatoes are made with milk, so don't get them. . . DO GET the ravioli or the canelones with the vegetarian sauce or the empanadas (they can grill them rather than fry them if you prefer the healthier option). I guess you can get the grilled vegetable skewers as well (yawn... boring).
