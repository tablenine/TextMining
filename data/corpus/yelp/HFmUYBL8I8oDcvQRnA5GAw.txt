Over the last few years, my coworkers bring in Porto's more times than I can count and each time they bring in the favorites.  Two Fridays ago, it was a whole box of guava cheese strudel and this past Friday was potato balls, giant flaky croissants, apple tarts (and other stuff, but i figure i shouldn't be walking away with ten goodies on my plate).  . . Porto's better at being a bakery (5 stars) than a sandwich shop (3 stars).  But I guess if people are going to line up by the dozen buying dozens, they gotta offer something lunch-y.
