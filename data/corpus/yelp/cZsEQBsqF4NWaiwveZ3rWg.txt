OK, without a doubt, this place has the best pastrami sandwiches.  No one has anything on Langer's.   I've tried local franchises like the Hat, and famous ones in NYC like Carnegie, but nothing comes close to way they prepare the pastrami here.  It's not too salty, it's almost like eating prime rib and it melts in your mouth.  . . The only negatives (and they are major) is the sketchy area and the price.  Spending about $20 for a sandwich and drink is a bit high for lunch especially considering the area it is in.   . . But overall, the service is great and it has a great classic look.  This is a place that all foodies should go to at least once, but overall, its hard to say you would go out of your way to come back.
