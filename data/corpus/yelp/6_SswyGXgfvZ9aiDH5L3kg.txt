I'm a 400lb man but I hide it well with slimming vertical lines and I wear a really tall hat much like Abraham Lincoln. That's a lie, I actually weigh 160lbs but eat like a 400 pounder. A lot of times when I go for Ramen I leave just under the full level. That was not an issue at Daikokuya. . . After a night at the theater, side note, Mary Poppins at the Ahmanson Theatre was spectacular, we stopped in for a late meal. I would have given the place a 5star but it wasn't as clean as I would have liked. But it was the end of the night so I could just be over critical. So add a little note, not a side note, an end note, the food is worth 5 but it got docked for cleanliness. It's like doing a math problem and getting the right answer but forgetting to show your work. . . I went with their Daikoku ramen combo with Tempura bowl and it was fan-freakin-tastic. The woman in my life went with the combo too but got the Shredded Pork. I liked the Tempura but I was supremely jealous. Â Everything was good. Seriously it was all wonderful.
