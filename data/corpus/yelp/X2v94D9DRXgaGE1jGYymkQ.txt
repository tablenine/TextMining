Here comes Debbie Downer.  I don't understand the glowing reviews.  Everything was all right, but I should've went with my instincts which told me it would be a meal wasted.  To be fair, pig has never been my meat of choice.  Yes, the pastrami was tasty, but I couldn't get past all the stringy white.  The pulled pork was less fatty, but quite dry.  Still, nobody can accuse Oinkster of being miserly with the meats.  Both sandwiches were loaded up and you must do your best to open jaws (attractively, of course, thou shalt always be a lady) like a hippopotamus to get your trap wrapped around them.. . As for the Belgian fries, they were all right.  Sauces were more interesting.  The chipotle ketchup had a little zing and the creamy garlic aioli was pretty good.  The strawberry milkshake tasted fine, but In-N-Out's is comparable.  The cupcakes are famous or something.  The peanut butter one tasted like a peanut butter cookie and the carrot cake, which I preferred, was fine.  All in all, as my review suggests, everything was just okay, whatever, kind of boring.  In fact, I'm bored writing this.. . Before I bid adieu to Oinkster, please note the following.  A report to the Department of Health and Human Services will promptly follow.. . **Emergency Broadcast**. You know that rainbow spectrum vision with the cacophonous, neverending beep?  Well, they always say "If this had been an actual emergency... "  I have lived through two emergency situations:  the Northridge earthquake and now this.  THERE WAS A HAIR FRIED INTO A FRY.  *shrill scream*  Author of "Fast Food Nation" is nodding his head, "I'm not surprised."  Upton Sinclair is giving Oinkster the finger from his grave.  I was grossed out of my mind and nostalgically thought back to my first Happy Meal sans hair.  :(
