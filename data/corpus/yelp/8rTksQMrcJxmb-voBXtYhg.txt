Restaurant: Toast Bakery Cafe
Category: American (New)
Toast has a nice ambiance and is in a great area (it was a lot of fun to walk along 3rd and look in the stores after brunch). It was also lovely to sit outside on a nice day next to the little spice garden in the flower boxes. However, I was very disappointed by the food and the service was totally mediocre, It being brunch, I ordered Eggs Benedict...and it was not at all worth the calories. What was most disappointing was the flavorless breakfast potatoes. I have no idea why there was such a long wait.
