When I was 19 and the Food Network first came to my local cable carrier, I had a huge couple-crush on Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, who had a show called, "Too Hot Tamales." They weren't actually a couple, though they're kind of close to being one- Susan Feniger is gay and Mary Sue Milliken is married to her ex-husband.  Regardless, as a not-yet-out 19 year old (who didn't know they weren't together), they were an adorable fantasy couple to me.  So when looking for a happy hour place downtown yesterday, upon seeing Ciudad pop up on yelp, I wanted to give it a try.  The bar was overfull so we opted for the dining room (no wait for a table for two at 6 pm on a Friday), since we didn't want tacos or mojitos anyway.. This is SUCH an oddly decorated restaurant; my fiancee described it as a place looking like it was playing restaurant, rather than actually being one.  It has a primary-colored, nearly playhouse feel, the latter of which is enhanced by walls in random areas that don't reach the ceiling.  . Everything we ate was excellent, from the ceviche to a goat-milk flan, and our server was demure and attentive.  Portions were on the smaller side, which was expected given the fine-dining calibur of the restaurant.  I'd be happy to return, and not only to relive Food TV memories.
