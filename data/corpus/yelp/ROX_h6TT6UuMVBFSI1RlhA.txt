Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
I love May Street Market!  The service is amazing, the wine is yummy, and the food is delicious!  The bartender, named JP, is a fun and also quite  knowledgeable. If your in the neighborhood alone, this is the bar that you would want to sit at and he is the bartender that you want to hang out with.. For an appetizer, try the Pork Belly Taffy Apple Salad. Also, the Turkey Burger is the best you will ever eat.. . A great staff, gorgeous setting, and a delicious menu make this a very fun and relaxing place to eat.
