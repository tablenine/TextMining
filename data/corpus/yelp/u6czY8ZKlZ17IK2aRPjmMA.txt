Who knew that ramen would be so good? The broth is EXCELLENT. The pork is awesome. The egg is different but yummy! Its delicious. They only lose a star due to the small space and long wait. But GEEE yummmmmmy =] . . Oh and parking sucks too!. . And the lady might pronounce your name weird so make sure you stick around during the wait.
