The food is extraordinary, interesting, unique and rewards you for ordering adventurously (unusual cuts of meat offal, etc.).  The surroundings are a bit austere in the middle of several office buildings which feel very isolating at night.  But I'd go almost anywhere to eat the food.. . If they are on the menu when you go, I highly recommend the sweetbreads and wild mushrooms.  And treat yourself to the cheese cart which is sublime.  Their interesting selection of desert wines also sets them apart in my mind.
