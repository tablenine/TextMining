i FINALLY ate at the griddle cafe!    . . that's all i wanted to say.  read the other 462 reviews if you don't know what the griddle cafe is.  . . i'll also say either i didn't order the right thing, or this place is way overrated.  we shared the breakfast tacos and the french toast w/nutella.  (i loved the idea of getting to have something savory and something sweet.)  we didn't get the mom's french toast because my friend had already had them, and i wanted him to be able to try something different.  the tacos (all egg...no meat) were not bad after adding hot sauce.  the french toast was a bit sweet.  i'm sure they have better dishes, but i'm sure there's also better breakfast places, with less of a wait.  arrive before 9am, or you're screwed.  . . why is it everytime i say "that's all i wanted to say", i end up saying much more?  *sigh*
