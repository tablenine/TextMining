I confess to writing a review solely so I can find the delivery phone number faster, easier and with less "Was THIS the place?". I have not actually been inside here, only devoured the delicious takeout goodness! . Yes please: Spicy Coconut Curry chicken. I am told the baby egg rolls were also quite tasty, but I blinked and nothing was left but a meager couple of crumbs and a pleasant smell. D@mn friends trying to get me from a size four to a size two.... I'll show them and order twice as much next time. Which is within the next fifteen minutes. . More Please! (And by that I mean Joy's food, not the all-too-swiftly developing J.Lo booty).
