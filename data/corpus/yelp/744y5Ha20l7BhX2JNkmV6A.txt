Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Papa Cristos is one of the best reviewed restaurants in our neighborhood, and we've been meaning to get over there for a couple of years.  The problem is they close so early -- 8pm.  By the time we're thinking about dinner they are no longer an option.. . But with my folks in from Chicago, still on the midwest time zone, we decided to pop over there about 6pm on a Thursday night.. . Now, after finally partaking of the PC magic, I have to say that the 4 and a half star rating is a bit too much.  The place has plenty of character, it has Papa Cristo, the 5 foot wunderkind, and a picture of him on the wall when he was a 2 year old and his dad ran the place.. . I appreciate the history, and the food is certainly fine.  The store and the counter have almost anything you could ask for of the greek persuasion.  But the plastic furniture and tableware is a little depressing, and the belly dancer who came out at 8 o'clock was more creepy than entertaining.. . PC's is an L.A. institution and it's not going anywhere.  But you can get just as much character, better people watching and better Greek Food at the Farmer's Market.
