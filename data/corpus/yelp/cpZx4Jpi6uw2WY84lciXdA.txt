I went here with friends for dinner a few weeks ago, and then lately found myself wanting to go back for more.  I was happy that the food was consistently delicious on both occasions.. . Portions are generous (but not overwhelmingly large), and the menu is large enough that you can order an array of dishes.  The dishes we had were excellent, but the two that stand out for me are the Basil Chicken and the Salt and Pepper Porkchops.  It's less a "porkchop" and more of a thinly-sliced, fried piece of pork that is absolutely delicious.. . The Kung Pao shrimp &amp; scallops weren't a big hit at the table, and I'm not sure I'd order them again.. . My only complaint for this restaurant is that the service is great in the beginning, then they kind of disappear as soon as the food arrives.  Both times we've been left sitting for 10-15 minutes after finishing and finally had to ask for the check.  This is a pretty minor complaint, though.... . Overall:  approved!
