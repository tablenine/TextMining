I know the name is silly, and would make you probably want to steer clear, but the food is great! Great prices (pretty much under $10 for most things), and the Panang Curry is the super delicious thing I get EVERY time. Several friends have gotten several different rice and noodle dishes, and all are happy with them each time. I haven't had the sushi, but it looks great; presentation is awesome. EDIT: I had the sushi, and it is delicious!!! The Hawaii roll was AMAZING.. . Also, when you walk in, the place is so awesomely decorated, you forget that it is in a Kroger strip mall. There is even a life-sized fake maple tree decorated with lights! How cool is that?
