Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
There are some great coffee shops in New York but The Grey Dog has been one of my favorites.  First, the chocolate in my friend's mocha and the vanilla in my vanilla latte were both rich, thick and worth it.  The atmosphere is great.  There are people having snack or lunch, folks there for a beer, students working, friends meeting.  It is busy, bustling but yet still laid back.. . Absolutely worth a visit.
