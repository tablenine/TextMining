Ok the food was so-so.  Everyone I was with seemed to really enjoy it.  I will say this: great attention to detail.  The canape's were well prepared and the wait staff was very friendly.  The place is definitely overpriced.. . I gave Spring 3 stars because of it's wine policy.  When I made reservations I asked if I could bring wine.  I thought it a dumb question to ask because I've never ever been told no you cannot, at least to a restaurant of this caliber.  But, to my surprise, they said I would only be allowed to bring wine that wasn't on their (terribly overpriced) wine list.  I checked all three bottles I was planning on bringing and I was clean...*phew*  . . When I arrived at the restaurant they said I was only allowed to bring 1 bottle from home!  Whaaat?!?!  I made a point of saying that I called ahead and inquired about three bottles and no one mentioned a policy like that.  Then, they asked who I spoke to, presumably to reprimand that person.  Throughout the meal, I was approached three times about their policy, and it made me uncomfortable.  I brought 3 very nice bottles to dinner and they dampened the experience by being jerks about it.  Maybe San Francisco is just a wine friendly town, but this wouldn't fly in the bay area.
