YUM-o. . . Seriously, I haven't had a good cheap thin slice in a while and this hit the spot.  I had the mexican pizza which definitely had a kick and was soo good.  My boyfriend had the bbq chicken which is hand down one of the best bbq chicken pizzas in city. . . This place also is conveniently on Clark near all the action of Wrlgleyville so its PRIME late night eating:)
