Man, I wanted to like this place.  Convenient location, and not crazy prices, plus I love tapas...so I actually tried it three times....but the food was always so-so, service was slow (I had to flag people down each time), and it was just all and all a dissapointment....bummer.. . Note: I sat in the "bar" section all three times, but it doesn't seem like this should make a big difference...same menu and all.... . Finally,  can I say my pet peeve is restaurants using crappy tomatoes for tomato/mozzarella plates?  Its one of like THREE ingredients and we are in Southern California...are you Seriously telling me the best tomatoes you could find are these pink, watery things??
