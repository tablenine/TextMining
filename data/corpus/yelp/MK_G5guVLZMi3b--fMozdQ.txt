Went for my first time yesterday and it was great. 2 ppl cost me $20 with tip! Not bad at all...they need more tables though. Waited almost 30 mins in the blistering sun. And Cash only. Meh...it's ok though! I wouldn't want to pay taxes either if I made that much on awesome Hainan Chicken!!! =-)!!!
