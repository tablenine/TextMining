delicious gourmet burger.  my chef friend says it is better than $100 burgers that he has had.  i'm not as big of fan but it is a really unique taste and i crave it every now and then.. . but i come here for the yam fries.  my wife and I can't find another restaurant that makes them this good.. . and the new culver city spot is really cool and a lot more space than the montana one.
