HB is an eclectic mix of ambiance and food.  The service was good, after a small confusion on who was our waiter, it is a BYOB, which adds an automatic star, and prices were reasonable.. . HB loses a star because I wanted to like the food more than I did.  I got the Lamb Burger which was overly salty.  After dissecting the burger I found the salt coming from the brie cheese.  The salt made it hard to eat.  The truffle fries were different and very good.  They were cooked crispy and came with a garlic aioli.  My wife got the chicken which was good.  Again my expectations were higher than what was delivered.  . . I would definitely go to HB again and try more of their menu.
