Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Last night, a friend treated me to Father's Office (or F.O. as the shirt says) for the first time.  I was craving a burger and they definitely have a tasty one!  We also ordered some of their sweet potato fries.  He went for a beer, I went for a drink similar to a Sprite called Bubble Up.  The ambiance is cool and laid back.  It is definitely a trendy part of Culver City and the Happy Hour crowd was bustling.. . I plan on returning here; however, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that I do believe they are overpriced for what you get.  The burger is $12 not including any fries.  If you want the sweet potato fries, get ready to penny up $7.50 for a basket.  I heard rent is high by Helm's Bakery, but $7.50 for fries??  Seriously??  Yeah... there you have it.
