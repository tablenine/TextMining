Restaurant: Wurstk√ºche
Category: Hot Dogs
I had the rabbit, veal &amp; pork seasoned with white wine topped with caramelized onions and sauerkraut and it was out of this world. I tried bites with whole grain mustard and with American yellow mustard and preferred the American yellow. I also tried the plain double dipped fries and the double dipped fries with white truffle oil glaze both of which I enjoyed but that glaze really did it for me. I will get that again next time. As for sauces for my fries, I fancied the sweet and sassy BBQ, buttermilk ranch and tzatziki. To drink I had the Floris Apple Ale which was sweet and delicious and complemented my meal perfectly. I also tried the Houblan Chouffe and the Aventinus - I'm a fan of both but they were too heavy for my meal. . . Wurstkuche is a gem in Downtown Los Angeles although there are a couple things I don't care for: The loud music coming from the comatose DJ and the insane crowds of people everywhere. If this place was an unknown hole-in-the-wall I'd probably consider moving close by.
