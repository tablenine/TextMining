I love this place! It's so yummy and prices are reasonable.. . The wait was about 1 hour... It was my first time there so I was getting extremely impatient! ... . . But let me tell you, It was totally worth it !!!. . We were a party of 6 and ordered the shrimp , king crab legs, crawfish (the whole shebang) fried oysters, Cajun fries and beers.. . It was so good! but very messy.. We end up paying about $35 per person which was a good deal since we all left super satisfied! . . (Oh! Watching the LAKERS win that night was the cherry on top :D )
