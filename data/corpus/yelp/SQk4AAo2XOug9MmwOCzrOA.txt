Restaurant: Hatfield&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
A MUST. . . I've eaten here several times and Hatfield's is my favorite restaurant in LA. The service is amazing but the food is the real reason to enjoy this wonderful venue. It's great to see the owners actually working at the restaurant and involved in the service. I took my entire family here for dinner a few months ago and the kids loved it, with a little help from Quinn both our young daughters received an outstanding dish.. . The setting is small which compliments the menu and service. Make sure you order the croque madame on the appetizer menu in addition to the tasting menu, you should be enjoying.
