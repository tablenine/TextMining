Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
So - have always loved the sushi here.  Great stuff, original rolls, certainly earns a spot in the top 3 of all the sushi restaurants I've tried in Chicago.  . . HOWEVER, I cannot say enough bad things about the service.  If you put your name down for a table, it is NEVER the amount of time they tell you.  Once you've waited the minimum 45 minutes for a table of two at 6:45 pm, it might (as it did in our case) take a good 20 minutes for edemame to be brought to the table.  Mitch (the sushi chef) is fantastic, and will often send over some appetizer, as though saying "yah, I know...I know" about the service.  Once the food arrives, all is forgiven.  Favorites are the spicy tuna crunch roll, the "Oh My God!" roll, the O-Roll, and Sunny.
