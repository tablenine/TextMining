I really don't get it.  All I've ever heard are rave reviews about this place and I honestly thought it was one of my least favorite meals I've ever had.  . . As far as I am aware, this place caters to vegetarians.. although I'm not a strict veggie anymore, I ordered the veggie burger and it was far from great.  The burger tasted like a frozen boca burger.. Not sure if it was or wasn't, regardless, that was what I thought it was.  The ingredients on top of the burger did not work together at all and did not bring out any flavors that I cared to taste. . . I thought the place was cute and quaint with a cute little staff, but our service was pretty terrible.  The guy seemed like he could have cared a less, and as a server, that is just annoying.. . I'm not really sure what to say, but I won't be returning. Sorry Pick Me Up.
