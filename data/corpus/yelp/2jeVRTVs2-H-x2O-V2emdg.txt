Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
OK, so I'm really confused by Tito's Tacos.  Every time I drive by there is a line out the door.  It's reasonable to assume that when there's that kind of foot traffic on a regular basis it must be good, right?  Yet when I finally stopped in to try it, I thought the food was terrible, the service was crappy and it was filthy dirty on top of that.  So why do people love it so much?  . . The taco shells were literally soaked in oil.  The meat inside the tacos tasted like low grade dog food and was covered by cheese and this greasy, overly salty brown sauce.  I kept trying to figure out what it was.  Mystery sauce?  Not good!  . . To use a cartoon analogy, if your typical enchilada sauce is say Speedy Gonzales, then the brown mystery sauce at Tito's would be the equivalent of his lesser cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez.  . . It reminded me of those commercials for that dog food "Chuck Wagon", where they would pour some water in the  bowl and make a meaty soup out of it.  Speaking of dog food, the idea of getting on the floor and chowing down next to Fido is more appetizing to me than muscling down another coronary in a crispy corn shell from Tito's.  . . I don't get you, Tito's Tacos!  Even Del Taco makes better Mexican food than you and I wouldn't feed that to my dog if I had one.  . . Next time you're jonesing for cheap Mexican food, step on the gas (pun intended), drive right past Tito's and instead hit the taco trucks.  The lines aren't as long and the price is right ($1 tacos).  Your tummy will thank me.
