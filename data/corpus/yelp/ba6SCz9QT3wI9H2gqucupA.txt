Maybe if this place wasn't showcased on shows like The Hills maybe I wouldn't have had such high expectations. I heard really great things about this place so I had to check it out.. . First of all, good luck finding parking because there's very limited street parking. There's a tiny lot that holds maybe 6 cars at most across the street but even that is a pain in the ass. . . I'm a HUGE sweets person so I think I have a pretty high tolerance for sweets over the average person, but even this place was too much for me.. . I ended up ordering two shakes, the Milky Way Malt and the Coffee Toffee Crunch Shake. Both were really really sweet. The first few bites were definitely good but I couldn't handle anymore than that. For someone who LOVES sweets, this was way too rich for me. . . If you come here and order their shakes, be sure to share it with someone, unless you have a very high threshold for sweets, then you can finish one all by yourself.
