Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I don't know how good their burgers are because I haven't tried them here yet. However, I stopped by here to grab a quick snack of their popular apple pie a la mode one day and it was really disappointing. The apple pie slices are broken up when served and was extremely watery/sogging. It didn't even look appetizing. The scoop of vanilla ice cream they served came out of a big tub of old fashion vanilla ice cream. I wouldn't order their apple pie here again.
