Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I can't believe I keep forgetting to put up a review of this place.  My last outing was with Craig H.  There were amazing vittles to be had.  We split a combo #3 (I think), which had beef brisket, marinated beef something-or-rather, chicken, and pork belly... all tasted great.  In addition to the numerous side dishes, we also got soju with the combo.  Everything had great flavor, and only the shear pain of my bloated stomach kept me from ordering more.. . This wasn't a perfect dining experience, however. The broken English posed a problem, as we couldn't communicate with the servers well.  But in summary, I wish they would trust us to cook our own food, instead of their doing it for us (I guess we looked like we would maim ourselves).  One other thing, they ran out of rice paper.  How does a Korean restaurant run out of this? That's like an Irish restaurant running out of potatoes.. . Also out of principle, I don't like the idea of paying $28 for a ribeye steak... it's not better than the Ranch Reserve steaks you can get at Vons on sale for $3.99/lb.  Can we bring our own and they just charge us a "steakage" fee?
