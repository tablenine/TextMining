Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
It drives me crazy to drive by this place at night--there is a wait any night of the week and I want to scream at the people sitting outside that IT. IS. NOT. WORTH. IT.. . I wouldn't even eat here if there was no wait. I've been a few times, hoping I'd find something I hadn't before. Their spinach ravioli with meatballs was just two small meatballs floating in a sea of raviolis whose already-lacking flavor was drowned by a humdrum tomato sauce that I swear came out of Â Hunt's can. Things improved with the shrimp pasta, whose heavenly butter sauce saved the meal. But the preached-about pizza, aside from a wholesome crunchy crust, fell short of the perfection I had heard so much about. I'm from deep-dish Chicago, but I can spot a good thin crust, and this was not it. . . I've heard this place is good because of the strange toppings you can get, so maybe that's what I've done wrong by only ordering pepperoni and cheese varieties. But I'm of the opinion that if it doesn't have the fundamentals down solid, it can't really be called good pizza.
