Restaurant: Bite Cafe
Category: American (New)
Bite is the type of local haunt that you keep going back to. In my case, that means having dinner there almost every night I am too lazy to cook for myself. . . Their basic menu includes salads, sandwiches, pastas. The veggie burrito is fab. Their specials change daily, which is why I am a regular. They always have a special meat, fish, poultry, and vegetarian dish, and it is usually $12 or less. The portions are very healthy and the dishes are very creatively prepared. The brunch is good, too. Expect a wait on Sunday (though it tends to not be as bad as other Sunday brunch place waits).. . The only reason I would not give it 4 stars is the decor. Â I am all for hipster grunge, but would it really hurt to recover the banquettes?
