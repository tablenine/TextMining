I'm a fan of the original location in Midtown but I'm liking the new loca luna more and more with each visit.  . . The Mojitos and Sangria are simple but tasty. After trying to make these drinks at home you develop an appreciation for the simplicity of their drinks.. . The tapas are great portions and packed for lots of simple flavors.  The lobster bisque is my favorite. Served in small expresso cups, it's a great beginning to your meal.  . . Because their are so many small plates to pick from I'll just give you my list of "must tries":. . -watermelon tomato salad. -braised beef ribs. -fried calamari. -brisket empanadas. -vegetable empanadas. -grouper taco. -brisket taco. -grilled asparagus. -fried green beans. -chicken skewers. -steak skewers
