Wow!! Reading the 52 yelp reviews before me, I am almost ashamed to give Jenny 3 stars but unfortunately I am.  The turkey chili was pretty cold and flavorless. I got the most manly thing on the menu which was the peasant sandwich, salami and turkey on ciabatta. Good meat, cheese and bread I am good to go!  The place was packed and the chairs and tables were a little too small and cramped for me but we had a nice time and the girl was happy.  Definitely a good spot to take a girl for lunch or a feminine guy...(before people get offended, I just don't think Souper Jenny is a spot for some 300 pound offensive lineman that likes ribs and cheeseburgers)   Anyway, check it out...solid place for a lunch..
