Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I went back again this past week and I'm sad to say that the quality of their meats have suffered.  The galbi wasn't as tasty and was much smaller in portion.  Their beef brisket - which is usually consistently good - was very chewy and dissatisfying.. . Nevertheless, I will continue to go back since service is usually good... and well, they stole my heart a year ago when I first visited.. . Like many restaurants in this bad economy, they've made cutbacks.  Just be prepared if you've been coming for a while that it's not going to be exactly the same.. . **************************************. In response to this review, the owner contacted me to assure me that they have not made cutbacks on the quality of their meat.  They contacted their distributor to complain and stated that they would be getting a new batch of beef.  . . It is great to know they take their customers' reviews so seriously.  Surely, their attentiveness to excellence will take them far in the restaurant business.
