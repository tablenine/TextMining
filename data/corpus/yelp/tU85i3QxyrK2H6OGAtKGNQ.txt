Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I went here on a Sunday afternoon and had a good experience, but was told to come back late night after being at the bar all night, because that was the "true weiner's circle experience". Sooo, I did at 330 am after a Friday night of 9 hours in the bars, and all I wanted was a cheeseburger. Â  The point I realized that I wasn't going to get my burger was when I got a handful of french fries thrown in my face, and one of the employees jumped out of the trailer and tried to beat a customer to death with a spatula....... Bad for business kids- I left, and will never go back late night. If I want to get yelled at, I'll call my mother - just give me a GD cheeseburger.....  But, for a greasy afternoon snack - it's the place to go!
