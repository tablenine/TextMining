It was just brought to my attention that I have the same initials as Tom Colicchio and Top Chef.  Ha!  It's no wonder why I'm drawn to Craft.  Went back over the holidays and had a great time again.  I actually couldn't get a reservation and decided that I could just eat the bar with my boyfriend, but they recognized me and gave me a table anyway.  I can't get enough of the Pork Belly and the Braised Beef Short Ribs.  I guess I just like anything that meltssssssss in my mouth.........
