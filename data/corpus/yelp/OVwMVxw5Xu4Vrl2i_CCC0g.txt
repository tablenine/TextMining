Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I don't get it. . . My boss ordered a crap load of tacos from here for Cinco de Mayo and her assistant and I got the "lovely" job of picking them up.  . . I have never seen an eating establishment so packed.  There was a line coming out of every imaginable orifice of this place.  . . So silly me... i figure these have to be the best tacos on the whole freaking planet.... . not so much.. . bland, with pink liquid for salsa and green liquid for guacamole.. . like i said.... i don't get it
