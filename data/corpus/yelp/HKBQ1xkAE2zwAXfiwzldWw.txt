DON'T LET THE STRIP-MALL LOCALE FOOL YOU!!!  . This is one of THE BEST places to get chinese food!  They're open late for those of us who are hungry after 10pm but don't necessarily want fast food.. . You know it's good when over half the clientel is asian.  The dishes are large and flavorful and the staff is good, fast and relatively friendly. They are usually willing to make adjustments when possible (more or less heat,  veggies,  sauce, etc.) . . I try to go with a group - mainly because I'm indecicive, but greedy and this lets me try a bunch of different dishes at once.
