Restaurant: Watershed
Category: American (New)
Watershed is housed in a renovated garage in downtown Decatur. The food is contemporary southern and the atmosphere is casually expensive.. . I went there with my dad (it's a great place to go when you're not paying) and ordered the hot vegetable plate. When it arrived, I was underwhelmed by the presentation -- just three sides on a plate. But when I tried the veggies, which included some absolutely delicious gingered beets, I was won over. It remains one of the finest meals I've had in Atlanta.
