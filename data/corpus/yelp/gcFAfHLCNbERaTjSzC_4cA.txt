Potato balls, potato balls, why are you so good yet so deadly? Psh, we can probably say that about any super yummy food. Great for your taste buds, not great for your expandable waistline. Just close your eyes, gorge, and think "that one didn't count".. . After having worked down the street from Porto's, I've to say that I overdid it and no longer dream about these round, golden treats. However, I remember how good it used to taste when I used to eat them as often as normal patrons. Their other foods (particularly tortas) are quite delicious lunch choices. I know, you're going to forget all about your main meal when you face the 180 degree view dessert choices. But it's okay, you'll most likely be waiting in line, so take your time deciding how you want to compile your 2000 calories.
