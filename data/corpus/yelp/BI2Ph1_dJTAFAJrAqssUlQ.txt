One major problem is the crowds! Toast can get absolutely PACKED. That aside, breakfast and lunch here is absolutely and completely delicious. They have so many great veg-friendly options! I haven't yet had something that I didn't like here. I have no interest in coming for dinner, because I imagine it's even worse crowd-wise, but it is definitely a go-to for lunch. Just try not to get annoyed by how many people are "doing lunch" at Toast. Focus on the tasty, tasty food!
