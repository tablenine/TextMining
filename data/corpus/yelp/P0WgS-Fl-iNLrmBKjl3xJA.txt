The brilliant aspect of this place, and why I'm giving it 5 stars, is in the fact that there is a secret to it:  1/2 priced maki before 6PM on Saturdays and Sundays.  BRILLIANT!  Their signature maki is also my favorite in the city thus far (Godzilla from Sushi X being a close second).  Jalapeno, strawberry, edimame and wasabi mayo combined into one role and its GOOD?!  WTF?!  . . I've never been on a weekend night, but all other times have been fine with me.  I don't know why people are giving it low reviews.  I think its better than a lot of places out there.
