Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I never thought of eating chicken and waffles together before, but a friend of mine assured me that it was great. When we went in to Roscoe's there was a crowd, and people waiting outside. We were seated quickly though, and the waiter was friendly and helpful.. . I just got the standard chicken and waffles, and I have to say that the WAFFLE was the best part. So good. I would say it's even better than waffles served at a breakfast place. The chicken wasn't anything special, but together it was a great meal.
