Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
We went to Umami Burger and we were disappointed. . . First, we were seated on the outside patio, which they did not ask whether to sit there or inside and just assumed we were okay with it. When we sat there, half of us were sitting in the sun with flies and pigeons. it wasn't the best atmosphere and it made the food less appetizing.. . The service was mediocre. They gave us the condiments when were halfway done with our burgers and almost done with our fries. They gave us an additional side of fries when we didn't order it (and they charged Â us, but we eat it). Plus, they didn't care about giving us the food, and they just set it down on the table anywhere. They did not offer to refill our water.. . Although we did think the quality of products were pretty good, the burgers were just okay and were a bit overpriced.. . We will most likely not go back.
