review #795, I'm sure I won't say anything new. . We tried to go on Friday night, but the wait for just two of us was over an hour long, so we went to the sushi joint across the street, which was awesome. I don't remember their name, so I'm piggybacking reviews.. . On Sunday just before we left LA we tried again to get my man's favorite crunchy pork ginger noodles. Oh, dear god it was worth the wait. I had the tempura bowl, and we shared bites of each. WOW. Delicious, humongous dishes, filling and CHEAP. Totally worth it. Go. Now. Have some for me.
