Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I happened to be in the LA area today and gave MILK a shot given it's iconic status and wildly popular stats on yelp.  After previously digging through all these reviews, I decided to try some of everyone's favorites.. . Tres Leche Cake: very very sweet, pretty good given I only had one bite.. . Blue Velvet Cake: interesting twist on one of my favorite cakes, I like it a lot, but it's so incredibly decadent that I can't see myself having anymore than a few bites.. . Coffee Toffee Crunch Shake:  Such a delicious guilty pleasure, though I think it may have been too guilty.. . Media Noche Sandwich:  Good, but not great.  If you're in the Huntington Beach area, I can recommend a place that does this sandwich much much better.. . Clam Chowder:  Good, but a little on the watery side.  It's loaded with so many different ingredients so I think it's definitely worth trying.. . Red Velvet poppers:  I didn't try them, but they looked very edible and I ended up buying a bunch for my girlfriend's coworkers.
