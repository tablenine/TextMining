The first time I came here a few years ago was for my boyfriend's sister's surprise birthday party.  It proved to be a fun atmosphere to celebrate over a big ol' cup of hot chocolate on a cool fall evening.  Since then I have returned a couple times to see singer/songwriter friends of mine perform on the back room.  This brings be to my favorite thing about Uncommon Ground: there seems to be a little bit for everyone here; good food, good drinks, coffeeshop feel, music, poetry, and so on.  . . My least favorite thing?  There always seems to be this weird pressure to buy food even if you're just there for the show and UG always makes a point to make a big deal out of this to my musician friends and their fans.  I have never quite figured it out, but I know it's caused people to miss the show over the confusion.  It's weird and I don't particularly like that aspect.. . All and all, not a bad little joint, but maybe not my fav place ever.
