Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
A-OK, that pretty much sums it up. Doc Chey's isn't authentic and doesn't really claim to be. However, sometimes a trip to Buford Hwy is a trek, and DC has some great grub at a crazy low price. The last meal I had at DC was mediocre and at their now-closed Sandy Springs location.. . I went back recently with some friends and had a great time. A disaster meal @ Machu Pichu still fresh in my mind, the server was extremely attentive and refilled my drink with the quickness. It's a BIG pet peeve of mine to sit around parched waiting for a refill. . . We shared some edamame and I had the 'Chinese' black bean beef &amp; noodles. It was delicious and I'll definitely back.
