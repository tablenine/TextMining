Restaurant: 123 Burger Shot Beer
Category: Burgers
Went here after a softball game with my team at around 6pm on a Saturday. i've never been here late at night and can't offer reviews on that or people who go here during a game. . Wasn't expecting much. I figured it was going to be all about the gimmick and that the burgers would be bad.. . The only thing bad were the regular fries, which were substandard. The waffle fries were delicious.. . And the place is awesome.. . Granted, we did spend over 300 bucks here (hey - at least gratuity was included then) but it was all worth it.. . The shots were surprisingly strong. They were overly sweet and didn't feel like a lot - but when we all left the bar, all of us realized how drunk we got that (granted, we did have 7 shots and an endless amount of delicious 3 dollar beer). . And the burgers - they were freakin awesome. Yes, they are small and were done in a few bites.. but most of us have 4 or 5 and were more than good.. . And the waitress are awesome. I'd almost describe their outfits as a "classier" (or maybe more new york city esque) version of the hooters waitress outfits.. . This place is now the post game spot whenever my softball team has a game at Dewitt Clinton park.
