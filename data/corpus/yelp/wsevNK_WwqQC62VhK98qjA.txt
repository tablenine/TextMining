Yum!  If there's anything more satisfying than Korean barbecued meats, I've yet to discover it.  . . We were promptly seated and presented with a whole plethora of small dishes to munch on while we waited for our entrees.  The most interesting was the often commented upon fried whole-fish, which didn't really do much for me.. . We ordered the spicy tofu soup, the barbecued ribs, and beef bulgogi.  All of it was delicious.  The soup was flavorful and spicy, with the egg adding a nice richness and the tofu incredibly silky.  Bulgogi and ribs were very good...the bulgogi haunts my dreams.  The rib portion was a bit small.  . . Service was fine...we got our food pretty quickly.  Overall, an interesting and delicious dining experience!
