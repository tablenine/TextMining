Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The first time I went there, I thought that they would have my beer on tap. I was wrong. A little disappointed, I asked the bartendar to suggest something that was close to my choice beer. He went ahead and gave me his suggestion... turns out, I love it more than my choice beer. . . Father's Office breaks the norm, and doesn't deal with waiters or waitresses. The only people you ever interact with is the bartendar or the rest of your party. Their burger is amazing. It's just what a burger should be. They serve the best sweet potato fries and in a decent portion to keep you happy while you're enjoying your beverage of choice.
