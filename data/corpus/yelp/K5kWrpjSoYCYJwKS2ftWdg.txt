Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I am a huge hot dog, polish dog, and sausage lover.  But I have only been here a few times so I can't give it the complete 5 stars because I have yet to try the Turkey Dog.  You heard right, I recently found out they serve turkey franks.  I'm just happy they carry a lighter calorie version of casing filled meat.  I could probably try everything on the menu but would rather save my arteries from clotting up.  I would definitely bring out of towners here if they want the true LA experience, for god's sake it's been there since 1939!  The wait can be long but anyway it does take a while to decide what you want, the menu IS overwhelming.  . . *Pink's is vegan friendly!
