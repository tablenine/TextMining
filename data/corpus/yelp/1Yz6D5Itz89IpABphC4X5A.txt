What a treat! . . 1. Grilled Octopus: amazing. My mom could not stop talking about it. . 2. Burricotta w/ braised artichoke. To die for. The cheese was perfect. Best part of the meal. Â . 3. Orecchiette with sausage &amp; Swiss chard: spicy and delicious.. 4. Gnocchi with duck ragu': this was good but didn't pair well w/ the Orecchiette. We should have chosen something more radically different. . 5. Secondi: The main reason this review is 4 instead of 5 stars. All of our secondis were a bit boring (although perfectly cooked). Monkfish, fluke, steak, and grilled orata. . 6. Desserts: the Cioccolato made my heart race and was served with wonderful nut treats; the Fritelle di Riso (fried dough with banana gelato) was light and creamy; and the apple fritter thing had my brother wanting to suck face with his plate. . . The service was fantastic. Effortless and seamless. We were the first people in the door for the first seating (5:30) and they gave us a terrific table tucked away in a corner. Our server treated us like we were his only table: not the kind of service I expect given that we have no chance of being regulars (at least not in the near future). . . Other than the entrees, my only complaint is that I wish the sommelier had been as sensitive as our waiter. He did not pick up early enough that we are not wine connoisseurs and so kept asking us the kind of questions that we could answer only awkwardly. I'm flattered that he gave us the benefit of the doubt (we do know a lot about food!) but it was uncomfortable.. . I'd like to go back and do the mozzarella tasting menu. . . All in all, worth it!
