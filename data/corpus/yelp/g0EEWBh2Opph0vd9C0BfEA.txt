Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
WOW! A fantastic steak paired with a killer wine (Treana Red) made Mastro's another one of my favorite restaurants.. . There were four of us dining for my birthday, but we were also in the area on business. We were quickly escorted to our table (reservations a must!) where our first waiter was courteous and very knowledgeable of the wine list. Like I said above, we chose the Treana Red from Paso Robles. Although on the higher end of the wine list it is definitely one I wouldn't pass up on.. . We had the oysters Rockefeller, mac n cheese, warm spinach salad, tuna tartar, potatoes and asparagus (a mix of appetizers and side dishes). Entrees around the table were bone in ribeye, bone in filet, chilean sea bass and the vegetarian ate (and loved) the side dishes.. . All were fantastic, and bone-in is definitely the way to go. For desert we had the "butter cake" and boy was it delicious.. . I'll definitely be back.
