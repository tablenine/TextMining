Restaurant: Uncle Julio&#39;s Casa Grande
Category: Mexican
Loud, over-priced, somewhat inconvenient location (if you don't know what you're looking for you might miss it, and if you are coming north on Peachtree, it's almost impossible to turn left into their lot) and just really not the kind of place I'd go out of my way for. And let's face it, northern Midtown on Peachtree is out of the way for pretty much everyone.. . Service was pretty mediocre. Not horrific, but sub-par and what I've come to expect from over-hyped "commercial" restaurants (as opposed to local joints and mom-and-pop places.) The food was ok - chips were definitely the highlight, which is pretty sad, actually. Fajitas were just fajitas, same as when I make them at home. The one thing that was actually tasty was the Swirl margarita. I'm a serious margarita girl and I really enjoyed the Swirl. I could see the potential of this place being just a bar with tex-mex bar food, but the dining room is just way too big and too loud.. . I really have no intention of ever going back here.
