Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
BEST PIZZA EVER!. . Ok, so there's a lot of hype surrounding these celebrity chef restaurants and it was no different with Pizzeria Mozza.  I had heard tons about it and how difficult it was to get in.  We ended up making reservations weeks in advance only to get a 5:15pm early bird dinner time slot!  No biggie, we took the reservation.  We arrived early and parked about a block away from the restaurant on a residential street.  No way we were going to pay $10 valet!  The restaurant is pretty small.  We were seated in the wine cellar area which was away from the main dining room and very cozy.  . . Here's what we ordered:. . 1) Rucola, funghi &amp; piave salad. 2) Funghi misti pizza. 3) Egg, bacon &amp; potato pizza. 4) Butterscotch budino. . The salad was good but nothing to rave about.  The funghi pizza was absolutely amazing!  The crust was thin and crunchy and just perfect.  The egg/bacon pizza was a bit mild in flavor especially compared to the funghi.  But really, it's all about the crust here at Mozza.   I would probably eat any topping on that crust.  The butterscotch budino was rich and sweet.  I would probably try a different dessert next time.  . . All in all, this place definitely lived up to all the hype!
