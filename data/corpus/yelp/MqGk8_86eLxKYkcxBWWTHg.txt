Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
They really managed to screw this place up in a short period of time. I remember when lawrys was located across the street where the stinking rose currently resides, and I remember this sour coat check lady with the thousand yard stare that used to sit in a coat room the size of a guess your weight machine. What I don't remember is the prime rib being so tasteless, Â the au jus being so watery, and the creamed corn being so thin. I don't know maybe my tastebuds have changed since i was a kid but the food isn't as good as I remembered it. I still go for traditional family dinners though, . . shalom hunger, shalom free food, am I right?
