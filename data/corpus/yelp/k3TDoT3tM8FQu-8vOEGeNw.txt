I didn't even get the pleasure of dining there.  I called about 6 days ahead to make a reservation for a large group and got a confirmation call stating that they were able to accommodate me.  The day of the dinner, I called to confirm and of course they lost my reservation!  I was told there was no way they could accommodate me and the dinner was in less than 2 hours!  I cannot tell you how upset I am by this experience, especially since this dinner was to celebrate a special occasion.  I will never dine here again but judging from all the positive reviews, I'm sure they won't miss me.
