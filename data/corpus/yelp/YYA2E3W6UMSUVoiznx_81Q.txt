Nice looking, bright colors, I agree with the previous reviews on that. . . I ordered the chili soup and it was really good. It had two different types of beans in it and was seasoned just right. Also, you can't go wrong with the sweet fries, but the sauce they serve with them isn't the best compliment for them. . . It is pricey however, Lunch cost me around $11. I can walk there and back from work during lunch time so I guess if I just needed to get out of the office, I would go again.
