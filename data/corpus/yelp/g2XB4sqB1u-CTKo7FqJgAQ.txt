Is this really healthy food?!?   Gimme some more flat bread then!  Gotta try the flat bread!!  The Cedar Plank Salmon, Scallop dish, and many of there specials that I have had are fantastic!!  There is also a Pineapple Martini that hits the spot too!!  Great service!!  Cute little desserts, served in shot glasses!  Can I get another, please!!
