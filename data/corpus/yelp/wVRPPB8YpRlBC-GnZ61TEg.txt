Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
Best Thai in Chicago as far as I am concerned and I have been around the Thai food circuit. Â They have a huge menu, but can do each dish well. The spicy peanut lover is my fav- a hot peanut sauce with onions, peppers, cashews and the meat of your choice (I get the tofo). I could eat it everyday.
