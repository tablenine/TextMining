Blah. Don't know why I thought this place would be a great quick dinner stop. I waited for my effing food for a good 20 mins before the aggressive people behind the counter realized that they forgot my order. . . The food tasted like generic bullshit. Not what I thought I was ordering. Not good. Skip it.. . I heard that drunk people like Flash Taco. I was not drunk, but I wonder if I would have thought better of it if I was...
