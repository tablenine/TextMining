Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Almost always packed, with a crowd of people waiting both inside and out.  But we return to this place week after week because the prices are reasonable, the service reliable, and the food consistent.. . We love how comfortable we feel here.  They treat us warmly whenever we go, call us by our names, joke with us, try to teach us Japanese, and seat us as soon as they can.. . They have selections that aren't always available at other places -- like amaebi, aji, engawa, etc.  And they don't charge astronomical prices for them either, like they do at Katana, Sasabune, and Sushi Roku.  . . The fish has almost always been extremely fresh.  The one exception was when we went for Friday lunch.  Mind you, this was nearly a year ago.  The quality was not as good as usual.  We suspected they were getting rid of  leftovers from the previous night to serve that day's delivery for dinner.  Well, I can't expect perfection for those prices!  . . We usually sit at the bar, where the staff tell us what's good that day, as well as what's not.  I appreciate that very much.   . . I'm always looking forward to our weekly dinners at Hide.  L.A. really needs a good, affordable sushi place.  . . Note: There's free parking next to the restaurant.  There's a pack of cats there that warm themselves under newly parked cars.  (Do they eat the fish we don't?)   A plus on both terms for me.
