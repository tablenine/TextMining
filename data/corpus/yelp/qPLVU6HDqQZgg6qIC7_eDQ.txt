My girlfriend and I went here for dinner last wednesday. I have heard about this place and we thought we would give it a try. One of the big factors for us going here was the fact that they WERE Byob. This is no longer the case, so we were a little disappointed from the start.I thought The pizza was pretty good, a little burnt, but flavorful. They skimp you a little on the cheese and toppings, but the pizza filled us both up. The waitress was very attentive and nice. Overall the pizza was good and service was great, the only problem was the no BYOB, but the manager noticed our dismay and ended up giving us 1/2 off on the bottle.Which brought this baby up to 3 stars. May go back again at some point.
