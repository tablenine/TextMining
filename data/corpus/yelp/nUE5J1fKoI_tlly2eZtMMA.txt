Eh, it's ok. It's trying to be so much more than it actually is. It's a diner. It's diner food. The Juicy Lucy is a hamburger, as advertised. It's not amazing, not awful. Just ok.. . Hipsters in booths trying so hard not to be cool. Servers forgetting that they're servers and not hipsters or models. The water glasses never got refilled, but the waitress was a 7 on the hottie scale. . . I'd go back and order pie, just because.
