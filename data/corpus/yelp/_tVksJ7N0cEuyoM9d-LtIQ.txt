Enchiladas were so good here. The wait staff was really nice! They give you chips with 2 different salsa dips (one that was tart and another that was hot beyond belief). It's BYOB - so be sure to bring some cerveza to enjoy with your dinner. The tres leches was a total disappointment -- but everything else at the restaurant was fantastic!
