Man, I love me some Joy's, that's for darn sure.. . Joy's serves your typical American style Thai cuisine, and it's always quick, hot, and most important, delicious. You can't go wrong with the baby egg rolls or chicken satay appetizer, and I enjoy their Pad See Eiw. They are always willing to accommodate any special requests, and they do it with a smile.. . Is it super fancy? No, definitely not. But considering you can be in and out in less than 30 minutes and spend under $10 for an entree and appetizer, it doesn't get any better.
