I had only been here for breakfast which, by the way, is very good, until the other night when we decided to see what dinner was all about there. I must say, it's pretty damn good. I had the chicken curry which I almost never order. It tasted pretty authentic to me. It's also BYOB which certainly helps with the tab. Don't fret if you forget your booze at home, Bite is attached to the Empty Bottle where you can buy cocktails ad nauseum.. . I'll be back....for dinner and breakfast.
