I live next to this place and usually go down for a beer or two.  Best German/Belgium beer selection around town that's for sure.  If you can handle the 6%+ ABV your bound to have a good drink and time.. . I also go down and try out a different sausage (5 down so far).  . . Good times with friends sitting altogether on the bench and shooting the $hit.  Service isn't too grand, but understandable when they have to be waiting on drunkards all night.. . Bartenders could be more pleasant and look more lively... must be the German/Belgium/tough guy exterior (in flannel shirts) persona.  But for the good beer and fun who cares about them.  . . Just go up to the bar order your beer and go sit down for drink and laugh.
