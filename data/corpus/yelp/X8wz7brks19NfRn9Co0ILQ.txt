Category: Dim Sum
I never had dim sum in my life until I came here. It was probably the best experience ever to go with some friends who clearly know their dim sum. Food after food after food! We just kept taking whatever they kept pushing our way. Between the 3 of us we spent over 45 dollars all together and we were so full. I suppose it's helpful to bring along someone who knows what the dishes are like. But I can guarantee you its all good. It's pretty busy on the weekends, there was a line at the door when we left around 12:00 and we had gotten there a little before 11am.
