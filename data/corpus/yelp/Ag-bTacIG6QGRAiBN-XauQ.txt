Restaurant: La Parrilla
Category: Mexican
Visit Date: 03.29.2009. . Having gone to Georgia Tech for 4.5 years, I've always heard of La Parrilla but never went. It wasn't until I came back to Atlanta to visit did I manage to hit up this place.. . My table was given generous portions of chips &amp; salsa, with the chips fresh and hot from the kitchen, indicating its homemade quality. Though we were halfway done with one basket of chips before the server took it away and gave us a new basket. That's a bit wasteful. I had the fish tacos and they were good, but not the best fish tacos out there. The rice and soup/sauce side items were okay.
