Let's make this clear.  I don't like waiting in lines.  In fact, I don't like doing anything in lines (with the possible exception of dancing).  But on many afternoons, I feel like that light (actually a lamb sandwich dripping with au jus) at the end of the Philippe lunch line is well worth my suffering.  When I sit down with that simple, classic LA delicacy comprised of just meat and bread, I marvel at how moist the red meat core could remain without weighing down the bread, making it soggy, or just causing the sandwich to fall apart altogether.  Throw in a baked apple (which is like apple sauce in the shape of an actual apple) and an iced tea, and you've got yourself a meal that's been good enough to feed a century's worth of downtown city dwellers.
