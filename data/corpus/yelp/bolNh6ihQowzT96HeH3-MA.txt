Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Almost 2 thousand of reviews but none of them mattered until this one. Its a short review. If you want to now about the food - just got there and try it. We only went because the line was short. He got his food (double burger, a side of chili, and fries with nacho cheese), and I got my veggie dog. The especial came with grilled onions, guacamole,, and tomato's (i think). It was good. Guacamole falling out on all sides of my cold ass dog. Yes it was not hot. I still ate it and enjoyed every bite. . What I really want to talk about is the great service. The woman who took our order was a doll. Nice, funny. and attentive. She was cracking jokes to the point of me blushing. You make me blush... you got the power! For that... 3.5 stars with room to grow. I need to go on a diet.
