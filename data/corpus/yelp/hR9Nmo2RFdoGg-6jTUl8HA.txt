I heard about their great sandwiches and soups and planned to peruse the extensive menu but impulsively ordered porridge because THEY SERVE PORRIDGE. I got mine with currants and cream because, as I can't emphasize enough, THEY SERVE PORRIDGE WITH CURRANTS AND CREAM.. . So I can't speak too intelligently about the food. But the space is wonderful. It's like your grandma's house is supposed to be: cozy and filled with people your age playing board games, reading, and eating eating eating.. . Seating is snug but people are friendly. Servers are sweet. Next time I'll be less impulsive and try a sandwich.
