Came here late night for some coffee and to kill some time before my friend's flight back home to KC.  She, my husband and I all ordered white chocolate mochas.  The guy at the register was like "a white mocha kinda night, eh?"  Then he went on to tell us how he used to work at another coffee place (Pete's?) and they got free coffees and he would literally drink a white chocolate mocha every single day and how he can't drink them anymore because he did that for like a year..... . I like friendly people behind the cash register at places, makes the cafe really great in my book.. . We drank the coffees outside and even though it was a cold night, the heaters were all on and a lot of people were outside.  Oh Los Feliz, I really like you.  Alcove, I will return.
