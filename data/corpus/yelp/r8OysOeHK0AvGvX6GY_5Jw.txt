More like a 3.5 star.. It's a bit confusing walking in here, especially when it's crowded. Had to do a little searching for the hostess. If it weren't for the good food, great ambiance and some cute servers ;), I'd probably would have given this place less stars. My friend and I were told our wait would be 45 minutes, we actually waited a little over an hour. (I think I read some other Yelper with a similar situation, so I guess they tend to underestimate the wait time.) Luckily we had so much to talk about. Another good thing was, they were walking around with samples of their deli's sandwiches and their bakery's pastries. All delicious!! When we finally got seated and ordered, our food came out before I could finish my slice of bread. The chicken milanese was really good. I must say, I don't share the same enthusiasm as everyone else on the mushroom fries. They didn't really taste like anything to me. Oh and P.S. do NOT valet at the parking right next to the restaurant. They charge $7.50!! Park at the lot right next to it with the $6 sign and it's actually $3 after 4pm or 6pm. It's seriously a few steps away.
