Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
One word sums this up: . O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D. . This has been on every food channel special about LA or hotdogs.  I was expecting a rainbow and a pot of gold coming out of hot dog.  Alas, there is no pot of gold or rainbow, just a hot dog and some chilli in it.  . . The positives first.  Its open late.  Great for getting here after the clubs or bars close out.  The food is decent.  Not amazing but edible and decent.. . Here comes the negatives.  Again, theres more negatives since the expectations were set so high.  The line is LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG.  It took me 45 minutes to get some hot dogs.  This is a HOT DOG, NOT A 5star resteurant.  The parking is horrendous due to a tiny lot and tons of people trying to get their fingers on this hot dog.  The hotdog was meh... wasnt OMG was MEH.. . For the LA first timers, this is an ok joint but if the line is crazy long, i would say bail it and get an innout burger instead.
