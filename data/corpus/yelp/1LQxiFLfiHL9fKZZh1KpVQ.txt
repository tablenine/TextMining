They truly must boil those pork bones to extract that much flavor!. They have a tasty bowl of Daikokuya ramen! Portion sizes are most excellent. And prices are truly a steal. . I love coming here. It's totally worth the wait. . . There is a stainless steel partition to prevent 3rd degree burns onto patrons (on the bar seating area) and servers don't speak a lick of English.. . So, when your done getting your drink on at weilands bar waddle yourselves over to this joint. This place is a must!!!!!
