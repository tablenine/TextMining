My hubby &amp; I have been hearing all the raves about Korean style tacos! So when the Kogi truck rolled into Irvine, we drove to the spot and stood in line for 3 hours to have to wait additional 30 minutes for the food. I must say, the hype didn't live up to its promise. The kimchi quesadillas were gross! The burrito I had was so sweet. I must say, my husband did like the tacos. . . It was an experience having to chase and locate the Kogi trucks. But seriously, it would have been a better night to drive to Baldwin Park to get some King Taco burrito!
