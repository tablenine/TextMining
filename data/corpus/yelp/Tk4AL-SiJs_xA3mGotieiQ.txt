Was just  introduced to this lovely gem at lunch today. It's in Downtown, but about a mile away from all the courthouse/Pershing Square mess (which is a good thing).. . It's an interesting set up - you order up front, then walk down a hall to the dining room. It's a great Oktoberfest type of seating arrangement, with long communal tables and a bar to get your big beers. . . The menu is straight forward sausage - all different types for all different tastes. Feeling pretty good about myself, I ordered the Sun Dried Tomato &amp; Mozzarella (smoked chicken &amp; turkey) sausage with the carmelized onions. It was delish. . . It's a great place for lunch because it's quick, yummy and it won't break the bank
