Maybe it was the fact that I had only eaten breakfast that day, but the dinner at Millers Pub was DAMNNN good. The wife and I headed over there for a late dinner and it was our first and definitely not our last time there. . . The service was prompt, the food tasted like it was right out off the cooker, beer I had (Stella Artois - draft) was frigid and the place was warm and cozy! . . What I have to say next, is totally breaking my heart. The Bleu Cheese burger with bacon (recommendation from Sara E. on Yelp), totally beat out my beloved Bleu cheese burger from Moodys Pub on north Broadway. I have taken many people to that place for their Bleu cheese burger but now, I will have to show the same people what Millers Pub is made of! . . The portions are huge. My wife and I walked over a mile in the horizontal snow/ice storm to our car, just so we could walk some of the food off!
