I love this place!  I finally tried it out last night.  The macaroni and cheese was incredible, one of the top 3 I've ever had.  Creamy and gooey and salty, with a crusty top.  The spirit moved me to ask if they could put bacon in it.  Awesome.. . I also adored the martinis.  I tried a whole bunch.  Favorites included the Canteloupe Martini (Melon vodka, canteloupe puree, garnished with juicy canteloupe balls on a skewer. The drink was a lovely canteloupe color. It was not too sweet, but was delicious and refreshing. Loved it.) and the Oceans 11 Martini (Beautiful and elegant, this was again vodka, plus parfait amour (an amazing violet/rose petal/orange liquer which I had to look up on the internet, but I am so going to buy now) and edible flowers floating on top. This was one of my favorites. It was just so glamorous, strong and simple with essence of flowers. Lovely.). . Nice, diverse crowd and nice waitress.  I can't wait to go back.. .
