This review will serve as your road map for your trip to Manny's.  First of all, park in the free lot if you can to avoid paying Da Mare's de facto tax, i.e. the pay box.  Then, make sure you have a bit of money in your pocket before you enter Manny's.. . When you enter, grab a tray, silverware and a napkin.  Lay said tray on the metal bars and proceed straight past the dinner selections to the Matzo ball soup.  Place your order for the Matzo ball soup at this time, and then proceed to the corned beef guy with the 'stache at the slicer.. . The guy with the 'stache at the slicer is an icon.  He will give you a hard time.  He will pull your leg.  He's a treasure and I think a veteran, so smile and order your corned beef on onion roll with a couple of potato pancakes.  Banter with him a bit if you dare.  Then move on with your tray down the line and grab a Green River.  You are now ready to move to your table.  No, you won't pay right now.  You'll get a receipt.  On to the formica and the huge meal.. . You'll find there's enough corned beef for two sandwiches.  You'll probably remove some of it to make it easier to eat the sandwich.  If you can finish it all, as well as the potato pancakes and soup, you are a hero.  . . Afterwards, you'll saunter towards the door, fuller than you've ever been, and pay the damages.  Yes, it's going to cost you a bit of money.  But it's worth it.  This is the best corned beef sandwich in the city.  But you can only eat here twice a year at the most.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself going out to buy new pants with a larger waist size.  It's that good.  . . I highly recommend Manny's, especially for a hungry Saturday morning/afternoon.  Definitely something every Chicagoan should experience at least once.  You will know why this city is referred to as the City of Broad Shoulders after eating here.
