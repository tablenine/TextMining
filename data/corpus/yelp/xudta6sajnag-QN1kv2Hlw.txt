My experience at Craft last night was phenomenal. We ordered the tasting menu (highly recommend you do this) and were completely blown away. First, the bread is to die for. The pumpernickel was soooo good I had to ask them to take it away so we wouldn't fill up! Three amuse bouches came before our first dish. The highlight of those was the Dungeness crab gratin. Omg. It was one of the best things I've ever consumed. A perfect blend of creamy, cheesy bliss. Next came sea urchin (wow. Weird, but wow), delicious mackerel topped with serrano ham (perfectly crispy on top), a lobster pasta (def. tasted some truffle in there), roasted foie gras (my first time!), squab, lamb medallions, and some desserts that I can't remember the name of, but were amazing. I loved the homemade frozen yogurt. Every piece of food was meticulously crafted to taste amazing and complex, yet simple and clean at the same time.. . Its really hard to describe this place. It is a perfect restaurant. The service is so attentive and sincere. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, yet modern and elegant. You really have to just try it. I felt like a million bucks when we left, because you know they really care about making good food for people, and you were treated better than you've ever been at any other restaurant, ever.. . Yes, all the glitz comes with a price tag to match.. But really-- if you just didn't go out to eat for a couple of weeks, you would be able to save enough to go out for a meal some place like Craft. It is honestly worth it. Oh, and im eating the free brioche muffin they gave us when we left. It's reeeeeaaallllly good.
