Sorry if I offend anyone.....but I thought the sandwich was a bit dry. There was no line when I went which was a plus. There was primo parking which was another plus. BUT the area is a bit scary at night...good thing I had my UFC with me. Oh and the place looks a bit dirty. Have I offended anyone yet? Kekekekeke...
