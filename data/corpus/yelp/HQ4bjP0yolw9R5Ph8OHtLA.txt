Went there tonight with my wife and another couple and the food was amazing!  I would highly recommend the Triple T Burger I believe for the appetizer (basically 3 mini burgers).  As for an entree, I had the half slab of baby back ribs.  Very tender and battered in their own special BBQ sauce which is to die for.
