Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Just be ready to stand in line for a while.  Or did you have to grab a number and wait?  I can't remember anymore, they've changed it from one to the other but can't remember which to which... anyway, it's a long wait.  And make sure you're in the right line... the main one is to order the food and pastries and the one on the right is for whole cake orders.  You can go to the left section of the restaurant if you just want drinks and appetizers.  And upstairs they have party stuff and pinatas.. . Since you're going to be waiting a while, you might as well buy as much as you can when it's your turn.  All of their cakes and pastries are fantastic and the sandwiches are awesome... true, you can get sandwiches anywhere, but not like these.  I've yet to try the potato balls but clearly, from the other reviews, they're to die for.. . I like dining it (cuz I like people watching).  Hard to get a table though... you gotta come in with at least two people... one to stand in line and the other to scope out a table.  I'm like a vulture out there... if I see you're almost done eating, I'll hover over you until you leave.  Hey, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do when she's at Porto's!
