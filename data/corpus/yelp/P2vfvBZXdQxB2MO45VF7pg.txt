Restaurant: Serpas
Category: American (New)
I truly enjoyed my experience at Serpas. We went for one of my friends birthday and our lady of honor was a little late, so we all chilled at the bar. My friends all got cocktails that looked really pretty, so I would imagine that they were taste as well. I do not drink so I just got a soda and the bar tender was very nice. Upon the birthday girls arrival we were seated immediately and our server was very attentive. She was great attention to detail as we had some vegetarians at the table, she explained the menu without skipping a beat. Now as far as the food goes, the ambiance and service do not hold a candle. I had the Serpas house salad, OMG! I did not think something this simple could have such a wonderful effect. Spring mix green and candied pecans and a blistered grape vinaigrette. SOOO GOOD! I also had the mussel app as my meal, rightly so this bowl is huge. Huge but O SO wonderful. It comes served in a spicy garlic broth and grilled toast. Magnificent!!! O you already know I will be back!!!
