HB is a wonderful restaurant and we enjoyed every bit of it. The service was excellent. Our waiter was adorable and everyone seemed to keep an eye on us to make sure that we had what we needed. The food was delicious, all three of us enjoyed our entrees, we loved the dates and beets for appetizers and the dessert was amazing. We couldn't believe how affordable it was and will definitely return.
