I am -unbelievably- pleasantly surprised. The quality of the food, outstandingly personal service, respectable wine selection, and intimate ambiance (and we were outside) easily earn 5 stars. Ridiculously delightful, and we will be back shortly.. . I'm sure you were wondering: yes, that pie crust is vegan.. . Also try the insalata mista, and any or all of the roasted veg antipasti. Then try a dry red wine. . And please, at some point, get rapini on your pizza. The combo of bitter green with the freshly baked crust is fabulous. I probably don't need to mention that the crushed garlic on it seals the deal.
