Can anyone write their review without mentioning that fake wannabe rock and roll singer with big hair that sings with a guitar and has outrageous outfits that is used here to entertain on stage while you're eating?. . Anyways... boyfriend took me here for lunch. Was real excited, wanted to really like this place because everyone else did. I've eaten a lot of Thai food in my life. And from way too many different places. . . We ordered the Pad Kee Meo (spicy mint noodles), green curry (medium), thai beef jerky, thai ice tea, and a coke.. . We saw our waitress and then somehow she disappeared and figured we didn't need service after taking down our order. The lunch special prices are reasonable. But the flavors were rather bland. Not sure if they were having an off day or that lunch has lower quality assurance, but I've had those dishes so many times and they really didn't do well here. I must say the thai beef jerky was awesome.. . The drink portions is an insult. It's like child's play. Mostly filled with ice and there are no refills on the soda, so I basically drank water the rest of the time. . . I'm going to give this place a second try when I come back for dinner. Maybe the food will all of a sudden taste ten times better if an asian looking man with a guitar serenades me. Seems to work for others....
