Restaurant: Apres Diem
Category: French
I've been here about 5 times now and I am ALWAYS disappointed by Apres Diem.  First off, the service is horrible.  The wait staff takes forever to  both take your order and serve you.  They're really pushy, and it feels like they're trying to rush everyone in and out.  The music is way to loud to have a decent conversation anywhere - even outside on the patio!  The lounge area in the back is really cool, but it hardly makes up for the problems this place has.  This place is one of those establishments where the prices don't match the experiences.  I wouldn't pay for another entree here again.  The pasta I ordered during a previous visit was mediocre.  I need to stop giving this places chances (or money).  There are so many better places in Atlanta to be wasting another night at Apres Diem.
