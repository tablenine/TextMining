My friend took me here for brunch recently and as nice as the setting was, service and the food was something less than to be desired.. . We both had a version of Eggs Benedict. Her eggs yolks were solid as a rock and the bacon was dry and chewy. . . Luckily my smoked salmon Benny was good, but never got a refill on my coffee once. So disappointing. That's a guaranteed full star deduction from any restaurant in my book. . . It has a really nice brunch atmosphere, but for quality food I'm going to have to stay on the East side with Square One or Little Dom's.
