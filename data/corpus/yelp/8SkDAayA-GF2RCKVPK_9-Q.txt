Restaurant: Mexicali Cocina Cantina
Category: Mexican
On Monday nights, food is 30% off, which means I ate here every Monday for about 3 years since I worked on the Blvd.  A great place to be a regular--nice bartenders (cute, too!), good microbrews on tap, decent food.  I don't actually like Mexican food, but I like Mexicali, so take that into consideration--I don't eat anything spicy, and Mexicali is the one place I can agree to when others are in the mood for tortilla-fare.  It's definitely Californian-influenced.  The guacamole has changed in the last year and is now a neon green and not as good, but the shrimp and crab quesadilla is one of the best things on the menu--ask for light on the chesse so you don't drown in grease.
