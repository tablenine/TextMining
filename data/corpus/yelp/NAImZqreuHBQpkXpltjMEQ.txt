Wanting out of the same old, same old lunch offerings, my daughter and I went for lunch at Desta. What a GREAT choice! Nice atmosphere, good jazz, kind and considerate waitstaff. And the food was perfect! We shared a vegetarian combo platter and a platter of fish tibs. It was more than we could eat, and inexpensive, too! What a nice find. Thanks, Yelp!
