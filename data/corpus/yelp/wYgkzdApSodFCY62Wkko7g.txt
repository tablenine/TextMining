Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
We loved the waffles - they were scrumptious and promptly consumed. In fact, we ate them faster than was healthy! Kudos to Roscoe's for their ice-cream scoop sized serving of butter on top =). . . That said, the chicken-breast half of our 1/2 chicken (split an Herb's special #3) was over-cooked and a little dry (of course, chicken-breast has a tendency toward dryness, so....) . . Lots of down-home diner-type atmosphere - and the clientele was extremely diverse (good people watching! good "diversity-themed" mural!)... and then it's just a hop, skip and a jump over to the theatres on Sunset and Hollywood Blvd. Great hearty, pre-movie dinner perhaps?. . Oh: and we liked the guy with the red bow-tie who seated us.
