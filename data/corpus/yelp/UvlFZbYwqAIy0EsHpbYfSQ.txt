So....I'm not really a breakfast person which makes it sorta odd that I have been here several times. THAT'S what's so amazing!  Now - you've gotta try the granola WITH fruit and yogurt.  They chop up 4 different kinds of fruit and all together it is dee-lish-US!  Tried an egg thing but I got textures issues so I had to order something else...their burgers and salad's are good too so if you're not into eggs or pancakes (I know, I know...) you can still get full and fat here!  Love the wait staff and the wait to sit is never as long as they tell you!!!
