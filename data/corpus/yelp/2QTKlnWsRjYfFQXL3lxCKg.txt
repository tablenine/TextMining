Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
F-U-N.. . Don't bring an attitude to Hamburger Mary's....this place has enough personality for all of us.  You might have to wait for a table, you might have to wait for service, but it is totally worth it!. . It's the little things that make Hamburger Mary's so fun: like the puns on the menu, or the cute names on the specialty drinks, or the hot male server that flirts with your husband and not with you....but I digress.  . . Hamburger Mary's is known for (duh) hamburgers.  And I got the quesadilla!  But I'm here to say it was delicious.  They have an extensive menu, so if you aren't a hamburger eater you will be just fine.  I highly suggest the specialty drinks...they are strong and take the edge off the hour wait!  . . In a city where we are all so serious, it's relieving to go to Hamburger Mary's, where it's just plain fun.
