Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
The Good: . - great atmosphere . - great pizza( i had the one with an egg in it which was one of the best pizzas I've ever had . - great appitizers including bruscheta with chicken livers which was very addicting . . The Bad: . - Long wait at peak hours . . The UGLY or Strange . - It is not that expensive. I can't believe it costs about as much as California Pizza Kitchen, what a deal!
