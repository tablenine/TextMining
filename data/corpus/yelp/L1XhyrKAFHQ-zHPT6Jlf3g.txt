Ah, another neighborhood favorite of mine.  Great food, really exceptional desserts and the place is lovely. As a veg, there aren't many options on the food menu but the ones they do have are delicious! Namely, the feta cheese sandwich (tip: order it on a croissant) and the grilled veggie sandwich. Pretty much every dessert here is awesome so I'd recommend them all. But I've tried the napoleon, fruit tart and chocolate eclair, to be specific.. . Also, I ordered a perfect red velvet cake here for a birthday.  The price was shockingly reasonable, it was a big hit and it lasted for weeks afterwards both because it was so big and because we wanted to savor every bite.. . I heart this place so much I'm compelled into shouting a rallying cry each time I go: Onward to Portos!
