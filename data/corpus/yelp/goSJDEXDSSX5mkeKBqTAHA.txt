I went here with my girlfriend late at night on a Monday, so it was pretty empty. But it helped us relax a bit and enjoy the nice patio.. . We started the night off with the deliciously fresh Mozzarella Salad paired with some French wine and continued with the Cote de Boeuf which was cooked to perfection. For the price you're paying, the flavor and the quantity of the meat was outstanding. So I won't be able to agree with the people saying they received too little food for too much money. Actually, at the end we were so full that we could not finish almost half of the meat.. . With the beef, pommes aligot was served. I still remember the amazement I had when the server literally strangled the mashed potatoes to place it on our plates. As soon as I had the first bite from the potatoes, I knew that I would be back to taste it many more times.. . We had desert as well, but after all the perfect meat and the great wine we had, it was a little bit pale in gastronomic satisfaction.. . All in all, Spago is one of those restaurants you have to go at least once to become a part of world's culinary history.
