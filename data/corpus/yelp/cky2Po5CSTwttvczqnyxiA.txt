Guess I ate all of the wrong pizzas because this place is just okay.  The dough is not that good, way too soggy which I know is result of wood fire but still, this was beyond where it should be.. . The wait for food was way too long we practically had to eat on the floor there was so little space at the bar when we were seated.  Forget how long you have to wait just to get in.  Way over-hyped, but hey it's Hollywood right?
