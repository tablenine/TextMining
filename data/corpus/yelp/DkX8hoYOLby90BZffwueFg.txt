L.A. traffic is horrible.  When I lived on the Westside, I always hated driving out of my area, so I had to find food places that would either deliver or would be walking distance from my place and my roommates felt the same way.. . Unless, of course, we were planning on having dinner at Daiko.  We would sit in Westside traffic for an hour and a half only to sign in and wait in line for another half hour.  Is it worth it?  Hell yes.  If you can't stand the wait, go and have a beer at Cosmos next door.
