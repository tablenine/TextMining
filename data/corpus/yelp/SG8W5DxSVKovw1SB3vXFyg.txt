SO MUCH BIGGER than the Montana one!  It felt weird to not have to obnoxiously stalk tables, and all of the tables on the patio were nice.  I can't say I've ever eaten anything else here but the Office Burger (sooo juicy and tasty!) and the Sweet Potato Fries (mmm...dipping sauce!).  I do remember they have some pretty decent wine and too many beers for me to try to remember.  All in all, a great sister location to the original.
