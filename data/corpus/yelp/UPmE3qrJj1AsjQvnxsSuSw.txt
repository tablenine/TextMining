You look down Wilshire Blvd. and see the streets packed with food trucks. And who do they have to thank? Kogi Muh F***in BBQ! They paved the way.. . This is the most bad ass idea ever. I love these trucks. There is nothing like these tacos. Just searching for the trucks is half the fun!. . The Tres Leches, and homemade sauces make your taste buds have an orgasm. . . If they aren't already, the owners need to be on the cover of Forbes and Entrepreneur Magazine.. . When you have a line of 400+ people EVERY SINGLE DAY, you know you're doing something right.
