Restaurant: Lula&#39;s Sweet Apothecary
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Lula's vegan ice cream was absolutely delicious and the owners were so friendly and enthusiastic about what they are doing. . . I can't imagine anyone (omnivores, vegans, lactose intolerant) disliking this place. . . The sundae special I got was a fair price.
