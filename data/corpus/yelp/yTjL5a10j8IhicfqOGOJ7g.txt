A bit Overrated!  . . The Bad:. Put the frickin' English word at least next to the item on the menu so regular folks like me know what it is.  . The noise level is too high. You kinda have to shout in order to be heard, which gets tiring after a while.. Our food took 1hr. to come to the table. I thought pizza cooks in minutes in those woodfire pizza ovens. . The wooden chairs aren't super comfy and you kinda feel cramped in the whole time. The busboys kept hitting my chair every time they walked behind me because it was so tight.. . The Good:. The Pizza flavor and crust is outstanding and nothing I had ever tried before.  . The service is great.  Our waiter had to explain some of the pizza toppings to us and he was super knowledgable and didn't rush through. Also, the busboys seemed very attentive.. . Definitely worth a try but nothing to have to rush back to urgently.
