Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
this is a family tradition restaurant, birthdays, graduations etc.. my cousin married one of the waitresses from here. its a family owned business and very small.. the majority of people that gave this place a bad review . just arent locals and basically dont know whats up.. . it takes a while to be seated so if you dont have the patience,. order to go cause no matter what you order . its always ready in 20 minutes. . or call and put your name in before you go,. there isnt a minimum of people in order to be on the list.. . they have great thin crust pizza. they use REAL italian sausage . not that dog food crap they use everywhere else.. my usual order is a thin crust with sausage &amp; jalapeno's. &amp; for pasta i get the Pasta Bianco.. . It's CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM machine by the bathrooms.
