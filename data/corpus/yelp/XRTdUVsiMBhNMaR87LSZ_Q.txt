Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
What a great discovery! After reading the reviews here on Yelp, we stopped by Papa Cristos for a very memorable lunch.  You are immediately greeted with the aroma of fresh baked bread when you arrive. Stand at the counter and order, and then sit down at one of the blue picnic tables to wait for your meal to be delivered.. . As you wait, you can't help but watch all of the large portions of food that passes by. The meats. The breads. The colorful salads. All are very tempting indeed.. . We ordered Moussaka (sp?), green beans in tomato sauce, rice pilaf, spanikopita, baba ganoush and terramisolata (sp?).  All were flavorful and fresh and we devoured every bite.  Even the pita bread was yummy. My Greek hubby was so pleased to eat what he claimed to be a pretty authentic feast.  And, he was tickled pink to discover that they had his favorite Cypriot beer chilling in the fridge.  . . The restaurant also comes equipped with a deli section and store, where they offer meats, cheeses, bakery items, wines, olive oils, and a number of choice canned and bottled goods. They've even got a little freezer section.   . . This place is a little out of the way for us. But having to drive 40 minutes to get there is worth the trek when you are craving some authentic Greek food.  We'll definitely be back!
