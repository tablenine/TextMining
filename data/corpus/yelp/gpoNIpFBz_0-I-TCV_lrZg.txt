The lunch buffet is a great deal and the food is tasty with a great selection. We where in the area and I had been craving kabobs  they had a lunch buffet that was kabob heaven. They have 2 styles ground meat  which included chicken ,beef and lamb they also have a whole white meat chicken style kabob each type was tasty. The buffet is a great price all you can eat for 16.95 that included a glass of champagne, tea, soda its everything included so you don't get nickel and dimed for the extras. The buffet includes alot of other items  some of my faves were great hummus a nice salad a very tasty lamb shank a variety of grilled veggies and rice last but not least some honey puffy dessert things that tasted pretty good. Its a great deal and the food is quality with a good variety and the staff is very attentive and friendly.
