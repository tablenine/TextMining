Lots of reviews so here is my quick version:. . LOCATION: East to find. Off Fairfax on the west side of the street, just north of Melrose. Quick, hassle-free valet for $ 5. . ATMOSPHERE: So-so. The interior is very cute, kind of Spanish cottage-y but that doesn't really fit with martinis, does it?! The pool table and bathroom decor just threw me off more. Silvery gray walls with black and white shots of rock stars?! There is a front bar with a hostess stand in the middle, the dining room to your left, another lounge (with pool table) in the center room and then another bar in back. Dinner menu can be served anywhere during happy hour, but happy hour cannot be served in the dining room.. . DRINKS: Martinis indeed!!! Apple &amp; Ruby Tuesday were big hits at my table- neither too sweet and both sufficiently girly ;) They *ARE* strong. I can usually do 2 drinks over dinner but had to stop at one martini in order to be ready to drive home. Yum, yum, yummmm.. . FOOD: This is a great place for light dinners while out with the girls for drinks or appetizers to nibble on during said night out ;) I personally love the Goat Cheese Salad which is similar to a Waldorf in taste. The Fruit &amp; Cheese Platter, Chicken Sate, Sweet Potato Fries and other appetizers have all been great with my parties. Dinners are harder to nail down because they tend to be overpriced. Again, good for drinks / light dinner, not the best for full dining out. Go for $5 specials during happy hour.... . BOTTOM LINE: I go back for drinks and happy hour nibbles with my girls, because the drinks are strong and I work nearby, but I never go there for dinner out with my man...
