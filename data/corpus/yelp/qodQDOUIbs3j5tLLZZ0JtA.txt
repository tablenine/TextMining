SO THIS is where youth goes to die? Seriously man, the ratio of young to old is like 50 to 1... what's with that?!. . The food though, no matter what the age of your dining companion, is fabulous. I yearn for a restaurant that understands the importance of serving perfectly ripe tomatoes-- THIS IS IT! . . For lunch I had:. . Summer salad-- perfectly in season, fresh fava beans, frisee, I think feta? Perfectly light and delicious.. . Shrimp, Pesto, and Squash Blossom Pizza- YUM. The crust was thin and buttery, and the squash blossoms were fun to eat and tasted so fresh!. . Lobster Club: Honestly, could have used more lobster and a little less mayo. For $32, I was expecting a little more of the good stuff. It was served on delicious walnut bread with the most perfectly cooked bacon. Next time I'm going with the Lobster Cobb Salad. . . The ambiance wasn't that stuffy during lunch, but every where you looked there were ladies who lunch wearing derby hats and pounding down mimosas. Damn, those 70 year olds sure know how to live the good life!
