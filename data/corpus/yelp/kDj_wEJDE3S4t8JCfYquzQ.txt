First thing, I dont like Sushi. Actually I think a large number of people just pretend they like Sushi. I mean, raw fish? Avacado? Seaweed? If you think about it, do any of those on there own sound appetizing?. . But, I have to give this place props. My girlfriend loves it. And she actually likes sushi, in fact she loves it. The space is limited and it's always booked. And it's on Ventura. So much cooler than hollywood.
