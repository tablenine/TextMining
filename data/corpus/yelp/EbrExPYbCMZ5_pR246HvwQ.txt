Good but not great, but I guess there aren't that many good pizza places in LA to begin with so I can see why people think that this place is better than it is. I am a huge fan of Iron Chef/Food Network/Batali, but my expectations weren't met.. . I tried the all meat pizza and it was on the salty side. Crust was just eh okay, meats were okay. The fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese impressed me more.. . I must continue the quest to find the best pizza place in LA...
