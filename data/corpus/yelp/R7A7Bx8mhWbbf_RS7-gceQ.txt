Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Every time I go to this place I'm with a bunch of my Taiwanese friends, which gives me the chance to try everything on the menu.. . I know Din Tai Fung's favorite is the juicy dumplings, and yes, they're good, but I'm not too crazy about them. The "juice" is way too hot when the dumplings are served. But if you're trying out this place for the first time, you should definitely order some.. . I really like the pork chops over fried rice. It's the best!. . But my favorite of all is the red bean dumplings. I'm not a huge fan of red beans but man, you gotta try these if you have room after your dishes. If you don't, then take some to go.. . The wait is long, so either drive out a little bit to get yourself a cup of boba or stand inside and watch the cooks make dumplings.
