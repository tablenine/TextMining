Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe all of the five star reviews made me raise the bar a little too high. Maybe the time of day effected my experience, the fact that I went on a busy Saturday afternoon. Maybe it was me. Maybe it was them. Whatever the case, I was disappointed by Tank. . . I did not have a problem with the food or the service, or even the decor, which I found modern and trendy. My husband had the kobe beef sliders to start because kobe beef is usually so darn expensive and here they are a mere $8 for two tiny, precious samplings. I had a noodle bowl appetizer (I'm blanking on the name) that came in a huge portion and was smothered in some strange, creamy, mayonnaise-y sauce. Not all together offputting, but not all that appetizing either. The sushi rolls were adequate if a tad bit small. . . No, my dining experience wasn't awful, but I did have a problem with their billing. So listen up, if a restaurant advertises half off maki rolls on Saturdays and then TACKS ON A 20% GRATUITY for ordering the half off rolls, then they are not half off. That's like paying a fee for a discount, it just doesn't make sense! I was so upset about this that I did not leave an additional tip (I was charged a 20% gratuity and was only dining with my husband and we did not order a whole lot of food so I did not feel obliged to fork over even more money). . . Is it possible to eat out in Chicago without feeling like you're being ripped off? Not if you eat at Tank, apparently.
