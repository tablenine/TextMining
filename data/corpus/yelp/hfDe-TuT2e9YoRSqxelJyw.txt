Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
Haha omg this place made me puke my brains out afterwards. We had to sit in our car for about an hour and a half just trying to sober up. My co-worker who SWORE it was just a karaoke bar picked this place for her birthday a couple of years ago and we somehow ended up getting smashed off sake bombs, screaming our lungs off, dancing and singing to horrible-yet-it's-a-guilty-pleasure 80's music. The staff does a really good job of hyping everyone up. Honestly you won't have fun if you don't drink, it's almost like peer pressure once they start chanting. And yeah I agree the sushi is whatevs but everyone should come here at least once in their life to experience the Delve.
