Category: Tapas Bars
Part of Chef Rathbun's brilliant brainchild, Krog Bar offers a chill, yet hip place to have a glass or two before heading over to Rathbun's for dinner ... or just deciding to spend the rest of your night there trying different wines.  The servers are extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions because not only do they know the inventory, they've tasted most of them.
