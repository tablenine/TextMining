My first dinner experience in Atlanta, and it set the bar pretty high for the remainder of my visit!  The service was top notch and the food was perfect. Very friendly staff made it all the more enjoyable.. . My starter was a salmon chowder, which as a larger portion could have easily been a fantastic entree. I'd go back just for that! For my main entree I had a pan-seared trout with some type of almond/butter sauce. The flavors there were fantastic although halfway through, the sauce seemed to become a bit too sweet for my taste but that's just my personal preference. The combination of flavors was well balanced and flavorful otherwise. Finally for dessert  I had a chocolate souffle with peanut butter ice cream which was likewise fantastic.. . I'd highly recommend eating at Dogwood and would happily go back anytime!
