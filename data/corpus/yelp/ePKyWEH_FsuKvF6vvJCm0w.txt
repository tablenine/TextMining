Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Attempted Special #2 challenge - ate all the ramen and everything else inside, but couldn't finish the soup.  Not sure what to say about the flavor cause all I tasted was flaming fire.  However, as a fan of Man vs. Food - any restaurant that appears on the show gets at least 4 stars in my book.
