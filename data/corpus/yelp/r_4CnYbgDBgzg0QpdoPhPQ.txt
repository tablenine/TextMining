Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
I've been coming here for years. It's the Jimmy's of the Chicagoland suburbs. When someone is afraid to go to Jimmy's, they drive to Gene and Jude's. . They only serve hot dogs with fries, and tamales (plus drinks). . Mustard, relish, onions, pickle, and sport peppers. I get mine with everything but the sport peppers. . 2nd best dogs and fries in the Chicagoland area!
