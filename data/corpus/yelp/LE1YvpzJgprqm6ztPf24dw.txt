Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
see, this is the kind of place that shouldn't need to be reviewed. i suppose if you don't live in LA and you're visiting and wondering if this place is good, that's one thing. . . but if you've been in los angeles for more than 6 months and you don't know how good the apple pan is, you should be deported to somewhere like council bluffs and hate your life forever.. . this is the best hamburger in southern california. this is my favourite place to eat in all of california.. . a piece of advice, though, if you come here for the first time, make it known. don't try to pretend like you know what you're doing, the service is quick and surly. if you sit down and don't ask for a menu, you will be asked what you want within 30 seconds and if you don't answer him in 10 seconds he'll walk away. because of this, however, you only have to wait 2-3 minutes for your food, and if it's later, they start giving you free stuff. the newest employee has been there for 17 years, and these guys know what they are doing. not mean, just efficient. i love it.. . don't come with a big crowd, don't come around lunch and expect to get a seat right away, if you're in a rush or are in a big crowd stand near the register and place your order to go. there's about 25 seats total, and even as a party of one you can expect to wait for a seat for up to 15 minutes around noon.. . i think all of this adds to the experience, and the burgers are perfectly made dressed and served, the pie is fresh and delicious, and the price is right.. . oh, and don't ask for tomatoes. they don't have them.
