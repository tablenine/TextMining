Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
I used to order take-out from this place practically every Saturday when I worked a full day at Woodruff and I was always pleased with everything.  I've tried all the curries with either shrimp or tofu and find them delicious with just the right amount of heat.  They come with a TON of the curry sauce, so I just stir-fry some of my own veggies and toss them into the extra sauce I have left over.  Yep, I'm a cheap date.. . I like the Tom Kha Ghai and spring rolls for starters.  I ordered the Spicy Veggie Tofu or Shrimp about 75% of the time because I just couldn't get enought of it.  The Spicy Catfish &amp; Fresh Ginger Chicken are other favorites of mine.  I can't report on their Pad Thai or any of the other noodle dishes because generally I'm not fond of them.. . Top Spice gets my top mark.
