Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
This place is very pretty-- an upscale Chinese restaurant.  I had a Groupon, and am not sure I'd return without one.  The food was good enough, but not something I would go out of my way for.  With a little tweaking, I think it could be a four star place, but some of the dishes were just kind of bland-- like the Choy Sum Beef.  The Ginger Beef, however, was delicious.  I would recommend that if you come here.  I like that it is byob, but it still seemed expensive-- and didn't really live up to the "180 degrees from ordinary Chinese" motto.  This place has a lot of potential, but needs a bit of work with the flavors on the menu.  I will probably give it another shot.  The atmosphere is really nice and the service was good.
