Okay, I'll admit it... maybe drinking 6-7 martinis before sitting down to dinner here was a "bad idea". . . But there was an hour wait and the bar up the street (it was dark, and i was loaded when we walked out, so I forget the name) was so F'n cool that I couldn't help myself.. . When we finally sat down to eat I was pretty much a goner. . I think we had a cheese pie, bruchetta, I might have even had some wine (?). It's really kinda hazy for me. But I remember saying something like "liss iz weally goodf?!" Which ended with me slumping over.. . All I know is I woke up in the middle of the night with all sorts of stomach cramps and a massive headache. . Was it the food? Was it the drink? Both? Neither?. . Anyway, it's really far away so the wife had to drive home.... I def. want to try it again soon... . . Is there a way to avoid the wait? . Wait... that was the best part!
