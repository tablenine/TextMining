Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
As my search for the perfect pupusa continued, I finally made my way to Gloria's.  I have to admit I had pretty high expectations before walking in the door.. . A small, authentic restaurant with a welcoming and gracious staff, (was that Gloria? she's so cute!) made the experience worthwhile. . . The pupusa? Pretty lackluster.  I had the pupusa plate with one cheese/pork and one cheese/herb along with rice/black beans.  Really, I was somewhat sad inside because I was not blown away with flavor and consistency.  Maybe this is the authentic way.  It's not my way!  . . Rice and beans were bland too.  The best thing of the night?  The taquitos, and I hate taquitos!  . . For great pupusas - the Venice Whole Foods carries these at the tamale bar.
