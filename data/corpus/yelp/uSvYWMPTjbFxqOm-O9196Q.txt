Beers &amp; brats -- it doesn't get much better than that. And Wurstkuche does it better than anyone else around. Yes, it's basically in Skid Row -- but this is an up and coming neighborhood (or so they tell us). In an attempt to walk off our overindulgence of the fabulous gourmet brews and sausages, we strolled passed an array of warehouse antique stores, trendy lofts, and hipster bars, but let's just say you don't want to hang around here for long after the sun sets. . . Anyway, to the food: . . 1) Bratwurst (pork, coriander, nutmeg): B+ . 2) Bockwurst (veal, pork &amp; spices) : B+ . 3) Green Chilies &amp; Cilantro (chicken &amp; turkey): A+ . 4) Rabbit, Veal &amp; Pork: A- . 5) Duck &amp; Bacon with jalapeno peppers: A- . . Drinks: Echt Kriekenbier (Flemish red with cherries), Franziskaner, Chimay White . . Anyway, be adventurous and go with a gourmet brat -- it's worth it, and worth the wait in line you will most assuredly have. KCRW discount available.
