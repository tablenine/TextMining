Ordered in for lunch and though I've never dined on site I have to give major props for the GRILLED FLATIRON STEAK SALAD . . * Not a better lettuce than Butter Lettuce - so much better than the anticipated and standard Romaine. * Nicely portioned sliced steak, cooked perfectly to medium rare, nicely seasoned. . * Delicious beets, especially the golden ones that are quartered. They add a subtle sweetness that you can't miss and will definitely enjoy! . . Order in, take out, dine there - doesn't matter - get this salad!
