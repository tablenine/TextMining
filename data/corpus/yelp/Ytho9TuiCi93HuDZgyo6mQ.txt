Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
"So you've really never been to Roscoe's?". "Yes. Thought about it once but i'm more like a steak &amp; eggs kind of guy". "What are you waiting for?". "If we're going to do this, let's do it gangster style. Pico all the way!". "Wow dude! We in the right place?". "See that sign?". "Yo let me get my phone and lock the car again.". . Eventually we made it inside... . "Hi baby, what can I get tchu?". "I can't decide what I want, I need more time.". "Ok baby, tell me what you need and I'll direct you". "Fosho, I want the waffles and chicken but I need something smaller, I got to eat with someone after this.". "Look here baby, this is what you need. Number **, it gets you going". "Thank you, ma'am.". "Coming right up, sugar". "Dude, where the effed we at? Was he asking me what i think he's asking me?". "Just don't say that word". "What word?". . 5 mins later, the food arrived... . "Yo! This is pretty good. But damnn this is exactly how it tasted like when I made my own waffles and accidentally put too much syrup and it caught on to my other food.". "Hurry up with your food, we got to pick her up at 7, remember?. "Oh snap, you're right. Just don't tell Ronnie we ate Roscoe's before". "You're a true LAer now that you've had Roscoe's". "Hey baby, how's everything? You good?". "FANTAstic!". "Ok baby, Let me take care of you with the check.". "Damn!! wtf did I just eat? Breakfast for 15 dolla?". "You didn't know?". "Oh, that's why that other party was all dressed up with their suits and dress on, it's like fine dining.". "and also cos' she called you baby". . ps: thank you whitepain for the adventure at the wild side, btw.
