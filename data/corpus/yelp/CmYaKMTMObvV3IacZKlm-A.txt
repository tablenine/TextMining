*This review is based only on desserts...&amp; that i'm a "hills" fan. lol. . All their desserts looked super yummy!!! I had some of their homemade ice cream..cookies &amp; cream..it was soo good! My sister had a cookie ice cream sandwich..I think it looked like a ladybug..I forget what flavor the cookies were but it had strawberry sorbet in the middle. The chocolate chip cookies are ridiculously good too! I wanted to try all the desserts b/c they looked so tasty!. . The place is small, but very cute and trendy. I wouldn't mind going back for some homemade ice cream and cookies. =)
