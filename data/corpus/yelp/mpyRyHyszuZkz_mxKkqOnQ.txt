Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I wonder how this strange marriage of fried chicken and waffles Â came into being, it's so dam good! You get the sweet, salty, and crunchy, it's the perfect comfort food that warms the heart and soul (which consequently could also stop your heart). . . Chicken and Waffles:. The waffles are very fresh and fluffy, yet they still have a good caramelized crunch to them. It's faintly sweet by itself and is slathered with butter and maple syrup. I would just be happy with the waffles but no let's throw some fried chicken on the side!. The chicken is perfectly fried; it's moist and tender on the inside while the outside is light and crispy. You can tell that the fried chicken is great when you can take a bite and not have all the crunchy batter fall off. Thumbs up to Roscoe's on this one!. . The combination of the crunchy chicken, the saltiness of the batter, and the sweetness of the waffle and syrup make each bite outrageously good. You can also pour some of the gravy into the mix (which I love) to give it a creamy and buttery dimension to it, it's sinfully good. . . I've also had the chicken livers here which were more on the livery side (not too great) and the grits (just plain grits, but good). . . I would have to take a star off for the price here, it's basically two pieces of chicken and 2 waffles, which will run you around 10-15 easily if you are a big eater. If the price was cut down a little bit, it would be more worth it because in the end, all you are eating are waffles and chicken which can all be made cheaply. . . All in all, if you haven't tried Roscoe's yet, I'm sure you have friends who rave about it so get to LA/LB/Pasadena and taste true comfort food!
