Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
24 Hours of GOODNESS.. . Bakery, Cafe, Delicatessen.. . Pastrami and Corned Beef on RYE BREAD served with a side of their potato salad. YUM!!!. . I have to say, though, the texture of the potato salad is NEVER consistent. It always tastes AWESOME, but sometimes it's a bit too broken up and watery.. . Their service is always on the mark. I've always had a pleasant experience coming to Canter's to dine.. . The people that work the bakery counter, however, sometimes leave a lot to be desired. The past few times I went, the service was nice and I enjoyed myself. Most recently [last week], there was an older [I'd say 40s] fellow working behind the counter. He was neither very friendly nor very nice. His greeting and service were all blatantly perfunctory. . . That aside, I always have a pleasant experience and would recommend Canter's to anybody who loves a good Jewish deli. I think I'm going to try and study here and see how that goes.
