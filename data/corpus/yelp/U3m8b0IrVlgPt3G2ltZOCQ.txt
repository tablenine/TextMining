Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is one of the hardest places to rate. It reluctantly gets three stars, mainly for it's interesting background and its contribution to the local economy. If I weren't such a nice Yelper I'd give Pink's the two stars it richly deserves.. . The long lines aren't a reflection of a transcendent dining experience. The crowds tend to be tourists who know of Pink's through guidebooks or TV, but they're easy to sniff out by the short clothing and doughy limbs. Many more are poorly dressed; these are the local heshers and hipsters. The appeal has to be in all the celebrities' photos encrusting the walls.. . The food itself is delightfully downscale at upscale prices. Pink's purportedly serves Hoffy hot dogs, the RC Cola of heavily salted meat products. And most of the good dogs are in the $4 to $7 range. Despite being a house built on hot dogs, the burgers and sausages are a better meal and value for the money.. . Pink's is better for grab-and-go customers, as there aren't very many tables in the back. Also, sitting outside, beware of the pushy pigeons and sparrows. They like Pink's scraps, and swatting them away won't make them fly off like the garden variety candyass pigeons and sparrows. They'll just stare you down, maybe crap on the table, and inch ever closer to the food.. . For the car people, Pink's has a small lot and an attendant will stack park. Do not, though, park in the flower shop next door. Tow trucks lie in wait for noobs who try this. Also, do not park on La Brea, especially on weekdays, lest you taste the wrath of the Tiger Team.. . Transit access: Metro lines 10 (continues as Line 48) Â and 212/312; other close east-west buses include Metro Rapid lines 704 and 714 and their local counterparts, 4 and 14.
