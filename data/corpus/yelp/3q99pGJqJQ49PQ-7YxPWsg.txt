You know i was expecting a really good sandwich with dip but it turned out to be reguler cooking fat they dip the sandwich in and then add some meat.  There was no flavor but salt, and then you purchase a lemonade that is mostly ice cubes and your left thursty.  Its ok to eat but not recommended.  Oh not to mention the angry looking hispanic cashiers... lol wow
