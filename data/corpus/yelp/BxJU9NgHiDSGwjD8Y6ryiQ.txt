Potatoe balls. . The very thought of these little balled up artery clogging jewels sets my mouth awater with desire.. I don't usually hand out the five stars but this place is an exception. Ahhh, porto's cafe. I've been coming here for a couple years now and I never fail to leave with a satisfied stomach. . It's always packed so be prepared to stand in line, though it doesn't really take that long to get to the front.. Their pastries are delicious.The Refugiado is seriously goood. I can pop like 5 of those little guys in my mouth lickity split. . Same goes for the famous potato balls. Dang. They used to be cheaper when I first started going there, but hey, inflation is everywhere man, I put no blame upon the good people at porto's.. Once when I went in towards closing time, they handed out an assload of their plantain chips. Hahaha. . The prices are fair. Not dirt cheap but still affordable. . I plan to go this weekend hopefully and get my potato ball craving satisfied.. BTW, their sandwiches aren't something to be overlooked. The cubano and the pastrami sandwiches are delectable. They come stacked with plantain chips too. . I will see you soon my love.
