Everyone has reviewed this place already, but I'll just put my two cents in.  I went during a weekday night and it was just as busy, but luckily we got a table at the original restaurant.  The xiao long bao is very good, but it gets cold quickly, so eat quickly, but not too quickly because the soup inside is hot.  I wish the Shanghai rice cakes were even softer, and in my recollection, I think the best Shanghai rice cakes I've tried were at Joe's Shanghai in NY.  For dessert, we got the red bean spongy white thing, but we were hoping it was sweet, but it didn't really have any flavor.  So we went to Phoenix Inn afterwards.
