The Doner is what it is all about. In fact, that's the only main course on the menu. You can get it wrapped, sandwiched or on a plate. It's very tasty in either chicken or lamb/beef form, as are the fries and salad. The patio is much nicer than the inside, where the owner can be heard in the back working at what sounded like a really big vacuum cleaner. I asked if someone was vacuuming, and the cashier guy said with a smile much like Sweeney Todd's, he's grinding the meat! . Okay, think we'll eat outside. The ice cream/gelato looked like it was melting and in need of a better freezer, so we didn't try any.
