Foiled in our plans to finally hit up Victory's Banner, because they were apparently out on some vision-quest, we wandered up the street and settled on this place for Saturday brunch.  Yeah, it's a low-rent cutesy name, but they had a tofu scramble on the menu so at least their hearts are in the right place, right?. . Well, maybe.  Said tofu "scramble" was cubed tofu fried in a cup of olive oil with some flaccid vegetables and a mote of spice (and came with cheese on it, though that was not noted in the menu.  Seriously?  You realize most of the people ordering tofu at brunch are probably vegan and might just assume tofu scramble means no cheese.  Having to ask all the time hurts us more than it hurts you).. . There was a breakfast burrito too, which I'm told was also phoned-in.  The coffee was ok, and the servers were sluggish and boring. . . And there was this aging ex-hipster couple sitting next to us... and she was like 8.5 months pregnant, and they didn't speak a word to each other the entire time we were there.  And that just made things that much creepier.
