Restaurant: The Highlander
Category: Dive Bars
I've got to say that I've been pretty impressed with the Highlander's food, namely the vegetarian options. I've had both the veggie burger and a veggie sandwich that were both absolutely delicious and actually left me craving them the next day (and yes, I am typically a meatitarian). . . Stick to the patio so your food doesn't get tainted with smoke, round up a big crew to take over a picnic table, order a couple of pitchers, and enjoy!
