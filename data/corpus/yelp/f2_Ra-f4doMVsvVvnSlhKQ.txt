Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
The. Best. Deep. Dish. Pizza. In. Chicago. Period. Worth the wait, and these people have the timing down to a science- roll in, put your order in at the beginning of your wait, and by the time you sit down your pizza is almost ready. Pair it with an Old Style, and that is all you need. I always take friends from out of town here- and that way I have an excuse to go myself! Oooh- I am getting hungry now just thinking about it.
