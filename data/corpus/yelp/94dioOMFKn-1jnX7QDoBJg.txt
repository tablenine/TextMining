Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Flo is my neighborhood go-to brunch/breakfast burrito spot. . . All of the food I've had there has been excellent, although, to be honest I almost always get the breakfast burrito. In fact, any time I've ordered anything BUT the BB, I've been disappointed because nothing else seems to measure up!. .  Wrapped in a fresh spinach tortilla and filled with fluffy egg, pickled jalapenos, pico de gallo, cheddar and sour cream, this sucker can't be beat. Yummmmmmmmm.. . Oh yeah, I forgot to mention how delicious the tall tatted up server is mmmmmhmmmm. Burritos and cute boys. I think I've died and gone to heaven.
