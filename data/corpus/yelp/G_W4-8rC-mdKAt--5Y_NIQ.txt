Category: Delis
A couple of weeks ago, I finally succumbed to the mental pressure that Yelp and others had put on me. I finally went to Langer's. To sum it up, it was just okay. This is not the best pastrami in the world. It is very tender. It is very moist, but the flavor is lacking. If you read my reviews you know that I judge a deli not by its pastrami but by its corned beef. The reasoning is very simple. Corned beef has to be of a higher quality than the beef used in pastrami. In fact, any number of cuts can be used for pastrami. It is basically a pickling of the beef with spices. The corned beef is a higher cut of beef. The pastrami at Langer's is bland, almost tasting at times like a hot dog.. . The bread is very good. Crunchy crust, moist chewy center. I would like to return some day and try the corned beef. If warranted, I would raise the stars, but for now, three is as high as I can give them.
