My fav Tapas place in ATL!!!! Â Especially during the summer time, it is such a cute place to be in the highlands.... . the crowd - this place gets packed on the weekends..make sure you have reservations!!. . The food.....yummoo!! The Epanadas and fries....sooo yummy...gosh I am getting myself starved!!!! . . I love love this place and its def better then Esclipse de luna....try noches if u love Tapas.. :)
