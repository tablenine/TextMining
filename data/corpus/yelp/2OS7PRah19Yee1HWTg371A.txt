The lamb chops and the asparagus were very delicious although I was in pain by the time they came out so I didn't get to enjoy them very much. The crab cakes here are good. Octopus was also delicious. The steak had too much cumin as well as did most of the meat dishes; but, that's just my taste preference. It's a bit loud inside and the waiter didn't hear our order for the bacon wrapped shrimp. I would have liked to try that. The paella was ridiculously sour. Their three dessert offerings are CHURROS, flan, and french toast. All were delicious. If i wasn't about to keel over from my gluttony I would have Â swallowed all the churros in a flash.
