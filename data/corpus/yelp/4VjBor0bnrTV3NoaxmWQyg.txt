GREAT GREAT GREAT bar with your freinds.  I love their beer tap seleciton... I believe the # is around 70s.  I like their happy hour time since appitizer are half off and drinks are specials.  You cant beat $3.75 for draft Hoegaarden beer.  I usually try to finish em ASAP and keep the beer flowing.  The waitress are all nice an fast.  Bartenders are helpful and skillful.  I have a lil complain about the host for table reserve.  It is very rare to see a host screwing up both mine and my freind's reservations at same night.  She just seemed that she did not want to be there at all.
