Having eaten sushi all over the world i can truely say, the quality of the food here is similar to an 'all you can eat' buffet. I feel sad for all the reviewers that praise this place. I sincerely hope you all get some better quality sushi than this and realize what you're missing. . . After being ignored by the "happy to hang out with his friends rather than do his job or greet us bartender" we had excellent service from our server. The one star goes to her.. . The house salad was ok, the dressing was ok but the amount of sesame seeds was overpowering and made it feel gritty.. . My wife ordered the Chirashi-don. When this arrived it became obvious that the "chefs" here were not well trained. This had to have been the most amateurish attempt at cutting fish i've seen in quite sometime. the hamachi looked liked jerky chunks, the salmon was paper thin and not so fresh as it was starting to flake apart. Saba was ok but that comes preprepared. The rice underneath was meh, The dish also arrived with no seaweed , wasabi or ginger.. . I ordered tuna and spicy scallop nigiri. The tuna once again was thin and the rice was tasteless and stiff, the spicy scallop was pretty good.. I also ordered the Philly roll, which had a tiny amount of smoked salmon and avocado and too much cream cheese all wrapped too much of the same bland rice. . . The plastic tables and chairs look as bland and cheap as the food they serve tastes. I highly doubt we will ever be back.
