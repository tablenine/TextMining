I am hooked. This place is for people that love big portions of good food and if you are a sweat lover. If you are a diabetic or cant eat that many sweats I wouldn't recommend it. . What I ate: I had a yellow brick road to myself. A friend had a regular french toast and another had the original waffle. We went on a Saturday around 3:00 and there was no line at all. You can sit wherever you want. Because they close at 4:00 P.M. So if you want to beat the line just go later instead of in the morning. The food is kind of pricy. Extra bacon cost around $4.00. :P
