I have fond memories of this place! My old boss threw me a bridal shower here-and I had only worked with him(yes-HIM) a month! I have been here several times since and it is still okay in my book. I would not venture to say it is great, but I would be fine if a group wanted to go here. I love to watch the tortillas come off the conveyor belt.. This proved to be the best part of a blind date in my single days. LOVE the margaritas,yumm-o!
