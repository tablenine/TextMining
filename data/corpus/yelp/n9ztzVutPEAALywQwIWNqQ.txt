Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
T'was my first venture to Mastro's. I had heard wonderful things. I was with a group of eight other people in a private room. . Everything was excellent - service, sides, wines, dessert -- except the steak itself. I've had a lot of bone-in ribeyes before and this one was a bit lame. Ordered charred MR it came out with a nice crust but closer to medium. But more importantly the steak was tough and somewhat dry. Very little marbling was evident. I'll go back again since everyone has a bad night sometime but it was a bit disappointing...SSZ
