Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Squeaked in right before the Saturday morning brunch rush.  No wait at 9am! . . As I pursued the menu I realized I had quite the dilemma on my hands: Sweet (super delicious yummy sounding french toast) or Savory (super delicious yummy sounding omelet). . . Sigh.  Oh, the decisions in my life! . . I settled on the chocolate french toast, while my man friend got the lorraine omelet.  We were both very pleased with our selections.  My french toast was a tower of squishy, soft carbs, surrounded by fresh fruit and dusted with powdered sugar.  The omelet was really great with the bacon, gruyere and veggies, toast on the side.. . Service was fast.  Our beverages were replenished often and the food was divine.  Remember to arrive early to snag a seat!
