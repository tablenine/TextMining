Not bad. The coffee is is made well and the baristas/servers range from acceptable to really nice and helpful. . . The sandwich menu is extensive and seems almost like it's designed to induce a choice stupor from the sheer number of different sandwiches. But the ones that I have had are good. . . It can get a little crowded at times both inside and out, but the outdoor seating area and the upstairs are really great places to sit and read or work, or what have you. . . They have lots of different sweets and baked goods if you're into that sort of thing.
