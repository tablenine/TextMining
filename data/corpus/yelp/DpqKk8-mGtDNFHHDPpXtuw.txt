This place used to be a lot better, or maybe the last few times I had it they were too busy. The soup was watered down, it had way too many green peppers and bean sprouts, and the chashu was soggy from being in the soup too long. Perhaps success lowered the quality or my tastes have changed. Though they offer a lot of options for toppings, and the portions are quite generous.. . At the height of my spicy food days (looooooong gone) I got up to a Level 3 spicy, and that destroyed my everything. I can't even imagine what Special-1 and Special-2 does. Now I'm at a lowly 5 or 6 on the spicy scale.. . Maybe this will be my ramen stop of the week.
