Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I have been here twice and both times were nothing to write home about!. . I have heard people rave about their burgers and apple pie for so long and I honestly wonder how people can love this place!. . The burger was not exactly the best quality of meat, kind of slimy and tasteless and the fries were not good either.. . But the biggest disappointment is the apple pie. If you have ever eaten real apple pie, I am talking about the kind that is made with HOMEMADE crust and HOMEMADE filling you will not be impressed with this so called Â best apple pie.. . What a disappointment and I will never be coming back!
