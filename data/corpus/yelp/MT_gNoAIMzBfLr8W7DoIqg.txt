the mole sauce that comes with the fried tortillas is so delicious.  a big kick, but it's weirdly addictive.  . . $9 pitchers of margaritas, also so delicious.. . i got the chicken enchiladas because i wasn't too hungry, but they were pretty good.  a friend got shrimp tacos though, which looked awesome.. . service was slow, but i'll be back for their mole and tacos!
