This place is  very much the New Burger Dining Experience! Great Potato Fries, I didn't really care for the onions Strings... . Execution of the burger was good but I would like my meat a bit more flatten out. It was a bit too Ball like for me. I like that the meat was juicy and pink and well seasoned. You choose 4 sides, 1 cheese, and 1 sauce. Additional 1 dollar for grilled shrooms.. but i had to have it! 1/3 a pound is well enuff for this little  one- esp. for lunch. It's actually very large when you add all the toppings. i had to use a knive n Fork!. . Was too full to opt to a shake! I chose some grilled onions, grilled peppers, chile peppers, and jalepinos., grilled shrooms, and a horseradish cheddar cheese . My sauce of choice was a garlic arouille.. mmm mmmm good.. . Way Better than that overpriced freakin Flip. Total comes out to like 11.00 a burger w/ side of choice (fries, sweet potato fries, or onion strings). . Would come back here for lunch or dinner if I was in the area!
