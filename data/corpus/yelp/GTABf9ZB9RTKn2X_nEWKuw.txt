Either the hipster quotient has increased at this place over the years, or I've become more sensitive -- and less tolerant -- of their presence. I hate to belabor the point, since the "H" word plays so heavily in my reviews, but the sight of scarves in the paved deserts of Los Angeles, and the balloons-rubbing sound of tight denim crinkling under anorexic ass, I'm convinced demeans us as a species and is somehow going to accelerate the gradual heat death of the universe.. . I recall the food here being an explosion of miscellaneous shit. Udon and fried macaroni and cheese balls, alongside spring rolls and omelets. I have to rely on memories to inform me the food was OK, since the last time I was here (post-bar) we left after my friend almost got egged into a fight by some douche with horn rimmed glasses. My other friend captured the moment when he came barreling out from the bathroom to see what was happening.. . "You're gonna start a fight in FRED 62?! Ain't nobody tough here!". . The atmosphere over there has soured like an ironic t-shirt worn through a long fixie ride.
