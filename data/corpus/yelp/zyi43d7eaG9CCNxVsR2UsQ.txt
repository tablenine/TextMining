Overrated and overpriced.  Not worth the long wait...and I tried it twice just to be sure.  The Mexican-Korean fusion isn't bad, it's just not THAT great.  The tacos were too small to charge $2 each and the cabbage with the dressing just overpowered the flavor of the meat.  I couldn't tell if I was eating the short rib or spicy pork taco.  Overall, I don't think I would try it for a third time.  If you want to try it out, I would suggest waiting for the hype to die down so you're not waiting in a 2hr line.
