Not that this place needs another great review, but this is what we yelp for right! Toro is awesome, and not that I've been to many sushi resturants and I can justify that claim, but I definitely enjoyed the food here. The "Awesome" is awesome and although it's a tight squeeze of a place (you're literally in your neighbors ear) it's worth it. My only issue is that it took us almost 40 minutes to get our food, which was kind of riduculous, they weren't that packed. But all in all, I'd go here again!
