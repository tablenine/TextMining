Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
We had really high hopes for this burger.  It was pretty empty on a Thursday afternoon.  The space is simple with some random Asian accents, and the tables are mostly for 2-4 people each, though I think you can push some together.  There's also another room in the back with some counter space, as well.. . There's a small parking lot that it shares with the copy place, and the spots are at weird angles, but at least there's a lot.. . I wish I had planned ahead because it's BYOB, since they don't have a liquor license.  They have some interesting sodas including Mexican coke (no high fructose corn syrup).. . I was disappointed that they no longer had the sea-mami burger (open faced scallop burger), which I saw pictures of on another review.. . We wanted to try the signature umami burger.  I was surprised they didn't ask how we wanted it cooked.  The burger was juicy enough, and the bun wasn't too buttery.  I liked the combination of shiitake mushrooms and oven roasted tomato, which was a unique blend of savory and sweet, but I wish there were more tomato.  The cheese was definitely masked by everything else, and I couldn't taste it at all.  I have a smaller appetite, so it was definitely enough for me, but I could see how the size of it would leave a starving diner hungry.  . . Eggplant fries: they come stacked like the regular fries and cost $3.  They have a light dusting of sea salt on them, but they weren't crispy.  The batter was thin and got soggy quickly, and the eggplant was impossible to bite.  The eggplant was cooked through but not tender, and the fries basically had to be eaten whole.. . The deli mustard was good, but the umami ketchup was nothing special.. . It wasn't a bad burger, but nothing I didn't feel like I could do at home.  I guess I just don't see what all the hype is about.
