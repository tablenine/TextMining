Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Talk about exposure.  Orochon seems to be pretty popular, but their ramen leaves little to be desired.  Whoever in the hell invented charging $8 bux for ramen deserves to be shot.  Moving on.... . I ordered the Miso Ramen, and it was perfectly palatable, nothing special.  The noodles were swimming in a rather boring soup, with slices of green bell pepper, green onions, and other pickled vegetables throughout.  On the plus side the portions are generous, so at least you'll leave full.. . Since my heat-tolerance is pretty much non-existent (although I never learn my lesson--I still like the occasional spicy session), I chose  a 5 outta 7, with 1 being the theoretical spiciest.  5 was not hot at all, not even a hint.  You probably want at least a 4 if you want to taste any heat.. . Aside from the ho-hum food, Orochon has rather surly servers.  That coupled with my crappy canned green tea and you're probably better off overlooking this place.  But if you're searching for scorching noodles, look no further.
