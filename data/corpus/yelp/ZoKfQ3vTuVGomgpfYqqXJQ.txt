Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I always here great things about Roscoe's Chicken &amp; Waffles.. and after my disastrous experience of chicken &amp; waffles in Atlanta, I thought I'd give it another shot from a famous name. I walked about a mile to get to this restaurant, and I'm sad to report that I am disappointed. Maybe I ordered the wrong meal or something.. but it just wasn't as I expected. I ordered a side of Mac &amp; Cheese, and french fries, and the mac&amp;cheese was absolutely gross, and the fries were overwhelmingly greasy. The service was good, and they did a good job of keeping tabs on me. But I felt that I could have just made the food at home and save myself some money.. . I did like that the portion sizes were huge. I ended up taking the food to-go, and miles later a homeless black man asked me if I had leftover food in my bag. I gladly gave the extra food to him, and when he opened the box he was really excited to find that it contained Chicken &amp; Waffles. I think that moment was the highlight of my experience (what are the odds!).
