The guy that runs the place is awesome! I don't care what anyone says. Just smile and be nice and he will treat you the same!. . Anyways, it was my first time having this sort of thing and I was kinda iffy, but GOD DAMN delicious. The meat cooks so fast and you get to make your own soup to cook it in. I love veggies so it was perfect all around.. . I really need to work on picking up noodles with chop stick though. =X
