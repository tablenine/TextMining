Stopped in to see what sweets they offered.  I am on a mission to try every cupcake in the city. I gasped at the $3.50 price tag for one small cupcake, but handed over the money as I knew I am not always in the midtown area.. . The girl working the counter wasn't warm or friendly and made me feel like SHE was doing ME a service.  She blandly asked if I wanted a box or if I just wanted to carry the cupcake and go.  Excuse me, miss, but for $3.50 I'm taking the damn box.  Even if I am sitting on the fuggin floor in the middle of the establishment and eating it!. . I waited until I got home to try it.  Eh.  For a coconut cupake it wasn't very coconut-y.  And the cake part had little to no flavor at all.. . Muy unimpressive.. . But the restaurant is cute.  Perhaps their sandwiches are better?  I'll probably never know.
