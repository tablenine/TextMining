This place is pretty good, don't let the three stars fool you. It is just NOT a five, and a four seemed just a wee bit high.  I will cop out and give it a 3.5.. . Aside from the name of this place wearing on me like nails on a chalk board - I liked it... and I really would like to go back when I want a semi-close to home pulled-pork.  (Although, I am dying to try Smoque first. Another name that rubs me wrong...). . We started with the Chicken Nachos - which were pretty tasty.  Their chili is pretty damn good, and I am quite a picky one when it comes to chili.  We both had the standard pulled pork sandwich - pretty solid.  The price was right.  I had a side of mac and cheese, it was also pretty tasty but very, very creamy and filling.  It also had and interested jalapeno flavor - which I enjoyed while my boyfriend gaged.  The boy had the corn bread as his side - really good.  It was oozy and probably a 1,000 calories...  . . They have good drink specials, which makes me happy.  We enjoyed $3 drafts on a Monday night.  (Guinness not included - boo.)  . . The atmosphere is cool, not pretentious or obnoxious.  The staff and patrons all seemed pretty cool and laid back also - next time I will wait for the patio... They have good outdoor seating.
