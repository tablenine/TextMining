A few days ago I was with my mom and sister shopping in LA and we saw this place so we though ooo it looks cool on the outside let's just try something new for a change instead of good ol' CPK haha. I begin to notice it looks awfully familiar to the Cheesecake Factory, just a lot fancier (sorta). I then order and find out they are a sister company to the Cheesecake Factory. They have the same price ranges as Cheesecake Factory, but I think they probably have a nicer choice of food. I got to try their Short ribs Sloppy Joe! it was sooo good! the sauce that came with it was as well and the fries, mmm better than cheesecake's. . . I will recommend this to people who have never tried it and are fans of cheesecake factory! I know I'll most likely be going back just so I can give a real opinion of the restaurant.
