High class casual formal dining. Excellent wines. Their risottos and pastas are cooked to perfection 99% of the time. I go there often. Take out as well. Seasonal menu. Priest Stranglers are quite possibly the most divine simple dish I have ever tasted. Order the . Free Form Lasagna when the Stranglers are not on the menu. Balsamic Carmelized Onion risotto is addictive. This dish doesn't sound like much but I have to order a half now everytime. I recommend this place without any reservation to anyone.
