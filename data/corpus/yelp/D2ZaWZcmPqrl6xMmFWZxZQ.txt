Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
I went there last night.  Closed due to unsanitary conditions by the health food department.  The disclaimer by the health food department stated they were unsanitary and even had COCKROACHES!. . Good thing I was just going for shaved ice only, otherwise I wouldve been even more disappointed.  I don't know whether to blame the health food department because theres tons of other restaurants that are far worse than sinbala or sinbala themselves for practicing in such unsanitary conditions but nonetheless I wasn't a loyal patron so I'm not dissapointed. . . I read no signs about them reopening.  And from what I saw and my logic, I think theyre moving, perhaps under a new owner, and even a new name.  Everything from pots and pans to chopsticks to chairs was being packed up to be transported or perhaps an extremely thorough cleaning?  There was a sign also posted in chinese, perhaps someone could translate that if theres something more promising written there.
