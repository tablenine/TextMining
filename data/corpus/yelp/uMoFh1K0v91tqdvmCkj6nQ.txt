So, after being told numerous times, I finally checked this place out.. . I was a bit disappointed.  First, their lines were organized.  I couldn't tell where to stand to order and, then, pick up my food.  It was quite haphazard.  KING TACO has a better system.. . Their menu's too basic.  They need to be more specific in what you get.  When I ordered my food, I had no idea that it came with chips and salsa. Had I known, I would've ordered guacamole with it.. . The food, itself, was okay.  It didn't impress me at all.  I don't see why others love it.  It's nice if you want something to fill your stomach.  The salsa I was given was pureed and tasteless.. . Would I go again?  Nah.  But, should it stay around?  Sure, if others love it, more power to them.
