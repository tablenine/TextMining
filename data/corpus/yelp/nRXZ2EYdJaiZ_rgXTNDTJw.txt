A place that sells novel things to me. I mainly wanted to come here for the blue velvet cake, but I ended up getting more items from the menu. There's always lots of people and a long line so you know this place must be good.. . My group ordered 4 different sandwiches from the menu and they were all pretty good. I got the Media Noche. They all came with salad. The dressing seemed kinda strong--I didn't like it too much. The sandwich itself was pretty tasty but I don't think it was worth $9. I would recommend eating somewhere else, then coming to Milk for dessert. All the dessert food items looked delicious.. . With that said, I had a strawberry shortcake milkshake--GOOD.. I also had a slice of blue velvet cake--GOOD (rumor has it that you will have blue velvet poop, haha).. . Definitely a good place to check out. Not 5 stars because the sandwiches are expensive. Lastly, parking sucked! Hope you get lucky.
