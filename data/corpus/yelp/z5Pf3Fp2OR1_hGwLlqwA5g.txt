Yum!. . My friend took me here when we went on a group outing with some close friends. He recommended this place and he's pretty good with restaurants so I went with it.. . The environment is noisy, but it's a very chill and easy-going place. The chatter around makes it a good place to come with friends of yours. I love lots of chatter in these types of restaurants.. . They gave us a basket of bread. I'm a bread-lover. It was too buttery for my taste, but it wasn't bad at all. My big mistake was eating too much of the bread -- don't do it! More food is coming up!. . I ordered their famous Versailles chicken. They said it was half a chicken and they mean it. The portion was huge and it was roughly 10 dollars! Great price! The chicken was very juicy (HAPPY!) and had a very interesting flavor - I loved it. It came with a side of plantains. I normally don't like cooked plantains but they made it delicious. It also comes with a side of black beans and rice (or you can mix it together - moro). The beans and rice are also very good.. . Because I was so pleased, I took my boyfriend here. He can eat a lot, but he'll only eat a lot if he likes it. He loved it here. I recommended the chicken to him and I ordered the pork. We were both pleased with our orders. The chicken was filling because of the huge portions and the pork was delicious. I love the added lemony taste they add to their food. He was happy and I was happy.. . Parking is unpredictable, you may or may not get a spot. There is definitely a dinner rush; luckily both times I got there one was after and one was before it. Service was not bad, no complaints.
