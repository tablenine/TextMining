Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
My meal at the Green Zebra was among one of the best food experiences I've had the opportunity to enjoy. . . The tone of the meal is set by the dimly lit contemporary, earthy, Asian accented dining room. The amuse bouse that night was a spicy carrot soup, with Thai noodles, which was an explosion on the taste buds. Next I received my salad, Honey Crisp Apples, fresh horseradish, tarragon, hazelnuts - possibly the best salad I've ever had. Next, I received my entree, Ricotta Gnocchi, roasted heirloom squash, rapini, preserved lemon - very, very good. Each taste was like a new exploration. For desert I had the Honey Crisp Apple Beignets, creme fraiche ice cream, "Pere jacques" gelee - WOW! One of the best deserts I have ever had. . . I've had some phenomenal experiences at restaurants throughout this nation, I have to say, the Green Zebra was one of the best. I would highly recommend this place, meat eaters and vegetarians alike!
