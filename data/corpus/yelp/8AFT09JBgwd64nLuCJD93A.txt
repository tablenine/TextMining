Restaurant: Twisted Taco
Category: Mexican
Twisted Taco has been one of my favorite spots for a good time and lots of laughs. It is not pretentious at all, like some of its neighbors. Everyone is there to have a good time, get drunk or both. There is no real dance floor but I have always had a blast dancing there wherever I could find the room. Kareoke is hysterical on the top floor- reminds me of the new show The Singing Bee.
