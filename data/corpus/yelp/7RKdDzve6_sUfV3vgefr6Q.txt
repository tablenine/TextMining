Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
I had wanted to try Parker's on Ponce earlier but since the economy is in the tank, I thought I had better wait for a special occasion before heading out to a steakhouse. Then came my birthday, so Jim and I decided it was a good time to try it.. . The interior is warm.  Lots of dark wood, but it was balanced out by light walls and stone fireplaces.  Ambiance is a bit lost on me, but it's nice to go to a steakhouse where it doesn't resemble a playboy bachelor's den.. . Our waiter, Chris, was really kind and helpful without being intrusive.  He recommended some appetizers (flash fried calamari and the house salad, both delicious) and told us about the wine list.  I am not a wine connoisseur, but the restaurant tends to favor red, (which, with red meat, is understandable).  However, since I am allergic to red wine I ordered a Grey Goose martini while Jim had a beer.. . That was one hell of a martini.  Spot on.  I wanted to have another but since I wanted to be sober when I ate my steak, I decided against it.. . Jim ordered the flatiron steak while I had the ribeye.  Both came medium rare.  Wow.  My steak was amazing.  Jim said his flatiron steak was perfect.  For my side dish I ordered creamed spinach.  Jim ordered fries.  The spinach was so-so but hey, I'm not going to hold it against the restaurant.. . For dessert I had the bread pudding (Jim said he was too full. More for me!)  It was heavenly.  I couldn't finish it but it will make a great snack later.. . If you want to try a new steakhouse, definitely consider Parker's.  You will not be disappointed with the food or the service.
