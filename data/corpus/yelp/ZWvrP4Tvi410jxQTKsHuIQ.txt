i went after seeing the clip on food network and all the reviews here.  seemed like a good idea.. . not a good idea.  . . the food was ok.  my bf and i split the carne enchilada and the milanesa cemitas.  they were kinda greasy, but pretty tasty.  definitely not good enough to cause cravings later on, but enough that i didn't regret the experience.. . or did i.  about halfway home, both of us were experiencing some intestinal distress.  yeah.  that killed it.  fighting for the bathroom doesn't fall into my list of fun things to do on a friday night.
