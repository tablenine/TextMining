Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
After reading reviews online, perusing the menu online, and hearing firsthand experiences from close friends, I was pretty excited about checking out Bottega Louie.  The prices are very reasonable, but it seems as though the food matches the prices.  The portobello fries, as promised, were very good especially with the sauce served alongside.  Sadly, this was as good as it got all night.  The pastas are a bit small (which explain the reasonable price), and just a warning:  the Trenne is a very crunchy pasta dish.  It could be good if you're into that kinda thing, but I'm a traditional, al dente/soft kinda person.  The ravioli is a bit bland, and as for the pizza - nothing special.  The highly acclaimed peanut butter terrine is like a very rich peanut butter cup, where you're almost begging for a tall glass of milk after just a few bites.  The service is excellent, and I actually really liked the atmosphere.  I'd be willing to give it another shot, but I wasn't thoroughly impressed the first time around.
