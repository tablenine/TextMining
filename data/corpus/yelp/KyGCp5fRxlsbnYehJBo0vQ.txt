Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Father's Office... I salute you!  Your signature burgers, sweet potato fries and wide selection of beers are the perfect combination.  I wish I lived closer to this place, because this is the perfect spot to hangout.. . I haven't been to the Fathers Office in Santa Monica (I hear that one is tiny), but this one is pretty spacious with a nice indoor/outdoor setting.  Inside has dim lighting for that perfect ambiance. The music is at just the right level so you don't have to yell at your friends.  The people are laid back and friendly.. . This place has a HUUUUUGE selection of beers and wines from all over the world. The bartenders are pretty knowledgable about their beers too. If you tell the bartender what your taste buds are in the mood for, they will give you a few suggestions.. . I would highly recommend coming here with an empty stomach because their burgers are one of the best i've ever had. NO JOKE!  So if you're a rookie, here is what I suggest... get a couple of belgium beers (e.g. Chimay), a burger, some sweet potato fries.... and you'll be lovin life!
