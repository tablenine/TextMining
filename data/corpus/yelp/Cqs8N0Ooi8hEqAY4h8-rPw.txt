God I love this place.  Back in the day when I used to "puff the magic dragon" I used to come here all the time.  Now that it's been a while, I'm surprised to find lemonade still at $0.65.  Add that with two double dips with a good whip of mustard,  mmm mmm!!  . . If I have to choose the best sandwich in L.A., I would go with Phillippe's.  I mean I am a huge fan of Bay Cities Deli in Santa Monica and all but Phillippe's I could have any day, any time.  I know, but I swear..
