A person at our hotel suggested that we take a stroll down to this restaurant for dinner. He made it sound like it was just a regular chain restaurant, but it is by far no TGIF. This place ranks right up there with the best of the best. Our food and our experience were great. The wait staff look like they were all hand picked by the owner....very hollywood looking staff. The man in the hotel said to try the artichoke dip, and he was right on point, very tasty. The cheesy bread things were also a good appetizer. I'll definitely be going back here.
