Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
"CHEEEEESE! Hey, didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?". . "Yeah I got out, thanks.". . Seriously, I wish someone would have locked up the person making it rain cheese on these tacos more than Fat Joe in the club. . . The tacos are all right, not mind blowing. My friends RAVED about these and went to pick them up when we came over to their place in West LA before a Saturday night out.. . I tried both the beef taco and the bean and cheese burrito - honestly I liked the bean and cheese burrito better, but is it really that hard to make a good b&amp;c burrito?. . This may be a "my neighborhood has the best hole in the wall fast food taco stand" kind of thing - and I like my greasy, fatty, and of questionable origin Mexican food - but I've had better.. . If you're in the area, try it out for yourself, but I wouldn't drive more than fifteen minutes out of the way.
