Clarke's  . Category: Restaurants . . I once got a huge piece of red yarn in my coffee.  Huge.  How do huge pieces of red yarn get in coffee?  They gave me the coffee free.  This place is pretty much disgusting.  Sometimes I am shocked it is still open! Once one of the cooks was openly yelling at the waitresses for improperly filling the salad dressing bins in a way that was a health hazard (they kept topping the old dressing without cleaning out the bins) and all the waitresses got together and called him a jerk off.  He probably got fired for trying to keep customers from deadly bacteria.   I used to go here because it was convenient, and 24 hours (I am a night owl who lived off Belmont at the time) but then decided Hollywood Grill or A Golden Nugget are worth the extra effort to avoid this bad service (there was one good waiter; he was bald and had a self sticker on his ticket pad holder, never saw him anymore after a while.  Maybe he was good enough to get a real job), and terrible, bland food.  If I am barely standing drunk, and it is 4 am, and I am still thinking "Wow, this food sucks." It is BAD.   I have probably eaten most items on the menu, and pretty much only found the turkey burger somewhat palatable. .   Why two stars? It is fun to order shots with your (horrible) Omelet, and the people watching does not get a whole lot better.
