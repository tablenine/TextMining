"3 Tasty Treats". . I *love* the fact that I work next door to DBA!! And, when I work the earlier shift and get off around 8ish, I can mosey over for what I've decided to christen my 3 Tasty Treats "meal." A simple plan of attack and just enough food and drink:. . 1 The dee-licious white cheddar and corn muffins. They come with creamy good butter, but I like to have at least one with . . .. . 2 Some of the pimento cheese from the Deviled Egg app, which I spread on the muffin to make a cute little tasty sandwich! The eggs are great, too, and the dollops of pimento cheese very generous.. . 3 Accompanying my snacks (as long as they aren't super busy because I'd feel bad asking for it) is a lovely watermelon mojito. This is something I've only had at DBA and not normally being a mojito fan, was surprised to find how much I liked it! Sold.. . Tasty treats, all around.
