Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I've been here a couple of times with friends and have tried the Umami burger, the one with green chilis, and truffle burger. The best for sure is the one with green chilis. . It's definitely a good burger, but it is a bit overpriced. I really like the soft bun that lets you taste the meat.. The tempura battered onion rings are good and fries are ok. The portions are a bit small though. . Definitely worth trying if you want a good burger.
