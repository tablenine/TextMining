Ok, I was gonna take a star off because it was so So-Cal I felt like I was watching some sh!t eposide of the Hills (sorry, Err!).. . BUT...it's a cool spot and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. The service was on point and the whole experience was fantastic! I don't know why people would be offended by this sort of place (a little too sensitive). I'm totally waiting for someone to build a Hispanic-themed hip spot...La Casa del Guapo!. . They almost lost a star 'cause of DJ Weaksauce on the 1s and 2s. That was some pretty messy spinning going on, but maybe that's what's hot down there.. . Definitely worth the visit, especially if you're from out of town (I'm sure "locals" would disagree, but Id probably rate local popular Bay Area spots a little more harshly, too)-
