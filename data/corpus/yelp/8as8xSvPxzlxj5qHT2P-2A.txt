I've never been here outside of brunch. I want to- but its the type of menu that if you aren't looking for seafood, duck, lamb or qauyle-type dishes, you're rather limited. The brunch however is excellent. Very simple, with some really nice touches and twists.. . Among the wonderful touches to the breakfast are the buttermilk biscuits served with a delicious strawberry butter, and the bacon- covered in brown sugar- is amazing. And I don't normally even eat bacon.. . Restaurant is BYOB and at some point the H.B. that once stood for Hearty Boys changed to Home Bistro. I believe new ownership is the case, as local Boystown celebs, The Hearty Boys (apparently they have a show, or have had a show on the Food Network?) moved on to other enterprises.. . The restaurant itself is rather small, but very cozy and with a really cool rustic feel.
