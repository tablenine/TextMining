When I was a yuppie I used to shop here. I'm not a yuppie any longer, and I still find myself shopping here. See, that's how good WF is. Its like crack and LEGOs -- once you start playing with it, you can't quit. . . Anyway, there are some great deals WF manages to have. However most of the food that is found at Publix and Kroger is more expensive. So, the trick is to buy the most random stuff here like hemp milk and organic all natural soy cheese.. . Also their buffet is pretty damn good. A bit expensive, but if you are good at tetris and guessing weight, you can get plenty to eat!
