What? Are those frog legs on your menu?. . No I didn't have the guts to try them, but there are several dishes on the menu that contain frog legs.  Is that traditional Mexican?  Hmmm.... . I did have the queso dip, which was terrific.  I ordered 2 enchilada's: one chicken and one beef.  They were both good.  The best part, though, was my margarita!. . I would say that the food is much better than Pancho's on Buford Highway but, not as authentic as some other Mexican restaurants that I've been to.. . This food left me hopping right out the door. RIBIT!
