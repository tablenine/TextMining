It gets 5 bright stars for being the best alternative to Denny's that I have ever come across. Of course I got a Shake, they don't call me buttercup for nothing, it was great! The service was excellent considering that me &amp; Â my world conquering friends were drunk and it was 3:30 in the a.m. Also Mr. Bourdain &amp; Mark Peel came here on an episode of No Resi's.
