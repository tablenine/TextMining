Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I was visiting an old friend in Culver City and I was craving PASTA.  She chose Ugo.  I love my friend... but I'm not a big fan of Ugo.. . We went for dinner and after a brief wait at the empty host booth, we were seated inside.  We ordered a bottle of white wine (piedmont?) which was fruity, light, and delicious.  My friend ordered pasta with shrimp in a spicy, tomato sauce (shrimps were plump and the sauce was yummy).  I ordered the bolognese with cappelini pasta.  I added red pepper to the slightly bland sauce (I'm not sure if the pasta was properly strained).  I have had better bolognese but was overall was happy with the dish and serving size. . . I would have enjoyed my dinner had the server/busboy not asked us to go to the other cafe or the wine bar.  If he had been the slightest bit observant he would have seen my friend was on the last sip of wine and we would have left in a minute.  He was extremely polite but any restaurant who allows their servers to asks two patrons who spend $50 on pasta &amp; wine AND leave 25% gratuity is RUDE.
