Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Much cooler than their SF location... the Stinking Rose on La Cienega has multiple themed rooms that are done really nice. The food is great if you love garlic -- the bagna calda is something to definitely order. An all around fun place to go to dinner...
