In my last review I mentioned that 5 stars from me means I had an orgasmic dining experience.  The proof is in the pudding here...or rather the flan! OH GOOD GAWD do I love this place!!!  I drool thinking about it.  I dream of it.  I crave it.  I constantly want it.  I need it.  It's permanently entered into my GPS device.  It's the ONLY restaurant in my GPS.  . . I love bold flavors that tickle and excite my taste buds and Versailles does it.  It's how Cuban food should be.  I'd dance my excitement for this place if I could.  Do you get the point as to how much i absolutely LOVE this place?  I realize it's an LA "chain", but a damn good one.  I started coming here about 7 years ago (before I moved here) and it has forever remained one of my favorite restaurants EVER!  You get so much food for such a cheap price.  It's no frills and that's what I love about it.  I don't have to get dressed to the nines to come here.  I can put on my "fat pants" and a tank top and stroll in ready to eat!  The bread they give you when you sit is sooo simple but so good.  I used to always eat the garlic shrimp, but have now found a new favorite - the Oxtail Stew!!!  It is so flavorful and the meat falls right off the bone.  The only thing I skip out on is the plantains.  Anything in the banana family is the nastiest food in the world...blech!   Everything I've had here is good.  The black beans and rice that accompany the dish is simple, yet fabulous.  I've also tried their special roasted chicken, which is also really flavorful.  Everyone I've taken here has loved it.  . . I have a feeling I'm going to dream of this place tonight....
