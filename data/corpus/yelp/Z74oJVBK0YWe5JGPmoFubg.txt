Once upon a time a guy took me here on a date because of his law school budget. Â I was told the Hainan Chicken was incredible... THE BEST chicken EVER! So he ordered the Hainan Chicken and I got the pizza. The pizza was mediocre at best and the Hainan Chicken was good.. but not great.. We also had a few other items but the Hainan chicken was probably the only saving grace there. Come to think of it.. my date was kinda like Savoy Kitchen.. he got a law school education as his best quality.. and Savoy Kitchen got Hainan chicken.. Too bad neither were compelling enough for me to have a second visit. That and the food quality did not justify the wait.
