Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
You know, I wasn't impressed.  Italian Village is definitely promoted as a need-to-try restaurant in the city, and so I looked forward to it.  My friend and I went to have a nice Italian meal and some wine after a long day, and we didn't realize how pricey it was going to be.  You are given bread, but the portion sizes of the meals (even the pastas!) are very small.  The wine list is EXTENSIVE, to the extent that we were extremely overwhelmed.  It basically is a book.  Do people actually order those $3,000 bottles of wine?  Anyhow, we each had a glass, enjoyed them, ordered some pasta and shared a couple of desserts.  The ambience is neat, due to its reputation as a Chicago staple, but all of the servers are male (sort of a bothersome point for me), my wallet can't handle the impact, and there isn't any available parking, so you'll have to public trans or taxi it.
