Oh how good it is. I finally found this treasure on my way home one weekend afternoon and boy can I say it was delicious.. .  I ordered the Liege waffle with bananas. The waffle crust was just perfect and the fresh bananas just added to the flavors. I would have given them a five star review if only they had a store front. . . If I get lucky enough to stumble across this truck again I will be sure to try the ice cream and waffle combos as it looked delicious on a warm afternoon.
