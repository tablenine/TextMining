3 stars. Dropped 0.5 stars.. . Last time I was here the wait was literally an hour when they told us it would be around 20 minutes. The service was awful that night. Servers forgot drinks, served the pizza before salads, etc. I found out that apparently one of the servers had bailed last minute, so the others were scrambling to fill the missing server's tables. Understandable but shouldn't they have been prepared for something like this? Unexpected situations always come up.. . On the bright side, I got a delicious glass of wine and free dessert. Definitely willing to come back.. . PS The hot guy was still there.
