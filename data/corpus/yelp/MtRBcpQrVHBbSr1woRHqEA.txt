Relatively small but the food is great.  I recommend the bacon-wrapped shrimp on toast, paella, and french toast.  I asked the server why French toast at a Spanish place and she said, "Because it's good..."  Draw your own conclusions.  Much better than Spanish Kitchen.  Bring your own wine and enjoy it with your dinner.  Great date place because the dim lighting and candlelight will make anyone (even yours truly) look good.  Make a reservation beforehand and use valet parking.  It costs 5.50 but it's easier than finding parking in the neighborhood.
