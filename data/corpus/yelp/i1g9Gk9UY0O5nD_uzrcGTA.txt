Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
So when you come here, assume you're going to have to try the Pastrami sandwich, right?  It's good!  And thats saying something from a girl who doesn't really care for pastrami.. . The burgers here are really good, too.  Great fries. Mmmmm.. . This place is cash only, which is especially a pain in the ass, considering that this place is pricey.  . . Ordering can be a little awkward, given how small the space is around the counter.  I definitely would recommend Johnnie's, still.
