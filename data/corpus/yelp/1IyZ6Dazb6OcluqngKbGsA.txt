Three stars for the day...decent dogs. Zero stars for the late late after bar crowd.. . This review is not so much about the place, as it is about their late night customers.. . If you want to watch a bunch of drunk rich racist yuppies talk shit to the staff at night...and be able to walk away feeling refreshed so in Sunday morning confessional you can feel cleansed of your sins; this is your place for a cathartic moment.. . I cheer for the staff and understand this is done for "fun" but when I was there the comments some of the customers made went way way way over the line.  It is embarrassing to see within the city of Chicago rich "outstanding, law abiding, I need a tax break, patriot act voting, big box chain store shopping, I can't wait till they open an Applebees, future Republicans" show their true colors".. . I guess whatever floats your boat, but I won't go back because if I worked there the food would become a dangerous experiment.  Hint to the staff, keep some visine in stock for the real assholes and watch them shit themselves.
