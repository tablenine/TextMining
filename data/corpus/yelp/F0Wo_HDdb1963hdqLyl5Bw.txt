Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
One of the best sushi restaurants in Chicago.  Although the wait staff can work on coming up with a better system to seat people more efficiently.  The food is definitely worth the wait. And very friendly staff! Not sure if BYOB hurts the restaurant more than help.  Too many people drag just to finish their bottle of wine.
