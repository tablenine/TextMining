Its pains me to give this place such a rating only because its Mario Batali. I had to give myself time to assess and think this review over. In comparison to the big chef restaurants in the industry...flay, burke, emeril, this ranks last. I'll attribute the average rating to my inexperienced Italian palet but 2/4 dishes I know I did not like. . . I knew that this place's food is salty but shit its salty. From a 1-10, 10 being inedible its a 6-7. I had some little ricotta, olive, on toast compliment from the chef that was solid. Next was the mozzarella sample, it was good but not memorable. Server swore by the garlic bread but its wasnt that great. Then it was onto the spaghetti which had some spice and pancheta. The worse plate of the night. Super salty and not for me. We had some red wine from tuscany which is  from batali's vineyard to go with the veal, that was perfect cos the dish has caramelized onions that compliment the veal well. However, I made the mistake to order sunchoke w/ salsa verde cos it sounded good but its way too salty, gamey, and herb infused. Then on to dessert, canolis which were average. Then the check came in....$205 um that made me consider a 3 star rating. I hope batali can place some blame on his partners for something too far out and not so fantastic.  Maybe I'll give him a chance in Vegas cos that where all the fining dining I had shined.
