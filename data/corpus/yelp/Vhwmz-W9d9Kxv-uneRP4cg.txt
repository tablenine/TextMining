Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Strolled over to Taste on a lazy Sunday morning.  Lazy only because it's really already afternoon.. . Seating on the patio is not too sparse, as it's a little gloomy outside.  The inside is very simple black and white,  classy modern -- anything but kitsch.  The beverages come quick and the orange juice is pretty fresh squeezed style.  The service is quick and we put in our orders--crab cake benedict and southwest scramble, and get them in almost no time.  . . The crabcake benedict was a beautiful work of art with the poached egg perfectly shaped and sitting on top of the perfectly cylinder crabcake and english muffin.   The grilled potatoes paired on the side complemented the whole piece very nicely and it tickled the senses very nicely.  However, it was one of those hollywood moments, where it doesn't translate well from sense to sense.  While wholly appetizing to the look, the taste was a little lackluster.  The hollandaise sauce was a little thick for my tastes and the lemon wasn't quite mild enough.  The egg was poached perfectly with that yolk oozing out when broken but the crabcake was a little off--maybe not quite seasoned enough or a little overdone. . The southwest scramble was also not everything everyone claims it to be.  I usually only complain about dishes being too salty, as I hardly use much salt in my own cooking.  However, there was something about the scramble that was a little bland and lacked taste.  . . I think the hits of the morning (or early afternoon) was the perfectly cooked side of tasty potatoes, the service, and the ambiance.
