Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
I love savoy.  I was introduced to this place by a couple friends about a year go and have been coming here almost every week and sometimes more than once a week ever since.  My favorite things are the Hainan Chicken white meat or the Curry Pork Chop w./ broth rice.   It may just be chicken and rice, but the broth rice is delicious and the chicken paired with the ginger and chili sauce is what sets savoy apart from any other type of hainan chicken spots.  Plus the free refills of iced tea can make the meal even more worth it at approx. 11 dollars per person ( hainan chicken + iced tea + tax and tip)  Only down side is that the place is cash only, so a stop to the bank is a must when headed to this diamond of a spot.
