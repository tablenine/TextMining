I stopped in here the other day after my eye doctor's appointment.. . I had the black bean burger and a cup of hot chocolate. The burger, while not the best I've ever had, was pretty tasty. I definitely enjoyed the chipotle aioli that they put on top of it. It gave it a nice southwestern twist.. . Since they served it with tortilla chips, I asked for a side of guac. I knew this ahead of time and still chose to order it, but a side of guac is $5.75! That is, quite possibly, the most expensive guac ever. It was really good, don't get me wrong, but I don't think I'd ever pay that much again. . . Anyway, that's the only thing they lost a star for. The service was good, and the hot chocolate was delicious. . . I don't recommend going there with dilated pupils, though, because you won't be able to really see your food and you'll make a huge mess. . . I'll definitely be back to try out some of their baked goods and fruit juices. It's nice to have a cozy cafe nearby.
