If you are AFRAID of eating a LOT because you are a beautiful LA person with beautiful insides to match your wonderful outsides, then...at least get the one chicken breast, one waffle meal.  A little maple syrup will fall on the juicy chicken...then...you might want to try a little sausage afterwards to get some salty balance in there, oooh but, why not some gravy too, oh my...wait wait, what are they having over there?  Oh, it's a giant piece of cornbread!  Well, why not.  Can I have some butter to smear all over this puppy?  Wait, there's Mac and Cheese too?  . . HA YOUR DIET, IT HAS FAILED.
