sausage and rice plate! so good, and super super cheap. their shaved ice is really good too, and their cold chicken noodle. but i dont recommend eating the cold chicken noodle if you dont intend on walking out reeking of garlic. . . its always super packed around lunch and dinner time. and isnt really good for seating large groups, so order to go!
