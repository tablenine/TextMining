Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The best prime rib I ever had in my entire life.  Thanks to my ex-boyfriend for taking me here back in 1998, since then I am hook with their prime rib.  I love everything about this place.  People, if you have a chance to visit southern California, you must give it a try.
