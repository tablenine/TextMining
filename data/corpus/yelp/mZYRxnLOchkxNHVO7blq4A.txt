Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I've been to the Apple Pan a few times and always had pretty good experiences.  It's like stepping off the street and into a time capsule from a simpler era, one without PDA's or credit cards.  For them not much has changed throughout the years and I doubt much ever will.  It's just simple stick-to-your-ribs wholesome goodness.  . . I like the Hickory Burger, which comes with a sauce that tastes like the illicit love child of ketchup and BBQ sauce.  The burgers come wrapped in paper so you can eat without getting the burger goo all over your hands.  . . As for dessert, I'm partial to the Banana Cream Pie.  At the Apple Pan, the pie slices are fresh, huge and nicely chilled.  . . My only beef (pun intended) would be that their prices are kind of on the high side.  Last time I got two pieces of pie (one for GF and one for me) and it cost me $14.  $14 for two pieces of pie???  It's good pie, but still!  . . Parking can also be a problem depending on what time of day you go here.  There is street parking but it's metered.  . . If you're in the Westwood area and craving a good old fashioned burger, food-wise the Apple Pan is a solid choice.  However, you have to bring cash because they DO NOT take credit cards!  . . Two stars for the high prices, the poor parking and for not accepting credit cards.  Four stars for the food.  Average rate = three stars.
