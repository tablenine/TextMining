Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
The cheesecake factory was very good. I know, I know, many of the reviewers on Yelp have a repulsion towards corporate chains. Sometimes, I feel the same way. But good food is good food.. . Located in downtown Chicago, it is an easily accessible and affordable place to grab lunch or dinner. Yes, it is touristy, if that also includes suburbanites. But the service is always great and I have yet to be let down by anything I have eaten. . . The avocado egg rolls are outstanding!. . I could do without the decor. And, I don't like cheesecake. But besides that, the Cheesecake factory has solid food at reasonable prices for downtown Chicago.
