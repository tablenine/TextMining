Normally, esp. based on the other reviews, I'd never bother coming here. But I had one of those $30 "Dine Around" gift cards and I never let these go to waste -- this month's was Bluepointe. And lucky for us, both my friend &amp; I each had the $30 gift card and they said both of us could use it as long as we did separate checks. . . They have a pretty good sushi &amp; appetizer list -- I decided to order sushi since they call themselves a sushi &amp; Asian fusion restaurant. I got the rainbow sushi roll (BBQ eel, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado) which was pretty good -- all their rolls are reasonably priced ($11). For entree, I ordered the Alaskan halibut with artichokes. Unfortunately, the dish turned out to be pretty boring (compared to what I read in their menu), and definitely not worth $28 (yes, $28). My friend ordered the peanut crusted grouper in masaman curry with boy choy, which I thought tasted pretty good but had way too many peanuts ... but honestly, not worth the $28 either. Yes, the entrees are way overpriced here.. . For dessert, we ordered their chocolate molten cake with pistachio ice cream. We unanimously agreed the dessert was the best part of our meal. Great presentation, too. . . Highly doubt there would be a next time -- except if I were to get another $30 gift card to Bluepointe, in which case I'd order just the sushi/appetizers &amp; desserts.
