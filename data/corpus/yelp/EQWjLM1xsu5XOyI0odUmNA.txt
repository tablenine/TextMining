JUICY PORK DUMPLINGS!!!!. . i LOVE the fact that they've opened a second location right next door. that way the wait isnt so long. . . i just recently went and tried out the new location. there was NO WAIT!..maybe because we were cutting it close on their lunch hours. we barely made it.. . ordered about four different kinds of dumplings and also had shrimp fried rice. but the only one worth mentioning is the juicy pork! mmm MMm mm! so good.. . too bad these dumplings are so tiny that its kinda hard to get full off of them. they can be a bit pricey..but i think its well worth it.
