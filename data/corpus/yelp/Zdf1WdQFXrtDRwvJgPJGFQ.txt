Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I visit Canter's at least 2 times a month. The food is ok depending what you like. They have an array of pasteries, which are really good. The one thing I dislike is...as soon as you walk in there's this strong smell of who knows what. It's like a viniger, garlic, sour, bitter something!, which is not cool at all. Then again they sell pickled tongue!!!! Yuck!
