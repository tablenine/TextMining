This place gets packed!  Try to be there a little early to get a good table and order your food in a timely manner.  My $14 Syrah was delicious, but it was $14.  My husband's heffevison (on tap) was smooth like warm bread.  You have to order at the bar, get a number and your food is brought to you.  I got the beat salad- pretty good. And hubby got the office burger (no substitutes so he had to get it with the caramelized onions, that I gladly ate) - which was good.  Oh, and it seems a prerequisite to get the yam fries (served in a mini shopping cart) - they were pretty good.. . If there are only two of you, chances are someone will want to share your table with you.  We were joined by some very nice, interesting people.  If you eat outside, face the street, that way you do not have to look at all the people hovering over your table waiting for you to leave so they can jump on it like a vulture on carrion.   . . The staff is very efficient with bringing food out and cleaning up.  Don't expect a lot of conversation from the bartenders, however, they're really too busy to discuss the menu with you.. . Parking is FREE!
