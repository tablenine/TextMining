Ok, I get it... I think.. . This is a pretty cool little cafe in a pretty trendy neighborhood with some cool looking desserts.. . I tried 3 different items so I could get a good sample. . . The ice cream is good. Not mind blowing, and I've better ice cream at a number of places, but it's good. The best part for me though was not the ice cream itself, but rather the fillings. For example, I got the blueberry crumble and it was chucked full of actual pieces of blueberry cobbler. Nice! But the ice cream it was submerged in was average.. . The ice cream bars were interesting. Again, the ice cream itself was average, but the butterscotch coating on the one I had was great. Almost a little too sweet for me, but dang good. I thought it was a little pricy though. $3.50 for a small cup of the blueberry ice cream and $6.50 for the butterscotch ice cream bar!. . The sandwich and salads were also good, and I thought a little more in line price wise. . . Where I think their bread and butter is in the baked goods. The peanut butter brownie was fantastic. A little pricy again though ($4.50) . . Bottom line is that it's a trendy place in a trendy neighborhood, so you have to expect a little higher prices I guess. As for the quality, it depends on what you get. Some things were great, some were so-so. You'll have to experiment to find your favorites, but that's part of the fun of eating at new places!
