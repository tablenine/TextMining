alright. i had been looking forward to coming here with my friend kate for quite some time and unfortunately it definitely did not live up to the hype.. . it was really cool how you could choose everything that went on the burger. from how many ounces (yes even with VBs!) to the sauce that goes on it and the bun. Â it was kind of overwhelming with all of the choices but i think more choices are better than no choices.. . anyway, i got a veggie burger which was pretty good but it was hard to eat as it fell apart right away. this is a big no-no with vegetarians. veggie burgers that crumble on contact pretty much fail. F-A-I-L.. . the garlic aoili sauce was a bit too garlic-y. overall it was tasty but not worth the $9 that i dished out for it.. . we also shared an order of cheese fries which was sadly not nacho cheese but "melted" shredded cheese on top of fries.. . great concept, but not worth the price.
