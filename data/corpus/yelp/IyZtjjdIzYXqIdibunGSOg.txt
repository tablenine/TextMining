Tiny little restaurant with tons of personality.. . If you're going with a group of friends, get a mezza plate to share.  Warm pita squares with grilled eggplant and hummus...mmmm. . Al, the owner, will make your meal an experience.  The most entertaining owner I've ever met.  If you don't know what to order, have no fear, Al will guarantee you something delicious.. . Don't forget the Baaklava. Their Baaklava comes in traditional squares, rolls and pinwheels- my favorite.  Ground pistachios on top add a nice touch.
