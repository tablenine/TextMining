There are many reasons why I may or may not frequent a place time and time again. Sometimes it is the food that overshadows all else, sometimes fond memories of evenings out and sometimes it is the care and attention that the staff and/or owners pay to the customers. . . I have not been going to Gloria's for long, but it has become a somewhat regular place for me. They all know me when I walk in now and all know I have one dietary issue that I have to watch. Cilantro.. yeah, I know all you cilantro lovers are out there, but it makes me sick - literally. . . I went in today for a late lunch and Chico greeted me with his usual friendly manner, brought me chips and salsa to which I pointed out I could not eat it.. he apologized (it is brought totally out of habit, I think) then took my order. Not long after, one of the men from the kitchen brings me out a dish of freshly made salsa with NO CILANTRO. I did not request it, as it seems to be unheard of to do.. but they did it. I thanked Chico for that (after inhaling a good portion of it) and he said it was more the guys back in the kitchen. . . Bravo.. I am now officially won over. . . Seriously.. this is a family owned place that really seems to care about their customers. Bravo.
