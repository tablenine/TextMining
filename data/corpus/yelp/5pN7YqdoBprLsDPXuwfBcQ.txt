Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
They serve some tasty dumplings here.  My friends and I wanted to try a lot of things on the menu, but the waitress actually said "no" to us because it was way too much food.  We heeded her advice and gobbled everything up - totally could have eaten more!. . The variety of XLB's we ordered were all good.  Green beans were also tasty.  I wasn't blown away by either the pork chop noodle soup or beef noodle soup.  They were OK, but a waste of stomach space considering you could be eating XLB's!. . Come on the weekends in order to get the "weekend special dumplings" but be prepared for a long wait.  Parking can also be a pain.
