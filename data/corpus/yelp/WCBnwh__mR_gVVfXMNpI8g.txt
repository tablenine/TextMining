Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
SOOO GOOOOOD!!!  my first visit here was great!  i was expecting a wait but surprising their was no wait at all!  the place itself was very "male-ish" hence "father's office"  its like beer bar on the wall.  they had so many ecletic beers from all over the world.  And the bartenders were very nice.  They dont have any servers there, so u order from the bar and pick a seat, and they give u a number (but it isnt like a fast food joint).  I ordered Sweet potato fries which they served in a mini shopping kart (very cute) and the Office Burger.  The office burger was delicious!!!  it had caramelized onions, arugula, and i forgot what kind of cheese was in it...but it was AMAZING! go check it out!
