Portos is delish.  I always order a guava cheese croissant because it's different.  The potato balls are good, and chocolate croissants are another favorite.  Anything here would sound good to me, but the croissants are great because they're crispy on the outside as well as everything flavorful in the inside.  I buy a box of pastries, and the next day I pop them into a toaster oven and they taste better than I had bought them originally!  The pastries are reasonably priced...under $2 for some of them.  The tres leche and red velvet cake were seriously so good.
