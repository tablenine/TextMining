Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
*Note: I was thisclose to going to Orochon instead of Daikokuya because I wanted to try the Man vs Food challenge, but thought against it because we had just eaten the Kogi truck minutes earlier.  Next time.. First of all, expect to wait when you come.  My friend put down his name while we were in the Kogi truck line (it happened to be 50 yards away last night) so it worked out perfectly.  And yes, we had two separate dinners just minutes apart.  There's simply no explanation for our gluttony.  Well, one of the friends is pregnant so maybe that counts?. The restaurant is small, uncomfortably warm and smelly (not the smell of food, mind you).. We started with the gyoza.  I've said this before but gyoza never impresses me.  The dipping sauce was good and I do enjoy it, but gyoza is gyoza is gyoza.  Moving along.... Ironically, for a ramen place, you basically only have one option for ramen... the Daikoku.  The rest of the menu is full of appetizers, teriyaki bowls, fried rice and bento boxes.. The Daikoku ramen comes in three sizes, and I opted for the small since I had just eaten.  The noodles were a bit al dente, but I actually like it like that.  The pork was really good but they only gave 1 1/2 pieces.  And the soy sauce/pork-based broth was really good as well.  I actually added some of the chili oil and powder for more kick.. Overall good stuff.  Good service, good food.  I'm just not a huge fan of ramen.  3.5
