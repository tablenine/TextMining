Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Philippe is an LA landmark and it is a great place to kill some time and the food is good. First of all the place does have long lines but they move whole lot faster than Pink's line. Their menu is basic and is not hard to decide what you want. I go with a beef sandwich double dipped with blue cheese on it (it will be extra). It is good the only drawback is the sandwiches are a little on the overpriced side could a tad bit cheaper. Everything else is cheap I recommend the pickled egg and the straight chili (not together it can be a deadly combo gas wise). The ambiance is great cause it is so old school and the shared table concept is great. It might not be for everyone but if you look hard enough you can get a booth on for yourself. Other than that just enjoy your sandwich.
