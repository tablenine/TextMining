Al is a pal!!!. Its hard to find good Mediterranean food around town that serves delectable and carefully prepared fresh kebob meat and vegetables. It just doesn't have that "sitting around all day" food taste like a lot of those Mediterranean places have. Great thing is, you can go there anytime, even late at night. If you like soccer, it's your place, as they usually have GolTV on.
