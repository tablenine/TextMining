A great disappointment! All Glitz, pricey fancified prissy food. We were with some well known Atlanta politicians, and got lots of staff recognition but Service was poor for a high calibre place like this (was a great let-down.) The entrees were so overly pepper spiced (even after we requested NO pepper sauces,) we had to send it all back.  After waiting 45 minutes for the replacements, food was just as peppered and was inedible.  In an area of dozens of sparkling terrific fare restaurants this one goes to the bottom-of the list-high price, poorly prepared food, sparse service, absent management...spend more time on quality and less on the arrogance.  Lawyers don't take clients here to impress them anymore...z
