If I ever get a chance, I need a re-do on this place. . . I used to had an ex-boss that loves to come down to Old Chinatown and search for the next "Great Meal". We came by this location because he got lost on his way to Sam Woo or Hop Woo. (both are on the same street, but he can't find it until the week after) Don't worry, I got both of them reviewed already. . . Since it looked like a deli, he thought he can just ordered a steak. He made the same fu*king mistake when we were at Langlier, now this place won't bailed him out. Because they don't have steak. Ha! . . I guess what pissed him off was that it only takes cash and it's like a self serve diner. He was shocked to learned that it's a sub sandwich that is dipped into a sauce. He kept asking me if that is all they have.  . . *sigh* . . The soup and pie wasn't going to do it, but that didn't stop his complaining. After the food was ready, the beef french dip I ordered was very good. He ordered Tuna sandwich and proceed to tell it sucked. C'mon!!! . . Did not enjoyed a peaceful meal, but it was not the fault of Philippe. If I can leave the spoiled monkey in the cage, I would do it in a heartbeat. The food was good, the restaurant looked like an old fashioned deli, and service was so so. . . Now If I can only re-do the experience, I would definitely do it much more differently.....by telling my ex-boss to go Hop Woo and leave him there.
