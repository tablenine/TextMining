Great sushi probably the best one I tasted anywhere.  It's fresh, but real expensive.  I ate here once before for dinner by myself because my girlfriend was away and the bill came out to be $100 for myself??? Ate at the sushi bar because half of the place is a sushi bar.  Sat next to a guy who was a regular there who was a rich millionaire with a black amex celebrating his anniversary with his wife.  Long wait to get in there and I was sitting at the chair and I gave up my chair for his wife while we were waiting to be seated.  I ended up seating next to them at the sushi bar and we chatted.  In the end he paid for my dinner bill :-) what a nice guy.. hope he's there again when i go.. haha..
