Ashton Kutcher... you suck.. . Glitz and Glamor aside, the food at Geisha House blows.. . Sushi was decently fresh, but I had better at Ralphs Supermarket.. . We ventured for some of the more traditional Japanese dishes including Miso-marinated Black Cod and Stewed Pork.  It was OKAY, but for the price and hype, what a disappointment.  . . Needing to fallback on something familiar and difficult to screw up, I just ordered some tempura and California Rolls.  Tempura?  Tasted like funnel cake.  California Rolls were made with "real crab," which although sounds nice, means the meat isn't nearly as sweet.  Its okay, the funnel cake tempura was plenty sweet for me.. . again... you suck Ashton Kutcher!
