Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
My wife and I had a fantastic meal while celebrating our one-year wedding anniversary last night at Hugo's. She's been hearing me brag about it for the past few years, as it is clearly one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The swordfish hit the spot and the service was terrific (as always).. . If you go, definitely make sure to sit in the front room and reserve one of the booths if you can. I'd also recommend an early dinner given that the dining room gets crowded around 7:30 on weekends.. . In any event, one of Chicago's finest!
