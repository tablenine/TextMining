Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
i am broke, hungry, love seafood, love fried food.....where do i go? that's riiigghhtt. . no frills, crispy fish tacos? yep. shrimp tacos? that too. $1.50-2.00 for a decent sized taco? you bet. $1.00 Horchata? hell yeah. Sparkly clean bathroom (for a taco joint)? actually, yes'. choice of condiments you can top yourself? nicely done!. . nice sunny afternoon under the shade on the patio...a spicy bite of crispy, flaky fish, topped with cabbage and mango salsa....then take a sip of the horchata to contrast and cool the spice down....that'll be my defining moment of this place. . only excuses to not go here is if you have no cash and cannot to save your life withdraw $20 (of which, you'll spend about $3) or you're allergic to seafood. Â as for the latter, i have such pity on thee
