Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
I have some mixed feelings about this place but when it comes down to it, the food is really good.  I love the chicken, goat cheese and tomato crepes . . mmm mmm good.  The creamed spinach crepe is also pretty tasty.  They have a really good mixed green salad and french onion soup so I suggest starting with one of the two (or hey have both).  They also carry Red House Wine that I like a lot.. . The atmosphere is OK but there is something lacking and I cannot put my finger on it. . .I have had horrible service here twice and because of one of these times, my boyfriend will not go back.  I have been back since without him and the service has been so-so.  I like to sit and enjoy my meal - I don't like to be hurried through it but I do not be want to be ignored either. La Creperie cannot really find the happy medium.   I guess I just never felt relaxed here although the decor screams, "hey sit back and take it easy."  If the waitstaff caught up with the restaurant layout, there would be a really great vibe.
