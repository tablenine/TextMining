Five stars for the pastrami sandwich alone. As someone who lived for a decade in NYC,I can say with assurance this is the best one I've ever tried. Not just the meat itself, but the rye is fresh and tasty, and the way they make the sandwich (thick, but no where it's piled so high you can't eat it) make it a must eat.. . If you go on a Wednesday, be sure to try their daily soup: mushroom barley with jiblets. A tasty, hearty, comforting treat on a rare rainy LA day such as this one.
