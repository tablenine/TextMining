A good place for a burger or a salad, I eat lunch there a few times a month. This is not "haute" cuisine but tasty fare, perfect for an informal lunch. The place is very "Chicago" with dark wood and upholstery, making it suitable for modest business lunches. Service is good but a seat at the bar is the best way to get in and out in a hurry if you have little time. The bar looks like a fun place for after-work cocktails but as I don't drink I don't make it in for that.
