Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
this place is ok. sure its cheap and popular but the quality is questionable if you know what i mean. the long lines are usually for the $1.95 tacos w/ shredded beef and cheese...seems to be the staple here. then they have different combinations/varieties of bean and cheese burritos ranging from $3-$5. . try it for yourself if you've never been and i guess you can make up your own mind. . . oh and the advertising they do is horrendous...horrendously amusing. the commercials don't come on often, but they are so cheesy its hilarious.
