This is where the garlic crab I mean "cracked crab", and garlic noodles started, and I must say it isn't "vietnamese" but it defintely is tasty..... . . But expensive!!!!!! I am a snob about my crab since I am from the pacific northwest, and our crab is soooooooooooooo fresh, and delicious.... . .  That the way that they prepared the crab isn't anything that impressive, but seriously if you were raised with the freshest crab caught an hour ago, boiled, fried with spices and served right away, you'd probably complain about a mere 45 bucks too!! but then again when in rome, or when in beverly hills... do what the beverlians do... spend money, shut up and just eat!!!!!!! or not eat hahaha jokes, jokes...... . But seriously, this place is pretty tasty for a crab restaurant, but a star knocked off for being a faux vietnamese restaurant
