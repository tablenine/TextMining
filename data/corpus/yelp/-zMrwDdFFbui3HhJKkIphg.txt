The best Brazilian BBQ joint I've ever been to. Service was impeccable, nice ambiance/decor, and the appetizers (cheese bread) mmm... . . Some of their meats are a bit on the salty side, but if you have a glass of Guarana~ (Brazilian soda) it washes down real nice.. . This is one of the first Brazilian BBQ places that have a good salad bar and they don't use cheapy cheeses or wilted lettuce. Their produce was fresh and their fresh mozzarella, to die for... . We came here for DineLA's Restaurant week, probably the best deals, since they offered their full menu at a discounted rate. . . ::joke time::. . Brunette: "I slept with a Brazilian man last night". Blonde: " YOU SLUT". Brunette: "Huh?". Blonde: "Wait, how many is a Brazilian?"
