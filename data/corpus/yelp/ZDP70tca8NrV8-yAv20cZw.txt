This place is amazing, I've been here twice and will be coming back very soon. I love the setting, everything about it! It looks very intimidating from the outside but the prices are very reasonable with the dining experience you get. I love their clam pizza, portobello fries (spelling?), Clams oreganata, and their calarmari! The pastas are bit bland, try to stay away from those.... the lamb chops were good though. Service is good, sometimes I feel like they don't give me the best service because I look very young and sometimes a lot of teenagers don't tip well, but I always make sure to leave them a 15-20 percent tip because I know how hard the work is being a waiter myself.
