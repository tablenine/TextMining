I am from LA and SF and had lots of Korean BBQ before and I never had Korean BBQ on a hot plate until this place.  I really do like BBQ with the wooden charcoal better but I guess this place makes it up by doing the fried rice with all the left over stuff at the end!!  It was pretty good!. . I am pretty sure they ripped us off since we were a large group (9ppl).   They put us all in a 4 ppl table and gave us one grill.  We were served only 1 round of appetizers and only given 2 bowls of rice.  We had two types of meat that shouldn't have been more than 4 servings.  We also had this very fishy fish which wasn't really good.   We ended up paying $18 each and that's surprising since this is the first time I haven't been stuffed at Korean BBQ.  . . I will go back again but next time in a smaller group.
