I liked this place initially but the only thing that I've enjoyed there was their Chinese food. Once, I got a very disappointing curry and their Japanese food lacks flavor, not in a Japanese sense, I mean the broth doesn't even really have a bonito flavor in their miso soup or anything else for that matter.. . Also, its a bit pricey for the disappointing Thai/Japanese food.. . Positively, the garlic shrimp is AMAZING and I really recommend the bubble teas and Chinese food in general. HOWEVER, the Thai iced tea is MONSTROUSLY GROSS.
