Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Griddle Cafe is easily one of the BEST breakfast places in town. The food there is delicious and the staff and service is also friendly.. . The french toast and 'banana-ana' pancakes are DELICIOUS! They have several varieties of pancakes and french toast and I can't wait to return and try other flavors. . . Their food comes in HUGE portions so make sure you go with an appetite or plan to share.. . Also, if you're going on the weekend, be prepared to wait for a few minutes.
