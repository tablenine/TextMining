I've been to the Sundial quite a few times over the past 30 years. In the beginning (70's and 80's) the food &amp; service was fantastic. Sometime in the 90's I noticed the prices went up (drastically) and the food quality and service went down. Today, I had the pleasure of eating lunch there and was very pleasantly surprised. Lunch prices were not outrageous, the service was impeccable and the food was very delicious. (The grilled four-cheese sandwich was really good!) The view was fantastic, but that goes without saying. . . Currently the outside elevator is being renovated (I imagine along with the complete exterior glass replacement project), but I hear that it will be up and running in the summer.. . All in all, we had a very memorable lunch!
