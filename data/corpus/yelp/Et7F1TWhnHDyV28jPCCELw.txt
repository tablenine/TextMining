Ahh, Gloria's. For me, this is as good as it gets. Every time my fiancee or I get a craving we head from Hollywood all the way to Culver City to eat here. The service is some of the most friendly and accommodating I have ever encountered.  The food is as good as all the reviews say, fresh and tasty.  Given the atmosphere, service and food, I don't think I will find a place I prefer more.
