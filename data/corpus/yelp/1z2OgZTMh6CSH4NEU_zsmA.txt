What is more fun - eating BBQ or BS'ing about where the best BBQ can be found? I'd rather eat great BBQ, but it's easier to find a passionate row. Who's got better BBQ - Texas, The South or Memphis?. . I live in SF, but have been to Fat Matt's a few times (not enough) and it's one of the best by far. Piles of bones and beer - that's how it's done! The place itself (atmosphere) shouldn't be that nice, in fact I'd think less of a BBQ place if it was prim. Give me a weathered and used place with lot's of character, and Fat Matt's has that covered. . . Full Slab, Baked Beans, and a nearly frozen bottle of Beer. Honestly, there are days I'd trade my soul or first born child (note: remove 1st born comment when actually born ;-) ).
