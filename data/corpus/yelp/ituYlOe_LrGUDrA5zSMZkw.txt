So good!  Fans of Vicious Dogs in North Hollywood, and having tried Brats Brothers, we were very excited to visit this sausage haven! Yes, the line was long, but we brought entertaining company. After waiting in the long line, you enter a small room where the grill is working. There they give you your beers and take your sausage order. Turn the corner, and surprise! The atmosphere of a nightclub, complete with a dj and bar. As for the food.... We had some dark German brews... and got the fries (which were awesome!) with the curry ketchup, our favorite, and the chipotle aoili which also rocked. . My bf, the adventurous one, had the rattlesnake and rabbit, and the duck and bacon. He loved them both!. . I had a spicey link.. forgot the name but not nearly as exotic as my mans! Our companions tried the chicken and apple, and the mozzarella and sun dried tomato, and were very happy.. Cant wait to go back... on a weekday!!
