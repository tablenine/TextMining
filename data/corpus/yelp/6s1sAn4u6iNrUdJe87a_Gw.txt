One of the best dining experiences in Atlanta.  I actually received a gift card from a friend, and I have been wanting to try this place for a while.  . . If you want the Top Chef experience of Food-dom, then this is your place.  The menu changes daily, but every item order was just wonderful (the fois-gras was my favorite).  This is the place for special occasions, celebrations and when you want the best.. . Now one of the chefs is on Top Chef:Las Vegas - not a surprise at all, really!
