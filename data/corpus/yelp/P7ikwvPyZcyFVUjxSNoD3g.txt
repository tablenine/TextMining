Oh MetroFresh how I adore your fresh soups and inventive sandwich options.  I really appreciate MetroFresh's vegetarian options and good service. It only gets 4 stars from me because I feel like it's a little more than I like to spend for soup and sandwich-granted, it is a great meal.  The staff is always friendly, the place clean and attractive.  Seating can be a problem in cooler months at the lunchtime hour.
