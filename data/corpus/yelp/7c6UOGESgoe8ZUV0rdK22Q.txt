While it is true that there is often only one waitress servicing the entire bar...the prices cannot be beaten, and the food is good.  Drinks are not overly expensive.  The $4 pizza on Thursday is simply fantasitc.  We made this place a common stomping ground years ago.  The brunch is also very good.  Make sure you get there WELL before you plan to eat.  You will probably need to wait for a table (and the food) if you don't.
