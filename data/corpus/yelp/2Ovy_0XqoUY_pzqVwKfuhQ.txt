I heard this place was pretty expensive for contemporary Chinese food, but I wanted to try it anyway. I've been to Red Light (Asian Fusion place, same owner) which was awesome, so I figured this place would be pretty comparable and worth the extra penny. Unfortunately, I was in for a serious disappointment. I typically do not give a negative review for food that arrives to the table quickly, but I am going to write one for Opera. Our food literally took 6 minutes AND it was cold. This makes me think we got someone else's mistake. My boyfriend had the Slow Roasted Pork Tenderlion--it was cold, dry, and lacking flavor. My Singapore Noodles were also dry. They had some spice to them, but they other than that there was minimal flavor. Not to mention, the portion was much smaller than I was expecting... Â I essentially paid 24 dollars for a dish with four prawns and a fist full of dry noodles. . . I do have to say, if you're looking for a restaurant with a great dining atmosphere, then this would be the place. It's super cute--in an eclectic kind of way. . . All in all, I'd probably give them 4 stars for the ambiance and one star for the food. But who knows, maybe we just ordered the wrong things or dined in on an off night?? I wish I could say I had the money to give them another shot, but at this point I'd rather not take that risk. I'll take my money to Red Light and have the Salmon and Soba Noodles instead :)
