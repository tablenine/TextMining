din tai fung.. i always need my XLB fixes every now and then.. even though i live in the OC,i NEED them once in a while so i would drive 1 hour just to eat these babies.. usually, i order:. . - appetizer (funny b/c on the menu it really is called appetizer and if you never went there then you wouldn't know what in the world it was), which is basically like a cold salad dish (bean sprouts,carrots,and this other yummy stuff. . -juicy pork dumplings (XLBs). to die for. . -crab and pork dumplings (LOVE'EM!). . -tan tan noodles. . -spicy beef noodle soup. . -pork fried rice. . basically, i am trying to state that i've basically came here enough times to try almost everything on the . http://menu.hahaha.be. lieve me, once you've tried this place, you will NEVER get away from it.the price is still rather reasonable.i dont want to sound like a fatass, but a typical bill for my bf and i would come out to be about $50 haha.the wait can be long at times if you have a large party,but if you only have 2 ppl you'll probably wait like 15 min. and once you get seated and order, things come . http://FAST.it. s kind of like speed eating haha.. . overall,i highly suggest this place to EVERYONE i know.. . this place is an asian franchise.i haven't been to any of the other ones in asia, but my parents went to the one in hong kong and said it was the best service they've ever had at a restaurant.
