i would give it a 3.5 if i could, but they were open on July 4th.  The food was good, but it wasn't $65 a person good.  i'd say it was more towards the $40 pricepoint.  the grilled ribeye is very good, the halibut and the scallops were good, but like i said, not $65 good.. . the ambiance was really romantic.  this is a total date place for sure.  the service is very prompt and the coconut cheesecake was an excellent ending.
