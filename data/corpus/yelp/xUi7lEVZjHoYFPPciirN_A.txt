I LOVE me some Indian food.  And I worked closely with 2 Indians, who helped nurture my love for all things traditional as well.  So, that said...this place is not traditional, but they do some great interpretations.  . . The Tandoori chicken was the best tandoori I've ever tasted.  Sometimes the traditional tastes a little burnt or dry or can be a little too parts is parts.  Not here.  It was super juicy, flavorful and good quality meat (we chose both light and dark).  I seriously am craving it already.  The Samosas were awesome, just the right amount of spice.  We also tried the bindi chaat fry (eh), spring mutter paneer (awesome), the saag aloo (ok), mashed potato aloo (woohoo!) and the chicken tikka masala (lovely).  For naans we had goat cheese (yum) and mushroom (just ok).  . . They have super fun drinks too...unexpected herbs and spices.  Can't remember the names, but they were all good.    . . Definitely go here to try some new and interesting takes on Indian cuisine.
