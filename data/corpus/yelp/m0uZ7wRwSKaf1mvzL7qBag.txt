This place is not overrated one bit!! All of the legends are true...they do have the best chicken and waffles ever!  . . What an award-winning combination the fried chicken and double waffles are.  As far as the waffles go...I can honestly say they are the best waffles I've ever had.  I used to love the pecan waffles from Waffle House, but these waffles beat them in every way.  They have a cinnamon hint to it that's just to die for.  I love that they're double-stacked and come with lots of butter.. . The chicken is crispy on the outside, soft chicken on the inside, and really the perfect compliment to the sweet and hot waffles.  The place is so very cozy and gives you that southern hospitality feel.  I came here for breakfast and had one of those great meals that I'll probably tell my grand kids about.
