The meat is not always cooked perfectly, but either way, you're leaving there happily full! :) Personally, I prefer the lamb and the pork dip... and I spread a very slight hint of the mustard! I go here when I'm in the "I'm so hungry I can eat a cow" mood! The lines are intimidating at first, but here's a trick: stand there and look at all the lines, and see which one is the shortest! It's seems so obvious, but most people still just go to the nearest line, which is the one by each door! There's also lines in the middle! ;) Cute decor, and very historic! And their coleslaw is my personal favorite, tied with Bandera's coleslaw on the West Side! It's THAT good.
