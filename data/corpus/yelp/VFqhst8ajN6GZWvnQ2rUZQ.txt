Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Although I got really sick before I finished my hot dog (through no fault of Pink's!  I was already not feeling well, and I assume a chilli-dog didn't help), Pink's hot dogs lived up to my expectations.  I live in San Diego, and my husband and I drove up to meet a friend who suggested we all go to Pink's so we can catch up while standing in line.  It was a perfect idea.  The hot dogs were nothing fancy or out of the ordinary, but they were very good.  So good in fact, that I ate mustard (and I thought I hated mustard).  The line was an hour and a half long, so it was perfect for us to all meet up and catch up on what's been going on this summer.  They have hot dogs with funny names like "rosie o'donnell dog", and you can get anything on it that they have.  It was a lot of fun.  I would go back to Pink's for sure, as long as I wasn't already hungry.  Go when you are about to be hungry in about an hour, then stand in line and have friends with you to keep you company.  It really is a package experience, and it's something you can do as a tourist that isn't so hollywood where it seems you can find real people of LA also.  If you're in the area, try Pink's Hot Dogs, and I'm pretty sure you'll be back for more.
