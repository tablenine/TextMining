Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
The sushi here is great. I'm a Chicago native, so I am used to somewhat rubbery fish in my sushi, but everything at Tank tasted really fresh. . . I ordered the 9 piece combo, and for me the ultimate test was the octopus. Even when its fresh, octopus is very chewy, and when you get a bad piece it's like chewing an old piece of shoe. Happily, the octopus at Tank was delicious, and I didn't feel like I was gnawing on a pair of Chuck Taylors.. . Others have mentioned the high prices, but I didn't find them unreasonable. I go to Tokyo Marina all the time, and I think Tank's prices were a couple dollars more at most, but everything tasted much fresher. I'm happy to pay a premium to avoid the after effects of eating old sushi.. . I'm giving it 4 stars because the restaurant is loud, and it can be really hard to hear over the din of other diners and the avant garde Japanese flute music being piped over the speakers. Our waiter had trouble hearing our orders, I felt bad for him.. . I will definitely be going back, especially to try out the half price rolls on the weekend. Best of all, they have those fancy paper towels in the bathroom. It feels like you're drying your hands with a belgian waffle. High class!
