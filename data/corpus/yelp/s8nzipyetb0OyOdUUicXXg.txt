Chicken and rice, how hard can that be? It was good, although paying the extra $2 for dark meat wasn't worth it.  The sauces that came along with it definitely added some BAM to the traditional dish.  Drinks are also good here, free refill on ice tea and the chrysanthemum tea was BOMB.  The service is great, the waitresses do a good job refilling drinks and sauces if you're running low.  . . Also, they take CASH ONLY.  Don't risk taking your date here if you're paying by CARD, you'll look dumbfounded in front of your lady and waitresses.  I saw a couple that did exactly that, felt bad for the girl who had to pay for the date.  . . I think Anthony Bourdain should pay tribute to Hainam Chicken, location: SGV.  The dish looks like the one he exactly had in Singapore.  Will come back soon. =)
