Restaurant: Delicatessen
Category: American (New)
This is my second visit to Delicatessen, the first being for the lounge, which was visually appealing, as is the restaurant however the music was a touch too loud, and the cocktail waitress awful, as she refused to go upstairs to get me a draft beer... but they did have some tasty munchies and cocktails so i went back... . . I got the fried chicken in a bucket and it was finger licking good... I would give the lounge a 2 Star... but I am really focusing on the restaurant/food so they get a 4.
