Great burgers! I have been here a few times and just remembered that I forgot to Yelp! But, A+ burgers! I had the Spicy Turkey burger that was on special for this day and it was amazing! Tasted like heaven in my mouth! Even though we showed up on a day when they were out of every beverage except tap water and the one burger that my boyfriend wanted, we were still happy.. . We have had the following burgers. In the order of my favorite first.... . Truffle Burger. Spicy Turkey . Hatch Burger. Port &amp; Stilton Burger. So Cal Burger. . Sides:. Mmmmm Hand Cut fries. Mmmmm Onion Rings. . Dessert:. Ice Cream Sandwich (holiday flavor! mmm). HoHo thingy, eh, it was okay. . Great place! it is a must!
