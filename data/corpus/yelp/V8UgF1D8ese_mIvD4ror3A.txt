Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Man o' man do I ever regret being lazy to come here. 7 attempts since I've moved to Eagle Rock have I lagged on visiting our neighboring city of Â Pasadena, home of Roscoe's Chicken &amp; waffles. Finally made it in during that lil storm we had going on a week or so ago. . . My buddy Jeremy &amp; I get the #13. The Cecille Special or something which included "a suculant breast" &amp; a waffle. I also ordered a side of biscuits &amp; gravy. Jeremy being a usual got an order of macaroni &amp; cheese with cornbread just for me to try. . . The wait wasn't so bad, wasn't too busy but I do recommend calling if you intend on just coming in to pick up. 2 couples were there for a good 25 mins just waiting. Might as well sit down to a meal like this. The chicken was fried perfectly, waffle was awesome. Great combo of sweet &amp; savory. Biscuits &amp; gravy are addictive. Mac &amp; Cheese was really good but I hate to say I was dissapointed with the cornbread. it was dry and just dry. I was surprised considering everything else. I'm going to keep coming back though, beer is also served on the premisis. I'm sold!
