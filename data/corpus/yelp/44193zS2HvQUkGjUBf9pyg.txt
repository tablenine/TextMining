Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Well, I got talked in going back to Ugo for gelato and the gelato was good. The staff was very nice and attentive this visit. I got a huge serving too. Could barely fit in the cup it was so much so I ate it quickly because it was gonna melt on me if I didn't. Had two flavors and they were both good. Still don't recommend this place for breakfast though. That sucked big time. So with this past really good visit and the first sucky one I'm upping my rating to three stars from one.
