My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our 4 year anniversary here and were pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere.  After surveying Ami's atmosphere, we decided Yamato seemed more appealing.  We arrived at 5PM, just in time for their happy hour, and were pleased to see the 50% off menu.. Let me tell you first off that my boyfriend &amp; I are NOT big sushi goers.  We've gone to fancy sushi restaurants (namely Tamon's Sushi Lounge in Little Tokyo) and HATED it.. But, Yamato is worthy of 5 stars for the following reasons:. 1. Excellent variety of rolls to choose from, raw or cooked.  The baked lobster roll is amazing, and I personally liked the crunchy roll even better.. 2. The price at happy hour is unbelievable.  Our bill was well under $30 for 2 people after 3 orders + a large hot sake.  Expect specialty rolls to be around $6-$7, and regular rolls are just $3-$4.. 3. The service was excellent.  I forget our waiter's name, but he was incredibly helpful in informing us of what rolls were delicious &amp; cheap.  We were provided with the bill promptly after finishing our last dish.. . VERY happy with the service, food, and prices.
