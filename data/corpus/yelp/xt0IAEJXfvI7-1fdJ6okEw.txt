Started with mussels, which should have been simple but the sauce was over salted and had some cream or other thickener added which overcomplicated the appetizer. My margarita was undrinkably sweet and I sent it back. That is probably only the second or third drink I can ever recall sending back. The bar couldn't replace it with a Dark and Stormy because they had no Ginger beer, okay fair enough, but then still couldn't do a Mojito because they had no mint. No mint? Really? A full service bar in mid June with no mint. Okay. I finally settled for what turned out to be a weak gin and tonic. Had the black bean and jalapeño ravioli and was thoroughly underwhelmed. Lots of cream, butter and salt but nothing distinguishing.  Utterly bland. My dates barbecued salmon was equally bland. Smothered in what the menu boasted as Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Sweet Baby Rays is on par with Kraft in my book and not something I'd disclaim in the menu. The corn impregnated pancakes the fish was served over we decent. My side dish of spinach was forgotten and when arrived later it was inedible. Once again over-salted, more boiled than sautéd and tasted of rot honestly. As if it was on the verge of spoiling and then over cooked to avoid wasting. Finally our caramel gelato was sickeningly sweet, the corn syrup and sugar almost making my teeth hurt. The only things saving them from one star being the courteous and attentive service. I don't expect we'll be back anytime soon.
