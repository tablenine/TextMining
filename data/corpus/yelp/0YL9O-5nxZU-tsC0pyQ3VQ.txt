Went last week with a group of friends.  Could have done withhout the $12 cover, but the girls really enjoyed their champagne.  I stuck with beer, as I only really like dom and kris, but I'm not wealthy.  I ordered the lobster quesadillas (very good) and some sort of garlic and pesto death pizza (still good).  This would be a great place to take my wife if I ever land in the dog house and need to get out (I love you baby!!).  But if I'm over in that neighborhood, I'd probably hit Matilda's instead.
