We had dinner here on Tuesday and the wait wasn't as bad as we thought.  We had the infamous pork/crab XLB, shrimp and pork shiaomai, pork buns, some kind of soup I forget the name of, and 8 flavor rice as dessert.  Yum!  Everything we tried was good, thanks to my very knowlegeable Chinese friend.  It's a bit pricey, but worth the money in my opinion.
