In downtown it is rare to find such a gem of a place. The high ceilings and bright lights make you feel like you are in a living, vibrant city. The wait was atrocious, but good wine, and a place people watch we found ourselves passing the hour and a half without it FEELING like an hour and a half. . The shitake mushroom fries are a MUST TRY!!!! they were AMAZING. I would recommend having pizza somewhere KNOWN for pizza, but if you are waiting to eat pizza at midnight, I don't think it matters much!!!
