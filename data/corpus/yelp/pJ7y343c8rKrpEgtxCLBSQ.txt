Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
The beer garden is large and should be the motivator for going to Moody's.  I don't recommend going during cold weather as the inside is dark and poorly ventilated. . The burgers are so-so and the beer selection limited.  Pitchers are priced well at $9 for Anchor Steam and Berghoff, but service can be slow.
