Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Toast far exceeded my expectations and so did Jill, our charming, excellent server.  The place was packed and since Jill works the front counter I guess you can say  shes the gatekeeper, and a great one at that.  As busy as they were Jill still made me feel like her only guest.  They might seem to have a rules, and won't hesitate to tell you to stick with the program, but with food that great and energy that fun they have the science to keeping it running like the well oiled machine  that it is.
