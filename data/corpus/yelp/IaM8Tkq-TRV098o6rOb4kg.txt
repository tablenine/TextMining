I have only had a few things from here (not because I've only been a few times but because the things I've had have been so good I just keep ordering them) and they've all been amazing! It all started when my boyfriend ordered me a vegan strawberry cake from here for my birthday. The cake is SO moist with a whipped cream icing and fresh strawberries in the center and a strawberry puree on top. I've also had a raspberry tart here and it was incredible. Everytime I visit there is a line to the door of people getting lunch and picking up desserts. I have yet to try their lunch menu but I definitely want to because I'm sure it is as good as everything else they serve. . Give Southern Sweets a try, it's the best bakery I've had in Atlanta thus far.
