Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Simple and to the point. The fish tacos are great and the price is most definitely right. Pour on the magic sauce and chow. I always have a unique experience here--what with the wily owner and all-- and the latest one was when I asked for a Sprite and the old lady working the register (the owner's mom maybe?) asked me Â "Do you see any over my shoulder?". . "Yeah, right there" I point.. . "Ok then". . Love it.
