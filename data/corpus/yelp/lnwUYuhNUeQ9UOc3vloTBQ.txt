After all the hype about this place being awesome and then trying the food, I came to the conclusion that people in LA are just plain stupid.. . It was just whatever. I ordered one of everything and each dish tasted tepid. The worst was the spicy pork which had no depth of flavor to it. God, I swear, you people in LA are retards. As a matter of fact, maybe I will open my own freaking kalbi truck and monopolize everything. But then again, I will probably fail like every other wannabe kalbi truck out there.. . NYC FOR THE WIN
