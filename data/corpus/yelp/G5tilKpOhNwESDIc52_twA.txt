A great place to visit. At least once in your life.. . Food was decent, I had the lamb and it was cooked very well. It had a great jalapeno gelee that came with it. Side dishes were pretty generic, steamed veggies and mash. . . Shows were all great. First one was a comedy/magic had me cracking up the whole time. I'm not big on the 'mind control' magic though.
