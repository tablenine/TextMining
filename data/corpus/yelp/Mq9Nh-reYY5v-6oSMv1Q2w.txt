Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've lived in the LA area for almost 40 years and never once tried a Pink' s hot dog. So I had a day off last week and drove over there, traffic sucked so Im thinking this better be one good hot dog, but just what hot dog can taste that good? Anyway, I get there right after they opened and the dinning area is already half taken. I ordered a Bacon Chili Cheese that had 3 pieces of under cooked bacon and a regular chili cheese dog and a coke. Im thinking, the bacon is undercooked since they just opened maybe? The chili reminds me of Tommys, the meat was ok, overall it was just OK. Go there if you live close to it or have time to kill otherwise, Tommys hot dog is just a good.
