My husband and I went here for dinner on a whim. We live nearby and meant to try it several times before, and finally made it in. We were seated right away and our server came over quickly to get our drink order. I had the Ruby Grapefruit, which they make with an in-house infused vodka. It was really delicious, even without the sugar rim the menu described. . . Looking over the menu, we each found two or three items we had a hard time choosing amongst. Everything looked so good! I finally settled on the veggie calzone and my husband had the arrabiatta pizza with both shrimp and sausage. When my calzone came out, I noticed that they forgot to put the cheese in it. When I brought it to their attention, not only did they rush to fix the error, but they also made me a brand new one to take home for no charge. I was excited because it was really delicious, and now I had an extra one to eat for lunch at work the next day too. . . The atmosphere is a little confused -- they had an odd mix of music on that didn't quite fit the space, and I could do without the big televisions over the bar at my organic eatery, but neither of these is glaring enough for me to deduct a star because the food and the service are both amazing.
