Restaurant: Sushi Go 55
Category: Sushi Bars
I miss living in Los Angeles for the sole reason of Sushi Go 55!. . I lived in Japan for a year, and while yes, the sushi was better there, this is by far the best place I've come across in America.. . From the warm, family-like waitresses and the hilarious sushi chefs (I remember being appalled that the scallops were still alive and moving and the chef just let out this hearty "HHAHAHHA!! My pet!" and patted down on the big clam like it was indeed his little pet.) to the extensive menu filled with both American and traditional Japanese sushi and sashimi, this is a place to enjoy and visit often. . . The quality is superb and the selection is quite extensive. I used to take people here all the time, including grandma, dates, friends, and teachers.. . The price can add up, as quality sushi tends to do, but it's nicer to your wallet than most sushi places in LA.. . Enjoy for me, since I'm up here in Sacramento now!
