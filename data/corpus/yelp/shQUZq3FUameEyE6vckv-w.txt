Double-dipped beef sandwich with a side of potato salad and lemonade. . . The place is always filled with throngs of people, and it is easy to see that good food attracts people like bees to a beehive. At first glance, you would wonder why a slab of meat between two pieces of bread deserves so much fame and popularity. However, once you've tried the sandwich, double-dipped, you'll be constantly thinking about how delicious and mouth-watering it is. . . I hear the pork is also very tasty. Also, if you spread the potato salad on the sandwich before taking a bite, it gives a nice contrast between hot and cold.
