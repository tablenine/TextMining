I love thai food and my favorite is Tom Kha soup, which they have a white version instead of reddish that I am used to, still good, but not my favorite. This place is always crowded which makes sense because it has other dishes that are very good. The Spring Rolls are very good and so is the Pad Thai, service is decent, I think I have only had one time when I had a problem.
