Yeah, ahhhhhhhh no...... . . Mindless hype if you ask me. Dawgs weren't good considering all the love this place gets. Although they are dirt cheap and come with under cooked fries. . . The thing that bothered me the most was the ridiculous amount of trash all over the parking lot. Just tons of it. Everywhere. I realize this is because of the morons who eat in their cars and just toss their garbage out the window rather then get their fat asses out for 30 seconds to walk to one of the many garbage cans. (was that a run on sentence??) But it was 2 AM, there were only 5 customers inside, and literally 10-12 employees behind the counter. I understand they get slammed cause they are so popular (still not sure why), but when it's super slow can't someone go outside and clean up the lot that their product has created?? 12 people are needed to make 5 hot dogs?? Who ya crappin?!?!?! . . Portillos hot dogs beat the hell out of this place....
