The Swirl drink (Sangria + Margarita)  and the Margarita are both delicious!  I will definitely go back for happy hour.. . Their fajitas and steak are really good as well.  Juicy meat, good guacamole, delicious salsa...   . . I'd recommend it to Mexican food enthusiasts!. . Only flaw is no reservations...
