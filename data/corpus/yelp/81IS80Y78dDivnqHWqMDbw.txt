Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
For all the guys out there who couldn't make an omelette to save their lives, Alcove is the perfect place to treat a special someone to breakfast after a special night. Most of the reviews have focussed on the atmosphere at Alcove and with it being as charming as it is, I can understand why. It's not without reason it's always so crowded. The food, however, is worhty in its own right. As seems to be the case with most such cafes, breakfast and dessert are the stars here, but their sandwiches are quite good too. They have my favorite egg salad in Los Angeles and the grilled salmon sandwich is very nice as well. Both are good enough to warrant ordering them for take-out even if you can't stay for the ambiance. It's pretty hard not to love Alcove.
