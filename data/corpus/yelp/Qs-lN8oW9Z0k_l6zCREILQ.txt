Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
MM mmm chicken and waffles :) so deee-licious. . Came here a handful of times and always left with a full happy tummy! Every time I either order Scoe's number 1 or Scoe's number 2 and I was never disappointed. The chicken here is great, juicy, and hot. Their waffles though, are to die for. They give you two incredibly fluffy waffles the size of your head with syrup and butter and I think is just my favorite part of my meal! The gravy here is yummy too. . . Even though these chicken and waffle meals are artery cloggers on a plate, it is still absolutely delicious and the amount of food they five you always either leave you full or with left overs. Worth the money I guess you can say. . . The workers are nice here and the atmosphere is just a laid back diner but it is actually kind of hard to flag down a waiter here most of the time compared to all the roscoe's I've been to.. . Great place to get your grub on :P Waffles are the bomb, its a must get :O)
