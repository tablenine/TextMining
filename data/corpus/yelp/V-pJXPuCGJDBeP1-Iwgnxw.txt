Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
What can I say about this place other than what other Yelpers have already mentioned. This place is awesome. I know this bakery since 1998. This was when the bakery was only known for the cheese rolls. Cheese rolls were less than 1 dollar. This place has amazing finger foods such as cheese rolls, croquet, and the guava cheese rolls.. . Everytime I'd go to this place, calling 2 of my friends are a must. Also when they go to Porto's, calling us is a given ^_^ ..!!, We have a mutual understanding to call each other (because this bakery is so damn far from Orange County).. . I wish they'd make another store in Orange County. But for now, I'd drive to burbank for their cheese rolls :)
