Category: Asian Fusion
I visited Doc's for lunch last Fiday. Whenever I'm in the area it's high on my list. The space is small and half of the tables are outside. (covered) Everything is always very fresh which is what I like.... especially the Basil rolls and lettuce wrapsThe biggest negative point for me is that the food is not spicy enough. I like to sweat!
