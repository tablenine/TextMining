Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza

What's the big deal with this place?. . My secret to getting in without a reservation: show up during daylight hours and tell them you don't mind waiting for a spot at the bar.  20 minutes later, I was in!. . Anyway, I was curious to try Mario Batali's famous pizzeria; but unfortunately found it to be nothing special.  I'm sure his pizza is delicious when he's making it, but in this case, he's not.  Regular guys are behind the counter following a set of instructions, yes using great ingredients and recipes, but all without special attention and care.  I ordered a pizza with leeks, it was just okay, too much oil.. . Why is Pizzeria Mozza exciting: well I guess because it's Batali's, supposably hard to get into, and for it's interesting ingredients.. . I left spending under $20, not bad!
