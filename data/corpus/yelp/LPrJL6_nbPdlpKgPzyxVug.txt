I was expecting alot, I must admit it. It has a weird theme, (some parts felt like a persian theme with the covers) to it and it is in a very nice part of LA. Service was great and b/c i drink like a camel i love that they leave a water pitcher for you. The garlic butter was ok, but as i said it was REALLY REALLY hyped up for me. i had the garlic basted prime rib and it was really good, but i didn't scream for joy and excitement. The prices are way above average so expect to pay a decent amount, but its expected in this neighborhood with Lawry's down the street. Its an ok location and would only come once ina while as there are many many locations in la that i'd rather go to.
