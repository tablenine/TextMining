The best onion rings ! Huge and yummy ! Last time I was there I had the grilled salmon salad - delicious. . . After our meal we had coffee and dessert.. Delicious desserts -  a white cake with purple frosting - I think blueberry. I've had one of their their chocolate cakes before as well. Big enough for two servings.. . I enjoy the outdoor atmosphere and sitting outside at the tables. Very relaxed. An enjoyable way to spend the afternoon.
