I'd probably give this place 2 1/2 stars, but I couldn't muster up a full 3.. . Here's why:. - Way overpriced. - Jack's Pizza is right down the street (and way better). - Small portions. - "B" rated health inspection (gross). . Pros:. - Great service. . After hearing rave reviews, we decided to try Fritti and it was generally meh.  I had a shrimp and diver scallop salad which was definitely lacking something.  Generally very bland.  Wine was overpriced.  Pizza was pretty good (can't remember the name), but not phenom and small for the price ($14). . . I feel like they jack the prices up to seem more high-brow than they really are. Go there if you want decent food at an outrageous price.
