I guess their lobster dish is very popular because I saw it on almost every table.  The lobster can be prepared several ways, I remember the menu listed the ginger-scallion flavor and the plainly steamed. Judging by the name, Newport style is their signature preparation. We hesitated because they showed a chilly pepper icon next to the menu item and we had children who did not like spicy hot food. We asked the waiter if we could order the Newport lobster without the hot pepper. He said no problem. We also ordered their French style beef steak cubes sans hot peppers.  . . The dishes came out in around 3 minutes. The lobster was wonderful, the sauce was very tasty and not spicy at all.  The restaurant serves lobster in 3 sizes: small, medium and large at $14.99 per pound. The small lobster is around 5 lbs. On our bill, it showed 4.5 lb, and it came to like $60 something just for that dish.. . The beef was very tender and the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but since we ordered the dish without pepper, I am sure it was not how the original dish tasted like.. . Bring a few friends so that you can share the cost of the lobster. If you are a lobster lover, two persons can finish a 5 lb lobster with no problem because the shell weighs a bit too.
