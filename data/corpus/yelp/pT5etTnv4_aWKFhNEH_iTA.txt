Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
This restaurant is great in all aspects: Food, Atmosphere, Service, and even Value!.. . The show fee is $25, but you can have it waived if you can get your member friend to show up. Bring money for the valet as well. In fact it would be in your best interest to visit their website before going so that you do not encounter any surprises!. . The food is pretty darn good. I highly recommend the "Steak Milton" it is a Crab Meat topped Filet Mignon that just melts in your mouth. Ask about their daily specials too as they are very good. Depending on what you order most of the food is very reasonable!. . The whole staff is incredibly nice and helpful. A lot of times you can run into magicians that will give you their card so that you can get passes for future visits.. . It is best to go during the week, as with any place in Southern California the place is packed on weekends. By going during the week you will be able to catch more shows. The magic shows are great. I love the close up magicians the best. Sometimes the main show can feature hokey magicians like the gal that performed last time I went. She was officially the worst magician ever. I felt like she was insulting my intelligence because her tricks and execution were so bad!. . They do not allow cameras inside the Castle, which is understandable because they want to maintain an air of mystery about the place. Get there early. You don't have to get there right before your dinner reservation. If you show up as soon as they open you can start exploring the castle, have a few drinks, and get into more shows.. . I as well as every friend I have ever brought here has felt like a kid again while spending time here!
