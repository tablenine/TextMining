I've been avoiding Yelp for a while for fear of getting addicted and given the hours I work, that's not a good thing.  That being said, this was the first place that I went to based on reading Yelp reviews and it was excellent.. . This is a great date restaurant.  Be forewarned that the servings are very large and this is coming from someone who can eat a lot of food.  The only negative thing here was the fact the wine is in pretty cheap looking glasses.  Sorry, I'm not a snob, but I don't want to drink wine on a date with glasses that look like they were previously incarnated as tea glasses at a bus stand in my homeland.
