Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Delicious food and Thai Elvis? Someone pinch me because I must be dreaming. Palms Thai is the one place I always want to go to when I come to LA. . If Elvis has left the building, you can hear the love ballad lady, Thai John Denver or the Armenian Frank Sinatra.. Last time I was there we ordered a TON of food and the bill was incredibly low considering. Awesome.
