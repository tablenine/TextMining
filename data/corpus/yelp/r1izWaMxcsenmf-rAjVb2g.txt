Restaurant: Cafe Sunflower Buckhead
Category: Vegetarian
I adore this place! I wish I was a stray cat living behind the kitchen for scraps (though I highly doubt there is much food left on the plates). I visited the Sunflower Cafe for the first time a week short of a year ago for my birthday and I immediately fell in love. The atmosphere is light, the food is to die for, and the staff is very friendly (even if a  little overzealous at times). But the thing I love most: the dessert. You could not even begin to believe they are vegan,but after stealing their secret ingredient (Willow's Run "butter") I can see why! I recommend this place to everyone I know, but I think they just want me to shut up about it now.  However, I'm returning next week to get the best vegan/vegetarian cuisine around.. . Recommended dishes: Sunflower Box, jambalaya(this might have been a temporary dish,I'm not sure though), and the chocolate peanut butter mousse cake.. . Cons: The dinner menu is a little wallet-bending, so I'd say for first-timers try for lunch (Watch out! They close after 2:30 for lunch.) so you can decide if it is worth it (Of course it is!). .
