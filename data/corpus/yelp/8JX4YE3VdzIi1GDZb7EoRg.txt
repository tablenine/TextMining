I went to college with a lot of guys who liked to wear designer jeans and button downs and whip out their cell phones at any opportunity so they could publicly pad their image.  These were mostly the frat types and those who orbited around the frat types.  . . Ford's possesses this same mindset.  All image, no substance.. . We came late on a Friday night, after a movie.  Boyfriend and I were drawn to the tea-lit tables.  It looked fun.  People looked happy.  Glasses clinked.  People were drinking.  It was loud.  It conjured up a fratty vibe. . . We were seated outside at one of the tea-lit tables we had initially eyed.  The wine list had some pricey options--it turned me off.  And the menu just wasn't...calling to us.  There really was nothing on there we wanted to eat.  Granted, it was too late to put down a steak and mashed potatoes but still: we felt we had limited options.  Boyfriend got a plate of meat and I got a plate of cheese and then we had to pay for bread.  Who pays for bread?  It wasn't any next-to-godliness bread.  The Fords Frat Party was looking lamer and lamer.. . I can't really complain about my plate of cheese and boyfriend can't really complain about his plate of meat.  These aren't things that warrant complaints.  Good meat and cheese.  But I can complain about the overpriced menu full of wannabe dishes from a restaurant that wants to run with the big boys on 3rd and Melrose and Beverly.  . . Ford's Frat Party is like that big ass party--the beach party, the 70's party, the Pimps and Ho's crap--everyone is talking about, everyone gets hyped up for, everyone makes accommodations for (new top to wear, carves out a Friday night for it, etc) and then gets there and realizes that ultimately, frat parties are lame.
