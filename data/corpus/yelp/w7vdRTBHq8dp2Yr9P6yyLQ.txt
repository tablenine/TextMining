Based on almost 200 reviews, most of which are 4 or 5 stars, I'll just have to accept that I'm the one with the problem.. . When I go out for a dinner or drinks, I hope to get just that.  I'm not looking to see or be seen.  . . And I don't like having to push my way through a line 5 deep at the bar to try desperately to get an over priced semi decent drink.. . If you could clear out the army of famous/wanna be famous/wanna meet someone famous people that seem to migrate here, then I would give this place another chance.
