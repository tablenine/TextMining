in a nutshell, underwhelming, but if you choose to read here it is.... . Tried this place for fathers day- we were under the impression that th western theme would work well for dad who is a big fan of the cowboy/western stuff. We went for brunch.. I ordered a bloody Mary which was great-the only impressive thing about the experience on whole. We were also not disappointed by the squash blossom flat bread, though for the value it seemed really overpriced. For brunch, I ordered the brisket hash with potatoes and  fennel. I guess I was expecting a brisket version of corned beef hash, but what I got was very different, and I dare say hugely disappointing. My $15 plate of food came with about eight half-inch cubes of brisket- three of which ended up being solid fat and inedible. It was mixed in with a very greasy version of breakfast potatoes, but instead of tasty stuff like onions or pepper, it had slightly undercooked fennel. it was topped with sunny-side up eggs and two crostini which were the most flavorful things on the plate. The most egregious issue with my food however, was the mound (literally)  of wilted, undressed frisee stuck on top of my eggs....it was gross. They could have tossed it with a spicy mustard vinaigrette and it would have been fine- but as it was, I would have preferred a tacky 50s garnishing of Curly Parsley.. The service was ok- our server was a young guy-friendly, though perhaps not the brightest bulb in the pack. When our alcohol arrived, I requested a glass of water (not unusual, though I did find it odd they didn't bring water automatically) what was unusual is that the server brought me a cup of boiling hot water....WTF?
