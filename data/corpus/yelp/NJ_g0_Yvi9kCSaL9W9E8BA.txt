Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
Once you manage to find this place, you will think that it came to you in some sort of vision or dream - can there really be a Cuban restaurant smack dab in the middle of a completely residential neighborhood?  No, you're making that up.  For those of us in the know, what a wonderful piece of knowledge it is.  I had been coming here for years.  Then I had some sort of horrific head injury and decided to move to San Francisco.  On a recent trip back home, I brought my fiance and Mommy to Las Palmeras to see if it was as fantastic as I remembered.  Of course Mommy, who went to Grady high school, thought the location sounded a little odd.  After my insane build up of the place, even I was getting nervous.  It turns out that it is still completely fantastic.   So f*ing delicious that on our way out of the neighborhood I found myself looking at houses for sale and considering buying one just to be closer to the place.  It is that good!  . . My personal favorite is the first vegetarian combo dish: yucca, moros, and sweet plantains.  A plate sent directly from heaven.  And coming out of the mouth of an atheist, that is saying a lot.   Mommy and my fiance both had chicken dishes, which they both loved.  As my fiance said, "I want to go hug the chef."   . . Las Palmeras is going on the list with Harmony and the Flying Biscuit of restaurants that I absolutely must eat at every time I visit Atlanta.
