If this is LA's version of a beer garden, keep it.  Ordered a dunkle, asked for orange.  Sorry, no. How about a lemon?  Negative. Got the reply that we have no fruit...period.  Hmmmm.  And the fact that they had a HIp Hop-Clubby DJ, and trendsters galore in house...not sure I need to go there again....unless I'm looking for desperate wannabe fräuleins.
