Maybe I'm just a fat guy trapped in a little man's body, but I had no problem finishing their combo dish.    . . Daikokuya is my cherry popper for ramen, definitely a great place to do it.  Not only that but, during our wait for a seat I got in an episode of Law and Order via the 19 inch TV in the front.  Not sure what they're gonna do when TV goes digital.. . The Ramen was good and I know I'll catch heat for this but, something about that brown egg just rubbed me the wrong way.  I attempted to eat it in order not to offend anyone, but the brown color just bothered me, so there it sat, in my soup taunting me.  I poked it around a few time but it just wasn't happening.  Maybe next time, you stupid brown egg!   I loved the iced green tea and the tuna my roomie ordered looked great too.
