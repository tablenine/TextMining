Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
I'm still not sure what to think about this place. I didn't extremely enjoy it, nor did I hate it. It was simply OK.. . Most of the sauces were rather bland. I couldn't stand the sweet and sour. Peanut sauce was really delicious. The bowl of noodles with beef wasn't too bad, but the beef wasn't very flavorful. Everything ended up tasting a bit like the sauce instead of having varying flavors.. . They have different fancy drinks, but expect to pay as much for a Margarita as you will for your entire bowl of noodles. I went here on a date and for 2 Beers, 1 Margarita, an order of Vietnamese Spring Rolls and 2 bowls of Noodles it was $36 before tip. It seemed a bit too pricey for what it was.. . Next time I'll just order a bowl of noodles and call it a day.
