Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Taste is exactly what you want every restaurant to be.. . -Friendly hostesses who squeeze you in early on a Saturday night?  Check.. -Surprisingly reasonably priced food, especially for that part of town?  (Neither of our entrees topped $20l in fact most of the menu choices were under $20!) Check.. -Lots of tasty and not-unhealthy options...creative cooking that doesn't rely on heavy ingredients?  An abundance of fantastic choices on the menu? Check!  (By the way, it isn't a huge menu or anything.  It's clearly a smallish but fantastic repertoire.  I appreciate a restaurant that doesn't try to be all things to all people, which is what makes this place exactly that: a carefully selected menu of fantastic choices that could appeal to anyone.). -Really well-structured wine list with surprisingly reasonable choices?  Check.. -Good service, including perpetually filling my water, which always impresses the hell out of me, especially when I happen to be really thirsty?  Check.. -Deeeeeelicious food?  Check!  I had a marvelous curried chicken breast with quinoa and it was phenomenal.  MOist and fantastic.  My friend had a fantastic cumin pork chop cooked to perfection, with PERFECT carmelization on the outside.  Seriously some fantastic pork.. -Lovely cute venue with a really interesting layout, and none of the tables piled on top of each other?  -Check!. . And although we didn't try any, the dessert menu looked fantastic.. . Look, it's just the perfect little place to have dinner when you want to go somewhere lovely and impressive with great choices, and excellent service without feeling like you've just been taken for a week's salary...especially when a week's salary is not a significant amount of money.. . A fantastic find on the west side of Melrose!  I'm so glad I forgot to make my reservation at Comme Ca!
