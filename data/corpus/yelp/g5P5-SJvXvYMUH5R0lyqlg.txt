Category: Burgers
Very, very loud, small crowded space. Tables are packed in and even the servers are confused, they're constantly bringing the wrong food to the wrong table. . . And it's expensive! 10 bucks for a burger with no fries (which are around 4 bucks extra), 1 slice of cheese, small cup of sauce, choice of bun, and 4 basic toppings (and I'm talking about the real basic ones; the standard lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles at most places are not standard here. Plus, order any more than four and it's and extra fifty cents each.) Along with the basic sides, you can add "specialty" items (like a fried egg or bacon) for a dollar each. A burger can easily cost 13 bucks, add on French fries and a drink and you're spending 20 bucks per person! For that kind of money I could be eating a much nicer meal.. . The food was decent, the sauces were interesting and tasty, and the service was good.
