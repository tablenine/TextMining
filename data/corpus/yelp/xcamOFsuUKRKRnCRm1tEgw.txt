Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
If you like or love dumplings, this place would be your dumpling heaven. . . I'm not much of a dumpling fan but I enjoyed eating here. All of my Taiwanese and Chinese friends LOVE this place, so I had to check it out, at least once. Beware of the little dumplings - If you bite into it, you might have the hot water squirting at your face/clothes, whatnot, so becareful!!. . From what I have heard and experienced first-hand, the wait to get a table is reallyyy long. Apparently everyone in the hood wants some din-tai-fung, everyday, all the time. During peak hours, parking is a bit difficult to find. . . Anyways, only worth it to go check it out if you really like dumplings - then you'd probably give this place 5 stars like everyone else did.
