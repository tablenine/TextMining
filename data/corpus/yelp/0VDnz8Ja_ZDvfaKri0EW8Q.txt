Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I'll admit it's good. I love their juicy pork dumpling, but it's so expensive and small. I also love their pot sticker chicken dumpling. A couple of friends of mine and I ordered about 5 plates and the bill came to about $50 something and we were all still hungry!!. . I heard this place get's so pack on sunday morning it's like another dimsum.. but with dimsum i can get a lot more and it'll still be cheaper!. . also I rather get it at mama's kitchen.. I can get 8 for only $5 and they're much more bigger.!
