Fabulous Beef Dip sandwiches, and yes I said sandwiches (plural)!  I ate two of those suckers.  I also tried a cup of the "Straight Chili" (no beans) and it too was great!  Thank God I didn't order a bowl, I would have had to be carted out on a stretcher.  I don't remember ever eating so much food for lunch...but it was great!   I hadn't been here for over 6 years and I cannot stay away for 6 days...gotta' get back to Philippe's really soon.
