Okay, I could go on and on about the great shows that happen here, and the celebrities that frequent this joint, but I think I will go on about the food!. . Despite the fact that this joint is mostly for bands to showcase their talents, they do have great food and drink!. . Dunch is my favorite thing about this place- it's lunch/dinner and it is amazing.  they have all the greasy food you could want- omelette's, hash browns, bagels and lox, vegan tofu scrambler!, etc.  But beware, good food can come with a price- they usually have some terrible and loud band playing right in front of you while you eat, and it is not fun when you are seriously hung over.. . But they have a great lunch/dinner menu if you get there before a show, or if you just want to eat there and leave.  But the bands they have every night are enough to make you want to stay and see what occurs!
