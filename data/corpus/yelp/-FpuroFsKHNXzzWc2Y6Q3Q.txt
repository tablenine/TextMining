Full Disclosure: I came with a private group and didn't get the chance to see the full menu.. . Favorite thing that I ordered was the fried green tomatoes.  They were very well prepared and made me want more!  The fried chicken I had was ok - but for my first experience in the South with fried chicken, I was expecting more of a she-bang! The boullabaise blew the fried chicken out of the water.. . Also, the place was FREEZING.  I even asked if they would turn the AC down.  I had to slam back wine in order to get a liquid coat going on to warm myself.  So ridiculous.  . . I'd come back though, mostly for the fried green tomatoes.
