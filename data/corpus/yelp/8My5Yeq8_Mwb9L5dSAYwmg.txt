I have to give this place 4 stars just because they have a lot of food that I can eat.  Starting this gluten free diet - I was worried that I'd have to go out of my way to shop, and I do, but it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.. . I've always thought WF has a good variety and I'm always impressed with their things - I just hate paying so much.  I always feel like I'm getting a deal at Trader Joe's and then feel like I must be on drugs to pay the prices here.. . Read their weekly flyer before you go shopping.  You can find some great deals.  Really great beer and wine selection (including gluten free beer - Bard's is especially good).  As a bonus, their flowers are really nicely priced.. . Greatest discovery ever - they carry Illy Coffee!
