I went here last night with my best friend after seeing the Los Angeles Kings play at the Staples Center.  We ordered a Margarita Pizza w/ extra basil and it was so delish! We were very happy! My friend had been here before and she's never been disappointed. It was my first time and as soon as I walked in there, the atmosphere had that exclusive feel to it but the price is very decent. I saw Lamar Oden and other celebrities walk in and they sat close by...  so I'm guessing this place is some what low key at the same time??? My waitress took like 24 minutes to bring me my beverage but other than that, I really like this place a lot.
