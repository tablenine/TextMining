If you like breakfast food &amp;amp; aren't diabetic you MUST try this place! . . Their selection always makes my mouth water just reading the menu. Their French Toast is amazing no matter which one you choose, and you'll probably want to take the leftovers with you. Their coffee is also impressive because they use a Bodum French Press &amp; the cofffe has a nice kick to it. . . One warning: there is always a line, but it moves fast so don't be deceived by the crowd standing outside. The guy who handles the seating it freaking awesome! The one time we waited it was due to a friend being late to meet us. We asked to be skipped to wait for our friend &amp; he kept checking with us to see if we wanted to be seated without our friend. We almost did.. . The only parking is a small and behind the Rite Aid on the corner net door. If you have patience for the parking the food will definitely make up for it. Overall, I love this place.
