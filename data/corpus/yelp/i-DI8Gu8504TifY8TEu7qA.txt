This place is so over-rated.  There's no first-come, first-serve seating policy so you literally have to stalk the diners before someone else snags their table.  And guess what?  Others will stalk you as you are wrapping up your meal.  . . You can't modify anything on the food menu which would be okay if the food was better.  Who the hell puts blue cheese on a burger?  If you are a vegetarian, you are out of luck because their few vegetarian choices (beet salad? bowl o mushrooms?) are not particularly filling or nutritionally balanced.  . . The skinny fries were mediocre.  Who ruins fries?  Honestly, if the stoned teenager at Rally's can make good fries, so can someone charging five times as much as Rally's.. . They have no table service and they have attitude about it.  All I have to say about that is that McDonald's has the same business model so you can hold the attitude.  Oh wait, you don't customize anything so I guess if you go here, you'll have to swallow whatever they dish out.
