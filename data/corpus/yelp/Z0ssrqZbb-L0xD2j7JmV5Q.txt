Geisha House of Horror!. . First, I would like to say that I had been anticipating going to Geisha House for quite some time.  Hearing all the hype and glamor that the venue brings to "night-life dining", I was excited.  . . Reviews were accurate on food.  2 Stars... Everyone has had better Japanese food for far less.  Portions are small, over-hyped, and quite frankly beginner sushi chef decor.. . *** When you pay $400 for a party of 4 (Including drinks) you expect the Sushi Rolls to at least be cut well... knife strokes were visible and uneven lines LARGELY apparent.. . If you really want to eat Japanese do not expect to get authentic Japanese here!  . . Oh! There are no Geisha Girls working there either... either it was their day off or the place is to slow to hire wanabee non Japanese Geisha's.. . Verdict: . 1. People Rave about the decor and ambiance... Pleazzze! Unless you grew up in a Trailor Park, this place is not impressive.  It tries to be Vegas, but does not quite deliver.  . 2. Food is a BUST!. 3. Price is very Hollywood... If your loaded with $$$, who cares how much money you waste here....!  But if your loaded, you probably wont put something that taste like (**_**), no matter how much it cost.. . Geisha House was once a place to be seen and see... it is no longer that destination..... . Happy Hunting...
