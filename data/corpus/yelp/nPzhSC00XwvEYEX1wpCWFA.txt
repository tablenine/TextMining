No innovation here...it's just a sports bar, but they do it well.  I went here on Monday night to see my Steelers whip up on the sorry Dolphins.  To my chagrin there was an hour weather delay.  Well, it didn't matter, there was plenty to see, eat, and drink at Fox Sports Grill.. . It is a large space that includes a billiard room, lounge-type seating, traditional booths and tables, and of course a bar and lots and lots of screens.  The crowd was mostly single 20-30 somethings.. . I had the blackened mahi-mahi sandwich and a Sweetwater Hefe...not bad!  I almost ordered a scotch after I saw the bartender pour (heavy hand), but I already started with beer and didn't want the two fighting in my stomach :)  That's a fight you can't win because eventually everybody leaves the premises!. . This place is a spacious rival to all other sports bars.  My only complaint was the "crick" in my neck as a result of looking up at the not-so-well placed screens; convenience triumphs over ergonomics again!?!?
