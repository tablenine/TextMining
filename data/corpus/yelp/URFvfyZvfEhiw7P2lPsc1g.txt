Horrible service, horrible food (but the portions are large) lame atmosphere.  Stay away!. . Don't you hate it when servers tell you they can't split a check?  WTF?  Why?  Is it really that difficult.  "I would have to void your order and start over"  Okay, well do that.  I usually wouldn't yelp or complain, but my co-worker and I need to keep our receipts for our expense reports.  Sure, we should have said something up front, but this is 2009, learn how to use the computer.. . Seriously, FOOD BLOWS!
