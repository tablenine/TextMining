My most favorite ramen place in LA!! The ramen is simply perfect with the broth. Everyone I've brought here has fell in love with it. Granted the wait is a little long, but it's really worth it. After a huge bowl, you'll leave feeling completely satisfied. Â If not, there's always the combination ramen with your choice of fried rice or tuna sashimi and others. I was told the tuna wasn't so great, so stay clear. Otherwise, I highly recommend!
