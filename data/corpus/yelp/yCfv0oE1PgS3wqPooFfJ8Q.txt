Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
I actually worked at Dolce as a hostess for a few months back in January, and by the end of that time I was pretty over it.  The food is hit or miss, the atmosphere is good for people watching, and the drinks are great, but the company and the management is snobby and blatantly sexist and lookist.  Dolce made a point to overbook their tables every night, so that people would have to wait for their tables and so they could cultivate an aura of exclusivity.  Now, I know that this is something that many upscale restaurants do (having worked and dined in many of them), but the attitude at Dolce was just on another level-very judgemental.   The worst offense for me though, was when I was asked to pass judgment on whether or not girls coming in for interviews had "the Dolce look," i.e. were they skinny and hot.. . All in all, Dolce (and the sister restaurants they are opening) are a good place to go if you're concerned with appearances and your own importance.. . That being said, I do have to say that most of the staff, especially the bartenders, were great people, and they deserve your business, even if the restaurant doesn't.
