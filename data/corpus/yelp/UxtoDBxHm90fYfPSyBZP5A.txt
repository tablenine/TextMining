Initially this place was perfect in every aspect when it first opened. . . After about a year in this place is semi good. Satisfactory food, service is inconsistent. On one occasion we saw our waiter but twice the whole night. Â . . Ill still go back if the place is convenient to go to, I certainly would not go out of my way to go there.
