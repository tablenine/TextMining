I'm knocking sola up to 5 stars, with the clear understanding that 1) it's probably not a "5 star" restaurant, and 2) there is room for improvement.. . BUT ... I always have a great time here. You know those places where you can just go and relax, where you feel comfortable bringing friends because you feel confident they'll enjoy it? That's my experience with sola. Everything about the place is so professionally run, and the food is so good and (god help us) creative, that I trust them to take care of me.. . I stopped in this week with a friend and her mother. Both mother and daughter can be picky, and both were happy as clams. It was chilly, but the fireplace was roaring, so that got us off to a good start. I had the house Manhattan, which was a delight. Mom had a special drink order, and it was delivered flawlessly. For dinner, I had the lamb chops which were on special, and they were cooked perfectly. If you've had lamb chops that were not cooked perfectly, you know what that means. Mom had the short ribs -- braised with an Asian touch, with hoisin and lemongrass, I cannot recommend these enough. I started off with the roasted beet and pineapple salad, which sounds strange, but turned out to be a lovely blend of sweet, earthy, and sharp, from the manchego cheese. This is the way in which the food is creative -- interesting combinations, without being too cute or clever.. . For me, the one flaw is dessert. They're either too pedestrian -- molten chocolate cake -- or too odd -- sweet potato and beet tart, jasmine rice pudding spring roll. I recommend opting for a flight of the ice creams and/or sorbets, which are consistently good.. . sola is not inexpensive. But my experience there is on par with places that charge twice as much. And that makes worth 5 stars.
