This place was great! My boyfriend and I always order the same thing at every Chinese resturant we go to compare what we like best. Their crab rangoon were in the form of "chopsticks". I prefer the traditional dumpling because it seems you get more fried cream cheese in those, but these definately had a lof of crab in them, which you dont see very much. The sesame chicked was the best I have had in Chicago so far. We also got a spicy cherry-chile shrimp dish that was very good however I don't think I would reorder it. Ben Pao is close to my place so I see us becoming regulars. I wonder if they deliver?
