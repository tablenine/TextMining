Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I went to Father's Office for the first time last Friday. It wasn't bad. Sure, there was a line to get in but it moved pretty quickly. The Father's Burger was good. I was hesitant to get it at first since they wouldn't let me get it without cheese, but the burger turned out alright. The sweet potato fries were amazing. I just wish they served ketchup.
