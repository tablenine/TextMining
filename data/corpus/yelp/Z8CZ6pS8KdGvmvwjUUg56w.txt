Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Came here after a fabulous day of shopping at IMATS for lunch with some friends. This place didn't quite live up to all the hype for me, but I still enjoyed what we ordered. The chicken was super hot, fresh and yummy. The waffles were good, I ended up having more of that leftover to take home. My friend ordered the mashed potatoes and it was the most memorable thing of the whole meal . There are some people I want to bring back here so they can try out some chicken and waffles, so I'll be back again or sure.
