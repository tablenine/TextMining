Be prepared to wait, b/c there is always a line here; lunch or dinner, weekday or weekend.. Parking can also be a pain. I suggest parking at the JVP parking structure across the street.. . One of my favorite restaurants in Little Tokyo.. They have fresh quality fish. And it's consistent! Always fresh.. They serve traditional Japanese food, which are all fresh, mostly healthy, and light. Pretty good value as well.. If you sit at the sushi bar, you can only order sushi/sashimi, unless you are VIP (I've seen people order hot food! I wish I knew how to be VIP; I'm trying to become friends with the sushi chefs there :D). . The staff is courteous, never had a problem with them.
