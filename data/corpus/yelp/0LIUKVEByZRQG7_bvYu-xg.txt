Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
What's better than one Tito's Taco? TWO TITO'S TACOS!!!. . Yeah, okay the line can get ridiculous.  And it's just a taco stand, right?  WRONG.  It's a feast of lovableness that makes you happy to be an Angeleno.  Seriously.  A box of tacos that deliver nothing but pure gastronomic delight.  These are the tacos that your father, and his father before him, dreamed you would someday enjoy.. . Okay, that may be a little over the top, but in all seriousness, they do tacos ... and they do them right.  Nothing super fancy, just plain goodness.  Bring a book, grab a friend, wait in line and dive in!
