Where the hell have I been????  I lived in Glendale for 18 years, and I had NO idea about this place!!!  It wasn't until my coworker came back from So.Cal that I tried a cheese roll for the first time.  OMG...so F'in good!!!!  My tastebuds were ready for more, so I was determined to go to Porto's on my last visit home.. . I decided to go early on Sunday morning to beat the crowd, but my version of early still wasn't early enough.  I arrived at 9:30, and there was already a line inside!  The line kept moving, but it gave me just enough time to figure out what I wanted.  I wanted to try everything, but I tried to have some self control.  Notice I used the word "tried."  . By the time I walked out of Porto's, my wallet was $43 lighter.. . I ordered..... ~20 potato balls. ~1 dozen cheese rolls. ~20 dulce de lece kisses. ~1 strawberry &amp; cheese croissant. ~2 meat pies. ~2 chicken empanadas. ~2 red velvet cupcakes . . You might be thinking..."damn that girl's a pig!!"  But no...I actually shared with my family, coworkers and friends this time.  I was able to try a little bit of everything, and it was damn good!  There was nothing that I didn't like. Nom nom nom!. . I can't wait until I go back home again!  This little piggy wants more! More! MORE!
