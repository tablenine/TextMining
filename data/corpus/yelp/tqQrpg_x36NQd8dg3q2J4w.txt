Restaurant: Alon&#39;s
Category: Bakeries
I cook, I don't bake. There's a huge difference. Baking requires precision, measurements, and strict adherence to recipes...all characteristics I ignore when I'm in the kitchen. So if I ever get stuck needing dessert for a party or to bring to an event, Alon's is my saving grace.. . The breads and desserts at Alon's are top notch. Yes, they're pricey, but they have to pay the ridiculously high rent for the area somehow I suppose. I haven't had too much of an issue with parking, usually because I'm only there for five minutes at the most to grab something dessert-y on the way to someone's party.
