I really liked their sashimi although I think everything here is a bit over-priced. They have a pretty good wine list, which is a plus. Good service. I guess old town is a cool spot, which is probably why it's more expensive than other sushi places. If you are short on cash, I'd recommend Toro Sushi for maki rolls and Tokyo Marina for sashimi. This place is definitely better than any other Kamehachi locations in Chicago.
