Ginourmous doesn't even describe the size of their burritos. I had enough leftovers for two more meals! . . Really, really good too, I can't remember exactly what I got but it was vegetarian. So delicious. . . I like the vibe in here too, all the photos on the wall, all the history. Go here now!!!!!! . . Unless it's lunchtime. You'll be sleeping all day.. . Go here for dinner!!!!
