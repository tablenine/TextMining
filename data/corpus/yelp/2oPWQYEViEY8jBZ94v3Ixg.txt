Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Savoy gets 5 stars from me for their Hainan Chicken.  As others have said, it's quite impressive.  . . The price of the Hainan Chicken plate is around $7.00.  I talk with a friend in Singapore and he teases me that he eats $3.00US Chicken Rice plates all of the time.  I guess the market for it is bigger there (understandably!), but it makes it harder to shell out the money for it knowing it costs less than half as much for the authentic stuff in Singapore.  ;). . Unfortunately, the small size of the restaurant and the long lines of people always hanging out in front of it and along the side usually causes me to keep driving straight past them.. . Seriously....they really can't open another restaurant?
