Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
I didn't want to believe the Guy Fieri hype.  I can't stand that frosted flake.. . Cemitas Puebla is the real deal folks.  This is the Kuma's of Mexican sandwiches.. . I took my fiancee here a few weeks ago on a whim.  We rolled up a little before 8:00 and the place was about half full.  There were two burly police officers sitting in the corner, hunched over the table and inhaling their food.  Cops in attendance is always a good sign.. . I ordered the carne asada Cemita.  AMAZING.  . . I'm a big fan of sandwiches, and the cemita might be one of the best I've ever had.  Not just the best Mexican sandwich---the best sandwich of any nationality or ethnic group (or religion for that matter....I would attend services at the Church of Cemitas on Sunday mornings AND Wednesday nignts if there were such a house of worship).  The bread is legit.  The avocado &amp; chipotle pepper spread doesn't overpower the meat and the Oaxacan cheese is perfection.. . I don't even remember what my girl ordered.  I had an extra taco on the side which was good, but I can't even recall what type of meat it was (probably al pastor).  It's all about the cemitas.. . +1 for friendly service. +1 for Mexican Coca-Cola . . The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is they close at 9pm, but I suppose these culinary geniuses need to rest occasionally too.
