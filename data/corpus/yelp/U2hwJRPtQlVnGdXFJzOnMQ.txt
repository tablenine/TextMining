It's more like 3.5 stars...but I'm giving it a generous 4. . . It was Saturday afternoon...a beautiful day and I just got out of work...yay~! I had plans to try out Â a new place for lunch with one of my gal pals. We were gonna go to Doughboys but decided to try The Little Door instead. We valeted the car and walked up to the man taking down names. He told us it's gonna be about 5 to 10 minutes. Dude...5 to 10 minutes my @$$. We waited 20 minutes. So anyway, we sat down waited a good 10 minutes before our server came by. She took our order: a bottle of wine (can't remember the name but it was yummy), a grilled salmon sandwich and a salad. We didn't see our wine until after our food came out. Weird. The food was mediocre. There was no party in my mouth. The portions are pretty small. My friend and I were still hungry so we ordered the cheese plate and meat plate. The cheese plate came out with bread...it was delicious. The meat plate never showed up at our table but showed up on our bill. That's a big no no~!! The server was apologetic so I just got the meat plate to-go cuz I was going to a wine party after lunch anyway. So...I tried the meat plate at the wine party and it was really good. . . So kiddos...recommendations for this place is a bottle of wine and a cheese and meat plate. The restaurant is super duper crowded and the service is not so great but I'd go back just for wine, cheese and meat.
