Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
It's well known by all my friends that they must go with me to Shinsengumi on a regular basis.  This location was the one I used to frequent when I lived in Pasadena.  I think the ramen is slightly better at the Gardena location, but I think the waitstaff is even more friendly and energetic at this location.  It's hard for me to pick my favorite, since the food and waitstaff are pretty great at both.  This place is highly recommended, give it a try!
