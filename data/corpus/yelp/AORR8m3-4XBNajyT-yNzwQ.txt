I might have liked this place more if I weren't sticking to my vegetarian guns this week.. . But alas, I didn't eat any fish at Tank and as such, my experience was ho hum at best. . . The best thing I liked was the vegetable tempura, but all the veggie rolls we got were not very tasty.  I felt like there was too much rice and not any unique offerings.  . . The best part of it was that we discovered it was 1/2 bottle of wine night.  Great deal!
