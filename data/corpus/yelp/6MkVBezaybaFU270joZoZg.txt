Restaurant: The Euclid Avenue Yacht Club
Category: Restaurants
"It's a classic place with good food.". . The Yacht Club is a Atlanta Little Five Points landmark. The place is always hopping and the staff is cool and service minded. You'll see lots' of tattoos and hip clothing. The food is above average... try the hot dog. The great beer selection keeps me happy.. . I love the Georgia State Patrol car door above the bar. Bring your darts too. Great people watching out the front windows... little 5 rocks!
