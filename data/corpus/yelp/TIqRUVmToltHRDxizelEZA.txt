This is one of those reviews that you don't want to write because then even more people find out about your new favorite place. However it's lent so I'm feeling that I should be a good person and share.. .  Hide is the first sushi in LA that I really really like and can afford to go more than once a month. It's incredibly fresh, it's good straight sushi, and the salmon skin salad makes me incredibly happy.. .  Other reviews mentioned that this is not the place to go if you want rolls/schmancy sushi combos. I agree... this place only has a few rolls on the menu (none of which I've tried). What makes Hide radical is that you go in, order your nigiri or sashimi of choice, eat delicious &amp; big portions of said orders, and feel happy. If a sushi place has excellent fish, I rarely feel the need to fill up on items with lots of rice. I'd much rather fill my tummy with delicious rawness.. .  The salmon skin salad here is amazing. You must like salmon skin, but if you do you will fall in love. It's just a bowl of fresh veggies with perfectly crunchy salmon skin for around $7. The other especially notable item is the special scallops-- I love their special scallops (despite not being able to eat them elegantly, too big for my tiny mouth)..  Â .  I've been three times now and have never had a problem getting seating (although parking in the area can be annoying at times).
