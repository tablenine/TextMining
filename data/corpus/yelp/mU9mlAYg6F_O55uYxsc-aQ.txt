This place is lovely if you like okra and garlicky greens like I do. And I love smoked meat, and that is some nicely smoked chicken. Cash only. It's great for the price. Afterward we headed back east and had a cupcake at Swim Cafe, just a perfect end to the delicious evening. Â mmm.. I go back to this place and bring new people there, when they say they don't want to spend much money. great food for good value. yay Feed!
