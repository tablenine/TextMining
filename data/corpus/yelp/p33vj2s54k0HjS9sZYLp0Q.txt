Authentic jewish deli...not a "jewish-style" deli.  Really good grilled turkey and cheese sandwich on wheat.  The unremarkable matzo ball soup could use a little propping up...carrots, celery and onion would be nice in addition to the broth and so-so ball.  Fries are for sharing here, they give you a bunch.  My friend enjoyed a decent egg cream as well.. . Still in search of turkey pastrami in LA...my quest continues as they don't have it here either.  And for the record, peppered turkey is not the same as turkey pastrami.  A jewel in an otherwise questionable part of town.
