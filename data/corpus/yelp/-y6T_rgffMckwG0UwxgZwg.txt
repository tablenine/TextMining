Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
When I first arrived to this place I was a little anxious about the very long line, but my friend assured me that it would go quick. It did, in part to the ambience of the place. The chefs cut the fries from fresh potatoes in plain sight, and there are only five things on the menu- hot dog, polish dog, fries, tamale, and drink. It's evident that they do these few things well.. . The dogs are served with fries on top, and the combination of both is absolutely delightful. The tamale was soggy and sans husk, but stlll decent. Gene's and Jude's doesn't have tables, but I think eating on the ledge around the walls of the place adds to the experience.. . I can't wait to go back!
