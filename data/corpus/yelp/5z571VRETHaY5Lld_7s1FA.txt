I have always waited at least an hour to 2 hours get seated here. I always get there hungry so the wait is always painful. I wish they had another location. The staff is somewhat friendly, but they're never enthused. . . I'd totally give them 5 stars for their food, but the waiting time just sucks. My biggest pet peeve is waiting so i guess they re out of luck. . . I always get an order of Sweet potato fries (or yam fries, as i like to correct people), 1lb shrimp marinated with the whole sha-bang . , and a basket of catfish. YUM. I recently ordered their chicken wings, it was unexpectedly good. ;) . . I'm not into the whole sucking shrimp heads and making a mess when i'm eating, but it's all part of the experience. Last but not least, . you should try adding corn on the cob and potatoes inside your bag.
