This is the best food experience I have had in a while.  If you are a vegetarian, I can see where this place may offend you.  I can't even imagine how many cows, pigs, chickens had to die because of one particular meal.  Imagine a buffet, you walk up to the buffet counter to serve yourself.  At Fogo de Chao, they bring the food to you.  They bring the meat to you constantly.  They almost seem offended that you turn down their meat.  That is Fogo de Chao.. . So Fogo de Chao is about a nice Buckhead dining experience.  So, I wouldn't bring your flip-floppies.  I didn't make the reservations but apparently reservations are made.  We got their on time and there is complimentary parking or you can choose to park your car in the pack.  It is in the Buckhead area, but there really isn't an issue with parking in back or in the area.. . It is a really simple concept.  For over forty dollars a plate, flip over a card "Green, Go" for I want some of your fifteen cuts of meat or "Red, Stop" to slow down eating.  If you select Red, normally this is a time to go to the salad bar or floss or continue with your meal.  If you select green, then expect dozens of cooks? or waiters will come to your table with their cooked skewers of meat.  And don't get involved in chit-chat.  The meat servers are there to serve their meat, drop it on your plate and move to the next table.  It is really a unique way of serving food.  Normally they will tell you what type of meat you are being served.  For example, I normally turn down pork products, so that sent away 30% of the servers.  And we also had a debate on whether or not the servers were the cooks of the meat.  I say this, because they look offended if you turn down their selection.
