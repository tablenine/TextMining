I really, really, REALLY wanted to try the Hainan Chicken dish at Savoy because I heard and read so much about it.  I guess with all the hype  I was expecting some godly dish to appear before me at the restaurant.  Well, yah...sometimes hearing too much praise for something can really kill the fun.  I didn't think the chicken was THAT amazing, nor did I find the rice to be that wonderful.  I liked that the rice was soaked in chicken broth so it had a lot of flavor, but the chicken was pretty bland to me.  I tried to compensate by dipping it in the soy sauce, hot sauce, and ginger sauce, but it just didn't do it for me.  . . Service (couldn't believe that there even was service...it's an Asian restaurant!) was really decent and attentive.  Our waitress came by and checked up on us as well as refilled our water.  A busboy came by to give me more ginger sauce since he noticed I had nearly finished mine.  That was really cool of them.  . . Also, as others Yelpers have mentioned, the food comes out really, really quickly.  I ordered and within 2 minutes, my food was presented to me.  That makes me believe that everything was already prepared a while before I even arrived, but that is OK.  I understand Savoy is really popular so of course they can't exactly wait for me to order, then kill the chicken, cook it, and then serve me.. . The cost per dish was really reasonable (Hainan chicken was less than $7), which is a blessing for poor college students like my friend Marthie D. and me.  I'd recommend whomever wants to try Savoy to leave all the high expectations at home, or else you will be disappointed like me.
