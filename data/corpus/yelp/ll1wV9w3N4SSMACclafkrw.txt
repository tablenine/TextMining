They have the best fried chicken you can find.  The size of the chicken is unreal, cuz honestly, you won't find girls with breasts this large.  The secret to paying a low price is to get the country girl (1/2 chicken), but with 4 chicken breasts.  You can't beat the quality.  Breasts never looked so damn good.
