Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
The first time I visited Pops, it was during the peak of a Friday evening happy-hour.  The champagne cocktails were very enjoyable but the place was so crowded that it was hard to really enjoy the experience.  . . Then, I came back for Round Two later on a Friday night, and just loved the place.  We got a table in the back which was actually preferable to the more noisy front room.  The booths were comfortable and the service was prompt.  In fact, I found the service to be exceptional at every step of the night, from the hostess who offered us our choice of seating, to the multiple servers who stopped by frequently.  I'm sort of ignorant when it comes to champagne, and our server did a great job of guiding us to the best options without coming across as snobby.  Even the random person who pointed me towards the restroom was very friendly.  . . I enjoyed my champagne very much, but the classy, polite atmosphere is what I was most impressed with.  I'll definitely be back (but probably not for a Happy Hour). . . I'm reserving a star until I try the food.
