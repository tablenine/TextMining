Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe's in one of my favorites. Chicken smothered in gravy, waffles and a side of greens and I'm in heaven. My friends all shudder when I tell them about chicken and waffles for dinner. They all end up loving it when I take them there. I live in OC, but usually travel to the LA location because I like the atmosphere better. I have to remind myself to skip lunch when I go there.
