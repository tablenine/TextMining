Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
I was stuck in Culver City waiting to meet up with a client, and had some time to kill. I was looking for a place to eat and was searching on my GPS. Gloria's Cafe was listed as Italian food on my GPS, and that sounded good. When I pulled up, I saw that it was Mexican food. Since I had Mexican food for lunch, I wasn't too stoked, but I was lazy, and I was there, so I thought what the hell. I love Mexican food anyway. So, I went in. I am very glad I did. What a find. This is possibly the best Mexican food in Los Angeles. . . I ordered the Tortilla Soup and a beef hard shell taco. Like I said, it was awesome. . . I don't get out to Culver City that often, but when I do, I'll def be hitting up Glorias.
