Let me start by saying I don't give many 5 star ratings.  This place is amazing.  It has been quite a while since I've been impressed by a bakery this much.  The cakes are beautiful and delicious.  We had a chocolate and raspberry one for a bridal shower.  Everyone loved it so much that we went there for breakfast the following morning.  I had an almond croissant that was filled with excellent marzipan thoughout and was flaky and buttery.  Plus, it was only $0.95!  Unheard of.  My blended dulce de leche latte was creamy and sweet.  Starbucks frapuccinos are crap compared to these perfectly blended wonders.  My only complaint was that the fruit cup was a bit lackluster, with too much of the underipe melon typical of socal.  I tried someone else's spinach croissant and that was superb as well.  I hear they have great sandwiches too.  I can't wait to go back for lunch and check it out myself!
