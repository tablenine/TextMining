I just had a great evening at Hub 51. I was thoroughly pleased with the trendy ambiance, wait staff, drinks, and food. (Note, It was earlier in the evening on a Saturday night - around 9:00 p.m., so I don't know what the crowd gets like later on....). . We walk in and it's already super crowded, and we're told it would be an hour and a half wait for a table. We consider going somewhere else when the perky hostess whispers to us that there is a table for two that is usually saved for reservations, but they didn't fill it that night. SCORE! We already love this place!. . We order a pitcher of the Hub Punch, awesome deal, awesome taste, awesome buzz! . . Our waiter was so attentive even though he was super busy. The crowd was a good mix of young twentysomes, thirty somethings, and older diners. . . We ordered the guacamole and it was a m a z i n g. Followed by the Nachos and some Sushi. The King Crab Roll, was a little too small but the gigantic serving of delicious Nachos more than made up for it. Seriously, the prices here aren't that bad for the portions that you get. I think we ate about 1/4 of the nachos. We wouldn't be able to stand and dance the rest of the night if we consumed anymore!. . My only complaint was how crowded the bar was, even at 10 PM. There was no where to stand. Also, the bathrooms are downstairs in the basement, kind of hard to get too!. . But, I will definitely be returning. Maybe with a reservation next time since we just majorly lucked out this Saturday night by getting a table instantly. . . Who couldn't live off of a pitcher of vodka and tequila Â punch and guacamole?? Great start to a night.
