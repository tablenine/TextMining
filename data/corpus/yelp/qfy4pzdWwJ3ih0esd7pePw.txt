Category: Steakhouses
Went here for my bestfriends 3 year anniversary. Â The atmosphere was romantic, service was great and the food was pretty BOMB!. . Have you ever been to Joe's stone crab in vegas?!?!. . It is a similar place, but of course they are more focused on STEAKS! I thought the steaks were very flavorful, we also started out with the seafood tower! All i have to say about that is OMG! You've never seen a seafood tower like this! . . Overall really great and entertaining place, pricey, but well worth it!. . (watch out for the plates. They are scorching hot, and i think my bestfriend burned her hand..ahahaha)
