Some friends were on a ramen craze and were talking up this place like it was the second coming of the ramen gods, raving about how authentic and piping hot and awesome the house ramen is here.  After that kind of an intro, how could I not go and order the daikoku ramen.. . First the good... the tonkotsu broth was absolutely delicious.  It was rich, creamy, excellent flavors.  Loved the whole boiled egg and you could tell that the sprouts and scallions were cut fresh, the ramen was made fresh, those pork belly cuts were tender, sweet, and just amazing.. . Now... after that kind of raving review, why only three stars?  I may have hit them on an off night, but the violated the cardinal sin of noodles in broth - the broth was lukewarm and unacceptably so.  They were busy and I was really hungry so I opted to stick with what I had versus sending it back.  They've definitely earned a repeat visit, want to try it with the kotteri flavor and want to try the Tsukemen given how much was absolutely awesome with the ramen bowl.  However, lukewarm broth, no matter how delicious, is huge.
