Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Had.... Umami burger, diet coke from the Netherlands, onion rings, fries. . To the health-conscious people, this place is not for you. The burgers are definitely on the greasy juicy end, but hey, who wants a burger that's dry and tasteless (definitely not me!).. . We got their rather early, I think it was around 6pm or so.  We got seated pretty quick at the wrap-around counter thingy in the small room at the corner, but plenty of seats were available outside as well (it was kinda chilly that day though).  I don't care for the $2 valet, because $2 is rather cheap compared to some other places in Downtown or the Westside.. . Service was alright.  I think the owner had some family and friends in the same room we were in, and that was a bit annoying as they seemed to treat said room as a private banquet ish event, without concern for others (=us).  But that's almost a non-issue as we got outta there rather quick.  Server was cool, food came pretty quick, prices are fine ($10 burgers are fine to me...The Counter, Father's Office, etc. are in the same range anyway).. . The Umami burger was tender, juicy, cooked medium-ish.  I personally think the burger is a good size, and the burger and bun meshed well.  Fries were average at best, and the onion rings were basically Onion Tempura to me (being the Japanese person I am...) But overall, the food's pretty good.  If I were to rate the burger alone, I'd say this is the second-best burger I had in LA behind Blue Dahlia.  The Counter is a whole other experience as that's up to your creativity, but I like Umami better than Father's Office for sure.  . . I'd definitely give it another try when I'm in the area.
