First saw this place (truck?) featured on Throwdown and swore to myself that I would find it when I came to NYC.  Thank God I'm one determined person, because I died and went to heaven after this orgasmic eating experience.  I wish I lived in NYC if only to eat endless amounts of waffles.  I found them on 46th between 5th and 6th ave outside an office building.  While standing in line, the after-work guys next to me were telling their coworker the W&amp;D truck is the best part of Thursday. HELL YEAH.. . The liege waffle wasn't as sweet as I was expecting it to be, which is all the better for me, since I got two.  The first was topped with spekuloos and whipped cream, and the second one with spekuloos and strawberries.  So moist and chewy, but the spread didn't penetrate through it to make it soggy.  MMMM!. . Let me say, that the guys who operate the truck are insanely nice!  After devouring my first waffle, they gave me a $1 discount on my second.  I wanted to know what spekuloos is, but they told me I ask too many questions; what jokers.  After I told them I came all the way from Canada for these waffles, they told me to tell all my Canadian friends about the truck -- damn straight I will!
