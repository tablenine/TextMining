This is one of the nicest restaurants I've been to in Atlanta. If you find one better I'm sure it's a great establishment. The food was good. The wait staff was as much as I could ask for and the price was fair considering what you were getting. On the way out a waiter (not ours) smiled genuinely and wished us a good night. That left a good lasting impression because there was no tip involved for him.. . The ambiance was great. There was a piano player at the door. All of the tables were full so we opted to eat at the sushi bar. At first I thought this would take away from the experience but I was soon reassured.. . I haven't been to all of the restaurants in or around Perimeter Mall so I don't know how they compare but all I can tell you is that I was thoroughly satisfied with this one.
