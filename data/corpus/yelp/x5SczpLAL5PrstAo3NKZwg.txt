Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I know it's one of my faults to feel guilty about going balls to the wall at a pricey restaurant, but hear me out... There are so many delicious restaurants in LA at which one can be wined and dined for half the price of The Little Door. Yes, it's there is a "hard to get a reservation" mystique. Yes, our server was beautiful and French. Yes, the ambiance was exceedingly charming. Yes, I was amongst good friends, bottles of wine, tasty food.. We started with the Mezze Royale (a delicious sampling of scallops, tuna tartar, cheese and Mediterranean accoutrement), I had a featured cod that was absolutely perfect, and finished with a rhubarb (?) cobbler a la mode. Each of the courses was impeccable. . ...But the guilt was still eminent. I suppose everyone's priorities are different, and if you don't have a guilt complex like me, I'd wholeheartedly recommend The Little Door.
