Great, solid restaurant. The menu is interesting and adventurous. I have eaten there several times, and we have it on our list for dining out when visitors come to town. The tuna tartare is to die for, and the salmon chips are a great appetizer, too! The last time I was there, I had the special, which was pan-seared salmon. One of the best I've had. They really have the food nailed down at this place. What is more, it is not too expensive. Dinner for 5 last time, with plenty of appetizers and wine (carafe wine) ran about $250.. . The decor is nice; it is in an old warehouse. But, it can get loud (high ceilings, nothing soft on the walls). Free valet parking.. . Definitely worth it for a nice evening out.
