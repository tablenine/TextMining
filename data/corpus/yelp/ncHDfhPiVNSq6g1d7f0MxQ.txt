Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
So I like to tell stories behind the food I eat and my Father's Office review get a story too.. . 8 pm.  Me and coworker driving around LA after a long day of presentations.   I'm on my blackberry and driving (illegal I know but it's dark and cops can't see if you are on the phone), searching for something to eat, and boom I remember my LA buddy talking about Father's Office.  I type it in to my GPS and it is seriously the next exit, so I proceed to swerve across 4 lanes and get here.. . Totally worth the near death experience.  Had the burger with fries, and  WOW, seriously good.  And being a beer guy, with the selection on the wall... I was in heaven.  Hands down, one of the best burgers, period.  Seared medium rare.  Crunchy crust on the outside, soft, pink on the inside.  Perfectly juicy and moist.  Damn... wish I was in LA now.
