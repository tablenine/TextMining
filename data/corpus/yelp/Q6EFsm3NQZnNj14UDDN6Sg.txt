Still a fan, but the xiao long bao (Shanghai Soup Buns) face a problem.  Most people familiar with both XLB and Dim Sum will know that many dumpling-like items prepared in steamers come with some sort of liner to prevent stickage to the bamboo (or, at times, metal) steamers.  Most of the time the liner is some kind of paper.  . . At Chef Liu, the liner they use is a rigid plastic grill with relatively sharp edges.  The thin skins of the XLB tend to stick to the grill and tear open when patrons try to extricate the dumplings from the steamer basket.  I try to keep a steady, careful hand, but I encountered four split dumplings, and much agony with the loss of the tasty soup inside.  . . Mitigating this loss, however, is Chef Liu's inclusion of Crabmeat Soup Buns on the menu.
