Wandered in here one night for dinner because it happened it be the place serving beer where we could get seated. . . The food was your standard diner fare but I kinda felt like they were trying too hard with the names of the dishes. Also had some random noodle dishes thrown on the menu, that, truth be told, I've heard are good. But I just stick to the grilled ham and cheese with grilled onions thrown on. Go for the onion rings.. . As mentioned already, quite the story of the places origin on the back of the menu - rather scandalous actually. Read it or else you're missing out on of the places charms.. . Booths are cozy despite the large, roomy size. Bring a date and cuddle up, they were made for that sort of thing.
