Excellent!  First off, there's something kinda cool about walking into an unmarked door and feeling like you know a secret.  The ambience was great.  The blinds are not very opaque, but enough that you can be tempted to make out with your date.  Service is fantastic.  Me and my date were squeamish so the tasting menu was out.  We picked 8 dishes total to share and felt full.  We had the sake tasting menu since neither of us knows a thing about sake.  The bill was about $150 before tip and was a great experience.  I'm definitely saving up and going back.. . I'd say pass on the Kobe beef, but the miso beef is awesome.
