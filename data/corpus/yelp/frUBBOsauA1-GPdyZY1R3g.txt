THE BEST. I've been going to Gene and Judes since I was born. I've never come close to tasting a better hot dog OR fries. Fresh cut fries, steamed hot dog buns, the best mustard, the best hot dog, it just can't be matched. There is ALWAYS a huge line, which tells you IT'S GOOD. REALLY GOOD! Anyone who says otherwise is not a true Chicagoian.
