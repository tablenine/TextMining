This no-frills cafe serves up some of the best Japanese food for the price around, despite it being a diner type of atmosphere. . . The menu is extensive offering everything from Okonomi, combination plates to Udon to even a few non-Japanese items. My past orders have drawn from different areas of the menu; all were well prepared and consistently tasty (oshiiiiii!). . Anyway, if you ever find yourself in Little Tokyo, particularly late at night and in need of a good place to eat, do yourself a favor and stop in; you won't be disappointed.
