Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Hey, for those of you in the great debate over the authenticity or lack thereof, of the tacos...are any of you actually hispanic, or at least raised on the East side of LA? This is EXACTLY how we make tacos. FRIED. . . Between the tacos and the chili beans I cannot tell the difference between my grandma's, or any of my nine sets of Aunts and Uncles, or their kids cooking and Titos. . . I'm not saying they're any good mind you...... . Go for the entertainment value of the people watching and have something besides a taco.
