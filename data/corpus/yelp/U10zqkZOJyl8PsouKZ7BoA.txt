Go for happy hour (M-F, 3-6p) and that's it. Otherwise I think it's too expensive for what you get. You can get all the appetizers for half off and it becomes a pretty good deal. Go for the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Poke Stack! . . They have a gigantic selection of beer (probably the widest selection in all of Pasadena), so it's a good place to go with some out of town guest, only if you are willing to drop 6$ a pint =(. No pitchers.
