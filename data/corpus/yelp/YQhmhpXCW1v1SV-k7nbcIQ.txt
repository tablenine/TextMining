Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Yummy!  This place is a diamond in the rough. . . I just recently moved to the city and went online looking for a good Chinese restaurant.  I read the reviews for Friendship and had to check it out. I was not disappointed.. . I was a little skeptical after checking out the location.  I love the decor inside.  Very stylish.  And the food is....DELICIOUS.. . Make sure you order crab rangoon.  The best I've ever had.  And that says a lot as I've had many many many others.  . . I told the waitress how much I loved it and that I would write a good review and she brought us a free dessert!  . . I brought my family here and they raved about it all weekend. Even the fortune cookies are delicious.. . This was more than I usually like to spend but it is worth every penny.
