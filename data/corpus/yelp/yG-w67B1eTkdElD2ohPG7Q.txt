Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
After trying to go for the last few years we finally  made it to Gloria's on Saturday night.  The place was packed, but we were seated right away.  The restaurant had a great vibe, low lit, plenty of seating and great service.  We were quickly brought some chips and salsa and asked what we wanted to drink.  Unfortunately I gave up booze...and was not able to try the tasty looking margaritas.... :( . . I got 2 papusas and my fiance ordered the Carne Abodoba (sp).  His meat was tender and delicious...though he SWORE the secret ingredient was ketchup (he's special).   My papusas were good.  Hot, but not too flavorful...but that is what the salsa and sauces are for, right?. . All in all a great experience and some of the nicest happiest servers you've ever encountered.  When we were seated he asked "how are you?"  we replied "Good, and you?". . Response was awesome:  "GREAT! Now that you are here!". . Gotta love that.
