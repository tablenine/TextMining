my papa adores this place - every fri is papa et moi dinner and he always wants to go here!!  it's a great sandwich/soup/CAKE spot.  the moroccan mint tea is deelish.. . brunch on the weekends is kind of packed so be prepared to camp out for a table.  weekends are also good ppl watching days, or if you're like me, dog-watching.  . . oh yeah, i'm not sure if the soups are homemade but they are fantastic.  i had a lentil (which im not a fan of) but it was excellent!  after your filling meal, try some of their cakes... just looking at the cake case while waiting to order just makes u drool.  yummmmmy
