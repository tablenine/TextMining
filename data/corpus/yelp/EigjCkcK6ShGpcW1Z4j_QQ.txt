Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I just don't get why this place is so popular.  I waited in line at this taco stand for ten minutes, not to mention the ordeal finding a parking spot and a table.  I felt like I was being cheated somehow.  Maybe it was their cash only policy, or maybe it was the pushiness of the counter lady.  As a side note, they did not serve any other meat besides beef.  The tacos were good, but nothing special really.  You can do better.
