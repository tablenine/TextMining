I've been here on a few occasions and I'm still confused as to what all the hype is over. Yes, the rooftop is nice... but that does require it to actually be open. A few times it's been closed for private events so your left to experience the sometimes iffy service and lackluster food on the main dining level. I do enjoy the tvs in this place and the crowd is nice, but unless there's a special reason to go here I'd opt for another place. If you're hungry please don't go here for the food. At most enjoy some drinks and then head somewhere else for food. I've had a few things on the menu and liked nothing at all.
