one of my new favs!  The owner is into organics and sustainability so last night was the first 'green room sessions', (new monthly feature)kind of 'industry night/layperson' mingle night, appetizer tasting, live music, green people, etc.  . . It feels bar-ish when you enter the first of three connected areas, comfy chairs by a fireplace, big bar with a lot of seats, but make sure and have a meal (I got to try a little of a lot...  sweet potato fries, meatloaf, organic chicken, pulled pork nachos, and goat cheese/spinach empanada thing (love goat cheese!!)), which we did towards the end of the night.  The menu is complete locally farmed products along with organic stuff too.  Complete wine list, all my favorite american reds are there and organic "rain" vodka, along with a super cool martini list!. . Best of all smoke-free, friendly staff, and cool vibe.  I'll be back.
