I took my boyfriend here this morning so he could experience the wonderful French toast! The patio outside in the sunshine was just what I needed! Â I give this place 4 stars for their FRENCH TOAST.The red headed HOST there is great. Only thing is, at the end we both felt the $35.00 we spent on breakfast wasn't really worth it. The Veggie sandwich is lacking in veggies and has way to much bread, the orange juice is like $6.00 but it is fresh squeezed. For a $12.00 plate, there is really no sides or anything special. All organic, but not vegetarian friendly. If you want things like oatmeal, get there early because it is gone by 10:00.
