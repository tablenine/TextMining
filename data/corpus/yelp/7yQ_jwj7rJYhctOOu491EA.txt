Let me say this...if I were rating Feast simply on the food, there is no question it would receive all five stars.  Unfortunately I am including service, so I can only give it two.  Generally the service is slow and inattentive.  We dined here at least once a month for the last few years and the service was consistently bad no matter which server we got, how busy it was or what night of the week it was  It was worth it , though, because the food was excellent and we really liked their wine list.  The last straw came for us not too long ago when my husband and I went there to celebrate my birthday on a Tuesday night.  I called during the day to verify they were open until 10:00.  We arrived at 9:10 and the host told us that they decided to close early that night and wouldn't seat us...despite the fact that there were many other people eating and some looked like they had only recently been seated.   We told them it was my birthday but the host was still very rude to us and we have gone from dining there at least twice a month, taking friends and loudly and proudly recommending it to telling folks it's not worth it.  If they can't take care of their customers, they're not worth my time or money.
