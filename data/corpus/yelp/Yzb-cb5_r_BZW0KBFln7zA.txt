quick review b4 i go to bed:. . after many friends raving about this place, i have to say it lived up to my expectations. the office burger was juicy, and i especially liked the arugula- nice touch!. . i find their seating/ordering arrangement kinda odd, but i guess it works. you have to just stand around and wait until a table opens up. our group got both the sweet potato fries and regular shoestring fries (which were too crispy for my liking). i'll be coming back and next time will be sure to try some of their rare beers.
