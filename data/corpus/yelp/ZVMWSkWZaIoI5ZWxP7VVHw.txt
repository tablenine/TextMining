Not that Canters really needs another review, but I do wonder, why are Jewish delis so incredibly BLAND and EXPENSIVE?  The only reason I am giving Canters two stars is for their delicious potato salad (the only thing I've found that I like there... although it costs $6 for a medium sized to-go container of it)... and they are OPEN 24 HOURS, so I had to give them something for that.  Cool to hang out at, but only if you don't mind spending too much money on so-so food.
