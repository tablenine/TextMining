Noode, the Midtown location, has one item that I cannot get enough of. Yeah, lomeins and basil rice are all good, but their Kimchi fried rice is out of this world. Take it from me -- the Korean who has eaten kimchi for the past 34 years and therefore smells like fermented cabbage. Noodle's kimchi fried rice is a big serving -- ask for beef instead of chicken or shrimp. Their beef is also marinated to accentuate the flavor of kimchi. Yes, it's time to preach the exotic taste -- and the unfortunate odor -- of Kimchi to the unconverted. Amen.
