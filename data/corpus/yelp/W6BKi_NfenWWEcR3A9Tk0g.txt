Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
I'm a returning customer of Porto's, but this is my first time at this location.  Let me just say...people line up at this place like the food is for free, but have some patience if you're a first time customer because the food is gooood AND there's like a TON of people working there and the line moves quite fast.  I love the cuban sandwich and the fried potato balls they have.  Again, why don't we have this in SF!
