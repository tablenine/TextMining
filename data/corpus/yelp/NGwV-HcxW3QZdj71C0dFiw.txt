OMG, this is soo delicious!!! I don't even live by here anymore and still make it out every now and then.  When you have guests from outta town, take them here, they will love Cuban food forever! Their pork &amp; chicken dish is juicy and flavorful and there ropa vieja is a classic dish.  Anything you order will be awesome, go there NOW!!!
