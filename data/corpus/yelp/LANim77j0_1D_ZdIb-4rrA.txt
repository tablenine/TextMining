super chill spot. dim lit. long benches. not bourgie. busy at night. happy people everywhere. located on a hidden street in little tokyo. . . this is a great place to have a beer with friends. the place your order food is separate from the bar spot. you bring your number over to the other side (the bar side) and wait to be served.. . i know the "exotic sausages" sound a bit frightening, but they're not at all. they taste like regular sausages, but with more spices. makes you wonder, "is it REALLY rattlesnake?" i had duck &amp; bacon, my bf had mango jalapeno. my cousins had rattlesnake (which was super good! it tasted like regular bratwurst, but with more flavor. more spices). in addition to the sausages, we also had the fries. oOh the fries! the fries are served with your choice of sauce (which there are a BUNCH to choose from). they all tasted pretty good. can't remember which ones i tasted, because there was about 6 on our table. hehe. so, just try them all! if any of you have been to Pomme Frites in new york, these fries would be comparable. mMmm!. . on to the libations. thanks to my cousin, i discovered my new favorite beer: Tripel Karmeliet. there's a pretty good selection of beer here, but the tripel karmeliet was my favorite one. i had a couple of those. initially, i had the St. Louis Framboise, which is always good. not much alcohol, but it's tasty heh. they also let you taste all the beers if you aren't sure which one you want, so taste away!. . i am a fan of this spot, for sure.
