I've been here a few times mostly just to drink.  This last weekend I went there to eat.  There is a long bar that seats quite a few people, and when I've been here before it can get really packed on a Friday or Saturday, but we were here on a Sunday so it wasnt that busy.. . I had the jambalaya and a few pints of Guiness.  The jambalaya was good, if a little soupy, but the portion was a little lacking.  I think it was $13.95 and for the portion I got, it should be maybe a dollar or two less, or better yet, give me more!. . Our waiter was always there to get us more drinks and even made a dinner selection for me, which was helpfull.  Overall I like this place and will continue paying a visit every once in a while when I'm in the neighborhood.
