A long time ago, I think I could have been blown away by this place, but I just can't get over the closeness of the tables and loud atmosphere.  I also got cold water sloshed on me by a passing waiter without notice or apology, so that didn't help.  I just think it was too 'busy' for my taste, but some people like that, so take it as you may.. . The food is average Italian fare.  We had the bruschetta appetizer, which I recommend, and I had some kind of pasta with sausage, which was kind of light on tomatoes and lacked enough flavor.  The table bread wasn't anything special.
