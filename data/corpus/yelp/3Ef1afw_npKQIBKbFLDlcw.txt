Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's is packed... ALL THE TIME.  However, the food is really good, I tend to order the same items over and over once I find something I like, however, everyone that I have dined with @ Porto's loves what they order.. . This is a cafe, bakery, coffee place, the food is made to order, I always order the Southwest Steak Salad, which is wonderful.  The tri-tip is amazing, the dressing is good, and they are not stingy on any aspect.  The price is right also.  (Just note, you line up, order, take a number, find a seat, and the server will bring your order.). . I have also tried cheese cake from the bakery, which you have to line up for, along with everything else, however, fret-not, the lines move very fast.  This place is used to dealing with the masses.  . . I -highly- recommend this place!!
