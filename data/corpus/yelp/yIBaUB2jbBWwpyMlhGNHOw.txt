Bomb onion rings, nice ketchup. Fries good, but not amazing. I wanted the Truffle burger but it was 86'd. I got the Port and Stilton and it was super delicious, nice balance of sweet, salty and stinky cheese.  The staff were really nice and funny, they even asked this guy in the parking lot to scooch over his  SUV so we could get a place. I'll have to revisit this joint next time I'm in LA, only, not so hungover, and hopefully, get me a truffle burger.
