Restaurant: Wisteria
Category: American (New)
What I like about Wisteria is that it is a classy restaurant with dishes that burst with flavor, but they still give relatively generous portions.  One of my pet peeves of dining at nice restaurants is spending a fortune, and leaving hungry.  I'm also a king of all things leftover. So after dining at Wisteria once, and eating it twice, they are still awesome.. . The decor is downplayed, earthy, and warm. It fit well with our waiter who was friendly and accommodating.  Overall, we had a good experience here and I would recommend it to friends.
