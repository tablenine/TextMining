Restaurant: Francesca&#39;s Forno
Category: Italian
This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants.  I've been here about twelve times, and I like everything I've ever gotten here.  Celebrated many a birthday, anniversary, you name it, and everybody i bring loves this place as well.  The menu is small, but everything is delectable (particularly the daily risotto--changes often but is always delicious!).  The service is always entertaining and friendly, and on Monday nights they have half-price bottles of wine (always a good time).  Being a poor student who likes to eat out, it's important to find places that serve high-quality dishes for reasonable prices--francesca's forno is one of them.  The wine can get pricey, but if you jsut come for the food you'll leave fat and happy, without having spent your whole month's budget.  Will keep going back for whenever I need a trendy, not-too-expensive, and delicious italian meal
