This place is cool because you can eat waffles covered in maple wyrup with fried chicken.  that is so decadent.   However that's about it.  don't  particulary think that their fried chicken is that great. If i wanted fried chicken i'd so somewhere else but if i wanted to eat waffles with fried chicken, i would eat here.
