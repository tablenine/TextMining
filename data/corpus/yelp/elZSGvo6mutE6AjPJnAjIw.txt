Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
I have no idea what classifys anything as argentinian food let alone authentic.. . This place is good and good looking. perfect place to take a date without blowing up your wallet or after a long day of shopping in melrose.. . im down with the milenesa, couple it with some empanadas, a salad etc and your are set.
