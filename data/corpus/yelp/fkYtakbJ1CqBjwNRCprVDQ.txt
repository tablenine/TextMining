Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
i had a burger there a few months ago and the it was really good, i don't mind spending a few extra bucks for a really good burger. They also had mexican coca cola which is great. The fries didn't have anything special to them, so you won't miss nothing if you don't other them. The service there was good, the servers there were nice. Overall this is good place to go to if you're really craving a good burger.
