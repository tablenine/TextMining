Strongbow on tap + a gorgeous early summer night +a spacious patio = a very happy Kristin B.. . This was the perfect spot to catch up with some friends on a Monday night, and I would definitely return on another weeknight.  The crowd was low key, though the bar was still pretty full for 11pm on a Monday.  Our glasses were promptly cleared away, and the bartenders took good care of our group.. . We grabbed a barrel table high top on the patio, and happily passed a couple of hours chatting and drinking under the stars.
