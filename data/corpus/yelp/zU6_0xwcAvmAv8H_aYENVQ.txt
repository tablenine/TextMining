It's a Taco Truck with Korean BBQ inside the tacos. The service is great, all things considered and the food is delicious. Added bonus, I wasn't sick later, which means it was cooked relatively sanitarily. (Is that even a word?). . Add that to the prices and well you're going to have a great night. Be warned though, don't buy the sodas. $2 for a can, I mean, really? Still the food is worth having. This is definitely a place to return to.. . (So, thanks to Anabelle for forcing me to use this as a bribe to get her to come to Cerritos; I never would have found out about this place if not for her.)
