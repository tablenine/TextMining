Oh my god, I did not even know this place served food!  What an ass.. . In my defense though, we were here late at night and basically took advantage of the martini menu, which was tasty and only $8.  After a very "LA" kind of weekend, Birds was an awesome relief:. . Cheap Drinks. Fun Decor. Plenty of Seating. Chill Patrons. . And the Scientology freakshow across the street was a fantastic photo op!  Too bad the bike cops hang out on every street corner and every move you make is monitored by cameras.  Creepy.. . Anyway, Birds -- rockin' good time for a bar!  Apparently you can get food too!  Double Yay!
