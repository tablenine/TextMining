If you don't mind the crowds and the noise, you and your friends'll enjoy yourselves here- the service was good (I found the staff here to be friendly and knowledgeable) and the food impressed - there's usually decent street parking around here at night - just walk a block or two.. One of the better semi-pricey trendy bistros. Â For now.
