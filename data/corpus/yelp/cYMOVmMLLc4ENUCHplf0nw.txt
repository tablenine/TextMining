Could go to 4, because it's a cool looking place, but I'll say 3.5 for the onions.. . Like I said, it's a cool looking place. Granted, the floor plan is odd, but it works once you know it. Outside seating, communal tables, smallish area near the register. Interesting, no?. . It is pricey. Which I think kind of sucks, but in L.A., a lot of food is sold on price rather than taste, so yeah. . . I got the hot italian sausage with sweet peppers. The peppers were not completely cooked, but I liked that. I wished they were sliced a little thinner, but I worked with it. The sausage was good. I've had better italian sausage, but I like the slight heat in this. The bun tasted good, but I found it sort of rough. . . My friend got the veggie version of the sausage with caramelized onions... or almost cooked onions in this case. . . The fries, or whatever they call them, are great. The dipping sides of chipotle ketchup (good) and tomato/mayo (amazing) are a pleasant surprise. . . All in all, lots of variety, neat place to go to, lots of people watching and neat list of beers.. . It's so close to Little Tokyo, though, I might be tempted to skip this and go there. Or not. Good  to live a little, right?
