If you can't make it to the "true" Roscoe's on Pico, this is an OK bet. The neighborhood, decor and clientele don't have as much flavor, but it is easier to find parking. . . Also, your chances of getting shot are significantly lower here, and some people are into that sort of thing. Keep in mind that this location closes too early to be a late night spot, unless you consider 9pm to be late night. This helps account for the shooting stats.
