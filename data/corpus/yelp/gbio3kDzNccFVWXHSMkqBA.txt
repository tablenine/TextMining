Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
Crowded, loud, and overrated.  Even though we made reservations, we had to wait an hour before being seated.  And no wonder it took so long... the waiter came to us only to take our order and bring us our food!  Cool vibe &amp; ambience (loved the vintage photos on the wall!), but the selection of tapas weren't great, and the price certainly doesn't make up for it.  However, the sweet potato fries and garlic mushrooms were great.
