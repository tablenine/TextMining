I love Agave. Great food and a pretty unique atmosphere. Tasty margaritas, yummy guacamole and great entrees. I've had the fried chicken, which was amazing, as well as the meatloaf, which was also good. Also, the raspberry margarita cheesecake was solid. Overall a hard to beat experience if you're around the Inman Park/Grant Park/Cabbagetown area.
