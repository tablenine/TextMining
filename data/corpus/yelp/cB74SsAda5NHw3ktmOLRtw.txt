I LOVE GARLIC! no, seriously, I love them to death and I honestly think food just taste ten times better when you have garlic in it. You would think that if every entree had garlic in it, it would be too overpowering, however, I didn't feel like that at all!!! . . Loved the spread they first serve you. it's like garlic in oil and you spread it over the complimentary bread, so good! The lamb was FANTASTIC!!! The garlic fries were SOOOo good! Even the garlic ice cream was good!. . I definitely want to come again when my brother decides to visit from hawaii. =) I LOVE Garlic!
