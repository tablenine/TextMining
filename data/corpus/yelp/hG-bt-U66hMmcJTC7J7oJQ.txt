I like this place because of the atmosphere, but the food is hit or miss.  I've had their burger, which was pretty mediocre, nothing special.  I didn't feel the urge to eat the whole thing.  Their rotisserie chicken is very tasty, especially when dipped in that super zesty garlic aioli.  . . I had lunch there today with my mom and sister.  Mom and sister both got the pulled pork sandwich, which I wanted to get too, but we couldn't all get the same thing, right?  I ordered the smoked pastrami sandwich.  The pastrami was pretty tasty.  Very thinly sliced and jam-packed into the bread, but the bread quickly fell apart and I was left with a mountain of pastrami.  I think better bread (like maybe some rye?) would make this sandwich killer.  . . My mom's pulled pork sandwich was definitely the winner.  The pork was very soft and delicious, and the vinegary sauce that comes with it is the perfect compliment.  Again, the sandwich fell apart because of the bread.  They just need better bread!  . . I usually love their fries, but they were a little dry and over-fried today.  In any case, their chipotle ketchup saved them. . . All in all, the food is 3.5 stars (sometimes it's a 4, other times it's a 3).  I love the atmosphere of this place, especially if it's not overly crowded.  The staff is nice, and I like that I brought our dog to the patio and no one said anything.  I guess being the beer fanatic that I am, I love that this place not only serves beer, but has happy hour. They even serve local Eagle Rock brews.  . . If you come to the Oinkster, order the pulled pork sandwich.  You won't be disappointed.
