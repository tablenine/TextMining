The Skinny = Amazing!!! . . More on that in a bit.. . HUB51 opened over in the North Loop a little over a year ago and still remains a trendy atmosphere today, even if that's mostly at night.  During the day, it's a normal busy restaurant that turns to almost club-like proportions at night.  . . The menu is a hodgepodge variety of food, from salads to tacos.  It changes slowly and they're slowly getting it centered.  The guac is awesome with roasted corn at the bottom and comes out fresh.  The tacos are tasty and there's a variety to choose from.. . However, the Skinny is my go to choice.  A burger with a really thing, large patty, covered in creamy cheese with the sweetest of onions.  As odd as it sounds, this is a burger that tastes even better as a left over.  Not sure why, but it does.  Possibly because the Skinny is only that in appearance as it packed with flavor.. . For a place over in River North, sure, it's got the club crowd flocking to it, but that's just because it makes them look good.  HUB51 does do it's menu right and puts out some really good food.  It can get a little noisy at night, so hit it up during lunch.
