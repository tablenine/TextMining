Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
I didn't mind this place.  I liked our server and really enjoyed my tomato rice soup along with my grilled cheese sandwich.  Its just a basic, cheapy diner.  . . BUT. There is a new section where it looks like they took over the space next door and we were seated there.  I hated this space with the heat of a thousand suns.  It was remodeled in an extremely ugly way with some walls purplish grey and others light blue.  Lighting was bad and the entire back of the room (where we sat) was dim even during a bright, sunny day. The wood trim was this glossy pale blonde colour and there was this weird thing on the wall that looked like strips of wood framing a beer tap handle.  Awful.  I will try to forgive a lot of mistakes in restaurant decor, especially in a diner setting, but this was too much.  It is so bad that if we went back and they tried to put us over there a second time, I would leave.   It was bad SOBER, I cant imagine how much worse it would be if I were drunk.  . . Seriously.  Clarke's for chrissake if you are listening, I will help you fix up that side FOR FREE.  This is an experienced interior designer talking. Dear lord, dont put any more people through that. Do you have a sudden upsurge with inebriated people vomiting everywhere? Yeah, its probably from that room.
