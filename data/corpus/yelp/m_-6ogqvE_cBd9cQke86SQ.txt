Classic! Good rubber dogs and great fries! This place gets tons and tons of business.. If your runnin there for lunch, plan on standing in line. They dont have ketchup.. Dont ask! Be ready to order when you get up to the counter, these guys/girls are amazingly FAST!!! This shouldnt be a problem since your slections are... Hot dog, hot dog, hot dog or tamale.. Don't plan on eating there unless you are going to sit in your car in the lot. Grab your dog and run!
