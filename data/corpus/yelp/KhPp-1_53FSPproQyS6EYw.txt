I'm being sort of generous with the 3 stars.  But the dishes that were good...were very good so it helps a lot.. . Generally I get a little worried if I go into a Thai restaurant and there are no Thai staffers and no Thai customers.  My doubts grew even stronger when our waiter couldn't properly pronounce any of the dishes AND informed us they don't serve Thai iced coffee or Thai iced tea.  So it wasn't starting out so hot.. . The decor is very modern and white and sleek.  But when you actually look at it, it's almost all white plastic lawn furniture.  No one's coat would stay on the back on the chairs and we were all scooping coats off the floor throughout the meal.. . We had a large group so we tried a lot of appetizers.  I think the stand outs were definitely the crispy ginger calamari.  The avocado dipping sauce was scrumptious.  We sort of fought for it, as there wasn't quite enough.. . The other winner was the crispy chicken wings.  The sauce on the wings had the right kick and the group agreed it was a winner.. . For en tree's I won't cover all 8 dishes.  Only a few were really enjoyed.  Luckily mine was one of them.  I had the braised duck in pinot noir.  The sauce was wonderful and the duck was nice and tender.  They were also pretty generous with the portion as I had enough to take home for lunch.. . Pad Thai was a total loss.  I've had better at mall food courts.  If that's any indicator.  LOL  . . I will say that they had a very lounge like feel. There were music and videos on plasma screen and pretty young hipster sort of crowd.. . I think if I'd come for just drinks and maybe a lite bite this place would have fared much better.  But I wouldn't bank on getting really great Thai food from Sura just yet.
