A lot of people have recommended this place as the place for ramen but I've only been here a couple of times. The ramen here is pretty decent and the serving is huge. The set option is a good value if you are a big eater because you get a mini side bowl of choice. This place is always bustling with business but I don't think this place has enough seating for the number of customers that they get everyday. There are a bunch of booths that seat 4 comfortably as well as counter seats. The counter seats are a little awkward though, because the table space isn't very wide.. . While I do like the ramen here and the mini side "don's" are tasty too, but what turns me off about this place is that there is always, always, always a huge line. Sometimes when I'm ready for some dinner, I just don't want to wait that long for it. There is a default clipboard sitting right at the entrance for you to write your name down. Ramen's good, but not good enough for me to wait (what seems like an eternity) for it.
