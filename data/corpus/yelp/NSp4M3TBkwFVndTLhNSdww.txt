For a lover of all things breakfast, their menu looked mighty promising, especially since they serve breakfast all day. Pancakes galore. I ordered the almond peach pancakes to go with my breakfast special... unfortunately, WAY too many almonds in the pancakes. I couldn't taste the peach at all. Get this if you're a lover of almonds... it just wasn't for me. I choose poorly. . I won't hold this against them though. . . Their turkey sausage was divine. Their red velvet was good, I don't believe it's deserving of the praise it receives on here, but it was decent. Moist cake, good frosting. . . I would give this place a 3.5, but i rounded up because the service was good and their menu showed a lot of potential to be fantastic with items like butterscotch banana pancakes and coconut pineapple macadamia pancakes. . . PARKING: At 7p on a sunday, there was available street metered parking, after 8pm, most meters are free. make sure you keep a watchful eye on the signage though. It changes from block to block.
