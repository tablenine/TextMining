I've been dining at RFD for years and its always good food with a large selection of choices.  I love that they've changed the menu to include more raw food!  With so much GMO and irradiated food around these days it's so good to know a restaurant takes pride in sourcing organic and natural ingredients.  Everything I've tried has been good but I've never been brave enough to try anything with tofu!
