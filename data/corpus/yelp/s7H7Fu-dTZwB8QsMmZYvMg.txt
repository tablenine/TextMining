TWO WORDS: Hard.  Liquor.  Separately, great but together, it's an ode to joy.  . . This location has the original Santa Monica FO beat for several reasons (in addition to the obvious, see above):. . (1)  Bigger = more seating means not as many hairy eyeballs on me from those who wish to sit and are jelly of my table.  . . (2)  Better = they have outdoor seating so I can enjoy my burger in the out-of-doors and it also alleviates the place from getting too crowded which increases the number of hairy eyeballs you get when you have a table.  . . (3)  Did I mention the hard liquor?  Geez, I sound like an alkie.  Good thing I am one or else I would be worried about my image.
