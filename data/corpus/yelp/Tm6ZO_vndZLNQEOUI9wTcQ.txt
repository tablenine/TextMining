Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
This place has a huge selection of beautiful cake slices, desserts, and fresh sandwiches.  There is always a long line within the store.. . My favorites are potato balls, fruit tarts, and black forest cake.  I get craving for their desserts occassionally and would drive out there and bring home a box of desserts.. . Bottom line is, you must CHECK IT OUT!!!
