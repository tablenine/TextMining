This place is OVERRATED!  . . So you hear celebrity this celebrity that, and you think, maybe celebrities have a more sophisticated palate.  WRONG.  We often times forget that celebrities were once wannabe's that came to Hollywood with a pair of Rayban's and just enough tanning oil to land a gig on Beverly Hills as an extra.  Don't get me wrong, I love the persistence and talent these people bring, but come on, I think that I've been brainwashed in LA for too long if I come to the conclusion that something must be good if celebrities go there.  Time to detox.... . But seriously, the food is ok, but never worth the hype.  I've been here many times simply because friends from out of town heard about it through another gullible tourist and begged, borrowed, and dealed their way into my heart to go.  The service could certainly be better as most of the servers think they are entitled to massive tips, and the food is just above average.  You know, 7 inches.. . Oh, sitting inside is depressing, and sitting outside kills you as the smog from 3rd Street blasts you as the traffic rolls on by.
