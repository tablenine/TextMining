This place has the worst service I've ever experienced.  the vegan deserts are okay but everything else is average to below average.  this place is supposed to be vegan friendly but their are just a few vegan versions of a not vegan menu.  i ordered the "vegan" Benedict which was served on a thomas' English muffin which is not even vegan.  the vegan version of the veg-sub sandwich was disgusting.  the servers are rude and hiding somewhere most of the time.  I would not recommend eating here.
