The first thing I thought when I dined here on Saturday night was, "Wow.  This place is super dark."  It wasn't even nicely dim.  It was was just plain dark.  It was so dark in fact, that when our waiter came to re-fill my BF's water glass, he poured water into his beer glass instead.  That was pretty funny.  He did however, bring another beer, which was very awesome of him.  . . Aside from the obscure atmosphere, the food was excellent.  I ordered off the Prix Fix menu and got the truffle mac &amp; cheese and the Kobe meatballs over linguine.  Very tasty.  At first I thought there wasn't enough truffle oil in my mac &amp; cheese, but man, there was plenty in my pasta, which I enjoyed very much.  Not to mention, the surprisingly sweet meatballs were extremely tender.  My boyfriend got the spiced pork chop, which I didn't try, but he seemed to enjoy it tremendously.  He has a very experienced palate, so I'd take his occasional, "Damn this is good," statement in between bites as a positive sign.  . . Toward the end of our meal, they finally decided to illuminate the place by turning on strings of white light bulbs above us.  Apparently, it was Earth Day and it was lights out for an hour that evening.  It would've been nice to be informed of that when we arrived by the hostess.
