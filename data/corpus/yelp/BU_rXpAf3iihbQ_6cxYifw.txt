By far this place is the best Cajun seafood place in the Los Angeles area! My husband and I went there for late Saturday lunch yesterday and it was da bomb. Fried Catfish cooked to perfection! Spicy Cajun fries, Boiled shrimp with the whole sha-bang seasoning (XXX), Raw oyster doesn't get any fresher than this. Â Even though it was like 2:30pm when we got there, the place was packed and we had to wait like 30 minutes for the table but it was all worth it. Great service too.
