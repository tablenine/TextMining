I want to give them more stars - i really do.  Am a huge fan of Brick Store and Leon's has several things going for them.  I'm pretty sure i will be able to upgrade the rating after trying them again, but it stands at 3 now.  . First off, we went on a saturday night - super packed and hopping.  We had to wait for over an hour, but were able to grab a small area at the bar and ordered apps and drink to tide us over.  I loved the bar and restaurant in general - i hope the doors will open during nicer weather.  The beers were great - as is to be expected.  Apps were frites (which was the winner), goat cheese pappadews (these were ok, but nothing special) and lug nuts - quite tasty cashews with rosemary.  . Dinner, at least mine, was really what caused the lower star rating.  I had the steak, which i asked for medium well and it came back (after quite a long wait) WELL done as in hockey puck style.  It was served with some sort of little zucchini quiche that tasted like it could have come out of the frozen food section in the grocery store.  . Bottom line - great atmosphere, friendly service, fab beers and i think if you stick with the sandwiches on the menu, you'll be quite happy.  Just don't expect this to be Cakes and Ale.
