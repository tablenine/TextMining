All the reviews here have already stated what I would write. . . I just want to be on record as saying - as a 100% vegetarian (and a 90% vegan - Mom's Christmas cookies can't be passed up ) Thank God for this place!!! And the one in Santa Monica too!. . I've just been going down the menu, and haven't had anything twice yet. Not that it isn't tempting to, I just love the variety!. . Maybe someday, it'll show up in the Valley!!!
