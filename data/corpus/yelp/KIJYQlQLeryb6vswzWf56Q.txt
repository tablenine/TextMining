KOGI!. this is my second time eating there food. this second time i didn't even know that they were in eagle rock. i was just going to wash my car but but i couldnt just pass by and not get one.. and so i did. i got Â 2 bbq pork and 2 spicy bbq chicken. they were great. i was fortunate that the line wasnt long. but when i tried to go back to get some more , the line went around the block! i saw channel 7 covering it and man i blame them for the long line!!! . . giving them 5 stars for the food. . conveniece? well thats up in the air...
