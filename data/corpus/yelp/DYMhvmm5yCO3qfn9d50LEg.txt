I have always been a fan of the GI!  Despite their recent troubles, I have not a single issue with going there again and again.  Always great service and impeccable food.  Gotta love the saganaki.  Gotta love the history.  Gotta love the atmosphere.  Parking is a breeze.. . Just don't like the wait.  If Dean Richards loves it, I love it because I love Dean Richards!  OOOOOPPPPPPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
