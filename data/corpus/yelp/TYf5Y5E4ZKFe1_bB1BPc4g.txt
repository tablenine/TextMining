Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I was in LA in october 07 (sorry for the review delay) and being a huge fan of fried chicken...my buddy insisted that I go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.. .   I remember our table being filled with Chicken, gravy, potatoes, french fries, biscuits, and of course waffles. Yes we had a tremendous amount of food coma after wards.. .   However, when I look back at it. Roscoe's really isn't that great. My chicken was small and dry...extremely dry. Which required me to douse gravy all over all of it in order for it to be a little more edible. The chicken also lacked a lot or any seasoning, which again required use of plenty of gravy to make up for it. The biscuits, waffles, and mashed potatoes on the other hand were good. Pricing, we at a lot, but we  also ended up spending like $20 a person. . . The service at Roscoe's was also not that great either. When I look back now at how much I spent, and the food quality I got. I think I would've been better off going to Popeyes for the chicken and sides, and getting some Eggo waffles from the grocery store. I would've gotten the same amount of food, perhaps better quality (at least chicken), and probably would've saved $5-7. . . So I have to give Roscoes 3 stars. You get a lot of food, but you pay a lot for it too, and nothing really stands out for good or bad.  I might find myself at Roscoe's next time i'm in LA, in hopes that I just maybe got an old batch of chicken, and hopefully they redeem themselves.. . ~G
