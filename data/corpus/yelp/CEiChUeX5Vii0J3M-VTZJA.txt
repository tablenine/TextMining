Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
Spago is the epitome of fine dining.   Every detail is attended to: . . Atmosphere - the vibe, the terrific art collection, great lighting, nice bar. Service - 100% perfect job,  unobstructive and very professional . Food - each dish was a work of art and used the freshest ingredients. Wine-  one of the best wine lists I have seen in the US. . I am so mad I didn't come here sooner.. . Try the cookie plate for dessert.
