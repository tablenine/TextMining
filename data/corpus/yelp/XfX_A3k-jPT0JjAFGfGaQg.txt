So many factors make this place a favorite, to many to even mention actually.  A few being:  Its a block away from my house... owned and run by the absolutely cutest cuban family Ive ever met... food is great and the quality never waivers... and my favorite being that it is still completely under the radar (location maybe?) and I can always get a table.. . Yucca Frites, need I say more?  Spot on.  All the time.  My biggest advice for ordering is to stick to the hyper-traditional stuff offered, dont be shy and just stick to sandwiches; because this is definitely a great place to feel adventurous and try some new stuff.  Cuban beers are also on the menu, which I had never been exposed to, and was pleasantly surprised by.. . Oh, and the place to sit is the patio... it adds an ambiance of what a true neighborhood restaurant is suppose to be.. . Cheers.
