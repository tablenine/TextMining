Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
im sorry but this place is ghetto. i dont trust the salsas sitting out on a warm day especially ones that have dairy in it safe. each bowl sat in a larger bowl of half melted ice.. . the fish tacos aren't that bad if you eat them right away. i made the mistake of taking them home and eating them soggy. i didn't like the shrimp taco. it was whatevs. and "the best" fish tacos were far from deelish. they were just alright. i've had better from rubios and i don't even like rubios THAT much.. . the employees aren't even friendly. they seem to hate their lives like w(hy)tf am i working here for? . . prices are cheap. the place looks dirty. it's a freakin restaurant for gawdsake! tidy it up a little. . . i would never come back here again. it's just gross. calling themselves "the best" is srsly mental.
