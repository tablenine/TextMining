Does the world really need another Bottega Louie review?. . Why, yes it does!!. . What I liked:. 1) Food. 2) Price (good value. I'd say one of the best bangs for you buck). 3) Service. 4) Open kitchen (watch 'em make your food). 5) Scene ( quite a mix of hipsters, after-work crowd, couples, and small groups). . What I didn't like:. 1) Accoustics -- way too cavernous and echoey. 2) Length of wait (over an hour on a Thursday night, and they don't take reservations). . We ordered 4 different things, and all of it was good, though some were a bit overrated. The portobello mushroom fries were good enough, but not worth ordering again for $9. I expected more out of the pizzas but they were tasty nonetheless. If you can't decide between two types, ask them to go half-n-half -- I love that option!. . I was pleasantly surprised by the steamed clams in tomato broth, and the beet salad. Also, the French macaroons at the bakery were scrumptious! They are $1.75 a piece, but worth it if you're waiting for a table.
