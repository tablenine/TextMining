Good Pizza, but not the  best I've ever had.. . The staff is friendly and helpful and the food (especially the salad) is quite tasty, but it's not the type of place I'd drive out of my way to go to. . . The toppings were good and they had some interesting combinations on their menu; but the crust IS very thin and not very flavorful so even ppl like me who love NY style might be disappointed.  A big nod for their upscale/gourmet approach, but without a good foundation..... . I'm told that I missed out by not ordering the fresh baked cookies so maybe the next time I'm in the area..... . PS:  One Great Thing.....I ordered the 10" bbq chicken pizza, (which is named the John Lee Hooker - after the famous blues guitarist) and had a great laugh when I looked at my reciept and saw that I had purchased a "small hooker" for $8.95.  LOL!
