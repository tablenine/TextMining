Whoever likes this place must have poor taste. The only thing they got right was the cocktail my friend ordered. We had the artichoke and ravioli tapas. HORRIBLE and over priced 'bar food'. The worst part was their Thai Beef Salad. The beef is cured as they tell you AFTER you get the salad but it is really gross raw beef that looks more like garbage. The dressing was enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth, the figs aren't fresh and the noodles are not even authentic thai noodles and I think there was some sort of Ramen seasoning on them. We had a few bites of it and pushed it aside. If you are into trashy food that you can get better at a drive through fast food joint then go for it. We went to Rosebud to get real good food after this. Oh and don't get the coffee, it is enough to make you gag.. . GROSS!
