I'm going to incur the wrath of fellow yelpers and friends by saying that this place is genuinely better than South Coast.. . On a Monday evening, it was crammed with a good natured and buzzy crowd. we got a table (at 6.30ish) but there were people queueing by 9, and it's a Monday. there's a message there somewhere.... . It's BYOB and they even chill the bottles-in-waiting! BYOB is stlll a novelty for me so forgive the excitement but it makes this place such good value. I was expecting a bill of twice what we paid, and wouldn't have had a problem paying it. Chuck in your best bottle and it's still a bargain.. . The sushi tastes like fish, rather than all the (deep-fried) extras that come in the special rolls In the black dragon you could taste the tobiko, and the shrimp and the avocado and the tempura. The eel was beautifully eel-y. The hurricane was especially good. I'd complain that the edamame was bland but what's a little salt between friends. . . A fantastic evening. Service a little slow but they let us keep a table for 3 hours with no complaints and a slice of cheesecake (to usher us out, no doubt, but better than an order to leave). Warning - spicy mayo nearly blew my head off.
