Had my first cup of coffee there today and loved it! My BF and I just got a new coffee maker and so wanted some really good beans. We went there to sample what kind we wanted. We each got a different kind using the clover method [which is about 1/2 the price of any other kind of method] I got an Ethiopian and he got a Bolivian. We also shared a plate of the donut holes which were so amazing. My coffee was a little too nutty for my tastes, but the Bolivian was amazing. I am docking one star because we asked for a lb. of the Bolivian and they were out which was disappointing because we went there to taste! . . Service was great, I didn't see too many pretentious people [though there was a porn starish looking couple next to us dressed in clubbing clothes]. . Will for sure go back for more coffee
