Boy do I need to yelp on this place! The food is ordinary and greasy, I tried the crab, chicken, and noodles. The best thing there were the garlic noodles. Everything was buttery greasy though. They neglected to tell us that the garlic noodles had Parmesan cheese and when we asked the waiter he was all snooty about the secret kitchen and not knowing because only family members are allowed in there. Geez, health concerns people! I went with a co-worker who is allergic to cheese.. . Everything was overpriced...i usually don't mind if the food makes up for it but I would only go back for the garlic noodles as take out(greasy as well). . . The service sucked ass. The waiter kept trying to push drinks on us etc. And the all the waiters and waitresses were in these silk outfits that they look ridiculous in. I take offense when they are trying to be too asian--its so fake!! I think there is some closet full of silk outfits that don' treally fit anyone but they are required to wear them. Overall bad service. Only redeeming thing was the noodles. Don't waste too much money here, its not worth it.
