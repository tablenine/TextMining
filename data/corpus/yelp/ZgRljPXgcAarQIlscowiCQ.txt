Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Five stars because I love the food and beer, and the service was great when I ate there (note that I ate 11am on a Sunday, and was one of three tables). . The sandwiches are amongst the best I've had.  It's a ton of options, but it's not that intimidating once you figure out what meat you want.  I had steak with avocado, cilantro, spicy sauce, etc.; my wife had the fish special. Both were really great.  the fish was high quality than expected, very juicy.. . sides are the weak point.  mostly starches (mac and cheese, chips, cornbread, pasta/pot. salad, etc.), none tried were great.  would rather pay less and get less.. . pretzel appetizer was very good.. . really great beer list is not mentioned enough here.  not cheap but commensurate with quality and location.  Mind numbing variety to choose from, but 5 or 6 are recommended and all are great.. . Service was just fine when we were there, especially given the patience required to deal with the amount of details I forgot to figure out before ordering.  one side was wrong but quickly fixed.
