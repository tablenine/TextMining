Breads and pastries and macaroons, oh my!. . My Yelpy friends and I were working our company booth at the APEX career fair event over at the Wilshire Grand Hotel, but had neglected to eat lunch prior to the start of the event! Duh. After a while, the sea of job seekers had died down and we were able to break away. We had originally planed on walking down to Famima to pick up something quick. . . However, after walking to the corner across from Famima, we saw it. it was like a glowing marble palace on the horizon. I could hear the angel choir singing... "Ta-daaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" My Yelpy friend and I looked at each other and decided, "Bottega". We walked the extra block and a half over to Bottega and opened the flass door. The scent of freshly baked breads and pastries wafted through the doorway and danced around us like ballerinas. We roamed around, peering at the cases and the desserts and finally decided: sandwiches and dessert. We ended up with two sandwiches (the one I had was the dry salame and butter on a really skinny baguette) and two macaroons (lavender and passion fruit). Yum.. . The two girls and the guy helping us were all extremely friendly and helpful...service with a smile. :). . I'll be back, next time I'm downtown! 4 shakas!
