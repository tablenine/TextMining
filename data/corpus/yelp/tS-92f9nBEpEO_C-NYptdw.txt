Restaurant: Raging Burrito &amp; Taco
Category: Mexican
Wow, I can't believe we did not come here sooner! The weather was gorgeous on Sunday and my husband and I were both starving. Not wanting to go too far and more importantly have to wait, my husband said let's just go to Willy's. I had remembered seeing a few reviews for RB recently on YELP so we decided to give them a try and were very happy! . . Free  parking  lot behind the restaurant, however you have to pay the $5.00 upfront and when you return  within an hour &amp; a half you get it back. The patio was big, with lots of tables both in the sun and the shade. Our server was really nice and stayed on top of our beverages. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, but they also have a few different salsa/hot sauces on the table which is a big plus for me. My husband loves hot salsa so we always have to track down the waitress to get more. Our burritos were good, nothing extraordinary but I do like that they have wheat tortillas  and light sour cream so this was another plus in my book. . . We will defiantly be back to RB and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere next time the weather permits!
