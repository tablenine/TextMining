Rodan is OK.. . I've been there for dinner a couple of times. It's probably a good spot for a date. It's not too expensive (you can eat for under $10), and there are some fun drinks (get the grapefruit vodka-grapefruit juice-soda water one, yum), and pbr isn't $4. I had the fish and chips. It was a lot of food, but the "wasabi" fries were really just seasoned fries. They were still good, though. The music was good, the people weren't too annoying or pretentious, and the service was attentive, but laid back. My only real complaint is that even in broad daylight it's pitch black unless you sit directly next to the window.. . As a bar at night, Rodan is kinda lacking. People love themselves. The decor is neat, but definitely not all that people rave about. Ends up seeming like the place/the people there are trying way too hard. Also not much of a place to meet people, as they are always really secluded in their own groups. Might not want to count on having any conversation, either, since the music is really loud, even if the place is pretty empty. I might like it better at night if I get drunk before I go...
