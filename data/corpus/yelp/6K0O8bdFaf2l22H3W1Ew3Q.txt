Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I'm trying a new rule for my Yelp reviews: I must go to a place more than once before I review it. So now you know, my wonderful Yelpers, that Kellee S. is truly committed to letting you in on the ups and downs, and not the "they might have had a bad night" kind of reviews. . . SO, now that's cleared up...  . . I really dig Ugo: An Italian Cafe.  The times I have been the food has been awesome, the service friendly, and the atmosphere chill (which is just how I like it).  This last time I got the Rigatoni with Four Cheeses, which was just sublime.  The cheese was delicious but not too creamy, and the rigatoni had a nice al denti texture.  . . The wine we wanted to order was out of stock, but the waiter let us in on a tip - you can buy bottles from the place next door and bring them in with no corkage fee.  Yes, both places are owned by the same company, but whatever, I like it! We got the Protocolo red wine for $16.  Much milder than a normally like my red wines, but as a "house red" it was fine.  . . So far, everything I've eaten at Ugo's has been good, and it's a perfect spot for dinner before catching a movie across the street at the Pacific Culver City, or going to drink loads of wine down the street.
