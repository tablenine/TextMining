Lord have mercy, I'm really starting to feel like I hate everything.  I really don't but my goodness.  I'm a part of a Ladies Dinner Club and every month we get together for dinner and try new spots in the city.  In April we went to Woodfire Grill, apparently the chef is famous and yata, yata.  We had appetizers, I don't even remember what they were...well I can't remember what they were like.  Oh scallops, that's what I had, very mediocre.  I had pork of some sort for my dinner.  This place does little food.  You know what I'm talking about they put a piece of meat the size of your finger nail on this huge plate and throw in a green bean and piece of squash and there ya go, here is your fabulous meal.  I don't do little food, hey I'm a big gurl now.  Oooo and dessert, can we talk about dessert, why did we all look at that dessert crazy and no one ate it, it was some kind of dry cake, idk, but it needed improvement and some rum or chocolate sauce stat.  At any rate we ended up leaving paying about $100 per person which is more than we usually pay and I was straight up still hungry.  Overall, not impressed, I don't mind paying for outstanding food, but this was pretty far from outstanding in my opinion.
