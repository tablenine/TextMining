What a great find in downtown LA!  My fiance and I were on our way to the jewelry district and as we drove by B.L. I thought - that place looks like it's right out of New York!  We ended up parking not too far away and stopped in for a midday bite to eat.  The pastries looked amazing - I wish we had room for them!  We had the turkey avocado and tuna sandwiches which were great!  The deli case looks amazing as well - perfect for a picnic!. . As mentioned a few tmes here, the service really is amazing.  B.L. threw in a few side potato salads with our sandwiches - and they were dee-lish as well!  They carry Dr. Pepper in an old school glass bottle and when I asked to save it, our server washed it out and offered to wrap it up for me to go.  Now that really is service!. . Another note - the design/decor of the place is amazing.  Apparently it used to be a Brooks Brothers, but it feels like an old bank building complete with high ceiling with adorned crown moulding and marble floor.  The gold accents fit perfectly.  I can't wait to come back and try this place again!
