The ribeye here is most amazing thing in the world (ok, maybe just in Chicago, cause Peter Luger in Brooklyn is pretty awesome too...) It's on so many top lists for a reason!. . We also tried the wagyu beef sashimi, which I think is a little overhyped. Their crab cake was average. For sides, we got spinach, mushrooms, and fried rice, all of which tasted pretty standard (or rather, like how food drenched in butter should taste). The mushrooms come with a giant slab of butter on top, which I thought was unnecessary, cause they were good even without all that. For dessert, we had the King (which was only $6 and huge) and raspberry creme brulee -- both were very good. The bottle of wine that they recommended (a malbec, I think?) was great with the food.. . Oh yeah, they charge like, $3 for each sauce for the meat that you order. I think the meat is fine, even without any extra seasoning. . . I'd recommend coming here just for the steaks.. and the King.
