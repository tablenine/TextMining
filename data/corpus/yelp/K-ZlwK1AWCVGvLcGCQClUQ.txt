Cannot say enough great things about HC! My husband and I have been going there for a couple of years, and it never disappoints. Drinks are awesome, tequila hummingbird is being served right now, soo yummy! They change the menu quite often, so the drinks, and food can change after a few weeks. There is always a specialty cocktail for the day, and super fresh oysters! Try the tuna tartar, the cheese plate, def try softshell crab if avail. Halibut is awesome! Sitting at the bar is the best! Dont forget you can park in the parking garage behind the complex, and HC will validate. Still will be about 5 bucks. Great drinks, and very fresh seafood.
