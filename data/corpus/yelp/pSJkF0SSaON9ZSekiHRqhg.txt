This Mexican seafood restaurant has huge portions for a great price! To me, the food was decent but not great. I got a fish fillet and it was a bit salty but still had a good flavor. Next time I go I would probably just go for a margarita and appetizers.. . I need to amend this old posting. I go here all the time now for lunch and they have the best lunch deals. You have to ask for the lunch menu, but you get a HUGE portion for a great price. And you get so many fresh grilled veggies with your meal. Plus, the margaritas are YUMMY!
