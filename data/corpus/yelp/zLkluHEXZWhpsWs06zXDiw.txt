Restaurant: Urban Belly

I really enjoyed Urban Belly.  Bear in mind that it was a little like shopping on an empty stomach:  I'd been flying all day, the temperatures were dipping like they were showing off and I'd been doing some heavy lifting to boot. Urban Belly to the rescue, where the light, affordable and scrumptious fare made for just the kick in the pants I needed to get to feeling upright again.. . The place itself is simple and not overly zen: the large family style tables make for lots of conversations and shared apps and entrees, and to that end , we sampled an assortment of dumplings, veggies, rice dishes and other divine fare.  And on the other side, we walked out warm, braced from the cold, buoyed by the camaraderie borne out of a good meal, served hot, and plenty of time to kill.
