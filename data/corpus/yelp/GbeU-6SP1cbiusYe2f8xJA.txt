This place used to be a staple of my youth, but as I've moved away from seeing shows in the area I've gone here less and less, and on the rare occasions I do venture in now, I'm usually met with bad service and mediocre eats.  My personal favorite is the Zydeco chicken.  Every time I've had it it's good, and some of the desserts are decent too.  I'll still wander in if I have no other options but I certainly won't be making any special trips.
