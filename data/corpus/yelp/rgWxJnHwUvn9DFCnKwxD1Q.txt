I love this place.  Just remember not to eat before you come here.  A lot of meat and vegetables!  Vegetables are buffet style but meat, it comes to you and it's all you can eat!!!. We went to the one in Washington DC and it is nothing compare to the one in Beverly Hills.  Beverly Hills have a nicer and friendlier staff and somehow the food was better, maybe because I haven't had it in a while =)  It's a little pricey but it's so worth it.  Can't wait to go back!
