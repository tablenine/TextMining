ATMOSPHERE: Traditional table seating downstairs and upstairs. White table cloths. Candlelit. Simple and clean decor. I like it! Attire could be casual or dressy. . FOOD: Limited vegetarian options but there were some:. 1. Bread - complimentary. White bread which was soft and served with olive oil. Good flavor. . 2. Eggplant caviar - very garlicky but I liked it. I wish it would have more of the grilled flavor to it. Served with crostini.. 2. Baby spinach salad - the honey fig vinaigrette caught my eye. Not enough dressing so I couldn't appreciate it as the Gorgonzola and  mandarin oranges overpowered it, but light with nice flavors. A solid salad but nothing amazing. . The meat eaters both ordered the lamb and said it was very tasty.. SERVICE: Very, very good.  Our waitress knew everything about the menu and was very attentive. We had a gift certificate from Creative Loafing and we didn't end up using the whole $50 and they even validated it for what was left on it!! I was surprised they did that for us. . PARKING: Sparse!!!! A lot on the street but all the spots were taken already. . LOCATION: A bit hidden in downtown. On Peachtree after it makes a 90 degree and still continues as Peachtree. Confusing.... with lots of one way streets in the area. . CONCLUSION: Nice place and good food. I would come back! I want to try the paninis/sandwiches on their lunch menu.
