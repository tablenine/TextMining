Restaurant: West Egg Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I went here for the first time yesterday, which is amazing considering I live on the Westside, and love breakfast. . . We went around 8:45AM, and there was a very light crowd, so I was happy not to wait. . . Our server was extremely friendly, very nice, and quickly got us some coffees and orange juice. . . I liked the menu, lots of enticing options Â - black beans cakes, breakfast burrito, banana bread french toast, but I ended up going with the huevos tejanos. . . The eggs were cooked very well, with a nice mix of bell peppers, onions, and jalapenos, topped with a light salsa and a small dallop of sour cream. They were good. . . The potatoes were fairly outstanding. They were pre-cooked yukons (or some other small white potato), then it appears they chop them into large chunks and smash them down, cooking them on a griddle like you would do with hash browns. This results in a nice crust on the top and bottom, with warm, creamy potatoes in between. They could use a little seasoning, but they were executed well. . . The played the whole new Kanye album while we ate, which added an extra bit of funk to my breakfast, which we then wrapped up with a red velvet cupcake.
