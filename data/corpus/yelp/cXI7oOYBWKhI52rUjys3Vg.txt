Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I've been waiting for SOOO long to come and try DTF in LA after trying it for the first time in Taipei.   2 years later,  i finally got to try it.. . I love (Xiao Long Bao) XLB, and Din Tai Fung definitely knows how to make em.. . The wait to get seated was ridiculous.  lucky we got there just as they opened, cuz within 5 minutes the line was ridiculous.  The restaurant is divided up into two locations, one around the building from the toher, to accommodate the fat crowd.. . we ordered:. 3 orders of XLB - small and juicy. 1 order of pork/crab dumplings - what you'd expect. . Din Tai Fung doesnt have nearly as much selection as the one in taiepi does, but hell, I LOVE XLB so i'm sold. . Unforrtunately, at these prices its hard to come back frequently.
