This place is an easy 4.5 stars!  I don't know what to write, since I don't have anything snarky to say.. . The service is always excellent and accomodating.  The atmosphere is comfortable, intimate, yet spacious.  . . The food!  The food is so so good.  Grilled calamari, pumpkin/butternut squash ravioli, chicken pesto gnocchi, lobster/seafood risotto, awesome sorbets, limoncello...everything is incredible.  I have been here with a large group and I have been on a date.  Each time, the food is incredible, the portions are large, (one member of one of my parties is a YOOGE bodybuilder - and he was stuffed),  the prices are reasonable and the service is great.  One time, I crept into the restaurant dangerously close to closing time.  Rather than cussing me out, the hostess invited me in, explained the specials and made sure that I was well taken care of.  Who does that?  The folks at Sapori do, that's who!  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Come here!  You will be so glad you did and you will keep coming back.  In a city as large as Chicago and with as many food options as we have here, I repeatedly come back to Sapori.  . . Major plus: they offer a coupon that, for $63, gives you bruschetta, choice of salad, choice of pasta entree, dessert AND a bottle of wine.  $63.  For two people!  And all that food.  And, if you're really slick, you can tell the waiter you're using the coupon while your lady is powdering her nose.  You look like the big hero, she gets great food and your wallet isn't plotting a revolt.  Everybody wins.
