Coffee House on Sunset - R.I.P.  . . Once upon a time, you made the best cornflake french toast.  Tragically, I was the last to find out that you are no more, so I grudgingly set out to find your successor.  Down the boulevard at Fairfax, Yelp helped me find Griddle Cafe.  While it's known for their monstrous thick, fluffy pancakes (comparable to the dimensions of a large wheel of aged cheddar and entirely imaginable in feeding a Little League team), and although I didn't find what I was exactly looking for, secret handshakes and all, I DID find the crunchy "Peanut Bubba" french toast: thick brioche toast dipped in pb crunch and grilled to a brown crisp, sprinkled with powdered sugar and whipped cream... just what the cardiologist ordered.  . . A friend chose the brown-sugar baked "Banana nana" 3-stack which is freaking GREAT accompanied with the signature french pressed roast coffee.  If I ever moved to LA, I'd have to eat here once a week, then by sheer rapid weight gain, be forced to stalk Kirstie Alley, lobbying to be her fat girl sidekick.  . . Leftovers are 100% guaranteed and holds up well for a couple days if stored properly.  I'll never forget you, my dear Coffee House, but Griddle is my new crush where Scott (the coolest, cutest and nicest of the Griddle staff) takes care of all.
