"blahblahblahblahblahbl...Porto's is within walking distance from here...". . "WHAT?! We're going there!" . . I walked in to a Marie Callendar's feel of cluttered provincial decor filled with cold and detached city folk behind the counters. So not provincial country.... . I heard so many good things about this place and I imagined it to be all warm and cozy and filled with smiles and love. Instead, the customers are climbing over each other in the lines and the bakers are climbing over each other behind the display wall of baked delights. . . "Not too impressive," I thought as I left the place with three bags of baked goodies. Baggies filled with recommended favorites tossed with a sprinkling of pretty little desserts covered in flowers. Potentially dangerous accostation of my taste buds.. . And then, here's my favorite part:. . I was driving. My passenger had a voracious appetite. He started tasting the delights we purchased. He set up the best bites for me to take while driving. I tasted not only the bakers' masterpiece but my friend's rendition of the favorite parts of the treats. . . Cheese Stick. mini bites. Marvelous.. . Guava Cheese Danish. Gobbled it all up.. . Potato Ball. Mmmm. Poked at the Korean heart we possessed. Good, good, good, damned good! . . Fruit Tart. As flavorful and delicious as we'd want from a mini fruit tart.. . If only the robotic bakers could learn to be the well liked and cute bakers in the provincial town... Now I see why the servers could be so cruel and robotic. . . The flavor of the bakery speaks for itself. It's so overpoweringly great that nothing else really matters. . . heavenly yummies. . . :)
