FRED is never DEAD, after a long night out on the town. lol. . I love hitting up Fred 62 for breakfast @2:00am (OMG I can just taste my last meal), the service is efficient, the latte is just right and the crowd is so awesomely eclectic (for those people watchers) and that's all the reason I love being there!  . . It can get loud with the drunks around that time but I've never seen anyone get so out of hand.  If anything the staff stands their ground on the grounds... . . Nevertheless if you want DAMN good food; it's a must at anytime of the day or night.
