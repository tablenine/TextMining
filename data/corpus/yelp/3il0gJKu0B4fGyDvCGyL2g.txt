Oh ... my ... Toro!  Absolutely amazing!!!  There are a few other sushi places in town that I still am dying to try (i.e. Kaze and Rise), but I am going to have a hard time tearing myself away from this place.  Every single roll we tried was unique and wonderfully fresh.  The Caterpillar roll may be my favorite, but it was really hard to tell, they were all so good!  I highly recommend (if its in season) the toro, of course you have to try the namesake of the place right?  Thank god that our good friend dining with us recommended it because otherwise we probably wouldn't have thought to try it.  Delicious and completely worth the somewhat high price tag.  . . Speaking of prices, the toro is probably the only thing on the menu that seems at all pricey.  Everything else is incredibly reasonable and no corkage fee!  (Nearly unheard of at any Chicago BYOB!). . A few other people I see did not have the best service, however I was actually really impressed with the service!  Maybe we got lucky and had a good waitress, but everything was spaced out accordingly.  The edamame we ordered came out right away for us to nibble on, then was followed by 2 rolls we had ordered and then in perfect timing when we had finished those rolls, 2 more came out.  . . The wait can seem some what intimidating, but it is well worth it.  If you go early enough, get your name on the list and ask them to call you when the table is ready and head to one of the many bars nearby for a drink to kill time.  . . I seriously cannot wait to go back!
