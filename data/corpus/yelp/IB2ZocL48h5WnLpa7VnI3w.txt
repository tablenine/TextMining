Big fan of Fifty/50.  . . Everyone in Chicago should follow suit with the TV outside.  This should be a requirement for outdoor patios in the summer.   . . The food is above average for a bar and there is a good crowd here on the weekend.  . . In addition to this they have a kick ass wait staff.  (kick ass meaning very nice and accommodating...)
