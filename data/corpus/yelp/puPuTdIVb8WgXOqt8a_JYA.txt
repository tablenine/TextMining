Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I was lucky enough to experience their hog dogs since they came to our workplace to cater for us one lunch.  However, their hot dogs weren't pink.  I was disappointed.  That's false advertising.  Oh....it's Pink's not pink.... well at least the dog itself is kind of close to pink...in a red kind of way.  I just had 1 chili cheese dog since I know how much of an artery clogger they are and to my surprise it was actually quite tasty.  I wouldn't trade in my first born for this dog, but it's not bad.  Their chili kind of reminds me of Tommy's... which is a good thing.  And I better stop typing now before I get even more hungry.
