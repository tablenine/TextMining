Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
A couple weeks ago I started on a quest to find good Thai/Chinese delivery. I decided on Duck Walk because, well, it was the only takeout menu that had been shoved under my door. I ordered chicken fried rice and egg rolls. The egg rolls were okay, kind of mushy and had little to no flavor. The chicken fried rice was pretty good, not as heavy as some I've had before, but not as good as others I've had either. All in all, I was pretty disappointed.
