Absolutely one of my favorite spots to hit up when dining along Sawtelle.  The food variety is great, though there some of the menu items are very hit or miss.  Favorites include the extra spicy teba chicken wings, the sizzling steak, the agadashe tofu (fried tofu in a light, sweet sauce, topped w/ green onion), and the rice bowl w/ ground chicken and a fresh quail egg on top (sorry, blanking on the name).. . Parking is a pain (tandem spots in the back).  Getting seated can be painful in the evenings and on the weekends as students from nearby UCLA frequent the spot in droves.  Service can be quite poor at times.  Not always the easiest place to go w/ a large group.   Aside from that though, a can't miss spot for some good food at relatively reasonable prices.
