One of the BEST places in LA to grab breakfast food. I've been here twice and enjoyed it each time. I've had the Power House, and the breakfast quesadilla. Both were just awesome. . . This place provides good quality, "man-sized" portions of food and I can almost guarantee that you will love it. BTW, I had the bite of the Brioche French Toast... I'm not a huge fan of sweet breakfast foods .... but hot damn if that wasn't some of the best french toast I'd ever eaten. . . Warning: I do hear the place gets packed on the weekends. I enjoyed this place (both times) on a nice and quiet weekday morning. What a better way to enjoy a meal while on Melrose?
