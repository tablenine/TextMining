Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I have really mixed feelings about Tank.  . . On one hand, the sushi is really good.  I've had several of the small plates and enjoyed them as well.  The drinks are nice as well.. . On the other hand, I think everything is pretty overpriced for what you get.  Service is just ok.  The tables are all on top of each other, so you can hear every word of your neighbors' conversations.  And what's with the loud techno?  It was easier to hear the people next to me than it was to hear my boyfriend on the other side of the 2-top.  . . Half price rolls make this a more affordable option, so I'd suggest going during those hours.
