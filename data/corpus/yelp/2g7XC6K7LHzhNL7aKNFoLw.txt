Restaurant: The Porter Beer Bar
Category: American (New)
Made our first visit here this week , so my review is based solely on first impressions...it may change later on subsequent visits, but I will not be quick to make that trip anytime soon. . . The setup of the place was cool and interesting--skinny long bar in the front room leading back and up into equally narrow "L-shaped" dining room area. The exposed brick walls and the rustic wood tables were a nice touch and I definitely dig the whole ambiance of a simple neighborhood pub. . . Right off the bat we noticed that their clipboard-styled menus were way too similar to the Brick Store's...I think a little originality would've been a nice touch here. The beer selection was good--I don't think it's as vast as Brick Store's, but they had many enticing Belgium beers on tap and the featured Japanese beers was a nice unique touch. The food however was really, really not good...something a lot of reviewers have already commented on, so I thought I was prepared for it...well, I was wrong. After not finding anything on the menu that was enticing, we decided to stick to the usual pub grub--both the basket of Belgium Fries and the Crispy Calamari came out over-fried and hard, and the Kraut and Beer Brats was just so-so, and the 3 small bratwursts for the price of $13 is absolutely ridiculous. . . Overall, my first impression of The Porter is, it's a knockoff of the Brick Store Pub, but with much worse food. I hope they'll improve, but for right now I'm having a hard time justifying my reasons for returning here.
