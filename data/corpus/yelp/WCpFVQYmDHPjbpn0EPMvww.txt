Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
This is a truly classic burger joint. Many have tried to be the Apple Pan but there is only one. The hickory burger with cheese is amazing! It is easy to decide what you want because they only make a few things but they are all top notch! The fast service grantees the hottest burger and the freshest fries on town. Don't forget to save room for a piece of their home made pie!
