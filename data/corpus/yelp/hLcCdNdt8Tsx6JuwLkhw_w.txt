First things first, if you're going to come here on a Friday, have on comfy shoes, for you will be standing for quite some time. I had a pasta dish, my friend had some sort of burger, and we agreed that the food was pretty..umm...well...it was bland. My drinks were fabulous, however. And the Godiva cheesecake made me want to curl up in a corner and whimper for mercy, it was THAT good. For the cheesecake and drinks alone I'd come back.
