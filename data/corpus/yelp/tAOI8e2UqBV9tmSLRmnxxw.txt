Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
Interesting atmosphere.  The place is bright, clean, stylish, but not any more than a breakfast spot should be.  It is however located RIGHT across the street from that huge, menacing, and let's face it, intriguing Scientology complex.  While eating there the other morning we had some interested blue buttoned up groups of them walking in straight lines together on their way to take over Hollywood, or worship Tom Cruz, or something.. . I digress.  The food at Square One is yummy, different, and fresh.  This is not your classic diner; everything there is served with a twist, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a traditionalist.  But if you want something different with high quality ingredients, check it out.  Try their ham and Gruyere sandwich with mayo-less mash potatoes or their chanterelle smothered grits with feta!
