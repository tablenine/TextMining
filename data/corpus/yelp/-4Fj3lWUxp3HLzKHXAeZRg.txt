Potato balls FTW - mashed potatoes, deep fried with a crispy outside, meat stuffed on the inside.  Stupid good.. . Sandwiches and baked goods are all solid.  This is a go-to place for any type of pasteries -- a good place to stop by if you are visiting someone and want to bring them some amazing baked goods.
