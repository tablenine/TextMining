Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
A cuban chain restaurant spread around L.A., one right down the street from where I live. There was a line on a Friday night, no list, just a line...I tried the famous half chicken, which came with a side of rice, black beans and fried bananas. The half chicken was HUGE. Flavoring was good, got a little dry once I ate all the dark meat and got into the white meat. Flan for dessert...too thick with a cinnamon-y touch, not used to that. Def. a place to try, but wouldn't work well with my pocket book on regular basis. $22 for paella is not my style.
