First and foremost, the service was awesome.  I love those places where other servers help out any table.  I had the chimichanga and it was crazy good.  I got bunuelos rellenos for dessert to-go and they were great.  They were fruit and something rolled in a pastry shell. and my waiter gave me a cup full of whipped cream to take home with me!  The horchata was really good.  I'll return.. P.S. yelp needs to get some spanish in their spell check
