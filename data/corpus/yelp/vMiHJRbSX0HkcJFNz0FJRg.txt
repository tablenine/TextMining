Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
Grey Dog's is one of those places I should hate with an undying passion. The wooden interior, the hand-written signs, the faux-boho clientele who queue up religiously every weekend, and even the Old World-style sign bearing their name all add up to a pretension I should have no trouble disdaining alongside hipsters, performance art, and fashion boutiques for animals.. . But damn it, I really like this place.. . Maybe it's their cookies, which are huge and make me feel like a little kid when I dunk them into a tall glass of milk. Maybe it's their teas and chai lattes, which are surprisingly good for a place that prides itself on serving coffee. Maybe it's the fact that you can sit down and have an actual meal here amongst people who are actually really cool if you talk to them. Or maybe it's the ridiculously attractive employees, who, bizarrely, are all really nice.. . Whatever it is, I can overlook the fact that this place is literally bursting at the seams most of the time, the tables are too close together, it's too loud to have anything beyond a cursory conversation, and it's also kind of dark inside. And here's a tip: when it is crazy as all hell in here on the weekends, and you just want to something to go, you can skip to the absolute back of Grey Dog's and order from there. Otherwise, wait on the regular line...and they'll get a table for you while you order. Told you they were nice.. . Bathroom Grade: N/A. I did use the bathroom, a long time ago, but I don't remember it, and honestly, today I felt going-through-the-womb enough without having to squeeze back there (that is, if the bathroom indeed exists and I'm just not delirious).
