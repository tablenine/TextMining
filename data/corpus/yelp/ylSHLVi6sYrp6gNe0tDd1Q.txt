This place has an interesting gimmic--put garlic in everything (including our ice cream and martinis). When we decided to go here, it was just that. We wanted to know if the hype was true. I like the way each table is separated by drapes and curtains. It gives that spooky vampire feel, but is also very cozy. The food wasn't good. I got the equivalent of a 15 dollar mac and cheese plate. It's a nice place, but I wouldn't come here for food. Just stay at home and microwave your own easy mac.
