My first visit was a solid 4 stars - the grilled octopus was heaven sent - it was so good, it didn't even taste like octopus. BUT you can never review a place after having gone once.  . . Tonight we went again - and it was the LONGEST meal ever.  First off, we had reservations at 9pm.  They sat us at 9:50.  Took our order at 10:20.  Apps came up promptly, and then somewhere between the Primi and the Secondi, the service forgot about us.  We waited until 11:30 to get our final course.  And by then, we were full so we ended up taking what should've been the best part of our meal in doggie bags.   At midnight, they gave us the dessert menu, at which point, my eyelids were half way down my eyeballs.  We looked up at the waiter with an "are you kidding me" look but he didn't even notice.   . . I'll have a scrumptious lunch tomorrow, when I'm half asleep.  It's never good to finish dinner at midnight on a school night.. in fact, it's never good to finish that late on a weekend either.
