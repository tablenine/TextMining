Restaurant: Two Urban Licks
Category: Bars
Another hip restaurant from the folks that brought you One.Midtown.Kitchen, this place draws a seen and be-seen kind of crowd.  . . The atmosphere is very sleek and urban, but the food fails to live up to expectation.  The lamb lollipops with jelly are actually a good combo, but the flash fried oysters just didn't taste fresh.  Not what one would expect for that price.  My beef brisket was a bit tough and chewy, but my companion's pork shoulder was impeccable, served with a side of creamy mac 'n cheese.  In fact, I think I ate most of his and brought my entree home to the dogs.. . The bar is extremely posh, with barrels of wine stacked upon a stainless steel wine "wall."  The center of the restaurant, adjacent to the open kitchen, is the huge flaming rotisserie tower.  A giant tower of fire in the middle of a restaurant - who'd have thought?  Tip:  don't get seated near it unless you like it hot.
