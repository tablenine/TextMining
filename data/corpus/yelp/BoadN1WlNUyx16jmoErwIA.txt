omg it's my first review! . . i'm a little befuddled by these lukewarm reviews, but i am not a seasoned pho expert, so maybe that is the problem... with that said, i wish i could eat here every day. it's extremely difficult to only go once a week. my roommate and i are "phobsessed" as she says. . . the spring rolls and egg rolls basically blow my mind, especially when coupled with the array of sauces available to experiment with.... hoisin sauce with a little chili garlic sauce mixed in is a favorite combo. i'm about to lose some cred points for not knowing real names, but the noodle soup with just steak is excellent.... do not care for the sausage (a rare occasion... oh gross). take advantage of the plate of additives. it subtly adds to the flavor. the cold noodles with steak and shrimp were also epic, mostly because they're sauce-able. the service is light speed and so friendly.. . if it's too "hipster" for you, what on earth are you in silverlake for? the laughs?
