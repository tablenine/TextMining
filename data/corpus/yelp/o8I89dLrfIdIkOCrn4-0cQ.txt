You know your friends who say, "Ramen is just ok.." It's because they haven't tried Daikokuya..no joke. I've had 3 friends who said that and I've asked them if they've tried Daikokuya and of course they've never heard of it.. . There is such thing as GOOD ramen. We're not talking about cup-o-noodles or the ones in korean packages. The line is long for a reason. The Monterey Park location is not worth the wait though...for some reason it doesn't taste as good as the one in LA.. . Order the original and don't forget to add garlic, ginger, and hot pepper. The egg is cooked just perfect with it being runny, and the broth is full of fatty meat flavor. After you're done, walk down to the plaza and get a $1 mochi ice cream.
