I have to restrain myself from coming here too often. Because, the thing is, while they offer many delicious items, all I can do is order the plantain sandwich, which is chock full of plantains and butter and sugar and cheese. Hello, I gain weight just freaking THINKING about that sandwich but I'm addicted addicted addicted and even get a freaking SIDE of plantains WITH IT. I cannot be stopped!. . That said, I have sampled food off the plates of my dining companions many times and have never tried anything that wasn't deeeelicious.
