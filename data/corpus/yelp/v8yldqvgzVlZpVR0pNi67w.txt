Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
There's a reason why the line is always insane and the parking is a nightmare - their tacos are cheap and delicious!. . I never turn down an opportunity to eat there which is saying something because I'm pretty picky when it comes to where I eat.  I'm not saying that this is the best place to get authentic Mexican tacos, but the food is hot, fresh, and tasty.  And it sure beats paying similar prices for crap at Taco Bell or Del Taco.
