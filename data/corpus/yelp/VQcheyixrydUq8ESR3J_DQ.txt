Restaurant: Cafe di Sol
Category: American (New)
Worst brunch ever. The service was practiically non-existent...oh, except for this exchange:. . Us: I'm sorry, does this come with a different side?. Server: What do you want ME to do about it?. . Comedy!. . Welcome to Cafe di Tude. Your food will suck. You'll pay too much for it. You'll hate yourself on the way out. I'm serious--avoid for brunch at all costs.
