i don't care what anyone else says, i love this place. the food is great and it's a cute date spot. my boyfriend and i always get that dinner for 2 thing &amp; we haven't tasted a bad dish yet. one time, we had a not so nice waitress.. but that's about it. the service is pretty good and the waiters/waitresses we usually have are personable. try it out!
