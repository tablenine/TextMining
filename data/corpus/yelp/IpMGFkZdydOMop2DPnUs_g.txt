I give this place 2 stars for weirdness. If it were based on the food alone, I would give it 4 stars. The food was good, but it took WELL OVER AN HOUR to get to our table. Three people stopped by our table to apologize about the delay, which was nice. But, HERE'S THE WEIRD THING: After waiting forever &amp; ever our waitress told us that our Fish &amp; Chips had been made &amp; remade &amp; remade again, but were repeatedly getting delivered to other tables. What??? I don't think I needed to know that part. I was really fine just assuming they were short staffed in the kitchen. On top of waiting forever &amp; then the waitress telling us that our food had been delivered to other people that had probably been there for 20 minutes, versus our now hour &amp; a half, they didn't even offer to comp us the puny little $10 Cheese Plate starter we ordered. . . I feel like they didn't do anything because we weren't assholes about them majorly screwing up. We were really, really nice about it. I think that we were really, really nice about it because we had been filling up on beer during our looooong wait. I hate it, but I know if we would have been mean about, they probably would have treated us like they wanted us to come back. I really wanted to like you, Marlay House. Say hi to your mother for me, but I'm not sure if I will visit again.
