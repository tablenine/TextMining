This had become the new breakfast spot for my coworkers and I after a long night work. I don't know how it started but now its tradition. The breakfast is good. Pricey because it's Hollywood hey you get what you pay for. So far I had the eggs benedict and churizo burrito. Both were pretty damn flavorful. Maybe a little to heavy on the sauce if you ask me. I'm more prone to the traditional tastes but there contemporary twist tends to spice up my morning meal. . . At 9 am the crowd is normally close to dead. I have heard they get busier in the evenings. So I will have to check it out some time. They have a lot of lunch and dinner items I really want to try but can't bring myself to order in the morning. And I'm sure the its a pretty hoppin' place when they have a crowd. Their staff are all really cool people. With chill waiters and flirty waitresses who never let my coffee cup go empty. God Bless Em! The only reason I gave Fred's 3 stars was because of the B rating. That kind of stuff always bothers me. But I'd rather be brave with my food than than be left out with my friends.
