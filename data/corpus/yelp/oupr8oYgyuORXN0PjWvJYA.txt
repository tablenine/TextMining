Overall good food, atmosphere and service at Landmark Grill!. . Went on a wednesday with no reservation and we were seated in about 20 minutes.  We were seated at one of the 'chef tables' up near the kitchen.  It was a little warm up there, but not bad and we received complimentary app's and sides from the chef - a definite plus!  The service was great, although I felt like our waiter might have been trying to pick up both me and my boyfriend - very friendly guy.. . We had the meatball and duck egg app - definitely would recommend.  I had the white fish - very good.  Boyfriend had a full rack of the moroccan ribs - which was more than enough for one (and this is someone who can eat, a lot).  Finished the meal with the chocolate peanut butter semifreddo - which was delicious!  The only drawback was I would have liked more of the salted caramel peanuts and less of the unsweetened whip cream.. . I will be back for Wino wednesdays - 1/2 price bottles of wine and free pizzas (which looked delicious - even though I didn't get to try one).
