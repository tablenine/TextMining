Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Tank sushi has been in my rotation for a few years now, and I can say that I've never left feeling disappointed by the food or the service.  . . The appetizers are good and the sashimi and nigiri is pretty solid, but the rolls are where it's at.  They are cleverly thought out and interesting and enjoyable.  . . I like Tank for date nights and for nights out with a group.  If you're planning a group dinner, check out the "rooms" they have near the back.  They seat about 8 comfortably, and you're sequestered away from the main room, which can get a little loud on a weekend night. . . I've read a few comments about service issues here, but I can say that I've never felt as though I was treated rudely.  In my opinion, the service is pretty quick and friendly.
