people love is place.  i think it's just ok.  since the hubby and i are addicted to sushi, this is the place we go when we are craving sushi at midnight or want it delivered after 10pm.  we order just standard stuff like the rainbow maki, dragon maki, some sashimi pcs.  quality is good.  it's just there are sooooo many places soooo much better than this one at similar prices.  this place doesn't really offer any special rolls or anything unique that impresses me.  it's also slightly overpriced, but overpriced is totally ok when they are there for you at 1am to fulfill that crave!!
