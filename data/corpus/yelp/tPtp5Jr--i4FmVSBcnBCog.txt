I ate here a few times and I've done the Special #2 challenge and it isnt pretty. I love challenges. But when I am not doing the challenge I get the Miso with level 2 spiciness along with egg, corn and pork. Its quick service around 2pm. Portions are really good for the price you pay. I highly suggest it for groups of 6 or smaller because the place isnt that big.
