We came here on a Cinco de Mayo. By the time we left around 8:30, the place was still packed. This place is awesome and the fact that Guy Fieri paid them a visit pretty much tops it off. The carne adobada was delicious. Tender and juicy and so full of flavor. I love how it just went well with the sauce and onions... and I don't normally eat onions. The pupusa were great too. We ordered the Revuelta and the Loroco. Both were very delicious and paired well with the dipping sauce and slaw. Finally, their staple Sopa de 7 Mares was also delicious. The soup really takes on all the flavors of the sea and the entire bowl was filled with all kinds of seafood. Our party paired the entire meal with a pitcher of sangria. It was pretty light on the alcohol, but still delicious. Would love to pay them another visit again soon.
