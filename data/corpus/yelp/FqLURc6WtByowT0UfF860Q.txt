Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
This place is frighin huge and always packed. Great for huge groups since they have long cafeteria tables. Never been there when i didn't have to wait around for a table. Well, except for the time when my family went there at 4pm, and really, who eats at 4pm? . . Birthday boy/gal gets a free pop of champagne, so you can always expect to see a couple birthdays going on. . . Due to its popularity and busy-ness, the service isn't that great. I remember on several occasions when we had to sit around for a good 15 minutes to wait for more food. . . Some people find the rowdy atmosphere "cheap," but I think it just adds to the kbbq experience. Â Rambunctious fun + good eat = Manna.
