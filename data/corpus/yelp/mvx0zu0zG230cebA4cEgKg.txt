DO NOT ORDER TAKE OUT FROM HERE.. . I made the mistake of doing so recently - it was much worse than eating at the restaurant.  The noodles stuck together, the bags leaked.. . Otherwise this is a fine neighborhood restaurant.  Not the best food, but acceptable - I doubt the reviewers who say this is great vietnamese have ever eaten truly great vietnamese.  . . This is more like the kind of hipster place people go and pay 30% more to eat in chic modern decor and feel like they are cool.  Not worth the wait when the line is long, but otherwise fine for a casual evening in the hood.
