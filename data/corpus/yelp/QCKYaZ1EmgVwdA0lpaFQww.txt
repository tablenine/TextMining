I love Joy's.. . I love the tom yum soup. I love the delicious pad see ew that arrives at the table steaming hot. I love the excellent service. I love that I can get out of here for around $10, and with enough leftovers for lunch the next day.. . This neighborhood has endless choices, but I return again and again to Joy's.
