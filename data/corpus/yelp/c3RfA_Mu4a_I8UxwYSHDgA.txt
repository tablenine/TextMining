At Barney's Beverly is the Best.  I visited the Pasadena location over the weekend and Beverly was our server. She explained options. She had suggestions on how to order in order to get what we wanted.. She came up with solutions. She knew portion size. She was all over the drinks. She dropped the check, picked it up. She brought us extra plates to split the meal. Came by and offered me another drink, brought me water. She was sparkly and happy. And she never once had to apologize for us about anything, even if it was a no go, she offered a different solution. There's something to say for good service. Job well done. Thanks Beverly!. . Oh! And we had the Spicy Hot Wings Meal. You start with a decent cup of French Onion soup, followed by a plate of hot wings, that next time, I will  get , only if they come not FRIED, a healthy portion of yummy veggies, and for $1 extra, a big baked potato covered with cheddar and broccoli/cauliflour. YAY. Easily enough for two normal sized people to share.. . AND THEY HAVE A FLAT SCREEN AT YOUR TABLE WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE CHANNEL. YEEEEEEE.
