Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Spent Valentine's dinner at this place since we were both down to try a new burger place. I've heard about this place from a few of my friends and thought we'd give it a try. . . The service is a little off-key, it's not your typical restaurant where you sit down and a waiter takes your order. You order at the bar and seat yourself. So we found some seats at the bar and we were greeted by a really friendly bartender. Since it was our first time, he gave us some tips on what kind of beers we would like. . . We ordered the Father's Office burger since that's what everyone talks about and the sweet potato fries. It came out pretty quick and I was surprised to see the burger wasn't in a traditional bun. It was in what looked like a roll. The burger was actually pretty good. But not my favorite. I was a little turned off by the roll. I would definitely say that I liked the burger from Back Abbey waaaaay better. . . The prices seemed normal for an upscale burger/bar place. But the atmosphere was really nice. I liked that the menus looked like an office pad! Overall, it was a good experience, but I doubt I'd go again. Especially since the Back Abbey burger is way better and much closer.
