I just had to look into a place billed as the world's largest drive-in. From the size of the place as I approached it from the Georgia Tech campus, I can see how they can make the claim. Plenty of space for cars, a ridiculously long restaurant with tons of seating space, multiple TV rooms, I think it makes a legitimate claim there.. . On coming in, you're greeted by a line of cashiers shouting "What'll ya have!" I was a bit confused at first, not being a native, but it looks like that's how they get you to notice that they're ready for the next customer. That's one way of doing it I guess. It definitely adds to the atmosphere of the place and it's a nice touch (although you'll have to get used to hearing it over and over if you seat anywhere within the long order counter).. . I settled on a chili burger and chili dog with fries. For the drink, I got the frosted orange drink I heard so much about. The food came out within seconds, leading me to think that the food had been sitting out of the kitchen for awhile. I know it's fast food, but I'd like to at least the pretense it was sitting on the grill within the last couple minutes.. . I enjoy the decor of their TV rooms, using school desks as the tables. It's a nice touch, imo.. . At first I thought the price was pretty good for a hot dog/burger combo, but I found out that the hot dog and burger were sized accordingly to the price (i.e. not as big as a regular size dog/burger). A bit disappointing, but I did get what I paid for. Unfortunately, neither of them were nothing to write home about, chili was okay, but nothing excited me when I ate them. The fries were pretty terrible (again, they must had been sitting out for a bit) but the frosted orange drink saved it, the drink was excellent. So bad fries, great drink, and average dog/burger all-in-all turn into an average experience here.
