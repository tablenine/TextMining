Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Mmmmm I love pizza and recently I have been getting in to liking thin crust pizza the most.  The pizzas are cooked in a coal fire - as you might have guessed by the name.  They come out a little crispy with a straight from the fire taste.  My favorite is the Margherita and I think at this place less is more.  The flavors were all well layered and I couldn't stop eating it!  I also tried the Caprese salad which was very fresh.  . The same guy is always working the room and registered - I think he might be the owner.  One time I had to wait for a few minutes and he was very apologetic and walked me (and my pie) to the car!. I will definitely be going back soon.  I want to try the white and pesto pizzas.
