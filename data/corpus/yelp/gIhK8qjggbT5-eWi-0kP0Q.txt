The best bone-in ribeye in Los Angeles thus far!  The title is on the line as my evening at Cut is on the horizon.  . . The Bone-In Ribeye (22 oz, $43.95) comes sizzling on a blank scorching hot white plate.  Just a dash of salt and pepper and i carved that thing all the way to the bone.  . . Each side is enough for 4-6 people.  The Lobster Mashed Potato is smooth and creamy topped with a lobster bisque like gravy.  The lobster portions are generous as you will be in a couple of hours ($32.95).. . I do not recommend the Chilled King Crab Legs ($24.95).  I was picturing the legs to be the size of a baby's arm.  Instead, it was more like a slap in the face.  Basically 2 wimpy legs cut down the center giving you 4 pieces total.. . The drinks are good and you do get to keep the ice melted dilution remaining within the cocktail shaker which makes just over 2 servings total.  Sounds like a lot of drink but the Pomegranite Martini is also $18 (cocktails start around $14).. . The upstairs bar is annoying as it doubles as a dinner counter (for people who think they are truckers?).  Trying to order a pre dinner drink there was impossible. . . The piano doubles as a bar counter and the old folks sitting around it singing Barry Manilow tunes took my buzz down a notch.. . The "thank you" phone call the following day is a nice touch, unless your wife picks it up and finds out you were out with a hooker.. . This is 90210 and the tables are close so you can eavesdrop or partake in some vague nauseating conversation such as:  "I work in the entertainment industry.  Did I tell you that I work in the entertainment industry?  Hey, I work in the entertainment industry!"  Sorry, never heard of you.
