Hands down, by far, one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.  We started with the skillet of shrimp, absolutely incredibly mouthwatering and  tasteful.  You have to de-skin the shrimp, but it  is so delicious that we didnt even care, and before we were done eating one shrimp, we were peeling another. . . Second course was the Filet mignon and crab with creamed spinach and yukon mashed potatoes. Imagine the most tenderly flavored beef, extremely tasteful mashed potatoes, and the crab-the crab! Just overall amazing. Top quality and the filet was massive!. . The people who write that this place is overrated are obviously not the type of people who enjoy an upscale resturaunt.  For the lady who wrote "be prepared to spend $20 per plate" DUH, who  the hell spends less than $20 a plate?  Maybe she would be better off at an IHOP. . . If you are looking for a hip and different atmosphere (we had a "cabana") and amazing food then I highly recommend this place.  I can't get it out of my mind.  We had a private seating arrangement, it was unlike anything ive experienced before.  The service was fast, very helpful and polite.  Appetizers and food were spread out perfectly.. . And to those who gave  poor ratings due to the volumnious amount of people eating on valentines day, their reviews have nothing to do with the food.  It's Valentines day, have you ever had a date on V-day before? Every one and their mom is eating out. OBVIOUSLY there will be a wait in every good resturaunt in LA.
