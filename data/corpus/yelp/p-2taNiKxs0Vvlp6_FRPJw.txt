Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's is located in the Kitch district, Johnny Pastrami is right around the corner.  Don't expect authentic Mexican (where not in Mexico) expect authentic SoCal kitch tacos and darn good ones.  Taco Bell ripped this place off without a doubt.  The quality is much better so comparisons to a mega-corp fast food place are unfair.  . . They fry their own shells, the beef is slow cooked and shredded, the Chile sauce is homemade and not from a can and out of this world, two kinds of salsa;  tomato spiked with black pepper that is completely addictive and a jalapeno one on request only, that pretty much is Chile escabeche that you would find at an authentic taco stand just chopped up in salsa form,.  They serve food fast and greasy and good.. . try the tacos w/cheese, all chili burrito and tamale.
