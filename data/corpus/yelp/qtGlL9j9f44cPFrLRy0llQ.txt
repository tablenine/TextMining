okay, so you need a vegetarian place ASAP for your friend who lives on brown rice and beans. go here, it's CRUNCHY. i thought i was in love the first time i went-- then i came back &amp; realized the truth. this place is OVERPRICED. *NO REFILLS* on ICED TEA ($2.00/glass) which costs like Â 25 cents to make a pitcher of, max. the veggie burgers are served with these weird uber-crispy "chips" -- NO FLAVOR whatsoever. Blah Blah Blah. lick a carboard box, it would be cheaper. . i am never full when i leave. this place has good ambiance, too bad some asshat ruined it with their penny-pinching-lack-of-creative-cookery-ways.. the milkshakes are damn good, though (albiet overpriced). it's a great place to have lunch by yourself, and now that i've given this place a second chance (3 1/2 stars), the libido burrito is quite filling. the staff is super super nice.
