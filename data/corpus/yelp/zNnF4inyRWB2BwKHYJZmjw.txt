We've been there 3 times in the past 2 years. The "kids" behind the counter could care less. The pastrami, which has a great flavor is very fatty. When you ask if they can trim it, they just say no because it's all been sliced and is in a steam table behind the counter. Most places trim that huge hunk of fat off the brisket before slicing it, but not here. The ketchup containers were almost empty, so my son encountered an air pocket and got covered with ketchup when trying to get some out. The crew behind the counter were too busy talking to notice the ketchup mess, or that the iced tea container was empty. I read good reviews for the roasted chicken so I figured the chicken salad sandwich would be a good bet, but I was SO wrong. The chicken was tiny cubes and shreds of chicken. My sandwich also had a dime sized small bone, some gristle, and some skin in it. It was served on a dry crumbly roll with a large nest of strong onion, old tomato and mayo. The chicken had no way of staying on the roll since there was nothing holding the chunks together. It didn't help that the chicken tasted like the fridge. 3 of us, $32.00 later and never again. it's funky, which is fine, but the lack of consistent quality coupled with the attitude of the kids working there takes it over the top. I know somebody tried very hard to do something different here, which it admirable, but they only got 30% of the concept and then gave up. You need to establish the quality, train the cooks and train the counter help. Somebody needs to ask the customers how the experience was. Nobody wants to ask that question of the customers leaving. Sorry.
