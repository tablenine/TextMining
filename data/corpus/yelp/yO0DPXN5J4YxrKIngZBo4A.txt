So i've been hearing all this hype about the kogi truck and aftre seeing many status updates on facebook about the kogi truck being in town...i decided to hit up the truck w/ my friend last week...the truck was at nogales and daisetta(rowland heights)  from 10pm-1am.. . Got there around 10:30ish and there was a pretty massive line...anticipated that it would be about an hour wait in line. after the long long wait i ended up ordering 2 korean short rib burritos, 2 korean short rib tacos, &amp; 1 tofu taco. Tacos are $2/each and burritos are $5/each (which was pretty overpriced considering the size of it)..its an interesting concept infusing korean bbq and kimchi in a taco/burrito..but i gotta say of course i was hoping that after waiting over an hour in line for these tacos..it wasn't really worth the wait. it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't anything out of this world. they're pretty shiesty w/ the meat and i think i had better  from a student organization selling their version of korean bbq tacos at Sungod at UCSD. . . so if you're still dying to see what all the hype is about...word of advice if you're hittin up the kogi truck, bring some lawn chairs, some drinks and something to keep you entertained while you're waiting in line.
