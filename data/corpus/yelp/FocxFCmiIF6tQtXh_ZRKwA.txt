do not come here for dinner. you will overpay and undereat.. . had the sashimi dinner which was just deplorable. dilapidated. disappointing, . who puts leftovers on a $35 plate?? . if you come for lunch you get 3 options for sashimi, and the prices are better and they do not give you little slivers of fish. literally, like little pieces of beef for fajitas, and smaller! the sushi dinner plate was also unsatisfactory. im very sad. still. so you your sadness for something else. thank you. . wont come back for dinner, maybe lunch.
