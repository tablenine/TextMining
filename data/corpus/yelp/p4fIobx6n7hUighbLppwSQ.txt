My favorite meal in the world is the hainan chicken from Savoy. Dark meat only, with a cup of cold chrysanthemum tea. They could just sell this dish and do plenty well. It's been years since I've even looked at anything else on the menu. From the dark recesses of my memory, I recall the linguini and conch pasta being yummy. The duck pasta was pretty good. All the pastas and pizzas are yum. The currys are so-so. The bread is tasty. It's really hard to get a table here for a group. Luckily I have no shame about coming alone and getting a spot at the counter. The owners/staff have been here for years and are as sweet as ever, even though they must serve the exact same order hundreds of times every single day.
