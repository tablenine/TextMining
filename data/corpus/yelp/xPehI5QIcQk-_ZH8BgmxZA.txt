This used to be a rather fantastic place with reasonable priced upscale Mediterranean food but it seems to have just gotten increasingly expensive as the years have gone by with too large of a turnover of waitstaff for me to feel comfortable getting used to frequenting the place often.  Nice quaint little outdoor seating is a plus but the inside environment for some reason makes me uncomfortable.  It is a fantastic place to order take out from, though, especially their Lentil soup!
