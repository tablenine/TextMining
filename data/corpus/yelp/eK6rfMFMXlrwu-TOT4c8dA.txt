A friend recommended this place a while back and we finally made it up to Lincoln Square to give it a try.  Almost immediately, I was kicking myself for not making it up sooner.. . This might be my favorite Mexican place in town.  I can't vouch for its authenticity, but I will say that the food is fantastic.. . We started off with the guac which was so fresh and tasty.. . I went with the pedestrian choice of the carne asada tacos which were incredible.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.. . My wife had the chicken enchiladas which, while covered in cheese, were surprisingly light.  From what I could see it was nothing but white meat chicken.. . The service was prompt and friendly and they workers seem to have a great rapport with the regulars.  This place has a great, homey atmosphere and I cannot wait to head back.
