I recently took my father there for his birthday. Every year for our birthdays, we do an Atlanta steakhouse.  It's always Chops, Mortons, N.Y. Prime, or Bones.  Bones and Chops have turned into an old man's steak house that's boring with the over 60 crowd. Morton's in inconsistent due to it's "chain" status. I won't say anything bad about N.Y. Prime as I love it too.  Though, it never hurts to have an alternative steakhouse in another part of town.  . . I was immediately impressed by the interior of the place.  I like how they keep it dark and traditional while still modern with floor to ceiling windows and the decor. I'm also a big fan of their bourbon selection and the cigar bar, bringing back the "old school" feel.  . . As far as the food, while being pricey, is terrific. We had the porterhouse for 3 for $96. OUCH I know, but quite a sight to witness.  As somewhat of a self-proclaimed steak junkie, I can't say I've ever seen anything like this.  The waiter came out and carved the filet and porterhouse.  The sides of grits, HUGE onion rings, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes etc. are pretty traditional. . . It will break the bank, but it is a truly world class steakhouse that perfectly blends old school with the new school
