This place gets FIVE STARS for having the best bloody mary's in the city.  Hands down.  Where else can you get a meal in a glass?  Spiked with shaved parmesan cheese, black pepper and garnished with a hunk of salami, a pearled onion, and a green olive, these things are a (tasty) meal in and of themselves.  Not to mention the PBR "back."  A little shooter of PBR draught comes on the side.  This is my brunch spot.  I never stray from my bloody coupled with the best Fried Egg Sandwich...to die for.  Fried egg, smothered in mayo, melted cheddar, sliced tomato and thinly sliced white onion, oh and how could I forget, crispy BACON on a marble rye sammich served with home potatoes.  IT IS THE BEST.  If I get good service from the fully-tatt'd cast, it's a bonus.  If not, I still get some cool artwork to stare at.  :)
