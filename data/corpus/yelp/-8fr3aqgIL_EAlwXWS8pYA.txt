Restaurant: Lola&#39;s

Looks like this is a converted house, with a bar section and a restaurant.  Strangely enough, it smelled like Korean BBQ in the middle of the place, although I'm pretty sure this isn't the right place for that.  . . The inside was classy and decorated well, and there was an aston martin parked outside affirming it's status.  They only put 3 ice cubes in my scotch, and it's a little crowded by the front, but those are small complaints.  I'll come back again next time I stumble upon the Fairfax district.. . PS.  That is not a taco place kitty corner from Lola's, that is a hot dog place that serves tacos.  Don't get your hopes up.
