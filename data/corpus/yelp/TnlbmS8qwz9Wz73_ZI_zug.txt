Went there for dinner and had the moules &amp; frites, Bibb Salad, veal belly and burger and of course some Belgian beers. Nice little restaurant and the Bibb salad was the most savory salad I've had in a long while.  . Unfortunately I thought it was very JV for a so-called Belgian restaurant to serve up a barely lukewarm mussels dish.  I couldn't tell if it had just sat too long after being cooked or if they were just plain undercooked; the silver pot they are served in was cool to the touch. In all fairness to resto, they did remove this item from my bill but only after having to complain twice which resulted in the manager getting involved.. I'm back at home now drinking St. Germain and hoping I don't get whatever they warn you about in fine print regarding undercooked shellfish.
