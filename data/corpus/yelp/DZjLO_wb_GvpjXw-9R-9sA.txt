Boy, does the recession bring out the unethical side of restaurateurs. I went to Fraiche for happy hour with a friend who had got an email from Daily Candy just a couple of weeks ago, saying it was from 5:30-7. Due to construction on Venice, we got there a little after 6:30 and were told by the supercilious maitre d' that happy hour was now from 5-6:30.. . In other words, it's a bait-and-switch: advertise a normal sounding time, cut it back to a pathetic 6:30, and try to reel in hapless customers. No thank you. I came to Fraiche a few months ago and enjoyed my dinner very much, but will now take my business elsewhere.
