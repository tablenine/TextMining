It's up above 3 bucks now huh? Has been going up a quarter every year. Now, I haven't been here in a long time, what with trying to eat healthier and this being the antithesis of healthy... but I sure went a ton in my first 2 years of school at Columbia, and I'm sure it's the same as then.. . 1) One slice is a good meal. It is BIG and it is filling. And pretty tasty.. 2) Don't get anything other than cheese unless you're crazy. Sprinkle some red pepper or oregano or pamesan or garlic powder. Screw the other toppings. 3) It's kind of greasy, but not in an excessively bad way.. 4) Fold it. Mmmm.... . Yeah, it is perfect for a greasy late night snack, better had less sober than not, and better the colder the weather is.. . That being said, it is not the best pizza in the world (though after writing this review I am craving a slice)... but for the area, it's hard to do better.
