This place can take a few minutes to get your food, but as our awesome waitress told us... they don't pre cut anything and make it completely fresh as soon as your order it. Besides, when you're munching on freshly toasted bread slathered with olive tapenade and chatting with friends, it's well worth the wait.. Free street parking is always available, if you know where to look, but there are several parking structures around that are inexpensive.. This place has the best breakfast in LA with veggie friendly options. The staff is friendly, quick with suggestions, and very knowledgeable.. I discovered this place on a whim, but will reccomend it to everyone i know in LA.
