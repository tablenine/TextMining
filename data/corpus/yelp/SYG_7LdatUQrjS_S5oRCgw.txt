order at the counter, stand in line to pay while food is prepared. pay for food, drink, hunt for table. . . Food: good eats, done right. simple fare but it's done pretty well. i don't think anything here is particularly amazing. but if i want something basic that's reliable i can go here. . . Atmosphere: most of the seating is outside, good luck getting a spot. people well claim spots by leaving sunglasses, jackets, whatever on a table. terrible for a bigger group. it's tough enough for 2 to get a seat. . . 3 stars for food minus 2 stars for seating situation.
