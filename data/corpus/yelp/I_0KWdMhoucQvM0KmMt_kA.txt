Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This was good solid ramen. The noodles were cooked just right. I liked that the miso soup base was not salty and the servings are huge. I recommend either going here when you're super hungry or get extra noodles and fillings and share the bowl. The waiters were very accomodating but got a little frenetic when the place was full to the brim. Will definitely go back.
