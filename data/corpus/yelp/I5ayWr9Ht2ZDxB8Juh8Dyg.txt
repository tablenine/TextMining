So, I went back to Terroni for lunch. Wasn't planning on going there but I left my sweater behind on first visit so figured since I was there anyway, why not give it another try. (Yes, they still had my sweater - yea!) . - The Good: Tried the Lamb Ragu - FIVE big-fat stars!! Amazing. Big portion so took some home and it was just as good reheated on day 2. Salad with olives was yummy too. My lunch mate had the pasta with the artichokes. She said it was very good. Again, portion was large. Service efficient and nice. Found free parking on street. . - The Bad: The Music was LOUD. Even at lunchtime on a Thursday! I now know why all the outside tables were taken - the traffic on Beverly Blvd was quieter than inside Terroni. What is it with the deafening music ?? totally unnecessary. . - The Review: Still 3 stars. Would have been 4 stars if I could have had a simple conversation with my table companion at lunch.
