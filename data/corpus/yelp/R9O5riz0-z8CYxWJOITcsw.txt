I've gone here a few times.  Every time I go.. even though I get there before they open, there is a line of at least 10 to 20 people.  So go early so you only have to wait 30 minutes instead of an hour.  And parking is a bit annoying... since there are so many people.  . . I like the pork dumplings.. and I've tried a few other things like the chicken soup.  Everything seems to be good.. but in my opinion, nothing so great.  . . Service can be spotty... I think you get the feeling they are trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible.  Well if I waited an hour to get in here, I'm going to take my grand old DANDY TIME!!  :)
