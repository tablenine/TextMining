Great food! Great atmosphere! Great Deserts! Can't wait til they expand to the other room. I have always thought where you order can be a bottleneck of people. If they did bloody marys i think i would be in heaven!. . parking can be a pain but after all the large food servings a nice walk is what the doctor ordered. . . _P
