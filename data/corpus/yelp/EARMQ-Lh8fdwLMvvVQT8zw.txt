Sweets only:. . Something inside me rebels against a $6 milkshake. But then I realize I routinely pay $4 for a coffee. And the ingredients in the milkshare are actually quality and fresh.. . EVERY listing on the shakes, floats, and malts menu sounded good. I actually could only narrow it down to four I wanted, so I had to flip some coins. I was picking between the coffee toffee shake, the mint chocolate malt, the triple citrus float, and the peanut banana malt. The banana won my coin flipping tourney. . . The shake was pretty good, not huge for a shake, but with something that rich, more volume would definitely have been a mistake. It was made of banana ice cream, dulce de leche, crushed peanuts, and whipped cream. Not a lot of textural contrasts, which I tend to be really big on, but I didn't mind so much. . . I also tried the molten choco cookie, thanks to miss Veronica R. Â And although it wasn't hot anymore, it was still nice and melty. If not a bit on the small side. . . The atmosphere was relaxed too. We got one of the front tables and busted out some Scattergories. I guess it was kinda cramped though, because at least five people tripped over chairs while we were there.. . Will definitely go back for the sweet stuff.
