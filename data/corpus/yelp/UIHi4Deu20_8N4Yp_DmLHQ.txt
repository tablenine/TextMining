Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I was uncomfortable at the beginning because I didn't know what I was suppose to do. They gave me a menu but what was I suppose to order? a pound of something... is that alot? I went with my friend who was also new there so we were sitting there for a while trying to figure out what we're suppose to do. They brought us a bag of crab in seasoning with corn in side of it... like a trash bag. I was in shock. Very surprised... no plates no utencils, no nothing. I guess its mainly for people who like to eat with their hands and dont care about the mess? . . But other than that it was really good crab. I just hate eating with my hands and it gets into my nail.. stuff like that. I would go back again, but I think i would bring at least chopsticks next time hahha.
