Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place is exactly what you expect from the name.  Loads of delicious chicken and waffles.  Oh, and add on some fluffy biscuits and Mac&amp;Cheese, and you got yourself a heart attack waiting to happen.  But if you had your choice of ways to go, this is probably one of the best.  . . It also has its own scene and history.  Not your usually friendly service, but the service is still great.  As the other 250 reviews have noted, its an LA institution, so even if you don't like fried chicken or waffles that much, you have to try this place (get the omelet).
