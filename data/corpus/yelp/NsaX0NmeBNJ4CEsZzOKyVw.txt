The new kid in town...well not as I'm writing but relatively new anyway. Simply put, the best pizza I have ever had in Atlanta. The Italian owners ship almost everything from the flour to the San Marzano tomatoes from Italy and the quality shows. Beware however, there is limited parking, seating (communal table, two benches) and the hours can be funky but that's part of the charm isn't it? The Pepperoni is thick cut, the Bufala Mozzarella( made from the domestic water buffalo) sweet and mild and the combination of fresh basil and crushed tomatoes is a perfect balance. Oh and the crust, I am not a crust eater. At least not until I came here.. . Pros: Best pizza in Atlanta. Bar none.. . Cons: Limited seating, limited parking, pricey.
