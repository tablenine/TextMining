my friend and I always go gaga when we look at the schedule and find that KOGI TRUCK is coming to us. AHHHH! seriously, how can u not drool after reading their menu?!!?! . . try their Blackjack quesadilla. the flavors instantly have a party in your mouth and you won't help but to smile. anytime there's carmelized onions, I'm alll for it. tender and juicy marinated pork and that salsa with the roasted sesame seeds all overrr MMMMmMMMMMmMM. worth the wait!
