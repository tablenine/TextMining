The service and space is nice. Food is HORRIBLE. This is not Vietnamese food, but someones idea of what Vietnamese food possibly taste like. And with that person never having tasted Vietnamese food, let alone cooked it. The pho was the most offensive dish on the menu, just plain salty like campbells chicken soup. I can't believe there was a wait for this place.
