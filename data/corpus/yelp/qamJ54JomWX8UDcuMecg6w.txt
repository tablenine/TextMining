Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I've been going to Houston's for years both at home and here in Atlanta. Unlike some restaurants, the menu doesn't have numerous pages of selection choices, but what they do offer is good. Â I've had the prime rib, the fillet mignon, and an assortment of appetizers and burgers. Again, I was never disappointed.
