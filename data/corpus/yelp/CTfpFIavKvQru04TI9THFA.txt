I just remembered this place today, when a friend told me she was going for dinner, and wanted to know how it was. Basically, they make their own beer, and any place that does that starts off in the win column. The food was not that bad, although it was a little more expensive than I like to spend.. . Every time I have been it wasn't crowded, and we never had to wait for a place to sit; perhaps that is because I tend to eat at weird times. Either way, I would definitely go back, and if I was in Midtown, and was not hankering for one of the other restaurants that are really close by, I would definitely head on into GB.
