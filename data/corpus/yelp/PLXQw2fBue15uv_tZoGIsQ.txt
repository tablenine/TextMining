Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The Apple Pan is like a smooth talking traveling salesman.  On the surface, everything is great; they have the diner nostalgia aesthetic down in a way that makes a place like Cafe 50's look like a tawdry draggle-tail by comparison.  The service is fast and responsive, which should be a given in a place so small.  But on top of that, the service is also charming, and meshes well with the overall feel of the place.. . But underneath this charmingly greasy veneer lies a less charming, but still greasy, underbelly.  $6.35 for a hamburger?  Plus $0.50 for cheese?  The food is good, but it's not THAT good.  Their turnover is high, but I guess not high enough.  . . Same thing with the pie.  Expect to pay at least $5 for a slice, plus another two dollars for ice cream or whipped cream.  Come on, Apple Pan.  $7 for a slice of pie?  That's teetering on the edge of Apple Panhandling.  ha!. . Jokes aside, this place will empty your wallet faster than Harold Hill.  But, unlike Harold Hill, I guess it won't make you feel empty inside.  The place always seems to be packed, so I guess enough people think it's worth the price.  I'm just not one of them.. . That banana cream pie was pretty ill though.  Maybe one day it will pull me back.
