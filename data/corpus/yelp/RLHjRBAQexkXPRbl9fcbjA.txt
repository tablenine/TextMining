Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
This place is a bit like rolling the dice in Vegas, sometimes you get an awesome deal, and sometimes you come up craps. Possibly literally, if you eat the wrong thing.. . I've experienced both, and they've both come after late night drinking at The Chalet. I wonder if they send kickbacks over there. One thing is for sure, if you're drunk, buzzed, tipsy, or slightly feelin' it, a few slices of pizza will usually soak it right up.. . Some of us Yelpers went last night and had a huge Hawaiian pizza, and this was a good night because we literally cleaned it right off the pan. It didn't last long, cured our giggles, and fortified all of us for the drive home. The crust was crusty, and the cheese was cheesy. The ham was hammy and the pineapple was ... well, you get it. . . If I'm drunk again at the Chalet, I'll be back, but I probably won't be driving out of my way to get here. Unless a freak chain accident burns down all the other pizza joints in LA.
