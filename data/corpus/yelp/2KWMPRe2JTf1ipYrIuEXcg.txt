Obviously, Mastro's doesn't exactly NEED another 5 Star review from me, but I will just make this short and sweet.. . 1.  Absolutely amazing food.  Get the Bone-in Filet Mignon- you will reach Carnivore's Nirvana.  I don't think I have found another steak that had such an amazing flavor and the perfect tenderness.. . 2. Pricey as all hell, but worth it I think.  $16 for a single cocktail is kinda rough, but I wasn't paying so.... . 3. My dog is such a spoiled brat- I gave him my filet mignon bone with shreds of delectable meat on it.  Lucky bastard. . 4. I was standing next to Ice Cube at the hostess stand.  Seriously, the people watching is great here- celebrities, rich old geezers, and anorexic BH women with silicon melons sagging on their chests.  Woo-hoo!  And btw, Ice Cube is a rather short dude.
