Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
"How can you NOT eat chicken with waffles," said a friend and a recent Roscoe's-a-holic.  There can't possibly be a more succulent and juicy fried chicken.  Finger lickin' good.  I have to remove the skin b/c it's dusted with flour and I have a wheat allergy. But even without that crispy skin, the chicken is cooked to perfection.  No need for any type of sauce and this is coming from a girl who likes to dunk her chicken like crazy in BBQ sauce.  The grits come smothered in butter and I then drizzle it with maple syrup.  . . This place is ghetto-fabulous.  A famous joint in L.A.  Grease me up baby!
