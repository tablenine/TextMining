Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I always pass by this place whenever I go to Chinatown, and finally after seeing it featured on "Man vs. Food", I knew I had to go check it out and see what all the fuss was about.. . All in all, I think Philippe's really does live up to its name. The restaurant looked like a cafeteria of sorts, but it did have some old-fashioned charm, what with their vintage signs, phone booths, and straightforward menu selection. There is no wonder why this place has become an LA landmark!. . I was a bit apprehensive when I saw how long the lines were, but to my surprise we got to the front pretty quickly. The demographics of the diners was also really interesting; they ranged from tourists to LA hipsters to solo regulars.. . I ordered the boysenberry pie and lamb french dip sandwich, which were both very good. The boysenberry pie's crust was a little dry, but on the up side, it didn't have that overwhelming buttery taste to it. The pie was also packed with whole berries which tasted fresh. The sandwich was really good as well. I expected to get a soggy and salty sandwich, but the amount of au jus in the sandwich was perfect.. . Word of advice: BE CAREFUL WITH THE MUSTARD! I liberally slathered it on some of my sandwich, because, hey? How spicy could the mustard really be??? Well...the spiciness of the mustard didn't have me guzzling down my lemonade but the moment I bit into it, it shot straight up to my sinuses. The spiciness was so overwhelming that I would subconsciously close my eyes from the sensation! I don't know if that makes any sense...but just try a little of their mustard on the side before adding it to your sandwich!
