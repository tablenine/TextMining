Restaurant: Pricci
Category: Italian
Pricci is another (yawn) themed restaurant from the venerable Buckhead Life Group. I ate there for the second time recently, invited by some friends, and noted that my initial impression was well-founded. My wife ordered fish that was seasoned like someone had used a booby-trapped saltshaker (you know the "gag" - the top is loosened so it falls off when used and the contents pour out). I had a pasta dish that was almost as good as homemade spaghetti topped with Prego. Bread is served with a bowl of pasta sauce and cheese for dipping, apparently so you can pretend to make your own tabletop pizzas. You want BLG food, try Kyma's.
