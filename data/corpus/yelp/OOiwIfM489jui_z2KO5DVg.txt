I love this place. I first tried the small Bev Hills location next to my old job and I fell in love. Their Santa Fe salad is my absolute favorite. The parking on the Sunset location is either street parking or valet, which can be a pain sometimes. But the funny thing is, compared to the other locations, it is prolly one of the easier ones to find parking. The atmosphere is cozy and the service is good. It is also open for late dining which is good for those partiers. You don't have to settle for Tois (yuck) or Dennys. Lets just say, it's better to go here and spend an extra $1-$2 on an entree...and a delicious entree that hasn't been left in the freezer then thrown in a deep fryer. Your taste buds will thank you.
