Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Crappy supermarket, very used clothing store,...Friendship Chinese. This place is a real gem. It's a cool space with a copper wall as a backdrop to your BYO chinese dining experience. It's freaking BYO and chinese. Never had that before. I brought beer and they gladly put it in the freezer for me and brought beers as me and a friend were ready for them. The food was really good overall. The seafood corn soup was a miss. And by miss, I mean it was like they dumped artificial crab in a can of cream corn. As in the opposite of a hit. Â The pork potstickers were really good, a little crisp on the outside, tender inside. The Hong Kong steak is the bee's knees for $8.95 on Tuesday.
