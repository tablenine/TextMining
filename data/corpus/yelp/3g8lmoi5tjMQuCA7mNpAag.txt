I have been curious to try Crustacean's famous garlic noodles with prawns for awhile and finally got the chance today for lunch.  The portion wasn't very large and the noodles were way too salty and certainly not worth the $18.95 price.  If nothing else, the service was excellent and the atmosphere is very pretty and unusual.
