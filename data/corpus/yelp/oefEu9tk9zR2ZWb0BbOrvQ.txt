I ordered the Mexicali Blues pizza with a gluten-free crust; they first brought me a Margherita pizza by mistake, which was somewhat bland. It only took about 10 minutes more to get my original pizza, and it was both original as well as tasty. They comp'ed my pizza because of the mistake even though I was in no hurry - very nice service! And any place in Chicago that accomodates gluten/wheat alergy so well deserves 5 stars in my book!
