This review may be biased, but I faithfully come to Furaibo once or twice a week. There are days when I get excellent service, and there are also days when I get terrible service. Usually it's the former and the latter happens once the traffic starts hitting.. . Their food selection is wide and everything tastes good for the most part. Everyone on Yelp harps about the amazing chicken wings, so I'll let you all decide on your. Just be prepared to eat +40 on your own. . . My favorite dish, on the other hand, is the kage karaage (deep-fried halibut). The chunks of fried fish are so delicious and juicy, I am currently frothing at the mouth just thinking about it.. . While everyone praises the hanpen cheese, I am one of the few who find that stuff to be disgusting. I can see it appealing more to the Americanized taste buds, but to me it tastes like a slice of Kraft singles wrapped around bland nothingness. Try at your own risk.. . Just remember to not eat here during lunch. Not only is the menu crippled, but the food just tastes leagues worse than normal. A co-worker of mine ordered a salad with bits of chicken, and the chicken tasted like sponge soaked in footwash... no joke.
