Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
The saving grace for this restaurant is the half priced sushi on the weekends. It used to be half off the whole sushi menu. Now there is one page that has half off at certain times on the weekend. It's 31/2 star sushi that becomes 4 star when the price is cut in half. Also, always good service.
