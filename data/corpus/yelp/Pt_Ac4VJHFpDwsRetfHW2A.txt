Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
If you have ever gone to Denny's and happy with the service. . you sir/madam, are a liar! . . Last Saturday, friends and family decided to try Bottega Louie that was recently opened up. It looks very trendy up scaled downtown restaurant. But the price is very reasonable. you'll walk into a high vaulted ceiling with decorative molding. . My my first thought was "wow, you can have a volleyball game here." . . You'll be amazed of how well the place is organized. First you'll past through the delectable pastry counter. Even myself, who doesn't like sweets all that much, they have me drooling. the deli counter was next. i could live here. . for dinner, I had fried calamari for an appetizer. It was battered lightly. I was impressed; calamari is very tricky to cook. Too under, it will taste like rubber; too over, it will taste like rubber. . And for the entree, I had the classic clams and mussels in a white wine broth; well balanced seasoning and spiced. Not overly powering so that you can taste the clams and mussels. Great job. . But the best experience from this place is the service. You will be intelligently catered by a well trained young staffs, who are relentless with great care and sincere attitude. Thanks Bottega Louie for a great meal. I'll definitely come back for sure. . "Dorothy, we're not in Denny's anymore"
