I love going to places that have dishes with flavors and items I've never had before, and Gingergrass is one of those places (and one of those dishes is the Jack and Ginger salad with Jack fruit - so fresh and tasty OMG!). . . Before you order food PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE order their basil lime elixir to drink (this place should get 5 stars just on this drink alone). It's tons of basil mashed into a glass with soda water and lime juice. It is one of my favorite drinks in the world. . . Their coconut curry crusted cod is delicious (yes, it's like it sounds, a piece of cod with a crust on it and when you break the crust thick wonderful coconut curry pours out of it). . . My favorite dish is probably the Bo Satay - it's like a big wonderful plate of beef satay (not on skewers) over a bed of rice. . . The neighborhood is cool, the vibe to the place is cool, you can sit outside or in, prices are reasonable enough ($50 for 2 people with appetizers and basil lime elixirs). . . Really, go here - I can't imagine being dissapointed and I think you'll find that you have another very cool and unique place to add to your repetoir (and afterwards head over to Tazzo Gelato!!!)
