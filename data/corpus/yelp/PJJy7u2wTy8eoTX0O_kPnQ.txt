Good new place to grab a burger, made their way, not yours; and some good cheese.  That's the food side of the review.  Well, also, it is a bit much for that burger now that I think about it. . . Now the service. Some people really dig the fries too. I say ok, but I'm in it for the beer and burger, because you can't get ketchup.  PERIOD.  Really, ketchup would be nice to at least option in, c'mon now. The Customer used to be King.  How can I enjoy my fries fully w/o the most common of condiments?  I usually toss some tobasco in w/the ketchup, and since this ain't Germany, I am not going to make due with mayo!!!  LET ME HAVE MY KETCHUP, someday I'm going to sneak in a bottle and see what happens.. . Decor is hip and if you're hip you'll feel it, especially on a weekend when the hipsters are out en force.  . . Enjoy!
