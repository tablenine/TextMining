Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
Antico Pizza's ringing Yelp endorsements are true: this place serves incredible pizza. My fellow diners and I crept down Hemphill until we spotted this ostensible hole-in-the-wall, surprised by the unassuming interior. The woman who took our order didn't speak the best English, but my having to repeat myself at least three times allowed me to enjoy her soothing Italian accent. . . We ordered two pies: a margherita with pepperoni and the bianca. After sitting at the end of a large table in the adjacent room, already occupied at the other end by another dining party, one of the staff members slid two huge trays in front of us--after literally 5 minutes had passed. The pizza was amazing. The pepperoni on the margherita, sliced in thin strips, crisped into my drooling mouth, the crust's char settling into my fingernails. The bianca was equally amazing: light and CHEESY. . . Antico seems more like a pizzeria that supports take-out orders, although I enjoyed sitting at the huge table and dousing my last margherita slice with the available fresh oregano and EVOO. . . I will be back, as visions of mozz and oregano have been dancing in my head.
