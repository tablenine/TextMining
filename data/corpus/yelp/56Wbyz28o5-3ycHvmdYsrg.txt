if you look around this place, pretty much everyone's eating a burger ... there's only 1 on the menu but it's the reason i come to eat here. plus their beer selection is pretty extensive ... how many other places serve Allagash white ?? on tap!!. the sweet potato fries are good too, if a bit pricey though.... . biggest con is the lack of any order in terms of trying to get a seat. this place is always packed at night. and the first time i went, i don't think i quite understood that you're just supposed to hover around tables waiting for people leave after they finish eating ?? how awkward. . oh and don't ask for any ketchup....
