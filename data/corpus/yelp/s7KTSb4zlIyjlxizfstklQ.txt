Category: Bakeries
I'll always have fond memories of Canter's.  Ah, the late late nights -- or early early mornings -- during college.  A great place to just pick up and go to at 2AM.   . . Favorite things about Canter's:.  - the pickles w mustard.  - cheese blintzes.  - potato pancakes.  - matzah ball soup.  - the corned beef reuben or hot pastrami sandwich.  - sharing a napoleon for dessert.  - running into my high school chorus teacher's ex-brother-in-law from Massachusetts.  - service staff who've been there since it opened.  - murals on the parking lot wall. . Definitely a place to go for the cool casual ambience and good times with friends at any hour.
