I noticed some of the past Yelpers have complained about the service at this place, and maybe management took notice, because that wasn't a problem this time. Our server was pretty attentive and we watched as someone always greeted guests promptly at the door. We were also celebrating a birthday and we were given a round of "Washington apple" shots on the house. . . Food: The fried pickles and hush puppies were a good start to the meal. The mushroom ravioli, burger and mac 'n cheese were a hit, but stray away from the black bean burger. It was pretty bland. Also, the oyster po-boy was too much bread and not enough oyster.. . Drink: The overall beer selection is pretty good, but there definitely isn't enough on draft. Draft beer isn't really saving you any money either. Can't comment on the wine. . . There was definitely an eclectic crowd there for a Friday night, but overall everyone seemed to be enjoying their experience. This is a good place to start your night if moving on to different places in East Atlanta.
