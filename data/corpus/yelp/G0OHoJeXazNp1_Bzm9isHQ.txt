Very tasty and fresh fish (4 stars, but...) A good place to go if you want to impress your date with how little you care about the cost of love. Perhaps this is just a poor grad student gripe, but I would like to know how much I am paying for my food before I get the bill. The dearth of prices on the menu makes this impossible. . . Nevertheless, there seemed to be many authentic Japanese dishes not available at the typical California sushi restaurant. I especially enjoyed the cucumber and pickled plum in addition to the scallop sashimi. We also had some nice salmon sashimi, although for the price there is definitely better. The service was also very good, except that the host insisted on seating my date while I was in the bathroom after being told it would be a fifteen minute wait. Just a little awkward when you're looking around the restaurant like a fool hoping she didn't change her mind.
