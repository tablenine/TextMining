Restaurant: Lula&#39;s Sweet Apothecary
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
The service was sooo sweet! I love finding nice, sweet staff in the city, which is always rare. However, I can't say I love their ice cream. I had high expectations due to other yelp reviews and I'm sorry to say that Lula's just didn't live up to them! But it might be because they didn't have their most popular flavors in stock the day I went. I'm willing to give them another try but only if I'm in the neighborhood!
