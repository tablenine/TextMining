I guess my experience must have been better than most people's.  Probably some of the best guac/salsa/chips I've ever had, fantastic food, dessert, drink selection and superb service.  Swanky dim-lit indoor/outdoor seating and great location -- Laurel Canyon + Ventura.  Music was a little loud though and I definitely noticed the frat-boy customers.  Four stars because the bathroom smelled like fucking dead babies.
