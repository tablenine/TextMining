yums, this is easily becoming one of my faves. mainly bc i can get an arrangement of diff stuff for a low cost! IM. A. HUGE. FAN.!!!!. . this time, 3 of us went-we got the following:. -mutton biryani: not my fave, but my friends wanted it. mutton (with bones) with rice. good flavor.. -chicken 65: OBVI! i could killed 8x plates of these myself haha. -nehari: beef stew. has a good bit of ginger in it which i like. but the gravy isnt as thick as the other curries. word of caution: this is one of the main dishes that i have to de-greasify.. -butter chicken: i didnt know they did this/never seen it before...but......they served it with a slab of butter on top hahahahha LOL. it was good. . -tandoori chicken: sooooooo moist. and charred. and delish. bone in chicken. had an extra kick that day. SPICYYYYY!. -they also gave us masssssive amounts of raita wowzers.. -got naan and paratha. i really like the naan here. first time getting the paratha, its a lot more dense than the naan, though seemingly the same type of flour. i liked it. -pistachio kulfi for the first time.....mmm....not as good as i expected. i was a little put off by the sweetness. but good overall.. . i want to try the mutton khorma next time. they ran out :(
