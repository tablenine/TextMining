Finally, another shaved ice place that's even remotely comparable to my favorite Little Bean in Rowland Heights!  They have authentic Taiwanese shaved ice here and you can choose up to 5 toppings for $5.  They also have a mixed shaved ice that has like 10 toppings that's pre-set (also for $5).  My friend and I split one and got almond jello, coconut jelly, red bean, custard, and condensed milk.  The ice was finely shaven and they drizzle liquid brown sugar on top (just like Little Bean!), so you don't even really need the condensed milk.  I was very satisfied!
