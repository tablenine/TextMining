Well I say if you don't like eats ,poopoo, on you, it's cheap, simply ,freshly made to order, and healthy. There enough combinations to satisfy any appetite.  And it's fast food that won't kill you. Having been one of the first customers to grace their doors. Back when they had enough room for bands to play there. I am loyal and true to Bob and his crew for feeding me. Sometimes the only healthy meals I got. I love the meat free greens, you can't get those anywhere else. It tooks years fo whining but they finally added my beloved butterbeans. Which are best before too late in the day. As all beans eventually become mush.  I love the corn, the sweet potatoes, the cornbread and those damn brownies. The sweet tea is the best in the city. My favorite meal there is by far the spagettini with marinara and side of pesto. No one will make out with me afterwards, I don't understand that one.  I have eaten a ton of spaghetti sauces in my day but eats has my favorite.  When they were still a new place with very few tables. My friend who was pregnant and I ate there every day. For 9 months. Her baby was dubbed the eats baby, by Bob. He's a healthy thriving teenager now and I feel old.  Still if I'm anywhere near the place it draws me in like a tractor beam and I leave happier for it. . I took my roommate there 14 years ago to try the jerk chicken. He has made a pilgrimage to be there when it opens every Sunday since.  So if your there on Sunday around 11, say "Hay LA", to the grumpy old biker dude, waiting for his chicken. . So its made fresh,. Its cheap.. Its fast. Its healthy. There's a variety of combinations to choose from,. They have beer,. There is awesome sweet tea and brownies. The crowd is more diverse than the U.N.. I say Viva La Eats!
