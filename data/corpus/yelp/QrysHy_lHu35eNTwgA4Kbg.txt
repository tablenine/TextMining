Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I have had Prime Rib at only a handful of places but dude this place has the best of all time, I wish I can take the meat cart and the carver dude home with me and just eat awesome meat chunks while I sit at home watching the tube. The cream corn was WOW. the place is very nice but sitting next to a stranger is kinda weird especially when you accidentally spray meat juice on their salad lol, I just stayed quiet. Kinda pricey but def. worth it, every meat eater should go at least once.
