The food at Phoenix is a good way to sample authentic Chinese Cuisine while having a delicious and very inexpensive meal.. . The wait is ridiculous between 11:30 and 2 on weekends, so your best bet is to get there early at around 10ish. That way, you won't have to wait for a spot and the food is more fresh and there is more variety. . . My favorites are the cheong fun (Big Rice noodles with meat in the middle). It is awesome to go with someone who speaks Chinese, but not at all necessary. . . As an added bonus the dining room has a great view of the city skyline. :)
