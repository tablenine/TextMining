It seems to me that Maison Akira has better reviews compared to my actual experience.  Maybe, after reading all the positive reviews, I had high expectations walking in.  Nonetheless, I found the food and my experience here just average.  I had a full dinner meal here (appetizer, main entree, and dessert with coffee) yet still went to Coconut Bay in Rowland Heights right after getting in my car and ate a chicken mint leaf with a Thai ice tea.. I started off the meal with a house mixed greens and their lobster bisque.  The lobster was a little too heavy for me after a few spoonfuls and I tasted more of the cream and butter than actual lobster or lobster stock.  For the main course, I ordered the infamous Chilean sea bass.  I was quite impressed how moist and well cooked it was but I was feeling too full from the bisque to really enjoy the fish.  The entree came with diced garden root veggies that was bland and did very little for the dish.  It didn't offer any texture in comparison to the bass.  The bass was soft and flaky while the veggies were also soft and tender.  As for dessert, I ordered the famous Timbal Elysee "Laserre".  What a pretty sight that was.  It came with fresh berries on top of ice cream accompanied by a raspberry reduction sauce.  . The decor however was fabulous!  It is a tiny little restaurant with a homey feel.  I liked the restroom!  First of all, it was really clean, neat, and actually smelled nice.  There were also free French lessons in there which I found amusing.  The wait staff was on their A-game as well.  They made sure my drink was full and always took a sense of pride while putting the food on my table, which sometimes is hard to do.
