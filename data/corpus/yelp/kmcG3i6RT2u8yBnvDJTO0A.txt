Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
When I was compiling my list of chicken and waffles places, I realized that I made one major omission:. . ROSCOES.. . The place where my chicken'n waffles craving began.  I was introduced to this establishment years ago when they actually opened a Northern Cali site in Oakland.  When I trekked back and forth to LA, it was always a priority must stop along with Philippes.  . . 1st impressions are lasting and great impressions.  They set the standards of what a good chicken n waffles place should be:  Tasty fried chicken, crispy brown waffles, awesome sides like mac n cheese and yams, refreshing lemonade and sweet tea, and buttery corn bread.  Yes, they have it all.  . . Not sure why they left the Bay Area cause I remembered it was always packed there.  Left a void.
