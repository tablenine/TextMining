EXCELLENT!!!! I NEVER write reviews but this place was sooo good im writing my first one...nicely tucked away in a block on Vine in Hollywood this place is not only walking distance to wonderful after dinner places all around but the food is FANTASTIC!!!. . Very well-thought out menu--seems short at first glance but when the waiter said "he was very proud of everything on the menu" believe him this time---also the cocktais are very original---and not in the least bit dissappointing--(i think we tried them all) Â I am SURE that everything on the menu is just as uber-delicious and well presented as these--but I have to speak very highly of the dinner entree's: Sea Bass, Albacore, and Lobster Pot Pie!!!. . AS well--I am a cheese plate--freak--can never pass it up---and would have made a HUGE mistake if i had passed this one up too---SO GET IT---. . Plainly speaking---this place has a wonderful staff--5 stars on service--5 stars on taste--and one of the best (most surprising) i have been to in a while
