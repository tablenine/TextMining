Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
I went here on a date and I just dont think it was that good.  I mean the atmosphere is awesome with the pirateship, crocodiles and all but i think you get better fondue at chains even (melting pot for example).  Worth a trip once for the scenery.  Also Dante the owner is super cool.  he comes and talks to every table.  I might have to give it another chance but i dunno.
