I like, U like, we all like. Its a fun place, with not a lot of room to fall down to. I like lunch there, quiet, good hot food and a cold beer, or two.  You like it 'cause its easy to find.  We all like it cause its the best Taco Mac in Atlanta.  I even got lucky and found a spot out front.  Oh, if you have to ask the price of Parking - then you can't afford it! Bring your bike.  The waitress kept smiling at me. must have been the Ketchup on my chin.   Wait, there was a chicken wing stickin' out me pocket!
