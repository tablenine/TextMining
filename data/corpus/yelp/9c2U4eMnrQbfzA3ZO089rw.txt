Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
there is ALWAYS a line at this restaurant.  i have never waited less than 45 mintues at this place.  is everyone craving for dumplings when I am?  the food is decent but more pricey than the dumpling house across the street.  However, some dishes lack flavorand the homestyle cooking I am used to.  But the noodles and soup here taste better than at the dumpling house.  . . I came here with a girlfriend once and my dinner was ruined because the guy sitting next to me told his waitress that our beef stew soup was weird and recommended to his "date" that the Chinese should tear down the Great Wall of China in order to build condos and businesses....UGH! i wanted to sock him.
