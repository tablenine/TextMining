I don't know if I can add much but, this place has the best dumplings I have had since I was last in Taipei. The service is a little bad but who cares when the food is this good!. . The order:. . 20 small pork dumplings comes with soup!! Sooo Good. Noodle with minced pork and tofu! = :). Fried pork chop --- Really good. Regular pork dumplings.. My personal fave!. Chicken Dumplings My second personal fave!. Green beans ... Really BOMB!. Shrimp Pork Shumai.. I am drooling thinking about these. Chicken Rice Cake ... My friends Fave!. Chicken Fried Rice... UMMM. . Need I say more 9 dishes and some sodas came to less than 80 BUCKS!! That is incredible and totally worth the drive if you live far!. . Can't wait to come back here again. . . BTW: NO AMEX so make sure you have a VISA or Master
