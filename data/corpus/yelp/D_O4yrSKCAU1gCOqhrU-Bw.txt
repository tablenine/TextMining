I am originally from Chicago and was back visiting friends who took me there for a terrific lunch.  Selmarie's is one of their favorites and I can see why!  We each got a chocolate truffle on the way out and it was maybe the best truffle I've ever had.  If you're in the area and haven't been there yet you should check it out, it's worth a trip.
