OK, I had never heard of this spot  before until a friend mentioned she wanted to go here to celebrate her birthday.  At first I was thinking and copping a attitude, do you not know how many good restaurants we pass on the road from south OC to get to Beverly Hills? Thankfully, my friend was onto something. The atmosphere is cozy, intimate for a kind of high profile spot. If you know what I mean. When you walk in you get the feeling that people are checking you out to see if you're someone famous. Of course me and my crew was reppin the OC and strutting our best OC stroll in the B. Hills. (lol) Our server was a cool dude... he was quick in pointing out what he likes and the specials of the day. I went low maitenance and ordered the garlic noodles &amp; Chicken satay as appetizers. Both were on point and very tasty. Good flavor.. . As the main entree, I picked good again and had the Halibut.  Usually you all know Halibut can be a bit dry, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was prepared in some sort of sauce that I can't recall the name of.  The halibut wyth the garlic noodles set me up for a good evening. I was quite satisfied even though we had drive over the hills and around the mountains to eat.(lol). . So I'm good with suggesting if you're in the B. Hills area for something else, I would say check this spot out. Otherwise save the gas and go to your favorite local dinner place.
