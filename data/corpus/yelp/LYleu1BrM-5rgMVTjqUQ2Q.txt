I went there with my bf on Friday 6.30 pm. We were lucky to get a street parking spot a block away and paid $3 just to reach 8pm. If you were not so lucky, then there's a parking building across the street for $4 at night. . . We walked into the shop and found that you must write your name on the list yourself. The list was placed on a chair. Waiting was around 25 mins and we got 2 counter seats. Sitting there was great because we could see them cook. It's so exciting to see the chef cooking so fast almost like he was dancing! We can see boiling soup huge huge pot. I love when he was cooking fried rice, shaking the big pan up and down, and the rice was jumping beautifully. . . We ordered their signature ramen combo with shredded pork bowl to share. I read other review before and they said it would be enough for two. I was skeptical but it actually was enough...really enough.. . The salad came first, then the ramen with sharing bowl. The soup was thick and nice. We got extra pork (4 pieces for $2.50). Â It's so soft with good amount of fat that melts in your mouth. Shredded pork bowl looked small but it's actually full of real good tender pork and sweet sauce. We ended up full and happy.. . The vibe is also what makes the place so unique. Their retro post-war japanese posters and signs are so cool. Your meal will be complimented with japanese waitress shouting the orders as the background music!. . We will go back again! This time with more friends and my foodie bro.
