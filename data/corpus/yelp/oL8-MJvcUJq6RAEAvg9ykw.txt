Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
This truck is amazing!  I ate here during First Friday's on Abbot Kinney about 3 months ago and it was to die for.  The only draw back is that because it is so good there is often a long wait to order and then a good sized wait to receive your food.  But people... they are cooking out of a truck, not a full sized kitchen.  The food is definitely worth waiting for!  I suggest the caprese or the butternut squash sandwich, I never knew that grilled cheese could be so gourmet!
