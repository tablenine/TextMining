An enjoyable experience (especially in light of a horrible experience the next night somewhere else).   We started out with the crab cake appetizer.  It had a good amount of crap and nice flavor (although not quite as amazing as the one at Shaun's).  . . For the main course, I heeded the advice of fellow Yelpers and had the molasses pork tenderloin.  It was delicious - so tender it would melt in my mouth!  My partner had the roasted chicken - I had a small taste and it was incredibly moist.   . . Service was very attentive.   The wine (Campus Stella, Albarino) was rich &amp; fruity.  The only reason we didn't give Wisteria 5 stars was the dessert wasn't as exceptional as the rest of the meal.  I had the black cherry cobbler &amp; my partner had the strawberries &amp; balsamic.  The strawberries needed more balsamic &amp; the cobbler could've used a bit more ice cream.. . All in all, it was an evening well-spent and I recommend Wisteria without reservation.
