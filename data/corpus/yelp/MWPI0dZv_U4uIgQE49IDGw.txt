I've been going here since it opened so I thought I should review since I was just there again a week ago.. . Good sashimi and maki rolls here.  Everyone is correct in loving the Ocean Sundae because it is one of their star rolls.  I've also had the Orange Crush, Latin Heat, Alaskan Night--all very good.  Two rolls that I wanted to try that looked really good, but didn't, were the Lava Maki and the Strawberry Benkan roll.  . . The nigiri is also fresh too but I tend to love Wakamono and Coast a little better sometimes for my raw goods.. . Also wonderful is the Goat Cheese Tempura Salad!  Probably one of the best salads I've ever had with mixed greens, a light but flavorful sweet chili lime vinagrette, apples, pecans, and lovely soft goat cheese fried in a light tempura batter, YUM!. . You wouldn't think about ordering this at a sushi place BUT, the Kobe Beef Sliders are fantastic!  2 kobe beef mini burgers topped with crispy salmon skin &amp; a sunny-side up quail egg with fries and basil aioli.  The meat is tasty and juicy and the egg and aioli are nice touches that actually add to it without just being there to be "different".      . . The atmosphere is lively and not quiet since it is ALWAYS CROWDED on a Friday or Saturday night.  A fun place to go with friends or maybe a date that you don't want to be too intimate with?  Just depends on what mood you're in, but don't go here for a quiet romantic feel.  Simple trendy decor with usually some low key dance beat type music going on but not overbearing.  I've never had problems with any of the service from the waiters or waitresses, it's always been good.. . Make a reservation for any weekend night for sure!  Otherwise you WILL wait for at least 45 minutes or longer for a table.
