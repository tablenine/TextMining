Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Everything was good, I didn't have to wait in line before getting seated or have to sit at the table for too long before we got a server. It wasn't anything spectacular but the food was good, a little pet peeve of mine the orange juice they brought us was very warm. I wouldn't scurry back here for any reason but it was a good experience trying chicken and waffles for the first time. . . I will definately say this, if you have a huge appetite and can eat a huge portion of food then this is the place to be. . . Pricing was okay but a bit on the higher side, I think I would rather eat somewhere else if it came down to it. I have since then ate at other chicken and waffle joints and let me tell you, Moe's Chicken and Waffles in Fontana blows this join out of the water, but all in all it was a pretty good experience.
