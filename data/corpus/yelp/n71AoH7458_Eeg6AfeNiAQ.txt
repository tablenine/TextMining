Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I used to go to this place and recommend it to others a lot.  But like all things that become famous, it has lost its quality, authenticity, and taste.  Pizza was once my favorite in Culver City - now the crust is soggy and has a hard layer of plastic they try to pass off as cheese.  The pasta puttanesca was sloppily thrown together: we identified three types of pasta in the bowl. The waitstaff was amateur... or else totally high on pot. At one point, I held my dirty plates in my hand while the waiter just stared at me.  Oh, boy.  Don't get me started on cleanliness: the menus were filthy.. . The manager comped our sloppy pasta and gave us some gelato (that wasn't great, either), but we still paid for our plastic pizza.. . I know there is nothing for Ugo to do about this, but the smell of the Culver City sewers that night was also atrocious.
