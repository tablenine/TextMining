One of the best burger's I've ever eaten. The sweet potato fries are pretty good, too.  Go early or go late. There's always a line...and once you get in...you have to hang around and wait for a table or seat to open up.  Claim it fast!  Order at the bar. . . If you're an iced tea fan...forget it.  No iced tea in the house.  They do have bubble up -- when was the last time you drank bubble up?. The hefenweizen is "oh, so good" -- with a hint of bananas.  :O)
