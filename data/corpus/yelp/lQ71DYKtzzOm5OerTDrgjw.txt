Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
One of the best burgers I've had by far! This place is pretty small but it's nice for a night of romantic burger scarfing. There is no alcohol here though. Something to do with having only one restroom. There, you might've just learned something new. The Umami burger is really good. Hell, all their burgers are good. They're very flavorful and you can pick out the tastes of each ingredient. It's not the average burger place by any means. You have to try it to believe it.
