If you want to get the Bang for your bucks in terms of getting a REALLY good BUZZ!! This is the place!! When I ordered a vodka cranberry, I got a whole lot of vodka and alittle bit of cranberry.. oh so yummy... The Fries they had are yummy as well, freshly cut and crispy, and considering it was super late at night they were still serving up food, not only drinks. Â I would skip the nacho cheese dip, the dip was watery, and the chips were not fresh.. but the hamburgers and fries looked good ( and like I said the fries tasted darn good)..  The bar area is nice and big, so you do not feel squished..Entire place is very inviting. The thing is for such a large place they have 2 one stall bathrooms- unisex.. so a small line can form...  Finding the place is tricky, but once you do, it's so cute and worth it.. Bartenders were super nice and starting a tab is so easy, just be careful that you don't over do on the drinks and cannot get home.
