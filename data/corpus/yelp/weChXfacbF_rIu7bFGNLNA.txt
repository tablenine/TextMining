Attention:. . You order &amp; pay when you walk through the door.. You take a pepper grinder &amp; SIT.. We bring you bread &amp; water.. We bring you drinks &amp; food.. We sprinkle parmesan if you want some. . You tip if you haven't done so already.. You leave happy.. . No, you can't buy the olive oil, it's great, we know, but we don't sell it.. Oh, and NO, THERE IS NO GARLIC BREAD.. I think the stuff there, freshly made daily, is effing delicious. . . Things happen in that exact order.. . The servers , cocktail runners, and waiters have to find your table by pepper grinder. They all have cool little names that come up on your ticket. So be patient, we have to find pepper grinders that may be hidden somewhere on the table while carrying very hot plates of food. . . So, be nice.. . I used the word "we," though I no longer work there.. =)
