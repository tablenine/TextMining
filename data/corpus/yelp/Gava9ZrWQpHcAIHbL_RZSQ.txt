First of all...I want to say there is a waitor there with a semi long pony tail that is VERY PUSHY with the food. I asked what he recommended and all he recommended was the most EXPENSIVE food.. . I asked for water and he brought me a $10 bottle of evian. . I also ordered that tapas in which he said it was $15 but it was $15 PER serving so we paid $30 for an appetizer which was not worth it AT ALL. . The garlic noodles are not up to the hype...I can go to the mall and get mongolian bbq noodles that taste the same if not better.. . All in all the ambiance of the place is nice but I left there feeling TRICKED into buying a lot of stuff I didn't want. I would NEVER recommend this restaurant again!. . MEDIOCRE food for $$$$$$$$
