Category: Sandwiches
Another fine Philippe's experience. Had the French Dipped ham sandwich for the first time (always stuck to beef or pork). Went really well with the mustard. Simply that with the hot mustard and a Fat Tire on tap would have been a plenty fine experience. But then I needed to check something online. I whipped out my DS and loaded up the Opera Browser. I was thinking I might be able to grab some random nearby wifi signal.... . Holy crap, Philippe's has a free wifi network! I love this place so much.
