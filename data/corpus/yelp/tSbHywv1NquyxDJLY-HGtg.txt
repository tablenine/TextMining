Good food, but quite frankly a little over rated in my opinion.  I was expecting a blow the doors off, knock your socks off, fantastic meal!  I place Gibson's slightly above Morton's in terms of quality and flavor.  Don't get my wrong, the food was good.  But, it certainly did not live up to the hype.  I really don't understand the long wait for a table.  Granted, the location is money sitting right in the smack center of Rush St.  I had the WR Chicago Cut, which is basically a bone-in ribeye. This was the most highly recommended entrée on the menu by our waitress that she was creamin' over.  With that kind of enthusiasm, I was sold!  Again, it was good... but certainly did not live up to the hype and that said, over-priced!  Apps were good.  Service was excellent!
