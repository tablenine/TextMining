Only in LA.... I will forever be ranting about this place.. . This place blows! It's too darn small and too busy. I'm still trying to figure out why it's so busy here on a wednesday night. What's all the hype about?. The main point of going out to eat, at least for me, is to have someone serve me my food. But here i had to order at the bar, and hunt like a fiend for a table only to end up sitting with strangers in an uncomfortable picnic like atmosphere while paying top dollar for a burger. A decent burger but a ketchup-less one! no ketchup rule here folks. So i notice that everyone forgot to order water because at a restaurant i'm used to having that on the table, even without asking. so now we get back in the bar line to get water while leaving half the group in charge of Â "guarding" our table. and the sweet potato fries only taste good with the sauce. On their own, I didn't care much for them. but what really made me hate the place it the "no substitution" and all their stupid rules. I just want a burger!! I don't need a 3 minute lecture from a snotty bartender on wheat free beer not being real beer...just tell me if you have some! and when i tell him i need a bunless burger due to food allergies he says "can't do it". I tell him i will DIE if i eat the bun and he still refuses. that just killed it for me and now i hate this place :(
