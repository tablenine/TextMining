Went in here last week for an alumni event. The food was tasty and the beer was cold. We were there to watch a basketball game. They had every TV with the game on which was nice, but after repeated requests to turn the volume up on the TVs, they just didn't listen. They turned up a little, but would not anymore. Hello, we are all there to watch the game, not listen to music. Anyway, the place was nice, bathrooms clean and service was great. Good times, just put the damn sound on
