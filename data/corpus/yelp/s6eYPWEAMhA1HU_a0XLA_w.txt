One of those places that's so damn special you don't want to review it, but the secret was out long ago. Sushi Gen is one of LA's best sushi spots. It's right next to Kagaya (another fave) in Honda Plaza, it's fairly small, and it's pretty perfect.. I prefer Sushi Gen to the 818 sushi temples (Nozawa, Katsu-ya, Kazu) because there's no attitude and the fish is...a little weirder. In Little Tokyo you will get a more exotic range of choices &amp; that we love. Masa, the head sushi chef, is a master and a very nice guy. . Please try to leave us room at the bar!!
