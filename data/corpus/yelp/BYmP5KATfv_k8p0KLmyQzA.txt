Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Pleasantly surprised by how many vegetarian options they had on their menu- you never really know when you are trying a new place.. My sandwich was awesome- kind of a caprese salad on a pretzel roll. You get to choose your bread and two sides, needless to say I was in heaven. The fries were great and the fruit was fresh even though it was about 8-9ish at night.. I had some great wine, even though their beer list is extensive.. A very chill place to go and hang out whenever....not really a romantic date spot, but a date spot nonetheless.. Not to miss for those who are obsessed with sandwiches like me!
