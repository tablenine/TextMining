I've lived in the neighborhood all my life and didn't discover it until about 5 years ago. I'm never disappointed with this place. Whenever I have friends in town, this is the place I bring them to for lunch! Standard order: hickory burger, plate of fries, and apple pie with vanilla ice cream! I've also had the egg salad sandwich, which is super good. They stuff the sandwich to death! The servers are super nice! Bring cash! Parking can be hard sometimes. So park across the street at Westside Pavillion.
