The host was rude to our party starting things off on a bad note.  It took a good long while to even get the server there.  A stylish interior with matching very nice bathroom.. . As noted below, small edamame servings.  Forgot my appetizer of goat cheese tempura and when it finally arrived it was $8 for 3 small pieces of goat cheese.  It was good but not that good.  . . As for the sushi, again small portions but some nicely inventive rolls.  I had the Kula Maki and my table also ordered the Ocean Sundae which looked the most impressive of the lot.  The ginger was better quality than usual.  The sushi seemed to stick too much to their wooden serving trays.  . . Minus price and service it was a success...  maybe I'll come back when it's half price.
