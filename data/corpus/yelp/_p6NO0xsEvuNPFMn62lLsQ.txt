Category: Vietnamese
Two words: Roasted Crab. Another two words: Garlic Noodles. Two more words: Blorp, yum!. . The staff was very accommodating when we asked to change tables (initially they seated us at the table closest to the kitchen, and I have a hard time enjoying my meal when I see staff scurrying in and out with plates.) Â . . Expensive, but worth the splurge.
