The service is fast...maybe too fast!  I felt quite rushed through my entire meal.  People circled like vultures for the next available seat at the counter.  . . Server: "Burger?". Me: "yes.". Server: "Fries?". Me: "yes". Server: "Coke". Me: "yes". . But somehow...I only got a burger and had to ask about the other stuff.  Why do they bother taking our order if they don't listen to what we say?. . The burger itself was fine.  Nothing great, but also not terrible.  A bit on the pricey side for what you get though.
