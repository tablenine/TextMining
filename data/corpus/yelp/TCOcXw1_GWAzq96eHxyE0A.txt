Beyond the over the top decor and squished seating arrangements (despite all the room), the food is simply weak. I can't find another word for it. The miso soup was saltier than any miso I have ever had. The sushi and the kabobs are prepared very nicely, however the quality is fairly low. The beef kabobs were tasty, but not seasoned properly (I guess that's why they throw in the low grade sauces?), and the chicken kabobs were bland. It's also way too expensive for the food you get. I understand that this place is more about the vibe and location than anything else. It wouldn't be this highly rated if ashton kutcher didn't own it and if it was in any other location than where it is.
