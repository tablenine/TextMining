Had a great birthday dinner here recently.  It didn't start out so well...our server didn't make an appearance for 10 minutes after we were seated.  But after that, smooth sailing.. . I really enjoyed the mojito flight.  My husband's sangria flight was nothing special by comparison, but still good.. . The food was excellent.  The ceviche sampler in particular is wonderfully fresh, and the mint/spicy/whatever palate-cleansing shooter that's included combined flavors in a way I've never tasted...a good way.  Also delicious were the pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, the flight of tacos and the veggie empanadas.  Ginger marinated chicken skewers were nothing special, but my husband enjoyed his bbq pork.. . Bonus: they brought a free birthday piece of rum cake, which put us over the top.  We waddled home shortly thereafter.
