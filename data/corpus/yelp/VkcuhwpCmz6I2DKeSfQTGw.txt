Great happy hour from 10-12! A lot of appetizers are 50% off and their beers, wines, and martinis are cheaper at this time too. My friends and I come here all the time just for their happy hour. . . And they have really great, friendly service! One time, we had a large group.. and I mean LARGE. Over 100 people. And we didn't even make reservations. We just called in a little early and basically "warned" them that we're coming. We took up the entire outdoor patio and our waiter was SO accommodating and friendly. I was really impressed! This is definitely one of the better Yard Houses I've been to.
