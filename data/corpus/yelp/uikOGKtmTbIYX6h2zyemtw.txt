Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
the tacos are great. . only if you like tacos one way - shredded beef in a crunchy shell with lettuce and the cheese is optional.. . the red salsa is kinda bland.. but the green salsa more than makes up for it - if you like spicy and flavorful salsa - go green.. . the guacamole is absolutely dreadful. it's like soup. bland soup at that. how can they absolutely desecrate the wonderful avocado by liquefying it?  no redeeming quality to that guac.  i'm sorry to say that.. . to their credit, their tortilla used on the burrito is quite good - and again - the beef is good... so the beef &amp; bean burrito is a good option.... . the lines are long - the food is cheap - the tacos are good.  but that's not enough to get me to come back to culver city.  this evening was the first time i had tito's in 15 years.  perhaps i'll try them again in another 15 if they're still around.  or not.
