I could come here every week and eat new things. I love that! It's hard being a vegetarian and eating a restaurant's obligatory veggie-pasta dish..ah, monotony. But here, choice? I'm indecisive enough as it is, so it's probably a good thing I'm generally only given one dinner option at a restaurant. Beware veggies, and picky ones too (I'm fairly picky): lots of OMG-options! Sorta pricey if you try a few dishes, and how could you not, and I wish they had cocktails that were less sake-oriented, but whatev--they have brooklyn lager.
