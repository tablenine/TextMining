Restaurant: The Shed at Glenwood
Category: American (New)
Ok, I need to start this review with saying I do not love everything!  I know, I know - I have given really good marks to a few places around town, but I have had some really GREAT meals at all the places.  This trend keeps going with the Shed in Glenwood Park!. . First thing, if you want to try it out without spending a ton of cash - GO SUNDAY!  They now have a prefix dinner of three courses for only $20 per person!  My friend Kon and I started with a few apps - Fried Diver Scallop Sliders - yes Sliders!  They were a really good twist on an over played menu item.  I will take Scallops any day over burgers.  We also had the Chicken Liver-Bacon Bruschetta which was not on over dried bread.  Loved it!. . Check it out - seems as per the other reviews they might have gotten off on the wrong foot - but if your a foodie you'll know their new Chef is Lance who worked with Shaun Doty for years...he has really come onto his own at the Shed!  Plus you will not go wrong Sunday nights with the prefix!
