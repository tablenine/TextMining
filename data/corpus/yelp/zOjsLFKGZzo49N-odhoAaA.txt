Wow, these guys are on to something huge. The LaBrea place is small place, tables can be hard to come by, park on the street to save the valet. But if you like burgers, there is not a better one being made right now. Also where elce can you get a lamb or a pork burgers made fresh. Go for the skinny fries, skip the onion rings.
