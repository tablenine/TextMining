Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
My, my, my.  Sushi-Gen, you are quite possibly the best Sushi I've ever had!. . I needed a good place to take my visiting parents out on a workday lunch, and this was the right spot to satisfy our fresh fish urges.  They've got a pretty simple menu featuring typical restaurant dishes (teriyaki, cutlet), sashimi, and sushi combos.  If you're adventurous with your sushi, I recommend sitting up at the bar and ordering to your heart's content, but be aware of the four dish minimum before you sit down.  The restaurant only seats 72 people, so sitting at the bar would be your best chance to lessen the long wait (20 minutes even on a Monday for lunch).. . I got the sushi combo, which was perfect for $15 bucks.  It was a sample of just about everything... five fish, egg, salmon roe, unagi, squid, sweet shrimp, and three each of cucumber and tuna.  Each piece of fish was extremely fresh and fatty.  It filled me up with really good sushi for around a dollar a piece, what a great deal.  Sashimi combo here goes for $30, so it's something to look forward to next time... maybe to split with a group of 4.. . Another thing I liked about this place was the chicken teriyaki my mom had.  She's not a big raw fish fan, so she stuck to a common dish I wouldn't have come to Sushi-Gen for, but it ended up being some of the best I've had.  The flavor of the teriyaki seems to be marinated into the chicken much longer instead of slathered on at the end, and the SKIN is kept on to provide some extra crispiness.  Delicious!. . Definitely will be coming back if I can find a good time with friends to avoid their talked about lines.
