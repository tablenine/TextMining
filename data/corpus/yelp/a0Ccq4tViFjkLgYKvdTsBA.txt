Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
This pizza restaurant has been around for more than 50 years and has the antique neon sign and celebrity photos to prove it.  It is located along the eastern portion of Colorado Blvd in Eagle Rock.. . This is a fairly traditional and old fashioned place with a conventional group of pizzas.  They cut their pizzas in an unusual way leaving some inner pieces with no crust to hold the pizza by.. . Their pizza was very good, was a thin, NY style and used top quality cheese and a tangy but thick tomato sauce.  I also want to point out how pleased I was that they spread out the sauce and cheese nearly all the way to the crust, assuring that almost all of the bites were as good as the first at the tip.
