Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I've been a huge fan of the Stinking Rose in San Francisco for a LONG time, so I was eager to check out the Los Angeles version to see how it compares.  Unfortunately there is something not quite right here. I'll start with the food.  I've sampled nearly all of the signature dishes in San Francisco and I have the distinct impression that they "sexed up" some of the recipes to cater to some distorted concept of what the LA dining crowd expects.  In particular the 40-Clove Chicken was smothered in some sort of cream-based sauce that pushed the whole thing over the top.  People who love garlic have a certain expectation of how the flavors combine (answer: with subtlety), and when someone who doesn't "get it" screws things up, it stands out like a sore thumb.  (To be fair, the Lamb Shank was still very good.) There is also the issue of the crowd.  Due to the prime location deep in the heart of West LA, this place draws a crowd that (forgive me if this come across as elitist) just gives a very scattered, off-kilter feel to the place if you attempt to dine there on a Friday or Saturday night.  Not much else to say, guess I need to head back to San Fransisco more often.
