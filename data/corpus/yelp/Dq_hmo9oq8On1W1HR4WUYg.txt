You have got to try the hainan chicken at this place.  Savoy serves more than just pizza &amp; pasta - it is located in Alhambra.  The place is always packed and every other dish you see people order is the hainan chicken.  The combination of juicy chicken, flavorful white rice, and touches of ginger, soy, and hot sauces makes this an amazing dish.
