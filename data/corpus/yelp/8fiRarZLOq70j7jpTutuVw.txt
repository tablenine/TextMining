Atmosphere is great. Lots of selections too and we got potato balls, chocolate croissants, Â fruit tarts, and of course, cheese rolls.. . Verdict: CHEESE ROLLS!. . I love Cheese Danishes from Costco. And these cheese rolls are just as great, although in a different way! They do not have that creamy center. Also these rolls has a slightly flaky, crunchy texture. . . I ate four of those with my coffee. It was soooo good....Hmmm...
