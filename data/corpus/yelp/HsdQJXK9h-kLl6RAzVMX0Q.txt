Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
First off, I have to say that I don't have any other Cuban food experience to compare Versailles against, but this is the best damn Cuban food I've ever had. ;). . Really though, the food is pretty good.  I consistently go back to get the ox tail stew.  Now I know what you're thinking...ox...tail...really now?!?!  Trust me, it's really good.  There's a lot of cartilage, but the meat is really tender and they stew is for a really really long time to make it really good.  The stew, like many other dishes, is served with white rice, black beans, and plantains.  I'm not the hugest fan of plantains in general, but they're good.  And the rice and beans mixed together works really well too.. . One recommendation...stay away from the breaded and fried pork dishes.  I've tried several of them and they've all come out dry and disappointing.. . I live right down the street and normally get takeout.  If you go during busy times, there's normally a line out the door.  In the times I've eaten there, service has been spotty and we generally had to flag somebody down to order or refill water.
