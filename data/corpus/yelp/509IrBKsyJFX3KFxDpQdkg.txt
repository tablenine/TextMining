I had been once before, so when my friends mentioned that they were having dinner here, I totally invited myself to join.  You have to give them credit for being so bold as to put a sign on their window that says "Meridith Ford" (AJC food critic) with a slash through it like she is not allowed into the building.  Amazing that they have been named the best Mexican Restaurant the past few years in spite of whatever animosity they have towards Meridith Ford.  This is definitely not your typical Mexican food, bland, same-ol-same-ol.  I might have ordered same-ol-same-ol (fajitas) but they were certainly the best I had ever had.  Gaucamole dip was amzaing as well.  Minus one star - service was borderline rude.
