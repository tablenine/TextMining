Yum, yum, yummy mexican food.  Kid friendly before 8:30pm, not so much after 8:30.  Excellent chiles rellenos, fajitas, and enchiladas, but important to note that one order of most anything is enough to feed two, especially after cheese dip / chips and a couple margaritas.  Go when you're hungry, or really in need of an awesome drink (I recommend a swirl or three).
