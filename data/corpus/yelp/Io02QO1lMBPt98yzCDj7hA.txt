Okay, update.  I've decided the pupusas are good and this place is still high on my list for a decent beer with free salsa and fresh chips along with your pupusa.. . However, the main attraction is NOT the cocktel de camarones or campechana.  You can get much better campechana at La Playita on Lincoln/Rose near the Whole Foods.  . . But the Sopa de 7 Mares is BOMB here! That's the main reason for me going there.  Plus the meat dishes are good, with nice beans included.
