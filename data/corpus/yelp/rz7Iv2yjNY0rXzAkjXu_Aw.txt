It's pretty good.  Ran me about $9 for just the #1 (med. noodles, yes onions/ginger, strong oil, strong broth).  It's not the best deal in the world but overall its very good.  The soup is pretty delicious and the staff is really friendly and it's a good environment.  The extra noodles are only $1 and normally people only get it once.. . It's definitely a must try but not somewhere I'd go over and over again.
