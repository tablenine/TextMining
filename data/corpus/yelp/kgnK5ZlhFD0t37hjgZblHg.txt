After that Pho 32 &amp; Shabu debacle, I searched and found another Pho restaurant. I was excited to see that this could be my Pho place in Manhattan. At 14th street, it's walkable to me. The restaurant is attractive and classy for a Pho place. It cheered me up but when I looked at my Pho, I was bit disappointed. For $8 (consider to be a large bowl), this did not meet the expectation. The meat in my estimation is numerable. I would have truly enjoyed it because the interior is nice and the service was fast, but that kind of pho, it does not measure up to the pho I usually get in Queens. Got to go back to Queens again for real.
