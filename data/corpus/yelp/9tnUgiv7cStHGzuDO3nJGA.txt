I almost feel like there is no reason for me to review Wurstkuche (man, I wish I was on a Mac to make that umlaut!), being that there are already 918 reviews. But... why the hell not?! I like boasting about the amount of sausage I can fit into my mouth just as much as the next gal! . . Wurstkuche is LA at its best... it is a concept restaurant/bar that takes a trend and makes it modern. In this case, beer and brats. The staple at a festival or street fair on the East Coast has now gone classy at Wurstkuche. . . Wurstkuche looks like an art gallery, recording studio, and the loft apartment you've always dreamed of; rolled into one with an added bar and sausage grill. The beer selection is extensive, especially the Belgian beer which makes me happy. I ordered the Rabbit Sausage which I found to be very light, with a hint of sweetness, but also needed more flavor. This could have helped with the spicy peppers and caramelized onions I ordered, but they were cold. My boyfriend had the Duck and Bacon Sausage which had strong flavor with a mix of the duck and gooey bacon flavor. I should have ordered that... However, he ordered spicy peppers and sweet onions and yet, they messed up his order and gave him my toppings, as well. The fries were filling; but there were too many overly crispy/burnt pieces. But they were delicious with the curry ketchup we chose and the table-side spicy mustard and deli mustard. . . Overall, Wurstkuche is a great concept in an artsy environment. But being such a hot spot, I expected more than cold peppers, burnt fries, and a flubbed order.
