Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
It's late night, and I'm drunk again.  Went to the Dodgers game, and had a couple of dogs (and I'm pretty sure that's what they actually are), but I'm hungry.  Again.  I need a fix.  Something to soak up the beers.. . Canter's is one of the true LA landmarks when it comes to delicatessens.  I eat there, just like my mom did when she was my age.  They have a menu that encompasses just about everything you could want, from patty melts to breakfast to matzo ball soup, and the list goes on and on and on and on.  Is it the world's best food?  No.  Does it fill the void?  Yep.. . My favorite part?  The entrance.  And I'll tell you why.  When you walk in the front door, there are stands to your right and left.  On the right?  A huge glass display case entertaining any smoked fish fantasy in which you've ever engaged.  And on the left?  Oh my god, heaven.  That's what's on your left.  Every kind of cookie, pastry, bread or bagel of which you've ever dreamed.  I can never walk out of here without a huge box of cookies.  And yes, I wake up feeling sick in the morning, but it's totally my own fault... I have no one else to blame.  Except Canter's.  Perhaps they put something in the air.  They make you hungry.  And if you're like me, meaning that your eyes are bigger than your stomach, you aren't getting out without more cookies than one man (or woman) should possibly purchase.  But it's cool.  Because they're delicious.. . Prices are reasonable, they're open late, and they have a diverse menu.  Oh, and they have cookies.  Lots and lots of cookies.  So I'm really giving 3 stars for the food, and 4 stars for the cookies.  But the cookies make it a worthwhile stop even if you aren't eating a full meal, so they get the heavier weighting in this review.  4 stars.
