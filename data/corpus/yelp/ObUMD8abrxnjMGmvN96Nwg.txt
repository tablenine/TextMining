I've eaten at Flo twice- once for a week night dinner and once for a week day lunch.  Both experiences were very similar so I feel ok roping them both into one review.  The place was hoppin' in both instances but we were seated right away (at the same group table both times).  Service was attentive but not excessive (I have a thing about people interrupting me or watching me eating my food. Go away.).   I would describe this place as mexican/comfort/healthy-veggie friendly.  A great mix.  They use lots of fresh ingredients and load up their sides with lots of veggies, something that makes my  body happy after I've ingested yummy food to my heart's content.  Really liked their side salads, veggie tacos, and guacamole.  They aren't afraid to bring the heat so spice averse diners beware.  Cocktails were interesting (different in a good way) and refreshing.  I'll be back.
