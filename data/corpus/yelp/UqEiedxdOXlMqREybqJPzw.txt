The only knock against this place is that they try to cram as many people in as possible and the result is a crowded and often loud dining room. Of course, the alternative would be even longer lines, so I guess crowding is just the price you pay for having great food.. . Try the Chile Relleno Vegetariano withMonterrey Jack cheese, spinach Â and mushrooms or the Mole Vegetable Enchiladas with mashed potatoes, carrots and onion.
