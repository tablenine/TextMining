I was leaving work today, and someone mentioned that the Kogi taco truck was near.  I had always wanted to try it so I paid a visit.  Even though the truck had not open for business yet, there was a long line.  Luckily, I knew someone in line, which helped.. . I went with a variety of tacos (beef short rib, pork, and chicken) at $2 each.  In terms of the meat, the beef short rib was the best.  But the pork was also good.  I would pass on the chicken (which was bland).  I did not care for the corn tortillas (but that being said, I'm not really a big fan of corn tortillas anyway).  Overall, they were pretty decent and tasty.  Were they great?  Would I rush back to try again?  Probably not.. . They also served sliders, and they looked pretty good.
