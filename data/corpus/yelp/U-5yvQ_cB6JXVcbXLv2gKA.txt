If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Eats is a very simple, no frills, sit-down fast food joint. There are two lines here, one for pasta, and one for meat/sides. If you go to the pasta side, it's all good but I recommend the Lasagna. ON the meat side, it's all pretty good.. . The food won't blow you away, but if you do a cost/quality analysis, you'll leave with a smirk. It's a great deal for good food. Again, no frills. Expect a dude in really tight jeans, long hair, and stubble to take your order and not be friendly about it.. . The only thing I dislike about Eats is the parking lot, where my car bottoms out every time I have to speed across 3 lanes of Ponce.
