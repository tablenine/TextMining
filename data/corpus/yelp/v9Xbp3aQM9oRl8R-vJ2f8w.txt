Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Love Jerry's! The food, waitstaff, and patio were great. The service is fast, in my experience the longest wait time is how long it takes me to decide what I want to eat and drink-by far!. . I had the Spencer T. (hickory bacon, granny smith apple, peanut butter, basil, &amp; cranberry sauce) on a pretzel roll. They were generous with the ingredients, everything seemed fresh and it was delicious. My dining companion had a Milton F. (Make your own)-a pretzel roll, turkey, hickory bacon, brie, granny smith apple, &amp; peanut butter. We both had the fries which were adequate, he had the mac &amp; cheese which was creamy and delicious and I had the szechwan pasta salad w/ peanut dressing, which was good (&amp; spicy) but a bit dry.. . And then....the beer. I've been wanting to try a sour ale, so he sprung for the New Belgium Lips of Faith: La Folie. It was lip-puckering &amp; delicious (and I haven't seen it offered anywhere else). We also ordered 3 other beers off their EXTENSIVE list. One selection wasn't available, but the bartender made a replacement suggestion, and the waitress was knowledgeable, helpful (&amp; cute!). . I could go back 50 times and never have the same beer or sandwich....Maybe I'll just try that!
