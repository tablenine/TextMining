i had a great dinner at resto while in NY recently.  because the weather was nice, we were able to sit outside and had that outside area to ourselves.  our waiter was good - very on top of our needs, and offered thorough explanations of the menu and specials.  we shared a few appetizers - the bitter ballen (basically meat and cheese in a ball, delicious), and 2 of the specials - the pulled pork sandwich and the gratin.  both were great!  i had the cod for my entree - very light and well prepared.  the vegetables were very fresh.  . my only disappointment was that i ordered the brussels sprouts dish which were basically mashed potatoes mixed with brussels sprouts - good in theory but too much potatoes in the mix for me.  more sprouts!!  i also tried a friend's short ribs and oh my god, they were amazing!  that is definitely what i would get next time.  . our wine was great too.  we didnt try dessert because we were too full!
