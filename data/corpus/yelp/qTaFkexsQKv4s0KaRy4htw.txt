who knew that eating vegan could be soooooooo orgasmically delicious? okay....so...let me break this down.. . PR0S: the food is amazing. i had the santa fe crispy chicken and it was faaaar from a disappointment. the sweet potatoe fries are to die for. mmmm and the chipotle sauce...YUMMO! they dont serve soda. just teas. its healthy (depending on what you get of course). and there's a cute sexy black guy that takes your order at the front...MMMMMMmmmm. haha!. . C0NS: it came out to be about $16 for my meal! wow! there goes my gas money! during rush, good luck trying to find a seat dont get me wrong though....its POSSIBLE....you might have to body slam a few people, but hey....its possible! parking is a little horrendous too.....as soon as the entire outdoor mall opens, its CHAOS. . . but dont get me wrong, once you get your food, you completely forget about how much you spent on faux meat and your thankful for the seat that you managed to find, and you forget about the bitch who stole your parking spot just a few minutes prior. the food is amazing. and i cant wait to be done with this detox to go back as a proud vegan! woot woot!
