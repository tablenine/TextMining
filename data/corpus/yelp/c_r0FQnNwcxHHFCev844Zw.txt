Its almost 24 hours since I ate here and I still have a garlic after taste in my mouth.  Ladies and gentlemen... this is NOT a good thing.. . Its a little gross.. . I like garlic.. but apparently I don't like garlic enough because after 5 bites of my garlic pesto mashed potatoes, I stated "Yep.  I'm done with the garlic."  This of course was after several pieces of their garlic bread with the bagna calda (which was pretty excellent I have to admit)  salad (Of course... garlic), and braised short rib (yep.  you guessed it.  Garlic!)  and well... I was pretty garlic'ed out.  . . What was pretty interesting was that my sister and mom in the end could not taste the garlic in the garlic ice cream that they had ordered.  They didn't taste it when they tried to compare it to my vanilla one.  Nor did they taste it after they cleansed their palets with coffee.  Did the garlic completely overpower their mouths that nothing could affect them?  It probably did.. . I've written garlic out way too much and now I'm not quite too sure if I'm spelling it right.  You know how that happens right?  No?  Nevermind.. . Ambiance wise, its pretty nice.  Its not as garish as Bucca Di Beppo but you'll find a few quirky pieces here and there.  We were lucky enough to be seated in a private room and well they get extra points just for that.  When I walked around the restaurant later, I noticed they had little romantic tents that made me go "awww.. that would be sweet to have a dinner date here..." but then when you think about it... no date would get lucky after a meal here.  Well maybe.  It all depends on how much you LOVE garlic.
