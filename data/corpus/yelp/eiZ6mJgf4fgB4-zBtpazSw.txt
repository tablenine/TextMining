i stopped by purely out of curiosity lol i didn't know what to expect from the store- I mean MILK? like dairy stuff? I don't know how to describe the store but I just know that this store isn't good for my health- My sweet tooth wanted to try everything in the store- small candies, cookies, buns, etc- I don't know how to describe my experience but after agonizing over what to get, I bought two of their mini sweets and awesome cookie(?) whitecookie that melted instantly mmmm - i am sure just one of any would've been sufficient but i am the sugar monster ; ; Â I so regretted having all three after though; they were all good but that was too much ; (felt like a fatcow to be exact) . . it's hard to describe or categorize for me- seems like a good place to stop by before I go shopping or something- Like a casual place to pick up food or sweets with a friend- But I will try not to go too often- I will get too fat - fun selection of sweets !!
