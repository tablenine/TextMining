Need to jump on that review train.  . . Yes the pizza is best in town, but you should consider your circumstances when coming here.  No place to sit, pricing seems to inflate beyond the menu, and some things will likely be changing soon due to health regulations.  Not saying you are risking anything, just think of it like eating in a friends kitchen.. . Still, I will easily go there again.. . Welcome to the scene Antico.  I can't wait for you to stabilize.
