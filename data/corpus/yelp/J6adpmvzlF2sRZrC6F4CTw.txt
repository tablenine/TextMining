Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
A strange location for a burger/bar but none-the-less a fantastic burger!. . And I give Father's Office 5 stars for a reason, but I still have to break it down to pluses and minus':. . Pluses +:. Burgers (the soul reason to go). Atmosphere - its a warm feel with lots of dark wood and good music. Staff - Friendly and helpful, very diligent (though there was one lady who was nice, but with a sprikle of sass) . Drink Selection - I say selection cause I didn't drink (DD) but from what i saw it was a great selection of wines and beers. . Patrons - Super nice, there was a lack of seating but just popped down with another group that had room for 2 and made it work.. . Minus' -:. Atmosphere - Really crowded (went on a Friday around 7:30P). Seating - None (So many people!) Walked around for 10 mins looking for a place to sit. Kinda reminded me of the Apple Pan where you stand and wait for a seat then leap at it before someone else does.. Location - Why is it here? This would be so much better on Melrose, Sunset, La Brea, Hollywood, or even in Westwood. . . So there's the skinny. . . Also they had a special white tuna sashimi appetizer, it was fabu. And their sweet potato fries.... just FYI our check came out to be $43 for the 2 burgers, fries and sashimi ap and no drinks. So if you're adventurous be sure to bring a benji when you go cause it could get pricey. . . Also for those who may be underaged, or look underaged, have your ID's ready cause they card at the door. . . Enjoy!
