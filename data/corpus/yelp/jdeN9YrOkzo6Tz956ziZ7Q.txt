Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
What sets Mermaid Inn's lobster roll apart from all others is the bun, of course.  The soft, buttery brioche bun adds a layer of richness to the already creamy indulgence of the lobster meat.  I could eat the fries by the fistful as well.  The shrimp sandwich has a surprising and delicious kick to it thanks to the sauce.  There could have been a few more shrimp on the roll, though.  Try the Elixir drink, a stunning combo of honey and bourbon that tastes strange at first, but then you want to gulp it down (hey, do what you gotta do).  I would have liked to have tried other drink concoctions as well, next time.  The appetizers were ok - mussels no the most flavorful ever, but the fried oysters were plump and crispy with tasty slaw in the middle.  Will definitely return here next time I am in the city.
