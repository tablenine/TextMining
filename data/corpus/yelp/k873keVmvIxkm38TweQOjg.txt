Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Consider me a convert.  I was a bit skeptical going in - but with so many people singing Roscoe's praises I had to check it out.  . . It was delicious.  The combination of the savory fried chicken and the sweet syrup is so delicious.  This is 100% pure comfort food.  The skin on the fried chicken was super crispy and fatty and the meat is moist.  The waffles are just average and could never stand on their own merit. - but that's ok.  Because in this case, the sum of the parts far outweighs its components.  The crispy skin, savory meat, eaten with a bite of waffle and sweet syrup - mmm, it is so good.  . . The service was incredibly fast - we waited less than 10 minutes for our food - and they were quick with re-fills.  The ladies bathroom was a bit dingy - but that's ok because you're not coming to Roscoe's for their restroom.
