I do enjoy Mastro's. The oyster rockefeller was great. Other side dishes (mushroom, mashed potates) were all good also. My bone in filet was good but my boyfriend complained about his filet being too salty. Overall service was good but I think their tables are way too close to each other and a little too wide. I would definitely come back again, but for the price I would probably prefer Ruth's Chris which I think is just as good.
