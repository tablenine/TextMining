Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
If the Asian in me is true, then this should be my 200th review. I was leaving Lawry's for this special mark.. . Lawry's has treated me well for over two decades now. Never has it ever disappointed me. From the meatballs in the waiting area all the way until the dessert. This place is a definite score. If you're a regular or going to be, I would suggest you sign up for the Lawry's card. There's an initial fee but it's worth it. They send you coupons and also if you show up around your birthday, they will mail you a specialized engraved seasoned salt or pepper to your home. . . Lawry's, don't mind that I dine at other prime rib or steak houses. I'm still very loyal to you and will forever be. The whole prime rib carts and getting it carved right in front of you is your historic tradition (as well as the spinning bowl salad!). Nothing comes close to your cream corn. I can probably go on and on with all the food you serve here but then I would possibly bore readers.. . One of your best investment was buying the C.C. brown hot fudge rights from that family to offer it at your restaurant. This by far was one of your greatest acquirements. I really advise anyone who eats at your place to order the CC brown hot fudge sunday for dessert. It just makes you speechless and brings a huge smile to your face.. . I left out a lot of details because I don't want to write a novel and I want people to experience Lawry's on their own. All I can say is that Lawry serves up a mean prime rib dinner. Look for the monthly specials which are always well worth giving it a shot. You can also purchase their salad dressing, just ask your waitress.. . Forever a loyal customer.
