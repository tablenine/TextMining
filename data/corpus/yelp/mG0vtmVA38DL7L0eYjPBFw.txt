After hearing all the hype about the Kogi truck, I finally made my way to one and tried their tacos and burritos.  All I can say is it's just alright...  I was expecting much better but I guess people like to make things better than they really are.... . I mean, apparently, eating tacos from a truck makes people think food tastes better than it really does...  go figure.  . . It's good... but not THAT good
