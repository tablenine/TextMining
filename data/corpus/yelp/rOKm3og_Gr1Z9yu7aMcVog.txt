Their tofu banh mi is so freaking good.  Since protein's better for my metabolism than carbohydrates, I ask them to make it a Double-Stuf, which costs twice as much minus a buck.. . More often, though, I'll buy 5 and get 1 free (the "baker's dozen" of banh mi), intending to make them last all week, and end up consuming them over the course of two days, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Or maybe lunch, second lunch, dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, and second breakfast.  What can I say? They're wonderful.
