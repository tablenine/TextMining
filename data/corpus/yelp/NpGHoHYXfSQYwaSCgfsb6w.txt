I LOVEEEE THIS PLACE!!!!. . My boyfriend and I went to LA for a little trip. And as we were driving around we saw Bosa NOva and decided to try it. WHy not. plus it was 2am in the morning and was one of the ONLY restaurants open that looked non-shady. hahaha. . AND. . OH MY GOSH I AM SOOOOO GLADD I TRIED IT. IT IS SOOOO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!. . We ordered an appetizer. i forgot what it's called but i know it has an 'x' in there some where. we got 2 because it only came in 1 for an order. it came out and looked like a pear. but when we started to break it up we found out that the outside was deep fried or baked i am not sure and the inside was liek chicken salad or something,. BUT DAMN WAS IT GOOD! SOOOOOOO GOOD! the table next to us was like "what are you guys eating? THat looks sooo good!" and i'm like "OHHH YEs. IT IS GOOD!". . i ordered a veggie pasta and my bf ad pizza. DAMN WAS MY PASTA SOOOO GOOD!!! there was soo much pasta i couldn't finish! i thought i ate soo much but it looked like i never ate it at ALL! damn was it good. we ended it with that. i wish i got dessert tho. damn.. . i can't believe it's open till 4 am and opens at 11am! wth! we need places like that in the BAY AREA.. . damn brazillian cuisine! soo freaking good!. . also my bf saw a guy that was on Nick Cannons Wildn' out. COOL! hahahaha
