Restaurant: Chops
Category: Seafood
I have been to Chops twice and was not very impressed with the steaks both times.  The first time I had a classic 8oz fillet that was not worth the money.  The second time I had a 12oz ribeye, which I thought would be tastier than the fillet, however, it was very salty.  I normally love salty so if I say it was salty then it probably was a little salty.  Also, the sides were unoriginal and tasted like they were once frozen.  The desserts were not very good either.  Their only saving grace both times was the service.    . . Chops is only worth going if you're eating for free otherwise I would choose a different buckhead life restaurant such as Bluepointe or Buckhead Diner.
