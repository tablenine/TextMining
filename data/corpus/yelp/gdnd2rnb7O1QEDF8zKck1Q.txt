"...FRESH (fresh)...exciting...so inviting to me." Name that tune.. . I friend of ours recently moved to the Century City area and invited us to Fraiche last night. Parking was a bit crazy but once we were settled in, the place did not disappoint.. . We started with two appetizers to share (I have a bad memory when it comes to names of dishes, so I'll give you a general description of what we had.):. . 1. To start: duck pate and ceviche-like special. The latter was my favorite. The citrus marinade was delicious.. 2. 2nd: pea soup. Very nice. . 3. Monkfish over pureed potatoes and spinach. Tasty.. 4. Dessert to share: torta della nona (I found myself repeating it over and over again in a very Italian way, hand gestures and all). Now I'm not a huge dessert fan but this was spectacular. Very unassuming, not too sweet, comforting. . . I'm sure I'll be back here in the next few months. All things considered, the prices were reasonable for LA standards. The vibe at Fraiche is also pretty cool (no pun intended). Very NYCish.
