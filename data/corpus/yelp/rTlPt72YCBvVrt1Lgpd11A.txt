I don't think that Yelp needs my review with the 170+ reviews this place has had in 4 months.  Still, I'll add...  Delicious! I'm a fan and would recommend this place.  The ingredients are fresh and it is a really different concept for Atlanta.  . . It really wasn't what I was expecting, which made the experience quite fun.  It is BYOB so come prepared if you want some wine or beer to accompany your pizza. There didn't seem to be much seating when we walked in...and there isn't.  We somehow found ourselves eating in the kitchen area, surrounded by lively Italian music and a large group of men making pizza after pizza.  They were preparing for some large event.  . . We were pretty lucky because we came at a time where there weren't large crowds, so the environment was lively yet relaxing enough.  . Our steaming pizza came out very quickly, served by the owner (I believe?), and was cut in front of us.  I really recommend eating it right there and then.  It was crispy where it needed to be and the crust was quite good.  The ingredients and sauce were on fresh and on point.  We ate most of it there and took the rest back.  The pizza doesn't hold up once you bring it back so come hungry.. . My favorite of the pizzas is the one with the prosciutto and artichokes.
