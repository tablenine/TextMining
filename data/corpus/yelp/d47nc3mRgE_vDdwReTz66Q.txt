I will be back again. I went on a Saturday evening with my friend Kyle and we enjoyed our desert options. . I had the blue velvet (didn't know of such a thing) cake. Blue velvet is a caramel flavored cake with a layer of cream and blue berries in the middle. Â I'm not going to lie at first it thought it was going to be a total waste of $ but I still had to try. . . Yummy, yummy, yummy I had cake in my tummy!!!!. . Kyle had the red velvet popper and the chocolate chip walnut cookie which was only missing one thing a big scoop of vanilla ice cream that I knew I should have ordered. . . They have indoor and outdoor seating equipped with heat lamps. . . I like Milk but parking is not the best. If you come during the evening you can risk parking in the mini plaza across the street beware of tow trucks
