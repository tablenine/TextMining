Mmmmmm!!! Oinkster! The pulled pork is AMAZING! Their barbecue sauce is really delicious too. At first it looks unappetizingly watery, but after you taste it you won't care! It's not the sweet, thick type that covers up the flavor of whatever it's on. It's vinegary and really enhances the flavor of the pork. The garlic aioli (comes with the fries for dipping) is so yummy! I don't usually like anything mayonnaise-y, but this stuff is a definite exception. It will give you serious garlic breath - the kind that stays with you - so be warned... but it's totally worth it in my opinion. The fries are double-fried and super crispy, not greasy. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I tried the rotisserie chicken and it was very bland, not crispy, and seemed undercooked. I'll stick with my pulled pork and sweet plantains! (*Get there early on weekend nights to avoid the long lines.)
