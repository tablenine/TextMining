The first time I walked into UG I noticed its fancy and upscale decor. Something that scares me when a restaurant/business is located near a mostly college area and an up and coming neighborhood. So right off the bat, I was skeptical. Plus, I had visited the Clark St UG and was overly unimpressed (can I say that?).. Well, I'm glad I stayed and enjoyed a few drinks and their plate of mussels. The muscles were so succulent that I had to ask for an extra loaf of their bread so that I could finish off the juice that the once there mussels soaked in. . I ordered a few drinks and the bartender was very accommodating. He was attentive to my needs and even asked if I wanted H2O. This is what really got me hooked on UG on Devon. The attentive service while the restaurant was NOT busy. I'm so used to going to places when it's down time that most of the staff doesn't even pay attention to you, except for the bartender who's on the phone or busy running around setting up bar for the rush making sure they get their appropriate tip. This guy was genuinely friendly, even though his attire and tattoos would make some people think otherwise.. Oh yeah, and I heard these guys grow their daily bread (in this case, vegetables) upstairs on the roof where they have a year round garden. Kudos to you UG.. One last thing, I love the food, service, and selection of alcohol, but why are we still paying downtown prices? You guys are in Rogers Park for crying out loud. Don't get me wrong, I live in RP, but the people there are expecting great food at much lower prices. Â Or at least I am.
