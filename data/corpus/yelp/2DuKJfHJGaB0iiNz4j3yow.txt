This place is great!  It is a must have everytime I am in the Sol Cal area and for some reason I always end up with the same waiter everytime I am there and he actually remember my friends and I since we are from the Bay Area.  The lechon asada is fantastic and so is the roast chicken. YUMMY!! Pretty much anything else there is great and you can't go wrong.  Get there before 6pm or else be ready to wait in the loooong loong line.
