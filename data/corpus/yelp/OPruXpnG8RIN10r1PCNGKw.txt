I got a butterscotch drumstick... that they made... from scratch.  Delicious! My friend got the counter boy to make up some coffee, icecream drink... he seemed very excited to make something new.  My boyfriend got some cookie dough that i later made into cookies. Also really really good.  Not as many flavors of icecream as i thought they would have, but more milkshakes and other goodies.
