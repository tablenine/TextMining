I really enjoy Pozole... its also slightly dangerous that this is almost across the street from my apartment.  I have found myself on more than one occasion randomly wandering in there on my way home from a night out.  You can get some good late night munchies here!  I have never been here for dinner, but I think the food would be alright.  I have to admit I don't come for the food though, but for the tequila! . . What is even better than the late night food is their long selection of margaritas you have to chose from.  I love that this place is a tequila bar and has all sorts of fun flavors to chose from.  Most people I have gone with LOVE the jalapeno margarita.  I personally still enjoy a classic margarita, but if your in the mood for a little spice, the jalapeno is a snazzy option.  The atmosphere presents a nice change to the ever popular dark horse tavern (why is this place always so full!?), and I enjoy the music they always have blaring at Pozole.  . . This place is kind of hidden behind all the typical Va-Hi places to go and that makes this even better.  Random, they also have a great shirt you can get at the bar... check it out next time you are there.
