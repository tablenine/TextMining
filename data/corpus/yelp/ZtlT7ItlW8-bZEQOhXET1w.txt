I have lived one block from Sura for 5 months now, and just went there last night. I was always hesitant because of the decor, as viewed from the outside..... . BOY was that a crapshoot idea. . . Our group went on Memorial Day weekend, and it was pretty clear they were not expecting a crowd. Because of that, the service did start off slow but was always friendly and polite. Once we ordered and got our drinks, all we could do was rave about how good the food and drinks were!!. . The four of us opted to get a whole bunch of small plates, and a couple salads, opposed to entrees. . Highly recommend-. -Crab salad, w/mango, celery, corn and a chili-lime dressing SO GOOD that I am actually craving it right now. It was SO incredibly fresh and delish!! . -Grilled teryaki scallops, came with sauce and some sort of apple/fruit salad chutney. ALSO craving that. -Duck Crepes, also delish. . So-so. -Thai style meatballs, the "meat" was a weird texture, but the flavor was just OK. . We got about 4 other things that were outstanding, but those were my faves/not so faves. The drink I had (coconut mojito) was also the most expensive thing we ordered, at $9! . . For 4 people, our total bill (with a couple round of drinks) was less than $100. I think that is a great value for quality food. . . I cannot wait to go back to Sura. Do not let the white/trendy/spacey decor scare you like it did me! The food is amazing, and while the service was short the night we were there, they were so friendly and accommodating.
