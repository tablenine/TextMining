This place is amazing!  After drinking our share at Cabo Cantina up a few blocks, my friends and I ventured down to El Carmen for one of my friends' birthday dinners.  Our waitress was super sweet and accommodating, quickly asking us if we wanted chips, salsa and guacamole and then bringing them. The guac was some of the best I've ever had (minus the stuff I make =D).  All the food we had was amazing and being a bit tipsy I scarfed down my two tacos with a side of beans and rice in no time!  Then since it was my friend's bday we had brought a cake and she brought it out with candles and served us up all free tequila shots!
