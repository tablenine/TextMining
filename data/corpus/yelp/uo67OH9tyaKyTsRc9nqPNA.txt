I used to work here and it SUCKED because most of the time I wish I was sitting like everyone else enjoying their juicy pork dumplings.. . Don't blame the wait on the workers. We're fast and you know it. . . Their dumpling skin is one of a kind. They actually measure out a certain amount of flour, water,... etc to make that thin-but-able dumpling skin. I'm not being biased but their skin is truly one of a kind... plus all the gelatin in the dumplings make it soooo juicy.
