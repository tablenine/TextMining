Let it be known that the chef and workers at Shopsin's do not bull$#it around. . . Do not be fooled by the fact that the place lies quietly in the corner of an indoor farmer's market. While quaint it may seem, quaint it is not. First, there is always a line. Always. It is highly recommended that your party is no more than 2. If you have more than that good luck with getting a table in a decent time. The will come get you when the table is ready. And they do not take kindly to people who ask for a menu while they wait in line. And that is why I love this place....It is the "soup nazi" of brunch spots and their food certainly lives up to the hype. They do not mess around with trying to be overtly nice or welcoming. They serve incredible tasting food and that's it. My girlfriend had a Moe II, while I got the famous Blisters on my Sisters, and lets not forget an order of banana ebelskivers to share. . . The freshness of the food is without question because it lives in a farmer's market, where they get their ingredients. Bacon is thick and delicious. The ebelskivers hot, sweet and spongy. I cannot say more about the place. The Blisters on my Sisters was savory chaos. Bar none the best brunch I've had in my life.
