Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Orochon Ramen has a real simple formula:. . 1. Chose your broth(miso, shoyu, or shio). 2. Choose how hot you want it on a scale of 1-7(1 being the hottest) OR their Special #1 or Special #2(2 being the hottest, I don't understand the numbering on that!). 3. Choose your toppings(egg, bamboo, butter???). . They also serve up a variety of side dishes from fried rice to teensy spicy scallops. . . The bowls are freaking huge! If you even attempt the spicy challenge you must be able to pack some carbs under your belt cause even if you can handle the heat, you may not be able to handle the quantity. That being said, the broths aren't too hot. They only use chili oil and jalapenos to season it. . . I was able to try a number of broths from the Special Spicy #2 to the Un-Special #2. The miso broth isn't my thing, but it really takes the spice out of the broth. So if you want more heat, order the shoyu or shio instead. That said, the broths are really standard. The noodles are fairly limp and average. The ramen normally comes with a few small pieces of pork(not chashu pork), green onions, and tons of chopped garlic sunken to the bottom of the bowl. Everything else is extra. In a city where finding tastier ramen with quality ingredients is easy, Orochon is missing the boat.. . All qualms about the value for ingredients aside, the heat customization is a great option to have but it does nothing to add to the boring state of the soup. . . However, afterwards we saw Vince Vaughn going to eat at Kappo Ishito next door, so you might just get your celeb watch on in Little Toyko.
