Please note: this rating is about 90% based on smell alone.. . My friend and I had already eaten lunch, but we stopped here for some tea, and.. wow. This place smells delicious. The tea was good, but nothing compared to the aromatic experience. My friend and I sat outside, but before we left we had to duck back in for one last sniff of freshly baked bread. I will definitely be back for proper food. (And furthermore, there seems to be some promotion involving waffles and ice cream on Sunday afternoons. But I'll re-review once I've actually eaten some of their food.). . You know, in retrospect, I should have bought some bread to huff on the way home.
