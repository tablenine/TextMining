This is the best Sushi in all of LA.  I've tried some really amazing stuff at this place... really amazing.. stuff that I have no idea what it was called, I just ate it.  It's a great place to take someone that knows their sushi.  I just know I like sushi, but have no idea how to order it, I'm not gonna lie.  I can't say that I'm a sushi-snob as Stephy S., so I can't say I've had better than this.  For my taste, this place is top of the list for Sushi.   . . Only downside, I've always had to wait to get a seat, and sometimes longer than I really wanted too...
