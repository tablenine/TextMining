Restaurant: Elliott Street Deli &amp; Pub
Category: Delis
This little neighborhood pub is undoubtedly my favorite.  It's a 4 minute walk out the front door of my building.  . . There is no attitude, great food, great service and they know you.  I was there twice this week.  Thursday for dinner and a couple beers and Friday night for their monthly Iron Pour art events.  The iron pour drew in about 150 people (not all inside, its a tiny place).  The iron pour happens in the parking lot next to the building.  . . They've done a great job mixing activities with food, beer and drinks.  Everyone is welcome and they do a great job fostering relationships with those in and outside of Castelberry Hill.
