Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Visited: 2-3 times. Lunch &amp; Dinner. . With this place having well over 1000 reviews...I don't think there's anything that anyone has not covered yet so this will be kept short. . . Juicy pork dumplings are highly recommended.  Regular shrimp and pork dumplings are good, but could be better with the skin being less chewy.  The shanghai rice cakes are good, but portions could be better.  The Shu Mai is good and is made differently than most other places.  . . Overall it is a good place to go and have a meal. . Upsides: Service on the weekday is great (weekends horrible btw), service is somewhat fast being it a Chinese restaurant. . Downsides: Price is about 2/3 more than other dumpling houses that are very comparable to this. Could easily spend $25 a person on a meal here whereas you could spend half of that somewhere else that's just as good.  . Would only go here in special scenarios, but if I just want to grab a quick bite on a normal day, then I'd go somewhere else.
