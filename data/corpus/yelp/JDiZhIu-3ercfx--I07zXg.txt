The pulled pork is average (Daddy D'z is so much more flavorful &amp; tender), the brisket dry and the bbq sauce unremarkable, but I love the fact they have fried pickles so I keep going back.  The tomminator appetizer is great for a hangover: tater tots smothered with brunswick stew and cheese.  Lordy.  The half portion is more that plenty.  The place is clean and spacious with a friendly wait-staff.  A good place to eat, but definitely not my favorite bbq.
