Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
Here are the criteria I'm going to judge this place on: How was the food?, How was the atmosphere? and do I think Oscar Wilde would hang out at Wilde Bar and Restaurant.. . First, the food- it's pretty good.  It isn't going to change your life, but as gussied up pseudo-gastro-pub food goes it certainly doesn't disappoint.  The reuben is particularly delicious.  I give the food a four.. . The atmosphere- the first time I came to Wilde it was a Saturday night.  The music was loud, obnoxious dance music, most of the lights were turned low, and it was crowded as hell.  On my second visit, it was a quiet weeknight, and I sat outside.  It was nice.  So, I would give the ambiance a 2.5.. . Finally- would Oscar Wilde like Wilde Bar and Restaurant?  Good food, lavish decor, and a menu filled with stupid puns?  Yes, I think he would.
