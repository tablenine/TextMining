went here for a nice evening out with my boyfriend while visiting atlanta for the weekend.  its tucked away on a quiet little side street in midtown in an old bungalow house.  it's very charming and romantic - great date spot.  i enjoyed their tortelli de mele - an apple and sausage ravioli.. with a brown butter sauce.  my boyfriend had a wild mushroom ravioli that was also delicious. the staff was attentive and friendly (though the night we went was rather slow due to the holiday weekend so that may account for why they were so attentive!).  i'll definitely go back to this place next time i'm craving italian while visiting atlanta!  very affordable, too!
