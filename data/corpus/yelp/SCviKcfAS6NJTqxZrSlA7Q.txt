Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I've been disinclined to write a review about Din Tai Fung because I really don't have a whole lot to add to the five-hundred-some-odd narratives here aside from my stamp of approval, which we all know is of dubious value.. . Nevertheless, their specialty, xiao long bao (lit."little juicy buns"), aren't the reason I recommend the restaurant. Don't get me wrong--the dumplings, with their generous "soupy" filling--were quite good. But I prefer a more substantial skin on my juicy buns. These were thin and like tissue-paper. I've had better.. . Their Shanghai-style pork and shrimp wonton soup is incredibly good as were the fried shrimp noodles. . . The service was very attentive and friendly. It's very authentic, but still accessible to the diner who is unfamiliar with regional Chinese (in this case Shanghainese but with a home base in Taiwan) cuisine.. . On my next visit, I'm looking to try one of the other dumpling varieties and will pass on the juicy buns. Juicy indeed, but they lacked...how you say...suppleness?
