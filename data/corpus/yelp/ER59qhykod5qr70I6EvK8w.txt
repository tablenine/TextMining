Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I have to thank my friend Jennifer for introducing me to Lawry's. It is still my favorite prime rib restaurant. Don't get me wrong. The others are good too. But, the prime rib here is just superb! I introduced this place to my fiance. Since then, we've been going here for our anniversary. . . They recommend making a reservation in advance. I agree! It's busy on the weekdays too. Valet parking is available for a fee. Sorry, but I forgot how much it costs. . . We always begin with the spinning salad. Their dressing is soooo good! I always want seconds. I can't get enough of it. . . Next are the sides. We usually order creamed corn, creamed spinach, and the mushrooms. My favorite is the creamed corn. It is really good with the prime rib. . . I usually order the California cut since I have a small appetite. I sometimes take some home. My fiance usually orders the the Lawry cut or the beef bowl cut. The beef bowl cut is recommended for those with an appetite! It is huge...usually served to the two competing teams in the Rose Bowl. I think I'm going to take a risk and order the lobster/prime rib next time I go. I know, it's a stretch from the california cut but heck..I love lobster!. . The servers/staff are great too. I'd give this place more than 5 stars if I could.
