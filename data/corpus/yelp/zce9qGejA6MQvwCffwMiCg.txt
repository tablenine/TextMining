Food:  Very good.. . My favorite dish was the spanokopita.  I could've eaten a few of them!  Baked goat cheese was yummy too.  I didn't even realize it was all vegetarian until my friend said so half way into eating.  I guess that's a compliment being that I'm happy to eat meat.. . Service:  Very good.. . Environment on a Friday night:  Very bad.  . . They need to invest in one of those of winter vestibule things to keep more of the cold air out when the door is opened and closed.  There was a wait and my date and I were crowded near the doorway with 4 other people ahead of us.  Just when we started warming up, someone would open the door to leave and we were freezing again.  We opted to take the first seats available, and lo and behold, it ended up being at the bar by the door.   :-(  We could have waited however long for a table, all of which are further from the door, but we'd be waiting where it was cold anyway so we figured we'd just order our food and try to make it a quick visit.  . . Though the food was great, drinks delicious (I had the pear sake), decor nice, we felt that it was not worth the wait or the cold.  It sucks to eat with your coat on.. . However, as the food was quite good, I'd go back when it's not crowded and I could get seated in the back, or for carryout.
