Really good minestrone-make sure you order a cup with your dinner.  Had not been there in years and I have to say the remodeling is lovely!  A good Chicago mainstay (been there for 40+ years) for decent Italian food, nice atmosphere and good service. There is even a designated, free parking lot right across the street!  A plus when entertaining out of towners or older parents who don`t quite get "city life" and walking to dinner! Definately worth checking out!
