Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Two minute wait to get seated, attentive service, and a plate full of various stuffed french toast smothered in yogurt, fruit, and granola? I hope this meal is indicative of how great the rest of 2010 is going to go!. . The coffee was piping hot, our server was great (presented with flourish, and a special accent), and the food was delivered really quickly. Â My only complaint is that the strawberry stuffed french toast somewhat tasted plastic-y.
