We Went for the Sunday brunch, but arrived a little to late.  The entire dining experience was a delight of the senses from beginning to end.  The design is sleek and contemporary, the southern American style food is prepared as updated versions of common favorites.  The service was professional with an extra friendly twist.  I noticed that not only at our table, but all the diners were in great spirits, which really created an uplifting atmosphere.  The Bloody Mary bar was by far the best I have seen.  You select your vodka preference, and it is delivered on ice.  A smorgasbord of the mix-ins were  laid out with a huge variety of mixers, pickled veggies, hot sauces, fresh spices, etc.  (check out the photos I posted!). Overall, I loved it and have no complaints.  The only thing that is keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the food quality/preparation,  but that's only if they are seeking perfection, and I am a tough critic.  Highly recommended and I would repeat in a heartbeat.
