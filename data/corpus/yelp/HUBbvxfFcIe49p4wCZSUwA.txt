Finally, FINALLY got to try this place in LA. I've been to the ones in Taipei and this locatoin lives up to the hype. . . Yes, come here for the xiao long baos! Expect to wait because everyone else is coming here for the xiao long baos too. Try both the regular ones and the crabmeat ones. Also if you come on a weekend you can order the special soup ones (but those sell out fast!).
