Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Five stars because Kopi lives up to everything for which it stands....laid back and au natural. It's close to my hood, so I do a lot of lunches here. Kopi doesn't put any extra crap in their food like most places and nothing's fried. Paninis aren't greasy, great assortment of cheeses, and their soups are always fresh...no weird separation. The service is a bit erratic, but it goes with the laid back vibe...what's the rush anyway. Overall, you can eat a lot here and walk out feeling pretty darn skinny. Oh, almost forgot, super cute boutique in the back that sells clothes, accessories, candles, books, etc...great for last minute gifts.
