Restaurant: Mary Mac&#39;s Tea Room
Category: Southern
Fried chicken: about as good as what you can get in Publix.. Mac n' cheese: cheese curds and elbow macaroni and not creamy sauce at all.. BBQ ribs: not smoky but tender with flavorful sauce.. Sweet potato pie: delicious!. Pecan pie: the best I've ever had since it was gooey and not corn syrupy tasting!  Even better that the waiter brought us a slice for free knowing the husband was debating between that and the sweet potato pie.. Ambiance: Southern contemporary.  Charming yet elegant.. Service: charming and sweet - the best you'll get in any restaurant, let alone a Southern one.
