i've lived near canters for almost 10 years and there's good reasons why i barely go in there. yet yesterday, desperate for some smoked black cod (sable) i walked into canters wondering if they had it- they never had in the past.  they said they had smoked cod so i tried a piece, it was good, so i bought $10 worth.  this morning i ate it on a bagel with cream cheese.  the fish was gross.  the piece they gave me to sample was good- but this slab they gave me was NOT good. what a weird flavor it had.  i'm currently feeling off.  this was not a smart move on my part. sigh. live and learn again.  as in the case of the bakery- it wall looks WAY better than it tastes.  yuck canters, yuck.
