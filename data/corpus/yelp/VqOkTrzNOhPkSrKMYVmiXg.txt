This place is always packed and a lot of people love it but I just don't get it.  I've been dragged here so many times and every time, I am disappointed.  Don't even bother trying any of the Korean dishes since they look like what they claim to be but doesn't taste anything like it.  There are couple of dishes that are decent like the Korean ribs (although they are not authentic as I said) but generally, it's bleh.  But if I had to grade them on just their smoothie drinks, they would get 5 stars.  They use all fresh fruit and their tapioca is perfect consistency.  I usually always stop by for a gigantic order of their fruit drinks with extra tapioca.  Yummy.  So averaging out the grade for food and drinks comes to 3 stars.
