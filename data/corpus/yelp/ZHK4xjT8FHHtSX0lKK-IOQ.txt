Every time I come here, my lunch is awesome! I always get the $12 lunch meal, and usually end up with some sort of salad and sandwich. The summer is the best time to come because there are less soups and better sides (like fresh fruit salad with honey and greek yogurt). Â It sometimes is packed inside (filled with many stay-at-home moms during the week), but facing the crowd is worth it. The staff here is amazing, and they always have a great attitude and energy.
