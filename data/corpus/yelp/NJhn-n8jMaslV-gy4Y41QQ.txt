Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Disclaimer: I'm from SF, not Chicago. . . In SF, I always rave about Zacchary's Chicago style pizza in Berkekey. I figured that If I liked Zacchary's so much I may as well stop by Chicago to see how it compares. . . We yelped pizza places on our blackberries and ended up at Lou Malnati's. Yelp hooked it up. . . Lou Malnat's was great. A step above Zacch's (which I still think is amazing).. . We ordered the Lou and the crust was soft and perfect. I'm not into really crisp crust. . . It was 9pm and we had a seat outside on the street and the weather couldn't have been better. . . The sodas (err, pop) were enormous. . . The service was good and prices reasonable. . . I need to go back to Chicago and have a pizza tour.
