Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
In all the years that I've visited this place, I've never ordered a chili dog here.  It's never what I crave for when I'm standing in the infamous long line.  Plus, I don't get the inclusion of mustard with chili on a hot dog.  It just does not make sense to me.  I'll experiment with this at home one day.  Or, maybe not.. . The only item on the menu I can really comment on is the Chili-Cheese Chicken Burrito.  Included in the dish are a "big flour tortilla, wrapped around 2 chicken breasts with lettuce and chopped tomatoes".  Of course, all this comes with chili and cheese.  It works for me and it's so damn good that I never ever order anything else!. . Like practically everyone else here has noted, parking can be a problem.  Most of my visits to this establishment have been during non-peak times, so I don't know the pain of having to deal with driving around in circles for almost an hour, and then following that up with a long wait in line.  But alas, when is parking in the Melrose area ever an easy objective to accomplish.. . * I spotted the guy called "Bigfoot" on the Howard Stern Show several years ago.  His name was Matthew McGrory.  Yeah, he wasn't any of the A-listers that you see in the pictures hanging on the walls, but that's who I saw!
