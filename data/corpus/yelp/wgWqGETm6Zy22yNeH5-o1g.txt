Category: Wine Bars
I'd choose this spot to try new wines/champagnes with just one or two other persons.  They do have an extensive menu (a fairly large selection of rose &amp; sparkling &amp; dessert wines which is great) and a handful of overpriced nibble-foods.  I think it's worth it - for the attentive service and ambience.  . . The live jazz bar downstairs would be a nice gathering place for larger, 'older' groups .  The bathroom down there is nicer/more discreet than the one that's right there in front of everyone and everything upstairs.... . Just don't come with a idiotic cheap date like I did last time I came here.  He's tall, fair, has a well paying job, comes from a good family, uh smells nice- I wondered why the heck he was single.   I guess i asked for it when he refused to order anything more in this "ridiculously expensive" place when I finished my 3 ounce glass of Moscato....
