Went back for a birthday brunch with my folks yesterday. After sampling what everyone at the table had--and figuring in our previous meal--I've tasted about one third of the brunch menu now. The fried chicken--brined in buttermilk and hot sauce--was great. The brown sugar waffle was also a winner (crisp on the outside, soft on the inside), as was the fluffy lemon and ricotta pancakes. Even the housemade maple peach sausage was a hit, a perfect combination of spicy and sweet.. . What continues to impress me though is the service. When we pulled up, the valet remembered us from our first visit a few weeks ago. Then, when we walked in, the host recognized us and welcomed us back as well. And despite an incredibly packed house, our server made sure we wanted for nothing. . . After two brunch visits, Nova and I now want to return for dinner, especially after twice seeing the previous nights' specials on the dining room's large chalkboards. We're having dinner with a friend on Friday night and I'm already thinking how we can convince her to come here. It's been that good.. . P.S. I just have to mention how much I like the valet guys here--and I hate having to valet at most places. They're super friendly and act as an extension of the staff, making recommendations and more. When we exited the restaurant on our latest visit, one of the guys saw me and immediately said "Chris, I'll be back with your car in a sec." I was surprised and my parents were shocked. When do you ever get that kind of service from a valet?
