The food - I ordered red meat of course - the grilled flatiron steak salad. =9 It had a nice distinctive flavor and a good portion of meats. The dressing was not overwhelming nor was it drenching the salad. A relief because they have so many customers in line that it's easy to quickly throw something together and move on to the next customer. They make the salads in front of you so you know you're getting fresh meats + veggies. My friends ordered the mashed potato which I thought was okay - think buttery mashed potato - the one I can make at home and would cost less kind. ;) . . The price - $10.50 for a reasonable sized plate of salad. Though, I do think that the price is more mainly because of the space it occupies. I could definitely get a bigger salad for less in other places. . . The ambiance - Plenty of seating, though less indoors than outdoors. It's in a pretty happenin' part of Culver City so, be ready for lines and lots of people. A nice hang out or date place.. . The service - Fast and friendly! . . Good place overall, just wish I had more food with it - I was still a bit hungry afterward.
