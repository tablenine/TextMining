IMO, a good pastrami is part sandwich and part fingerfood packed with flavors and an arsenal of pickled sides like carrots and hot peppers. Oinkster delivered! The food was so good I didn't give a damn if I checked my table manners at the door. Nor did I feel bad that I indulged in their amazingly delicious piggy fries. . . The Oinkster Pastrami disappeared into my stomach and all I had left was an amazing taste in my mouth! . . They got an array of awesome beer on tap, and since I can't drink I can't tell you which one to get but I've heard all their names and I know theyre great.. . Definitely come here on one of those hot LA afternoons, grab yourself a pastrami with a side of fries, pig out and wash it all down with a tall cool brewsky.. . Love it!
