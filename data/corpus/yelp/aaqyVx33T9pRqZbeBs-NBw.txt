Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
So I finally took the plunge and tried out Pizzeria Uno's Deep Dish (the original inventor of deep dish!?). . While the wait of course was for an hour even at 9pm on a Sunday night, we were ready for that. . . What we were not ready for is an under-cooked pizza that gave my bf a stomach-ache, a table where we couldn't fit our pizza and then a booth where we couldn't fit our legs. . . But worst of all - they couldn't find our check so kept us an extra 15mnts! They finally located it on the wrong name but then the server says she needs to transfer her commission from someone else's. Now if they're messing up, why are we waiting an extra 20mnts to pay!!!???. . I prefer Lou Malnati's!!!
