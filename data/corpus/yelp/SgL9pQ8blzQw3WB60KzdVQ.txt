Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I went here with a group of friends who all seemed to love the tacos . . . but I didn't.. . The fish was fresh but the salsas and condiments looked and tasted like they had been sitting there all day long. They were out of the mild salsas so I ended up trying all the spicy ones and the relish. The flavors were OK, but nothing great. My mom could make any of it much better. haha. I was craving a lime wedge or two!. . The price is good and the tacos are decent, but certainly nothing to go out of your way to get. . . (I have only been there once so maybe it was an off day, buy my friend who is a repeat customer seemed like this was normal.). . Ooh, but the green chunky granite slab tabletop is pretty awesome. :)
