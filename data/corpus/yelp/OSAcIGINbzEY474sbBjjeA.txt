Wow!  These little tacos (and I mean LITTLE) are bursting with flavor!  I had them at a school fundraiser, so the normal $2 price was jacked up to $3.  Also, you could only choose from beef shortrib and chicken.  I would like to come back and try the spicy pork tacos and the quesadilla.. . It's great, but the tacos are so small.  I ended up eating four of them (two beef, two chicken), and I was still hungry.  At $12 for the meal, it didn't seem worth it.  Korean BBQ typically doesn't cost this much.. . Actually, now that I think about it, you can compare the tacos to South Korea.  The place is packed with people, but the area of the land itself is tiny.  These tacos, while packed with flavors, are quite diminutive in terms of "taco land mass.". . Still, being that I tend to spend liberally on food, I don't mind the price because the flavors are great!  I definitely plan on coming back, but I don't know if this will become a habit.
