Restaurant: Pura Vida
Category: Tapas Bars
Very romantic place to enjoy a date. Pura Vida has a great atmosphere and very romantic feeling the moment you walk in. Located on N. Highland Ave. it's a great place to get dinner before heading out to a near by bar or blues club. . . The interior is exquisite as it has beautiful art work of half naked ladies hung all over the walls. The food is very well prepared, and priced right. I love tapas as you get to try a lot of different stuff. While you are there you have to have a mojito as they are served with a real stick of sugar cane. Although I don't suggest gnawing on it. Yuck!. . The people here are way beyond nice, as i threw a friends 40th surprise birthday party here last year and they worked with me on a large crowd. It's great for groups or intimate dinners for 2. Great place.
