I've sorely missed living in close proximity to such splendid sushi goodness.  I used to frequent Toro when I lived in River North, and credit Mitch with convincing my mom to release her raw fish fears.. . Convinced a friend to endure the hour+ wait with me on Saturday night, where our patience was rewarded with a happy l'il platter of ama ebi and sake sashimi, followed by the Oh My God (the _only_ roll good enough for me to drop my disdain of marriage between maki and cream cheese), White Tuna Crunch, and Kamikaze rolls.  All were prepared quickly, super fresh, and disappeared within minutes of arrival.  . . If only there were an Evanston outpost...
