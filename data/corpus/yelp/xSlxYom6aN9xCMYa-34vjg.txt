What a great lunch!  . . We had the Mango Jalapeño, Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers, and Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers (all with caramelized onions and sweet peppers).  Great fire-grilled sausages with no clear-cut favorite since they all have a different flavor profile.. . When we arrived at 11:30am on a Thursday it was pretty empty and the host helped us order.  An hour later there were only a few open seats in the house.  (We loved the beer-house family style bench seating.)  Two hours later we were on our third beer and second round of Belgian fries (the pesto mayo dipping sauce is great).  The very decent German and Belgian tap beer selection kept us busy.  Even the water is delicious!. . We will be back with a bigger group next time...
