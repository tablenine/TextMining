Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
ramen is pretty good. dont let the head scale fool you, it's more of the heat that will make you sweat than actually scorching your mouth. serving size is good and finger licking good. the service is great . hottest i've gone is hyper #2, the fried rice is good and i can only imagine the rest of their menu is just as good. will i dare to try the special #2, we'll have to wait and see.
