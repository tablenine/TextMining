After a night of bowling in Eagle Rock, my girls and I were very hungry.. . I couldn't really think of many restaurants that would be fully open at 10 o'clock at night but I did recall driving past this piggy looking place before, on Colorado Blvd. There are two small lots on both sides of the building but I'm sure that there is street parking if they are both full. I ordered the Veggie burger with a side of vegetarian fries.. . **NOTE TO VEGETARIANS**. Even though it sounds all cute and delicious, the Belgian fries are NOT vegetarian. They are fried in beef fat and something else that will possibly clog your arteries. I don't know, but I'm glad that I asked why they were different from regular fries because honestly, I had never even heard of Belgian fries before.. . Now, aside from that depressing topic, my burger and veggie fries were awesome. The lettuce and tomatoes inside were crisp and cold and the veggie patty itself was better than many I've tasted. The girl who worked the cashier/served was incredibly friendly, the place was clean. I don't know, its kind of refreshing to visit a place that was hyped up by other yelpers that was actually worth it (*see Wurstkuche review*).
