I hate that I spend so much time on the internet, but sometimes it pays off.  Thanks to Twitter and Thrillist, I found $5 burger week.. . The conditions were perfect.  BF &amp; I both had the day off, David Burke's had a 2:00 res.  I love a good lunch date!. . The whole way there on the bus (hey, I was going for a $5 burger) I was kind of irritated that we would have to pay for ketchup and mustard.  I was thinking, even McDonald's gives you this stuff for free.  But then I encountered the condiment tray.  My favorite part of the afternoon.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.. . I arrived and the place was packed.  I'm glad I made a reservation.  Turns out I must have been the last person to hear about this.  We arrived early, but were seated promptly at 2:00pm.  I liked how they offered just the burger menu and the wines by the glass list.  I'm not sure if this place usually serves lunch, but I liked the fact that I didn't have to feel guilty for going for the discount.. . Our server was great.  Friendly, cool and didn't even look at me in disgust when I asked if they have free refills on Diet Coke.  (I know, I know, but I was having one of those caffeine-necessary days).. . We both ordered the Burker, mine with cheddar, the condiment plate and some asiago truffle fries.  The burgers arrived plain, but oh, that condiment plate was fabulous!  Sauteed onions and mushrooms, sauteed spinach, fried shallots, full strips of bacon, pickled red onions, homemade ketchup (that is actually different than the regular as we discovered with our fries), mustard, pickle and this amazing garlic mayo.  It was fantastic!  We loved every bite of it.  The fries were pretty tasty too.. . Overall a great lunch in a lively atmosphere.  Now I can't wait to go back for dinner.
