Restaurant: The Porter Beer Bar
Category: American (New)
Finally ate there recently, and have been a few times just to drink. . . First, the beer list. Huge. Diverse. LOVE IT! Other than Brick Store I haven't been to a place in Atlanta with this many good beers. Bartenders are very knowledgeable and recommended some good choices when we told them what we liked (but wanted to try something new). . . Second, the bar. Narrow. Cool place, but gets really crowded very quickly. My only real knock against it. . . Third, food. Was VERY good. I had a black bean burger and my gf got the garlic/Belgian fries. The fries were awesome, but we had to hit the gas station across the street for mints after them. Burger was very good but came apart quickly. . . Fourth, ambiance. Awesome. Love the exposed brick, the dining room is very cool, etc. The bar area is great, just very small. . . Highly recommend to the beer connoisseur.
