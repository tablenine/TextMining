Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
It's all about the price at this place. Definitely the cheapest all you can eat Korean BBQ I've been to. . . But for the price you pay ($16 a person), the quality also suffers. . . We tried the pork, beef and chicken. I would definitely stick to the thinly sliced beef and pork. The chicken just didn't taste very good, and we ended up leaving half the servings behind. The thinly sliced beef was the best, but even that didn't taste superb to me. . . Brace yourself for a meat overload. There are absolutely no vegetarian dishes here. If you want veggies, you really need to go elsewhere. . . Two things I did like: . (1) The whole place is outdoors. With 5000 grills going, it's nice that we're not trapped in a smoke filled, stuffy room. . (2) For birthday boys and girls, you get a champagne shower! We watched from our table as a guest at another table get drenched. It's pretty fun! (but if you're the birthday boy or girl, just make sure your cell phone is out of your pocket!).
