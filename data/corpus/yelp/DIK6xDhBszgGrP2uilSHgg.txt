Read the reviews and thought it would be worth trying.  Let me begin with the pro's:. - The place is very posh and has a nice upscale feel to it.  The wait staff was excellent. Their wine and liquor list is very nice.  . - They offer valet parking.  Its close to all of the downtown action, right off the mag mile and off the El (especially nice for tourists).  . . The con's:. - I ordered the lobster bisque, which was very tasty.  So, I thought alright... bring it on.  . - I had the trout (grilled), which was very dry and barely had any taste to it.  I also had the asparagus risotto, which was also pretty dry.  For the price of my entree I expected much more taste and umph.  It was pretty lack luster. . - For dessert I ordered the apple pie, which went very well with my Kahlua and coffee.  So, they get a star for that.  .   . When I decide to do drinks, dinner, and dessert (basically spend up some of my hard earned cash) that's exactly what I like to do.  In this case, my money didn't get me far.  I could just chalk it up and say maybe I should have ordered something different and it probably would have been better ... but that just doesn't cut it.  All in all, I will go back for happy hour, since their drinks are pretty good and they have an ULTRA SEXY bar.  But, I'll definitely have dinner somewhere else.
