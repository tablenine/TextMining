Restaurant: Kamehachi
Category: Sushi Bars
I just went there last night and I am now craving it. I wanted to go back for more about a minute after we left but I stuffed my self silly so I dont know where I'd put it. . . We sat at the bar and watched the chef's create. Our orders were taken quickly and the food was also served fast. I dont mind lingering at a restaurant but we had somewhere to be. I got the Kamehachi combo and my friend got the Begginers sushi combo because he cant have fish. It came with California rolls which contained crab - even though it's shellfish, he cant eat it either. He asked the chef what was in the roll and one of the other staff was in tune to the situation and immediately asked the chef to make him something else at no extra charge. Nice!. . MY biggest beef with sushi places is when they make the rolls so damn large you feel like an idiot chewing this big fat roll. This place made them the appropriate size -at leas the rolls I got.
