I have been here several times and the service and food is always reliable.  Not stellar but definitely adequate enough to come back to.  This place won't knock your socks off, but it will provide you with pretty good food at price point that is on almost on par with the location of the restaurant and quality of the food.. . I don't love the ambiance, you definitely feel like you are eating in a basement (which you are), the servers are usually a little odd, and the food is just slightly above average.  For the price, I just expect a bit more - If this place was just a pit cheaper I would give 4 stars.
