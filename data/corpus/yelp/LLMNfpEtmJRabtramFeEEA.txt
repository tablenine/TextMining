Food is pretty good, but a bit pricey.. . Tthey set up the place completely wrong/confusing.  Not a very good flow to the space as you order in a teeny "foyer" and then walk down a windowless hall to the cafeteria style eating.  I actually entered through the back - didn't realize there was a "front"
