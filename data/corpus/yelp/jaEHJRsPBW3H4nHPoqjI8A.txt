Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
now this place is ok just for novelty but honestly it's not really worth more than 1 or 2 visits.  anything with guac or mushrooms tastes like ass and the wait ain't worth even a handful of candy corn...which brings me on to why they still make candy corn? anyhoo, a better hot dag joint is top dog in berkeley...err bumkeley should i say.  their dags are cheap and good.
