Went here for Cinco de Mayo, and my friends and I chose it solely based on the fact that it's shaped like a boat.  We sat out on the patio and went through about 4 pitchers of their frozen margaritas, which I have to say are very good.  I really liked their shrimp enchiladas, but then again by that time we'd already polished off 2 pitchers so my judgment might have been skewed...
