Great food, but way too loud.  OK, I'm getting older and I prefer to have dinner at a place where I can easily converse with whoever I'm dining with.  Everyone was really nice.  The bacon, pear and blue cheese flat bread was divine and a nice way to start.  I had an all meat dinner starting with steak tartare for my app and moving on to the flat iron steak.  Both were excellent.  One note, the steak is served in some kind of cooking pan even though it wasn't cooked in that pan.  The raised sides made it hard to cut the meat.  Next time I'm just eating it with my hands.  My friend had the salad and the ribbon pasta with rock shrimp.  They make their own pasta and it was wonderful.  For dessert we had the banana bread pudding and chocolate crepes.  While we enjoyed both we were too stuffed to come close to finishing.  As much as I liked the food and service, I probably won't be back until I'm rich enough to rent the whole place out.
