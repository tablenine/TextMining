Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno

My mom and step-dad were visit #2 in my spring-break-a-thon of being tourist guide.  They came on a Monday and, since I couldn't get the time off of work they had to figure their sightseeing out on their own.  I met them at their hotel for a little Wisconsin cocktail hour (which means they brought their own cooler full of cocktails and beer.)  My mom desperately wanted to try every famous Chicago food.  They had already eaten a Chicago dog, so next up was pizza and for that I decided on Pizzeria Uno.  . . I've heard stories about the wait here, but it wasn't bad at all.  Maybe because it was a cold and rainy Monday night?  We gave the host our name and ordered our pizza right away.  They told us it would be a 30 minute wait for a table.  No problem!  My folks could use some sobering up time.  Five minutes later our name was called.  Wow!  Where was the wait?  Not that I'm complaining, but the 'rents was tipsy! . . I'm not a big fan of deep dish.  I'm really more of a NY pizza gal, but I did enjoy Uno's pizza.  I enjoyed it so much that I was able to eat two pieces.  Uno's also has an ok beer selection which made my step-papa happy.  The staff was also nice and attentive.
