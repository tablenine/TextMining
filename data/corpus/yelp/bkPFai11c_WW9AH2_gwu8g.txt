LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. . So I live in the suburbs and this is definitely one of the top reasons I come to the city.  It's possible that my friends who live around there think I'm using them because every time it's definitely like "Hey, I'm gonna come visit you... we're going to Toro right?"  . . My favorite rolls so far are the OMG roll, the Three Musketeer roll, and Spicy Tuna Crunch.  Not that I've ever had a roll there that I didn't like.  And their sashimi is absolutely delicious!  The prices are decent, and it's safe to say that if I lived close enough, I would eat there every day.  . . Now this place is TINY!  And so many people are in love with it, that it is pretty hard to get a table.  However, I've always gone right when it opened 5-5:30pm on a weeknight and never had to wait.  So, go early and you don't have to worry about the 2 hour wait everyone is complaining about!
