The tacos were pretty good. The tacos al pastor were good and the pineapples were a nice touch.   The tostadas were good.  I liked the freshly made chips, but everything else was just okay.   The service was okay too, for an early Sunday afternoon. . . What irks me about the place is that it STILL doesn't have a website.  It's 2010 and times are tough.  But not having a website doesn't make a lot of sense in this day and age..   Most of the people know that there are some big names behind Big Star.  . . So the question is, "Are these people being thrifty, arrogant or just simply brilliant at marketing?" . . Is it an, "act like we're broke, but rake in the cash business model?". . Or a sincere, "We're really watching our budget and cutting costs business model?"   . . I don't know the answer to this question, but I'm guessing it's a little bit of everything.
