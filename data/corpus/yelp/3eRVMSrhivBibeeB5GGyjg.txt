First off, Filter, this is not.  Yes, the location is great, the space is bright and has a nice view, yes, the staff is very nice, and yes, I know they just opened.      However, I went there early on a Saturday and was disappointed in the offerings- oatmeal in a paper bowl and cold scones.  Since I don't drink coffee, I need something else to enjoy at a place like this.  Maybe bagels?  The bagels from New York Bagel would be a nice addition. They did have a few tea offerings and I picked a nice breakfast tea. Without a kitchen or even microwave, I am skeptical that the menu will improve.  They did say they were trying out options, like donuts, (if you like donuts) to add to the offerings.  I'll wait a few weeks before I go back.
