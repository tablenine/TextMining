I would like to give this place a 4 b/c they have great beer on tap, But I can't do it for 3 reasons: . . 1.  Because they are so ridiculous with the "no changes or substitutions" to their dishes that it's even printed on the outer leather cover of their menu. I heard someone ask for no cheese and they said, well we can't do that but the cheese we use is really good" - Ok great, but what if you can't eat cheese b/c you are lactose intolerant or you just don't like it. I know you can scrape it off but if you are paying over $10 for a burger, you should be able to get it with no cheese. . . 2.  A place like this that is known for their burger, should create an equally good veggie burger (one that rivals Houston's). Creating a meaty tasting veggie burger is quite a challenge and for a gourmet gastropub, it surprises me they haven't attempted to cater to that group of foodies. Just cause we don't eat meat doesn't mean we don't enjoy a good burger too along with a good beer. But then again, if they wont even make a burger w/o the cheese I guess, I shouldn't expect them to cater to anyone, especially us non-meat eaters. . . 3. They need more wheat beers on tap. Beers that are harder to find on tap would be nice - Franziskaner, Erdinger, Hoegaardenand, and Hitachino (they have this by the bottle but for $9, it would have been nice to have it fresh from the tap). They did have one good cloudy, unfiltered wheat beer on tap from the U.S. but nothing from Germany or Belgium. . . Aside from those 3 gripes, they do have a great selection of most other beers, a nice outside area with plenty of big tables, very knowledgeable bartenders, and good fries (both regular and sweet potato).
