Apparently authentic cuban food is greeeeeasy. I'm not that into grease - so not really my thing. The black beans were good. They filled my wine glass to the brim each time. My friend liked his fried chicken. I got an item described as beef stuffed with sausage - well imagine my surprise when that's exactly what it was! A dime size circle of sausage put into the meat. Pictured it rolled up. Got a big laugh though! This place let's dogs on the patio - so I'll most likely be back. They need a big fan on the Â patio - it was soooo hot!!! I'll explore some less greasy (hopefully) options next time!
