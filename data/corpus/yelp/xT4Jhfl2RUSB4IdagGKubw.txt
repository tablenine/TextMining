Unlike Warren Zevon, I may not have seen a werewolf drinking down at Trader Vic's (well, not that I know of) but I can say that I danced with hula girls there.  I drank the original mai tai there.  I plucked an orchid blossom from a bowl of liquor and placed it in my hair.  I compared ukuleles with a 6'7'' dude in a straw barber shop quartet hat.  I watched that same guy sing the Huikilau.  I once attended a Huikilau convention here.  I flirted with (and then got shot down) by a gorgeous blonde Ukrainian girl.  I flirted with (and got the number of) a gorgeous girl from Kennesaw.  I shared satays with one of the B-52s.  I drank hot buttered rum (many times) out of a giant flaming skull.  I consumed several drinks intended to be drunk by entire groups all by myself.  I regretted several mornings after.. . If you go here (especially on a Tongo Hiti Thursday) these things may or may not happen to you too.
