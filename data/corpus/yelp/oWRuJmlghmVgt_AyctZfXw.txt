This was the very first place I ever tried Pho and I definitely fell in love that day. What was this amazing broth with these fresh minty greens and thinly sliced pieces of beef that you could slurp up in front of a cute boy and not look like a rude loser with no table etiquette!? It was AWESOME and I have been a Phonatic ever since!. . I've only gone back a few times since that faithful lunch meeting where I sat across from the oh so adorable Rocco Deluca and interviewed him for his bio, but I have to give them 4 stars for triggering the brothy urge inside of me to try pho whenever I can and for giving me an amazing "first time" memory :) Thanks, I'll never forget ya!
