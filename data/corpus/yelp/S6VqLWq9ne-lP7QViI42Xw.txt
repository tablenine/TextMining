A wise person once said, Â "Don't hate the playa, hate the game". Well the game here is brunch my friends, and as a dutiful English major I present for your inspection a comparison contrast of two closely located Wicker Park brunch spots. . . 1) Wait for up to 2 hours at Bongo room vs. sit right away at Rodan. 2) Eat a wide range of tasty breakfast/lunch food (some with a vegan/veg emphasis) at Rodan vs. a few specialty items at Bongo (after that, face it--it's just eggs.). 3)Pay a lotta money for that French toast at Bongo vs. a reasonably priced meal at Rodan.. 4) After waiting an hour or more for your highly priced French Toast at Bongo getting asked to leave mere seconds after you swallow your last morsel vs. being able to spend a few more leisurely minutes sipping your Vietnamese style coffee at Rodan. . . My friends, at the game of brunch, Rodan is the winner and champion!. I might add the staff is super friendly.. . Addendum: I usually don't look at other reviews so I don't bias myself, but I just did and must admit that it may not be the best place to take the folks or grand-folks unless they are artsy sorts.
