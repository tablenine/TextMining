Like others have said - BEST french toast I've ever had. I don't even like french toast - but I guess thats because I'd never had it at the Griddle! The portions are gigantic so I suggest sharing. The french press coffee is also phenomenal. I don't think I'll be satisfied with breakfast anywhere else in this city after eating here. But oh my am I glad I found this place.
