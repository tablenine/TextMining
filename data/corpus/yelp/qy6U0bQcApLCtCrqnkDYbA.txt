I met a blind date here, he was late...but I'm reviewing Dunlay's not the date. . . ANyWay... . We chose this place to meet because he lived close by and we both had dogs we wanted to bring along. I really enjoy having my dog with me, because she's well behaved. This guy's dog, not so much. But again, I'm reviewing Dunlay's. . . We ordered a bottle of wine, which I never do but he never asked so I went along. He also suggested the guacamole as an appetizer and you know what, that was the best suggestion he had on him. I got the house salad and asked for light dressing, the salad was fresh and not too big. . . I didn't use the restroom. Contessa, however, was in need of relief so we had to walk up the sidewalk a bit. She didn't mind the lack of amenities and chose a grate about 100 or so feet away rather than trot across the street to the park. . . Dude who's name I don't remember...I know you said you train your dog yourself but you really need help. Please read my review of Animal Sense before you introduce him to another date. Save yourself. . . I'm going to not hold it against Dunlay's that the guy I met here was odd and give it another try one day. On my own time, and my dog will be my date! She's the best date anyone could hope for.
