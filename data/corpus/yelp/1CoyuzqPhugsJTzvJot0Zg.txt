The patio was perfect last night. Enjoyed sparking and chocolate with basil gelato. Our server was the best that I've come across in quite a while. . . Hit them up after a fairly disappointing time at the StudioPlex Art Stroll. . . Will be back for more so I can up the score...(after eating a meat plate).. . Cheers~
