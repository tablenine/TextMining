Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Sweet Penny, give her a chance; you might like it!  So many negative reviewers out there, but I'm going to throw Penny's a bone because I kind of love it.  No, its not the best Thai, but its a cheap meal, and just as good as all those other noodle restaurants in Chicago that are pretending to be Thai restaurants... call it Thai for Beginners or Thai for Dummies - I just call it good.  . . The Hot Pepper Noodle is great, but my personal favorite is the Vegetarian Bowl: its like a Pad Thai but not as greasy because it has raw/ fresh veggies in it.  Wash it all down with a Thai iced tea and you've got a meal!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Service and delivery are fast, too.
