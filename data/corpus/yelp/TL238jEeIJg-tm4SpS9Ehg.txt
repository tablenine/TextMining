Best way i can think to describe Phillipes:. I was recently with a group of friends, and phillipes came up. One of my buddies exclaimed "i've never actual been there." . I told him he had to try and I would take him soon. Upon hearing this, everyone else stopped mid conversation and at the same time asked "when are we going to Phlillipes?". . The beef is great, but for my money a double dipped lamb is the way to go. . . IMO, this is one of the only "LA Institutions" that actually lives up to the hype.
