I've heard SO much about F.O. that I had to FINALLY check it out. Overall, it's a cool place to hang out. The table hovering situation is a bit annoying and the lack of service can be frustrating (especially when there are too many people) but here is the review of the food:. . I was worried that the much lauded burger would set my expectations too high. But I have to admit it lived up to its reputation. Fantastic!!!. . The sweet potato fries were good but not the best I've had.. . The beer selection was extensive, yes, but I found the beers just OK.
