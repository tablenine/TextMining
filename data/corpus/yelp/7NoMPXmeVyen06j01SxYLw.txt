Like other LA traditions, this place is over hyped. It's worth it to check it out once, but otherwise, like some of the other reviewers, go to Costco for your money's worth or better yet, Tommys! . . The fun value is getting to take your out of town friends to see the pictures on the wall and getting to wait in yet another line that is synonymous with living in LA. Perhaps it's our close proximity to Disneyland that when people see a line, they want to line up!
