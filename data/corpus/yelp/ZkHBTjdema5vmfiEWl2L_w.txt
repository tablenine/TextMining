Campy, campy, campy, but the food is GREAT.  It's not the kind of place I think of when I want burgers and beer, but the food really is that good that I'm willing to overlook the campiness of the whole place.  The waitstaff has always been very friendly and the busboys are HOT.  A little eye candy never hurt. ;)
