Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
All you can eat BBQ for about $15. Nuff said, right? Probably one of my more frequented KBBQ places. I enjoy the outdoor seating, which, trust me, is hugely helpful when it's packed and everyone's grilling. The ventilation is tremendously appreciated. Imagine the same thing indoors. I think you could get your daily recommendation of grease just breathing in a situation like that. Plus it gives a more casual feel to it which I think works for the type of food being served, even if some people think it looks "cheap".. . Quality is good for an all you can eat, and IMO pretty good in general for Korean BBQ, depending on what cut you get. Samgapsal (AKA Korean bacon) isn't really necessary to be the highest cut, for example, and tastes just as great here as anywhere else. I also usually get the beef brisket and bulgogi which is solid.. . Only problem is I often run out of dipping sauce/side dishes/water pretty quickly and even when we're like the only group, service is sloooow. In fact I think service is better when it's a little more crowded cause they're in a rhythm. Unlike when it's empty and they're too busy gossiping or whatever it is they do in the corner. I guess that's just the Korean style though - they consider good service the one that bothers you the least. Luckily you got the little call button - never be afraid to use that. So if you feel like starving yourself all day and then pigging out, hit up Manna.
