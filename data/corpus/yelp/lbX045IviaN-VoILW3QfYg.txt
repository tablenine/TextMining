Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I was a Roscoe's virgin until last week. I had a tremendous craving for some mi dang food, so I dragged my friend all the way out to Pasadena for some Roscoe's.. It was fairly small, though easy to find. I walked in and...WOW...it was so ghetto looking. . There are many photos of some Mexican dude with celebrities, so I'm guessing that's the owner?. Anyways, I sat down, and this really nice black lady came and served us, she was overly hospitable which scared me quite a bit. I got the sunrise drink, which was orange juice and lemonade (OMG SOOO GOOOD); and the 1/2 chicken &amp; 2 waffles meal. Once I rubbed that butter all over the waffle and dumped syrup on it, I chowed down cuz I was starving! . Took me thirty minutes to get there, and omg it was heavenly!!!. The saltiness mixed with the sweet and butteryness.......... Hasta La Vista...ROSCOE!!
