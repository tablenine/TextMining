OMG  this place was great!!  I saw this place on the news, and I just had to take a trip!   I had the rib tips, 1/2 chicken, mac -n- cheese, Homemade BBQ chips, and Jalapeno cornbread..............  I was in heaven......I wanted to slap my mama AGAIN LOL!!  The food was great, the mac -n- cheese was excellent!!  The live music was awesome!!  You get so much for your money.  There was also a special with these dark beers so you know i had to try them.  I usually am not a dark beer kinda guy, but hell I was into it that night!! My Favorite was this one with an apricot taste.  I will definitely be back!!. . OMG the cookie in the skillet was sooooooooooooooooooooo good.  My fat ass needed a wheel chair to get up outta there!!!
