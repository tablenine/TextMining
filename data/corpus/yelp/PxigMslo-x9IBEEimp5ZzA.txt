Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
My pick for best overall restaurant in Atlanta. Not as elegant as Bachanalia (or as pricey) but the food is comparable. I've eaten here on several occasions, as part of a group and on a date. You can show up in jeans and a nice shirt or you can wear a suit, and you'll feel comfortable either way. The crowd is a good mix, and its not so trendy that you can't bring your parents here. The menu is pretty eclectic, so everyone should be able to find something they'll like. The only negative thing I can say about the place is that I really don't care for the eggplant fries, but that's just my personal opinion. Give Rathbun's a try, you won't be disappointed.
