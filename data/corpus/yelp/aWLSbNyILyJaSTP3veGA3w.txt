Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Absolutely fabulous! Yum yum!. . I've gotta give it to them! Very good ice cream!. . My fam and I decided to get the malt milkshake ( vanilla ic, caramel and choc swirls, malt balls), coffee toffee and choc dipped ic sandwiches (This has gotta be the best thing here! The actual sandwich part have the texture or are parisian macaroons!), espresso sundae (double shot espresso, hazelnut, vanilla ic), and a pint of green tea ic to go! . . The milkshake was a bit too sweet and not as malty as I would like. Didn't get to try the espresso sundae but heard it was delish, the coffee ic sandwich was ok, but the choc dipped ic sandwich was the best! Ohhh yummmy! I just love parisian macaroons!. . The place had a whole assortment of goodies, including ice cream bars (gonna get the cookies &amp; cream bar next or the strawberry shortcake one), ice cream drumsticks, cookies, a blue velvet cake (blueberries in it and not like the red velvet), and lots more!. . They even serve sandwiches, salads, smoothies, and coffee too! They got the works, and everything is "homemade", as informed by the Cashier with an accent. . . I have to admit that I've had better ice cream before from Mitchell's, but Milk would be among the top 10. I would def be back here again soon!
