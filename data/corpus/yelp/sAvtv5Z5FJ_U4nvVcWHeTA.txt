I had the Sesame Chicken, and though it wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing either. I did enjoy the brown rice and the broccoli that were paired with the mock chicken. We also had the steamed dumplings as well, which were decent, though I'm sure they would have been easier to eat with chopsticks.. . Others at the table seemed to enjoy their food better. I did have the pom lemonade, which was pretty nice though.
