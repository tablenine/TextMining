Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
It's been a while since I've been here but I thought I'd write about it anyway because I miss it so much.  I just haven't had a chance to drive out there lately.. . I absolutely love the food here.  I order prime rib almost everywhere I go that has it on the menu and nothing tops Lawry's.  I drive up La Cienega from the 10 and I love the location because it seems it's located far enough south that the traffic is not so bad, but far enough north where the buildings sorrrounding it seem less ominous.  I love how the prime rib is served right off the cart.  Just talking about it right now is making my mouth water.  Don't be surprised if you catch me there sometime soon.  I'll be the guy in the corner with 5 empty prime rib carts sitting next to my table.
