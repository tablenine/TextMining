I am addicted. I can't even lie. If I'm not here every week I don't know what to do. . . The Medianoche is my favorite sandwich and the potato balls are a must. . . Desserts! Let me pick a few: fruit tarts, any of the cheesecakes rock, the cupcakes are amazing! Those are my top desserts. . . the prices are too cheap for the quality of the food. I just Praise God for that! Because they could surely charge more. For a small meal: sandwich, dessert and a shake I probably spend...9 bucks.
