Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
Oh where to go for a down and dirty breakfast in the ATL before spending a day in L5P? Why, the Majestic of course. Maggi Y. covered most of the bases, especially the rudeness of the wait staff, which borders on comically annoying. I liked the fact that this joint is a people watching gold mine. If you like observing every facet of human nature in one small and narrow space, then the Majestic is your place. The food was decent, and I enjoyed re-discovering that grits taste exactly the same as I remember them when I was living in Georgia - Gritty.
