Why I love Canter's part 1:. . I had an interesting conversation with a retired bra manufacturer that I can't exactly remember because I was drunk and it was in the wee hours of the morning.  I only remember the way he walked.  Well, not so much walked as slowly shuffled.  I ate a sandwich and he talked about the glory days of underwear.  It was magical. . . Why I love Canter's part 2:. . The waitresses don't mess around.  They can even be described as bitchy, but in a charming sort of way.. . Why I love Canter's part 3:. . I had 3 roommates when I lived in LA and we were a diverse group.  Canter's pleased a Gentile, a Jew, a Korean, and a Filipino.  Come on, that's pretty good.  . . Why I love Canter's part 4:. . Waking up the next morning to find a pink bakery box of goodies in the kitchen that I forgot I purchased the night before.  . . Why I love Canter's part 5:. . Open 24 hours.  It looks used and lived in, like Vegas during the day.  That is part of the charm.
