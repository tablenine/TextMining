Went here with a $50 groupon and still ended up paying an additional $37.00 for sub-standard mediocre italian fare.  We started out with the calamari crostini which was soggy, rubbery calamari over bread, not good at all.  The bread at table was borning and nothing special also. I then orderd the parma proscuitto thinking it would be delicious, thin, light and salty like they do it in Parma Italy.  Essentially what came out was thin-deli cut ham, did not even taste like proscuitto, very disappointed.  We both took one small bite and did not even finsih it. My boyfriend had the risotto special with italian sausage and gorgonzola, the risotto was undercooked and the sausage uninspiring.  I had the margherita pizza which was pretty good.  This place would be better off just serving pizza and wine. , Pretty overpriced for not so good food too. SO many way better Italian places in this city,  nameley, La Scarola, Topo Gigio and Via Carducci. I will not be back to Gioco ever.
