Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
Aside from the fact that I was completely geographically disoriented, and resentful of the fact that I (and if I could, I would italicize that "I") had not even HEARD of Wurstküche, I had an excellent meal. I tried a bite of the rabbit sausage option but ordered and devoured the Austin Blues, which was a 6 on my very tolerant spicy scale. But for me, the colloquial crowning glory of this popular, hipster-leaking restaurant, was the Belgian beer selection. They have a tap you would not believe, the BEST in town. It goes way beyond Chimay and Duvel (though of course they have those too, though only bottled). It's missing a star for the clientele. I was assigned to find a table while friend waited in long line at counter. There was nowhere to sit and I almost got in a fistfight battling for an opening table. I lost said fight and I stood, until my friend arrived, when he calmly sat down immediately after arriving with our food at a table hawk-eye me had missed.
