Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
Tried to go there today at 3pm.  They were open and there were people eating at tables, but I'll be damed if I could find a person who actually worked there.  I waited at the hostess stand for awhile...walked into the dining area.  Nothing.  Tried to make eye contact with a server to let him know I was waiting for a table, but he scurried to the back before I could catch his gaze.  So, I gave up and left.  I just moved to the area and live right next door and have been wanting to try Crust for the last few months.  Not sure what the deal is, but I really, really hate to walk into a restaurant and have to stand around like a jackass waiting for somebody to tell me where to sit.  It's a terrible way to run a business.  Letting people walk out of your restaurant because no one was there to greet them...that's pretty lame.  I hear the food is really good, however, so I may try to go back one day.  Just not anytime soon.
