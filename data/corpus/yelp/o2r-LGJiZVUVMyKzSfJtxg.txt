Its amazing what this food truck has started...an entire mobile food scene across the country!!  Food truck nation!  I first tried Kogi after reading about it online last December.  I remember going Lil Tokyo on a Sat night and there was NO line at all!!  This was way before they got uber popular I guess.  I tried one of each of the kalbi, pork and chicken tacos.  Thought they were amazing!  Loved the saucy salad mix.  After that I've been to Kogi a dozen times, many times had to wait in a long line, boo.  I've noticed that some days they're not as good.  I think it was so good the 1st time because the original chef was in the truck making the tacos.  Now that they have like 3 or 4 trucks, the chef making the tacos may not be as good as the original guy.  Also tried to kalbi and kimchi quesadilla (they dont serve this all the time though), good stuff.
