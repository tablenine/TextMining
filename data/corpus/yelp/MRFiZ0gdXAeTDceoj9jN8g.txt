Restaurant: Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery
Category: Restaurants
Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery is my go-to place for lunch and dinner with one of my friends. . . The space is large, where upon entering, the maitre'd asks you if you want to sit on the restaurant side or the bar side. If you sit on the restaurant side, you can see the brewery. If you sit on the bar side, you get to watch the sports games. Upstairs is a private area for events and apparently over the summer they have rooftop seating.. . I order the same thing over and over when I come here: the mahi sandwich. It's just so good! (Tempura-battered or grilled Mahi topped with pickled cucumbers, lettuce and remoulade on a brioche bun). I tend to eat it with a side of onion rings (add a $1). The onion rings are so big they ought to come on a plate with a choking hazard sticker.. . My only complaint about the sandwich is that it comes on too small of a plate, so I'm fighting to make sure the remoulade drips onto the plate.. . The service is hit or miss - especially during the lunch hour. If you come during lunch make sure you 1) come early 2) ask for the check immediately after ordering.. . No comments on the beer because I don't drink beer.
