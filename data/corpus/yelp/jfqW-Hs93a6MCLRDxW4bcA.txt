Came here for my boyfriend's birthday on Friday. I was looking for somewhere on the romantic side but I also wanted it to be unique.. . I definitely found it here. I don't know how I have been in LA for almost a decade and I have never been here. The view was very cool. It was a hazy night because it has been really hot out lately but there was still a view to be had. I would love to go back on a crystal clear "winter" night. . . The service was great. Very attentive. We ordered the Short Rib and the Cracked Pepper Filet Mignon. Both VERY good. . . The reason they only get $ stars is because they brought out a B-DAY dessert for my boyfriend which was so nice!...but we had to pay for it. . All desserts are $10 there.. . I would definitely go there again. Especially if I had a large group of non-angelenos, Which there were a lot of since it was USC's graduation day.
