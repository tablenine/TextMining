I love the pancakes here and the outdoor seating. When the time came for us to pay our check we asked to split up our food three ways. The waitress informed us that she wasn't able to do that unless we calculated out the amount that should go on each card including the tax. When we asked what the tax would be she said she had no idea. Needless to say we had to whip our our cell phone calculators and figure out or own bill.. . Math and a lazy waitress wrecked my meal.
