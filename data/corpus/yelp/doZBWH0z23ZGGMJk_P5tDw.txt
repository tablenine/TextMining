The spicy wontons is beast. . But according to my boyfriend there's other places that do it better and for a lot less. I'm not from the area and the places that I have been to don't make it as good as this place. The place is a little cramped and the prices are little high. I thought the xiao long baos would be bigger and like how Andre L. mentioned the special soup dumplings weren't even that special.
