Great portions and good food.  I had the Angus Flank Steak sandwich with a Romaine Hearts salad.  The salad was god and had just enough dressing.  The sandwich is very simple: lightly toasted ciabatta bread, red peppers, aioli sauce (garlic mayo), and the meat... lots of it!  I went for the lemonade and didn't like it - too sour for my taste.  It was very crowded for a late lunch crowd (after 12:45) and the indoor tables were all wobbly.  They had bus boys that were very attentive though.. . Overall a good place to go if you're in the mood for a big salad or a good sandwich.
