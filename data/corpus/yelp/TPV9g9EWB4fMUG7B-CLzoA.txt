Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The pork dumplings at DTF are smaller than the ones at Joe's Shanghai in NY, but they don't taste as lardy.  And mixed with the vinegar and slices of ginger, they're quite good.  I could have eaten twenty of them on my own, but of course I didn't.  It's all about portion control, isn't it?. . We made the mistake of ordering the vegetable and pork dumplings; we did so without realizing 1) they're not soup dumplings and 2) they don't taste good.. . The pork and chicken fried rice were delicious, and both were far better than the shrimp fried rice.  Keep in mind though: for $6.75/plate, you don't get much food.. . The string beans and pork buns were also good. . . Overall, the restaurant was clean and the food was enjoyable.  And though the prices are a tad on the higher end for what you get, I'd say it's worth the drive out to Arcadia.
