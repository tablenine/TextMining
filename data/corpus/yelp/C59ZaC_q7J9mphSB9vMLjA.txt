I have never had a bad meal nor a bad dessert from Cafe Sel Marie. And the service is always great. I've gone in alone, as a pair, and with eight other people and every time I am helped by friendly and courteous people.. I have to go for brunch at  least once a month, if not three or four times, and I will generally have the brioche french toast with berries and highly recommend it to anyone else.  . I also enjoy that their menu changes to reflect the season. The gingerbread griddlecakes that made an appearance over the Christmas season were fantastic. Pairing them with spiked apple cider made the experience complete.. Enjoy the toasty indoors in the winter, and then sit out on the patio in the summer, sometimes you even get to watch performances in the square while enjoying your meal.
