Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Disclaimer:  I'm not a vegetarian, nor a vegan.  So I'm comparing this place to all restaurants and not just vegan.. . I've eaten here a couple times when my officemate took me there for lunch.  The fake meats taste disgusting, in the tacos and a certain burger.  The salad tastes just like any other salad but the dressing isn't as good.  And that's all you get... for like $10-15.  I understand the prices being a bit higher because of your specialized food, but I think they charge the higher prices just because they want to.  Conclusion: I'm not a fan.  I've had other vegetarian meals that were better for half the price.  I'm also not that big on sweet-potato fries which I guess is one of their favorite menu items.
