This is GREAT! Okay. . A lot of people say they don't take credit cards, but they take credit cards now! Just not AMEX. . Make sure you try the lobster. It's just as good as the Boston Lobster I tried. They're HUGE. . The waiter asked us what size of lobster do we want, s, m, or L... . we asked, how big is the small? . The waiter: 4 lbs. . We were like O_O. We have left over, cuz we order 5 dishes for 3 people. . . I gave them four because I am a fan, but I think they can do better on the Curry Crab. . . Also, even though the restaurant is new, the floor is not very clean. . . However, overall, all the food is fresh, came out pretty fast too. . . We had (in order of yummy level, in my opinion):. House Style Lobster (make sure you order the house style). Seafood Tofu Soup. Black Beans Clam. Garlic Dao Miu. Curry Crab (not marinated well enough in my opinion, or can be more spicy, but the sauce tastes really good with rice)
