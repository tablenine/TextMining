For those who are new to Indian food, this might be a good starter place.   I ordered a thali, which is served with Rice Pullao, Chapati (whole wheat flat bread), Raita (cucumber yogurt sauce), Indian pickle and a Papadam (crispy lentil cracker).  I ordered the Punjabi (one meat, one veggie) and got the mini eggplant and chicken tikka.  The eggplant had a mildly intriguing flavor, but the chicken tikka was bland and too sweet.  They were out of garlic naan, so we had the plain naan.  It didn't come out hot &amp; fresh out of the oven like I've had at most places.. . Service was a bit odd, but fairly attentive.  I wouldn't mind going back, but if I have a choice, I'll head to somewhere that hasn't been so Americanized (like Madras Chettinaad).
