This place was very good.  I came here on my first night in Los Angeles hanging with the mighty Sean and Sara.  I exclaimed "lets start this party right, pitchers of margaritas galore!".  The restaurant was beautiful and the food was excellent!  I had the blue crab and shrimp burritos with muchos margaritas!  If I am ever in LA again, I will make a trek to Studio City just to go here.
