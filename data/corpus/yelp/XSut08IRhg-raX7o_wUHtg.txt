During the week, Frasca gets 4-4.5 stars...the Wrightwood Salad is awesome!  The pizza and pasta stands out as well.  However, last Saturday, the food came out at random times, all 3 of us getting items 10 minutes apart.  That didn't matter so much but the pizza was cold and soggy and the rest of the food wasn't as good as it usually is during the week.  I think they do an outstanding job, but maybe can't handle the big crowds as much.  I'll be back during the week!
