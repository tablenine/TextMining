Stone Soup is DELISH! Â Be advised that weekdays you should order at the COUNTER, and weekends they have servers/full table service staff. Perhaps that is some of the confusion about service. . . I have never been disappointed here. The food is great, Grits are yum, the avocado sandwich is great. Count yourself lucky if you are there for Hungarian Mushroom Soup day.
