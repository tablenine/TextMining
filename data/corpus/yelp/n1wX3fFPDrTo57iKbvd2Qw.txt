Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
I moved into my current apartment simply because it's within walking distance of this restaurant - can you tell I love Versailles?. . I've been here upwards of 50 times in the past 2 years, I even went here for my 22nd Birthday dinner before going out to WeHo.. . Service is ridiculously fast, I've never received my food faster at any other restaurant. Pickup orders are just as fast too but BE WARNED your car WILL reek of the garlicky delicious goodness inside your plastic take-out bag and it will last for days AT LEAST!. . $5 Mojitos with real sugar cane and the Sangria is a must-try.. . I always get the number 7a Bistec de Pollo (chicken breast filet smothered in garlic butter sauce and onions). The plantains are a hit or miss - sometimes they're dry and overcooked and other times they're nice and smashy and wet just the way I like 'em!. . Above all else though I LOVE THE BLACK BEANS I dreeeeeam about these black beans. If you want to switch it up every now and then, ask to have your beans and rice cooked together (it's called "Moros y Christianos"). . EDIT: To make this even more loved by me, I got to hang out with Kolbe and Tim C. and meet Wes, Kevin F., Mike F. and Soy here this week!
