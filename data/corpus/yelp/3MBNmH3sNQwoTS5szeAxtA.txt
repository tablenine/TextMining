Decent roof deck spot. Lots of young professionals hanging out. The Construction Ale (differs weekly; it's Apricot flavored this week) was really good and not as sweet as you'd expect.. . Con: It was really hot yesterday and without a whole lot of shade it was kinda unbearable. There's the works for a ceiling fan under the tent, but no fan blades. Get that fixed and it would have been perfect!. . Pros: You can smoke on the deck. The Construction Ale is only $3.00!
