Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
I love Birds, but I'm a little biased. My good friend works there. But I think I'd love it anyway. It's a really nice atmosphere.. good vibes. During the day it's a nice bar to get wings and watch the game or just people watch. At night, it's a dark red vibe, and a fun place to be. It's lively, and Mary the owner is fun to watch. She's a Diane Lane type, exactly what I aspire to be when I'm older. She's always hula-hooping up top, and passes around random props. It's just fun. I've seen a few celebs there, which I always love.. but there's more to it. The food is awesome too. Honestly, the shrimp caesar salad is the best salad I've ever had. It's perfect. It's my favorite. The chicken pot pie is pretty good.. wings are awesome, very saucy. My b/f recommends the mexican wrap (but I think it's a little bland). They have a great variety of sauces, like garlic artichoke which is awesome. The onion rings come stacked on a wooden stick, which you order by the foot or maybe half a foot. I LOVE the split pea soup. The chicken tortilla soup is good too. It's reasonably priced... not cheap, but not too pricey. I really love this place, and even when my friend who works there moves in April, I will continue to love it.
