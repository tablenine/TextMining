Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
The outside of this restaurant gives no indication of what it's like inside. On the outside, you'll see a covered-up window and a pair of dark, heavy doors. It's hard to tell that it's even a restaurant. But as soon as you open those doors, you'll walk into a boisterous atmosphere. Furaibo is usually filled with a young crowd. Tables are placed close to each other that it makes to place seem even more crowded. It's fun to eat here, and the food is pretty good and reasonably priced. . . Their menu is extensive and since nothing is highlighted, it can be hard to pick out good tapas. Personally, I like their bacon and spinach, asparagus butter, enoki &amp; scallops, chicken and rice. I heard so many good things about their chicken wings, but I didn't think they were that great. Their hanpen cheese and seabass are also supposed to be good, but it was just ok to me.. . Last time I came, we sat in a corner of a room in the back, and our waiter forgot about our existence. We had to flag him down multiple times, to refill our water, to bring us our check. In general, service isn't so great. :-(
