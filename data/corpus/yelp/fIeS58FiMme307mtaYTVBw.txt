Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Yaay, this place was on Man vs. Food. If it's been on TV, it must be good, right? NOT!. . If you're looking for a place to eat ramen in Little Tokyo, opt for Mr. Ramen or Daikokuya instead. The ramen here is tasteless, there's little meat, and the service is bad. My fiance and I've come here a few times now, and the last time we came would be our very last. We each ordered a bowl of ramen, I got my ramen and finished it, and my fiance's?? Well, it never came, and the servers never showed up to check to see if we both got our food. Bad food, bad service.
