I wrote a long review - not a good experience at all.  I removed the detailed review as the manager called me today. Major damage repair.  I left a comment card with the manager - which I do when things go very bad and when they go great - if comment cards are offered.  . . I received a call from one of the managers today - he listened and I believe he was interested in the feedback.  . . My advice here - if your experience begins to go south - don't wait until the meal is over - let a manager know at the time if the waiter fails to correct the situation either through disappearing or indifference.
