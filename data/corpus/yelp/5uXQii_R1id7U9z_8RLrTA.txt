I really doubt I need to review this fab cafe...it seems to have plenty of reviews, but now it has one more.. . I heart this place for several reasons:. . Great food, I mean that.  They aren't breaking new ground in crazy creative ways ( although there is some rad stuff I have never seen else where ).  But they get it done right.  Some places have a hard time doing simple eggs and meat.  Blu Jam is not one of those joints.  They don't drown food in oils and butter as far as I can tell, and are great at modifying food if you ask.  The staff is friendly; I get English Breaky Tea with milk and honey...they have done went and learnt this, I like simple stuff like that. The customers seem cool and laid back.  If it is good enough for Chuck Liddel ( he sat next to me this morning ) then it is good enough for you!. . I only have one minor grip, and it is minor...tea pot ( although bottomless ) is 3.95.  I know it sounds silly but I enjoy my caffeine to be inexpensive.  Be aware that like any rad joint, it can get VERY busy on the weekends, so if you want to get grub on Saturday or Sunday go, but plan on waiting a short while before getting tasty food in your belly!  . . Soooo, go to Blu Jam, lock your bike up outside and read a book while Chuck Liddel and his Mohawk eat next to you!
