i LOVE sinbala! ive never been a huge fan of taiwanese food but i really enjoy coming here for their sausage rice plate! its well portioned and cheap! and who doesnt love cheap and delicious food? i also love ordering their sticky brown rice and spicy wontons.. i dont think i ever go without ordering those three dishes heh.. i also love getting shaved ice for dessert! or if im not feeling shaved ice.. i can walk across the parking lot and grab some yogurtland!!. . the only thing thats annoying about this place is the wait.. youve gotta come early for dinner or youll be waiting a while.. good thing is that their food comes out pretty quickly.. i also find it really odd that they have sausage and chocolate on their menu.. i have yet to try something like that..
