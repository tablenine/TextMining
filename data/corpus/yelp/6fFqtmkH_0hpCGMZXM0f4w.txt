Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I personally am not a huge fan of Italian food but my boyfriend is. We found this location on Yelp and decided to give it a try. . . The location is very romantic with the wine bar, pastry desserts and candlelit dinning. . . On different occasions my boyfriend and I have sat both inside and out. Not only is the staff incredibly welcoming (whom we strike up friendly conversation with) and professional but so are the people that come here. . . As I mentioned before I am not a fan of Italian food but their . 1.) "Seafood Butter Pasta" is excellent. Drools! . 2.) Calamari Appetizer- I would also recommend because it's fresh and unlike some places you don't find awkward clumps.. .  I truly feel their food is reasonably priced for the excellent quality and service. . . Thanks for a great dinning experience Ugo you are defiantly one of our favorite dinning spots in Culver City.
