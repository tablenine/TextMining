Everything is sooooo GOOOOD!  I had the crossant ham and cheese. My ultimate favorite is the cheese rolls. But their creme brulee, red velvet cup cake, potato balls are super YUM.  Not to mention they make all the desert  so pretty.  Their tiramisu was really good and really pretty. I have not been disappointment by anything they make.
