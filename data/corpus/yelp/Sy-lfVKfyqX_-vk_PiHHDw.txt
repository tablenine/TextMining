After our unsatisfying meal at DTF, we went around the corner to Sinbala. Oh snack heaven! An extensive list of snack items, and most of them only a few dollars. . . Their specialty is the Sinbala sausage. It certainly wasn't what we expected. Preserved sausage sliced into pieces. Our order was with ground garlic. So so good. The raw garlic packed a powerful punch and complemented nicely with the sweetness of the sausage. (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). . The Taiwanese glutinous rice was like the ones found at dim sum places. Rice, duck egg, sausage and peanut. Pretty good. Didn't care for the sauce though. (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). . The chicken nuggets were awesome! Hot and crispy! Delicious little bites! (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). . And the finale, what almost every table ordered, the shaved ice! Big pile of shaved ice topped with 5 toppings of choice. We got the grass jelly, coconut jelly, red bean, green bean and condensed milk. So refreshing and filling!! (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). . Awesome place! Should've came here for lunch instead. haha =P
