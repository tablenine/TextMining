better to come in a small group or you'll be waiting awhile (singletons have it easy). better bring something cold to drink while you wait since it feels like a 100 deg inside. after sampling santouka, santa, katana ya, etc.. the broth here does stand out -- very rich pork flavor since it's shoyu tonkatsu. and the pork slices are huge and tasty (large fat stripe). also onion, sprouts, and bamboo (glad they don't have the canned flavor). it was worth the wait!
