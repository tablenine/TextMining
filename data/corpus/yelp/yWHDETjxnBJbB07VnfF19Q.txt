Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Din Tai Fung is a very famous dumpling house.  People drive from everywhere to come to this place.  You can always expect a wait here.  The dumplings are not the best in the world.  They are fresh and good but not worth the price.  It's a great place to go to if you are treating guest who's heard of the name and has not been here yet.  . . Their red bean paste dumplings are really good.  I wouldn't really recommend any of the food though.  Nothing special about their other dishes.
