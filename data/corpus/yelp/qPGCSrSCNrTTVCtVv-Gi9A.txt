Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
This place is not good and the menu is oddly limited with very few options if you want eggs for breakfast. . . I went with the French toast which looked appetizing as it came with Nutella and bananas. I found it to be pretty average. The French toast was chewy, not fluffy at all. I sampled some of the omelet that my companion ordered and it was really overcooked. Oh, and the Bloody Marys that everyone is raving about? First off, they're made with soju not vodka. This wouldn't be a problem if I could taste any alcohol in it at all. It was so watered down that it might as well have been tomato juice. . . I have no complaints about the service -- that was great -- but the food was universally bad. Somewhat ironically, I recommend that you pass on Taste.
