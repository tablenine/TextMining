I would swim in their waffle batter.  I've never tasted a waffle that has even come CLOSE to being as delicious as theirs.  I even tried a recipe at home that I thought would hit the spot, but it's probably impossible.. . The chicken is deliciously fried on the outside, and wonderfully juicy within.  My go to meal is Scoe's 1/4 chicken and 2 waffles.  I always share it with my bestie because we each get a piece of meat and a waffle.  Yum.  . . When I go with my boyfriend, we share Herb's special, (1/2 chicken and 2 waffles), it's about 4 pieces of meat and it makes up for his big appetite.. . The last time I went, my waffle was extra crispy, and my diet coke was flat, but I easily brushed that aside because I only had that happen to me once out of the 4 times I've been.
