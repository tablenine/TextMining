We went for lunch instead of dinner on Chinese New Year and there was no wait!  We had the lobster special--it was as good as all the reviews say.  The small order (4 lbs) was perfect for 4 people.  The next best dish was the Bo Luc Lac steak--tender and flavorful.  . . Also ordered the Basil fish (good),  chicken lettuce wraps (not worth ordering).   . . Service was fast and very attentive. . . ENJOY!
