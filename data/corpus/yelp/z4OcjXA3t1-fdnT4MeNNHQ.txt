Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
What can I say, I'm a sucker for anything that's pretty and the Alcove is quite pretty.  I love the outside seating area at night with the twinkling lights and buzz of conversation.  Everyone looks happy to be here and that puts a smile on my face.  . . The sweet array of desserts also puts a smile on a face, and probably some cavities in my teeth.  My eyes must get big as I "ooh" and "ahh" over the plump cupcakes with swirls of mouth watering frosting, the giant slices of decadent cake, and all the other baked goodies stashed behind the glass counter.  My only complaint is that none of the treats are labelled.  I end up having to point out various items, asking the cashier, "What's this?  What's that?" before I can decide upon my order.  I'm sure this routine is greatly appreciated by the crowd behind me as I try not to step on their toes as I move backwards through the line hunting for my snack.. . This is a great place for a date or to hang out with friends.  Just  be prepared to wait, as it is always busy.
