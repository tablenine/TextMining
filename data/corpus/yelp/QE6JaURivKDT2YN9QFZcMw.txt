Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
This place was on my friend Jason's list of places to eat for dinner and being on Melrose Avenue, this was the first place that came to mind. Met up there with our friend Dean and the place is quite nice... has that atmosphere for taking a person out on a romantic like dinner date if one were to do that. The service was good and overall friendly; no problems there. I didn't like the limited menu though. And also, its a bit expensive.. . The calamari appetizer was good choice to start off with.. . A simplified back story to why I ordered what I ordered: I have this quest with a friend to find the best burger which has always seemed impossible. So seeing their kobe beef cheese burger, I decided to order that and see how good it was. Well I really should have stuck with my initial choice and order something new that I haven't tried, but I ordered that instead and was just disappointed. For a cheese burger, it really had no cheese or even a hint of cheese taste embedded between the bun and the meat. I've had kobe beef burgers else where, but this particular burger was really dry. The sauce and/or seasoning they use for it seemed to dissipate within my mouth as soon as it touched my tongue leaving it utterly tasteless and a real drag to chew on till consumption. NOT worth the price of the meal at all. . . The one good thing about my meal, the fries! Absolutely good. I just wish I had the stomach to eat more of the fries than I did. While I didn't try Jason's meal I did take a bite from Dean's mushroom mac &amp; cheese appetizer he ordered for his meal and it was bland and again on the dry side like my meal. Don't know if I would come back here again, but at least as always I had wonderful company with good friends so despite the lack of good food, I still had fun time.
