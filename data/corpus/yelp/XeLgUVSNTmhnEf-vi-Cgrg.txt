Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Remember in high school, when one of the people in your group started hating someone? You all pretty much turned on that person and their life became an endless procession of swirlies, scrawled locker insults and shitty comments whispered in the hallway. . . I think the same thing has happened with Tito's. It got so much hype that it became uncool, and therefore it's now cool to hate it. All the "in" folks (we'll refer to them as the "Tito's Bullies" from now on) are turning on it, and comparing it to laughable items like Jack-in-the-Box tacos. . . Riiiight. If a restaurant could be picked up, stuffed in a toilet and flushed, my guess is they'd do it.. . If you haven't gleaned it by now, I'm somewhat in disagreement. There are days--let's call them "Tito's Days"--when nothing less but their tacos will do. I don't wait in line for anything--not even to get into Hyde. But I dutifully queue up for Tito's with no hesitation. When my brother is in town, he insists on going there no matter how much it screws with his schedule.. . There's something immensely satisfying about their tacos, so much so that I get three of them with meat and cheese only and flat out go to town. We're talking head down, no talking, food intercourse time. . . The salsa that comes with it is so-so and the chips are okay, but the tacos are the main attraction here. If you want to hammer Tito's, then go after their watery guacamole. Even I, The Staunch Defender of Beseiged Taco Joints Everywhere, won't touch that runny green stuff. . . So take the silly taunts of the Tito's Bullies with a shaker full of salt. Maybe it's not cool to eat there, but it sure is good.
