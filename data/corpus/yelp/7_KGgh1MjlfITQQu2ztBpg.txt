Whenever we hit the streets of so-cal, we are always looking for Ramen. Since we were DT, we yelped and found this little place with so many raving reviews. So we thought, 'why not trust these fellow yelpers?' . . The restaurant is really small, but that is how most famous Ramen places are. We got there around noon and probably waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. Not bad..... . . When ordering, there are 3 steps: . . 1: Pick your soup. There are 3 flavors - Miso, Soy and Salt . (both bf and I got Miso) . 2: Pick your spicy level. They also have the challenge in which I think . I will try next time!!! I got #3 and the bf got #4. After eating #3, I will . migrate a little further to test what I can handle. . 3. Pick extra toppings if desired (average pricing) . . The Ramen itself comes with vegetables and some meat already so don't overload yourself if you don't need to. Maybe an extra piece of meat won't hurt?? That's what we did!! We ordered extra meat and an egg. You gotta have that egg when eating Ramen. . . We both enjoyed our bowls of hot Ramen and were satisfied. It's not our favorite, but we will be back so I can try the specials. If you're not into spicy stuff especially in Ramen, then this isn't for you. But if you want something different and be exposed to what Ramen has to offer, I say-give it a try. . . I want my picture on that wall!!!!
