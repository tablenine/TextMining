The best aspects of this place would be, in my opinion, the great staffing and their wine selection.. . The staff was just fun and professional. Very attentive and friendly to their customers.  The food was decent as I had the Entrana (steak). We had their panqueque's platano (crepes with banana) for dessert and this was a great choice.  Went on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed... good job!
