Awesome food.  We visit the Logan Square area from the south burbs and happened to see an article this place. Yes, it lived up to the hype. . Caution, this is a very casual type place. No fancy tables, no fancy valet crap, no fancy silver ware, just a couple of stools and a counter. But heck the owners are so friendly and the food is worth the trip. . Try the Lechon and the plantains. I may pass on the bistec next time; I like the old fashion Midwest beef. Also, try a pop from Cuba, interesting. So glad we did not go to Kuma's.
