Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
After passing by Joy Yee's every time I came to Chinatown and saying, "I want to go to there!", I finally went.  Of course, I brought along my husband and our two fine grubs.  For the grubs, we ordered the crab and shrimp egg rolls, which they enjoyed.  I had this particular egg roll at a different restaurant, and it was funky tasting, but Joy's egg rolls were super fresh and hot, and very tasty.  What I thought was sweet and sour sauce accompanying them, was actually a sweet and spicy sauce, but it was good.. The hubs ordered the garlic shrimp, which he liked, but was a little disappointed in.  The shrimp was a bit scarce, and the vegetables that came with it consisted of 60% onion, 40% mix of baby corn, celery, and other bits and bobs.. I ordered the curry chicken with baked coconut and rice, which I enjoyed.  It was served in a hollowed out coconut, and had a creamy sauce, spiced just right.  They weren't stingy with the chicken, either.  The rice that came on the side was pretty heavily seasoned, almost too much so, but I liked it nonetheless.  I must have, as there was no chicken or rice left for me to take home.  . I loved that the menu had a picture of everything on it--love that!  It really helps.  I was sad when I asked the waitress if they had anything like bim bim bap, and she said no :(  I will definitely be coming back here and trying new things!  . We also ordered a peach strawberry smoothie, which was really good!  It's nice getting a smoothie that tastes like fresh fruit rather than artificial ingredients.  . Last but not least, do not visit their bathroom!  Hubs took the kids, and was dismayed at the level of cleanliness.
