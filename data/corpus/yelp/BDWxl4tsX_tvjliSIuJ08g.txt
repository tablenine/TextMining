This place has all of my favorite things: cheap food (sammy under $3??), "healthy" food (it has veggies on it, right?), and hot Pho. I stuck with the tofu bahn mi and a a bowl of Pho for dinner. For $6 you can't beat that deal. I was over stuffed and unable to finish my meal. . . Apparently if you have kids, this is a family friendly establishment. We saw lots of kids running around the place but they were quickly drawn to the big screen in the corner showing a kid-friendly channel. So if you have munchkins, bring them over and enjoy a delicious dinner while they watch the tube.
