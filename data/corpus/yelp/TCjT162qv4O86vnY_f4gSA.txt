Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Not a fan. We only settled here after searching all night for a sushi restaurant open on Sundays - who knew it'd be such a challenge! The last thing you wanna do on a rainy Sunday when you're starving is search for parking and an ATM on top of good sushi. Unfortunately Hide Sushi made us do all that... not appreciated!. . We waited quite a while since everyone else in our boat also landed here. When we finally got seated, we were presented with bland, boring menus that had nothing like what we were hoping for. Instead of creative fun yummy rolls, we got the basic tasteless ones and their fatty tuna and scallion roll ran out! so we finally settled on 2 simple rolls, nigiri, and chicken teriyaki. By the time the food finally came out, I was so hungry I could have eaten that entire thing. I gobbled up my 8 pieces of nigiri super quick only to be left craving more food. When we finished I just wanted to get out of there and hit up an In-n-Out or something to really hit the spot.. . I was disappointed and felt that there are way better sushi places in LA. Lesson learned: never go on a sushi-hunt on a rainy Sunday!
