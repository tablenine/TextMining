This place reminds me Urth Cafe.  Love the dessert and cake there!!! We ordered a piece of banana cream cake, which is fantastic.  The banana custard is not too sweet and the cake is moist.  We also got some pumpkin cheesecake, which is pretty good too.  . The service is good.  The person who took our order is very helpful and give us some honest advice (such as the pumpkin spice cake is his favorite but at 9 pm, it may be a bit dry....). Anyway, it's a place I will definitely go back.
