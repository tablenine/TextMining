If what my friend told me is true, this is the original Moe's, before one of the managing partners split off, basically stole the business model and opened a competing chain that has now gone semi-national (mostly in college towns) while Willy's remains local to the ATL region alone.. . So, let's get down to business. It is similar to the Chipotle dining experience, but with a tofu option, a different variety of toppings, and a salsa bar.  They also have fresh lemonade. I really appreciated the option to put cilantro on my burrito. Furthermore, they had pickled and fresh jalapenos. A nice touch. They have a pico de gallo style salsa and a corn salsa, sliced red peppers and a few other unique options.. . I had the veggie burrito. I got fajita veggies, red peppers, cheese, pickled jalapenos, corn salsa, cilantro, guacamole and maybe that's it... Served with chips on the side, rather than at an extra cost.. . The burrito was yummy, but not anything particularly out of this world.  A nice alternative to Moe's or Chipotle.. . As far as this specific location goes, it was in a very nice looking neighborhood which was apparently celebrating it's pride parade sometime soon. Also, the patio is really, really large and I could see this being a very fun place to gather in warmer weather.  Inside seating is somewhat cramped.
