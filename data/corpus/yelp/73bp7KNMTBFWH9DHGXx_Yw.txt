CHIGGIN!!  Bird's the magic word baby!!. . You can really dig into this chicken.  Deeelicious.  Waay better than KFC and Popeyes.. . We came here during Christmas time on our xmas light tour.  Even thought it was somewhat late at night, this place was still packed.  . . We ordered:. -1/2 Chix prepared southern style, 2 Waffles: the waffles were greaaat!!  Tastes like the waffles are made with cinnamon and honey.  They are light and delicious.. . -1/2 Chix smothered with gravy &amp; onions, 2 waffles (We got the gravy &amp; onions on the side so we could dunk everything in it). . -Smothered Potatoes w/Gravy: these potatoes were the bomb!!  Sliced potatoes in gravy.  Tastes like country home cookin.. . -French Fries... these were good dunked in the gravy and onions.. . All this "stuffed" 5 people with food to spare.  We all split it and ended up paying about $8-10 per person.
