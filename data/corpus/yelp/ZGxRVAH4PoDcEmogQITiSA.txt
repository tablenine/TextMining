Yet again I find myself wishing I could provide half-star ratings but this place is closer to a 4 than a 3.5.  The reason I would move the rating lower is that it's a bit overpriced.  The food is good, it's really good.  But the special off-menu steak was not worth the $55 u didn't tell me it cost.  In their defense, it was good enough to warrant a $45 price tag.  If the steak had been seasoned perfectly (as opposed to certain bites having much more salt or pepper than others), then I probably wouldn't complain about the $10 difference.. . Mmm...steak.  mmm...pommes frites.. . It is a loud venue so try getting a spot in the back room...which might be a little quieter.  Friendly wait staff and good food.  I'm sure some of the other stuff on the menu is worth the price but just be careful when u start hearing about the off-menu specials.  They sound delicious, they are delicious, but they are a little overpriced.
