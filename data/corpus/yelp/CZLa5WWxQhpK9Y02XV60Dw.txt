Went here on the verge of deprivation from Korean BBQ. My first Korean spot in Atlanta. I was not happy. First off, isn't it supposed to be family size servings for at least for 2-3 people. $12.99 for a plate of bulgogi for one serving. And you had to at least order two meats and had to be two different meats. Rip off. Instead my friend got the bimbimbop (spelling?) and I had the tofu soup. You can't go wrong with the basics. It was ok, but I wouldn't go back. On to try the next one...
