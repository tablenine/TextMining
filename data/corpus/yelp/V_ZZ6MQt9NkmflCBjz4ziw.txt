This place is always SO GOOD.  When they first opened, it was difficult to get reservations at a decent time, but it seems like now you can make same day reservations no problem! Perhaps we're just lucky?  . . We started with crispy pork trotters and the charcuterie platter, which came with yummy little fried gnocco.  Delicious!  We the squid ink pasta with crab and a piece of uni on top.  The pasta is cold and quite refreshing!  For my secondi, I got the rabbit, which was good but totally didn't taste like the rabbit meat I've had before.  The meat was tender and came off the bone easily. I was quite full but still somehow managed to save room for the molton chocolate cake and their famous olive oil cakes and gelato!  . . Always a very satisfying meal at Mozza!  Both Osteria and Pizzeria are worth a trip!
