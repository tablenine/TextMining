My sister and I had a lovely lunch at Feast. The outdoor patio is fabulous on a nice day and the food was very good. We both had excellent sandwiches, and the salads looked good as well. I wish we had gone for breakfast because the pancakes of the day looked wonderful!! Good Service, Great Experience!
