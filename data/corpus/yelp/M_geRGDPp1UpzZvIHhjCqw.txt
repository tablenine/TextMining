Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
This place follows the over promise, under deliver philosophy.  It looks, eh, at least interesting from the outside, and I recall it being rather crowded on warm, summer afternoons...but clearly that's the margarita and oogle crowd.  We went on a cold, wintery evening looking for some good spicy mexican food to warm us up.  First of all, we had to wear our coats in the dining area...it was cold in there...most everyone else did too.  We ordered the tortilla soup, which was spicy, but wholly uniform, salty and uninteresting, the fried tilapia tacos which were bland and extremely boring, and worst of all the guacamole, which was a smashed up avacado, a little chopped tomato, and nothing else...bland doesn't begin to describe it.  Moe's is better...that's right, I said it, Moe's is better...AND half the price.  I'd give this place one star, but I reserve that for places with roach armies vying for power with the three-fingered, ass-scratching chef in the kitchen; and frankly, I didn't get a good look in the Zocalo kitchen.  The one redeeming quality was the margarita which was OK; oh, and the fact that they don't have to put meat in everything, so in theory lots of vegetarian options (but at the full-meat price); by that theory, a hamburger is also vegetarian option (mmmm, bread sandwich).  Unless it's 90+ degrees, and all you want is chips, salsa, margarita's and oogles on 10th, SKIP IT.
