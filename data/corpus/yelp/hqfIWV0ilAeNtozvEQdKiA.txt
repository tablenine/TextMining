smokedaddy...smokedaddy...I'm in LOVE. . . Great food, huge portions, and great outdoor seating. Â I've been here twice and sat outdoors in the front patio both times. Both times, I bemused at the fact that I was enjoying a live band...courtesy of the bar next door! Way to capitalize on neighborhood resources smokedaddy! It's like giving your customers the benefits of a live band without having to pay or hire one. . . I've had both the ribs and the salad. Usually, at rib places, the salad is okay at best, but the salad is GREAT at smokedaddy's. The ribs were also top quality and I like how they have 4 different sauces on the table for you to glop on your ribs. I'm giving it only 4 stars because: . . 1) there's only 1 veggie entree choice (1 salad, would have preferred at least another salad choice). 2) the loooong wait sucks. 3) they don't take reservations. 4) street parking only
