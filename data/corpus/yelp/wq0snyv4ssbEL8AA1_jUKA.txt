Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Ready for a heart attack?  I sure am.. . A literal fist sized portion of paper thin sliced pastrami is slopped between the halves of a deliciously chewy french roll.  Just the right amount of spices and oh so juicy!  You can add cheese if you please, or go w/ the standard mustard and pickles.  I'm not a fan of pickles, but EVERYONE raves about theirs.  Guess I'm missing out then, huh?  The chili cheese fries are pretty good too and It's such a large portion, you should probably share.. . They have patio seating which is nice during the summer, and a 50's diner vibe.  I think they're open pretty late, so expect a few drunkards sitting next to you.  . . I love this place, but I get heartburn for at least 2 days after eating here.  Bring your antacids, cuz your gonna need em!
