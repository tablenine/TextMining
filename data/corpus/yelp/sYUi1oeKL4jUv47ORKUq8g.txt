Wow...I had no idea places like this existed in downtown la.  First of all, I need to make a big deal about their excellent service, by far its one of the best I've ever experienced in pretentious LA.  I totally felt at ease and very welcomed.  . . My boyfriend and I tried the calamari, pizza bianco, and trenne pasta.  The calamari was crispy with large cuts of squid.  The thin crust pizza was yummy and flavorful.  I love ricotta and mozzarella.  The pasta, well, it was way too hard.  I later found out that they fry the pasta and oven it to give it that texture.  I guess the manager felt bad about it, and took that off our bill!  There are so many other things I want to try on their menu.  I will definitely be coming back to sample their famous portobello fries.. . I also enjoyed their house pinot grigio.  My boyfriend got his usual crown and coke and oh my, they sure do liquor you up.  Overall I really enjoyed our dinner.  I thought the prices were very reasonable.  I also couldn't get enough of the high ceilings and very classy crown moldings.   Next time I am in the area, I want to drop by and try their pastries and macaroons at the adjacent market.
