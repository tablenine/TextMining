Great little restaurant, for great big breakfasts.... our waitress was quick to pick up on us staring at the ceilings and phones, to tell us the trivia behind their history.  I don't remember her name, but apparently she has people who will ONLY sit in her section when she goes... She's definitely right on top of every need.  Parking can be a bit tougher, but not bad if you're willing to wait a few minutes at the most.
