Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
If you are ever in the neighborhood of this place, you need to stop by and have a beer and a one of the best pastrami sandwich you will find in CA.  I have been to Langers, and I prefer this place.  I truly believe that every pastrami lover in CA have eaten at this place.  Pretty small place, so my recommendation is go on weeknight after say 8 pm and you will not have to worry about parking or seating.  Waitress that served me and my wife was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely go back on weeknight again.
