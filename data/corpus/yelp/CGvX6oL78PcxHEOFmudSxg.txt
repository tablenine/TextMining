Just got back from my first time here. Before you go here, make sure you have the following things covered:. . 1) Make sure you don't have any serious work to do after you eat this stuff.. 2) Buy the most comfy bed you can find, so you can sleep on it afterwards.. 3) Prepare to be amazed...and sluggish.. . I ordered the Oinkster Pastrami and their Fries. The sandwich was delicious and was neatly packed and full of flavor--house pastrami, carmelized onions, purple veggies, and garlic sauce! The fries are comparable, if not better, than In N Out french fries! They are bigger types of fries with similar crisp and a suble sweet flavor. I love this place, and the service was not bad, and staff was friendly!
