We went here on a Friday night and it was packed.  There were people waiting outside and in the restaurant.  We had to wait over half and hour for a table, and it was a bit uncomfortable just standing over people eating.  We didn't have a great start to our evening, but our meal made up for it.  . . I ordered the fried whole red snapper.  It was delicious!  I'm always a fan of restaurants that serve whole fish.  It was moist and flavorful.  The side of vegetables were kinda bland, though.  It was a simple mix of potatoes, carrots, and green beans.  The rice was o.k.  I tried a bite of my bf's skirt steak dinner, which was really good.  I'd definitely order that dish again.  The margaritas were pretty good, too.  . . The customers are diverse,  ranging from families to couples and everyone in between.  There are flat screen tvs playing Spanish music videos, too.  It was a popular place, but we'll try to go back on a non-Friday/Saturday night.
