Category: American (New)
I don't usually go to high end restaurants but when I do I expect to get what I pay for. As New American cuisine goes, this restaurant does a fine job using organic, seasonal and local ingredients while providing fresh takes on old stand by dishes. . . We started out with the scallops for appetizer and were very impressed by their tenderness. I had the duck breast, which were perfectly done and so rich in flavors. It actually really tasted like very delicate steak because of the flavor and texture. My boyfriend had the Alaskan Halibut and it was very well prepared as well. The flavor wasn't as rich as I anticipated, but the texture of the flesh was buttery and smooth. . . The waitstaff was very attentive and didn't complain when we stayed talking until the entire restaurant closed. Our server came by at least once every 10 mins and was never pushy about our orders.. . I gave the restaurant 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think the prices are just a tad high, especially for some of the appetizers. I also wasn't that impressed with the dark chocolate delice we ordered for dessert. The crunchy ingredient in the chocolate ice cream was a bit overpowering and, for some reason, tasted like bacon bits. It was just a bit disconcerting and didn't go well with the rich chocolate flavor. . . Overall, a good birthday dinner establishment with romantic atmosphere and good service. A bit pricey but worth it if you count the overall dining experience in addition to the foods.
