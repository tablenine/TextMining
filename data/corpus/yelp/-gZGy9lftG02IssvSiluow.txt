Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Very disappointed that "Elvis" was not playing the night our group went.  We chose this place specifically for the entertainment and were shocked when we arrived, were seated in the back and found out that there is no show on MONDAY and TUESDAY nights.  After several phone calls to the restaurant to set up the reservation and ask some questions, we were never told that "Elvis" is not there every night.. . The quality and taste of the food was good, but nothing outstanding, and there is far better , more tasty Thai food all around LA.  We happened to have had a good waiter, but overall, the staff was quite unfriendly, especially the very snippy hostess.  The ambiance is nothing special, valet parking is a bargain at $2.50.  . . I have heard that this is quite a fun place when "Elvis" is entertaining, but other than that I would not go back.
