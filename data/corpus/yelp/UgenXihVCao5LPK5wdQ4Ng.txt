I ordered the "blue plate special" and it was some eggplant on this hard crunchy bread.  It was like a small slice of pizza.  It came with a side of greens...all for $9.  Expensive and not enough food to fill you up. . . Service was slow and they were not even that busy during lunch.. . The only thing nice about the place is the outside patio.  I would not go back again except to get a suntan.
