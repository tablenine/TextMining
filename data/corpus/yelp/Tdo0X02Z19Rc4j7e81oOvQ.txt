I had dinner there on Saturday night at 8:30pm on a date.  We sat in the back which is where you want to be.  I ordered the burger which is pretty amazing.  She had the French onion soup and mac &amp; cheese.  I met chef Meyers who couldn't have been a nicer guy and told me that the burger is his moms recipe.  Overall very cool experience, the only issue I had was the 50 + crowd.   Will def. go back for the burger.  It's all about the meat and the bun.
