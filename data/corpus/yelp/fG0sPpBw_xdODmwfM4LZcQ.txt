Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
The food was pretty decent. I like my Thai food to have stronger flavors. I found Palms to be too muted...neither sweet or flavorful. The place was clean and the service was nice. The Prices are really good for lunch...below Â $7 bucks!!! It feels more like a cafeteria setting rather than a cosy restaurant...but the decor is nice. I did'nt see "Thai Elvis"...I'll be back
