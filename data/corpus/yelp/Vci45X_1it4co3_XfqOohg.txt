Restaurant: Six Feet Under
Category: Seafood
I adore the new location of six feet under, though I miss the rooftop patio overlooking the cemetery.  I'm definitely a fan of the glistening hardwood floors and roomy booths.  The first time I went to Six Feet Under, my entree wasn't very good, and I tried the alligator bites, which were equally unimpressive.  Now, I stick with what I know is good:  the taco plate!  I usually get two shrimp tacos and a calamari taco, nixing the jalapenos.  They're absolutely delicious, and I love it that they let you mix and watch what kind of taco stuffing you would prefer on your combo plate.  I hope the food keeps the restaurant from going six feet under for a long time yet!
