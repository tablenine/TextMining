Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
I almost rated this place 4 stars just because Heidi and Spencer's huge blow up portraits were on the wall amongst Obama, Clooney, Pitt and other real celebs.  BUT...the food was awesome and the service even better, so I can ignore that little detail.. . Honestly, I'm sure you could get close steak-wise going elsewhere, but I'd still hit up Cut when you're willing to splurge a bit.  It's one of the few places in the US that carry real Kobe beef, though I can't say it's my top choice on the menu because of how gummy it is.  The waiter we had ensured we had the perfect wine pairing to our meal (which I guess is their job), but he was a really cool guy and complimented me on my camera which scored some brownie points.. . I went to the Cut in Vegas as well, but the ambiance and decor in the LA location left me more "stoked" to go back.
