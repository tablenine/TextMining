#34 in . http://365losangeles.b.... . . Yeah! Thank you to Magic Mike, who invited me to magic castle with a bunch of my friends.  When you go with a member, you don't have to get the food (which I wasn't looking forward to anyway, based on the reviews here).  We got a private show with Mike, then went to the close up gallery and saw this dude Toto from Japan.  He was so funny (and a great magician as well), I laughed so hard I was tearing up.  After countless "What?" "No way!"s, we migrated to the main show (we had to wait in line 45 minutes early to get a good seat because they let in the dinner guests first).  The guy in the main show kept making these cards appear out of thin air.  It sounds like a cliche-out of thin air--but it really was like that.  Big cards, little cards, medium sized cards. It was nuts.  Anyway, I went on a Sunday night, and it wasn't too crowded.  Oh, and I think we saw the Mystery guy from The Pickup Artist there.  What? No I don't watch that show...
