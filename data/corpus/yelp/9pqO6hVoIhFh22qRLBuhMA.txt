Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
This one is easy. It's the best to my knowledge. Nothing beats the taste, authenticity, environment, and history of this place. My dad came here as a grad student of ucla and now I go here as an undergrad. Perfect little homey small restaurant, always packed. The people working are cool too. Manuel's the man.. . I took my roomies here. And from my recommendation, we got 5 hollenbeck de machacas. No one was disappointed. I'm sure there are good things out there... but I haven't really ordered anything Â but the Machaca!! Simple, if you haven't had it, go, now.
