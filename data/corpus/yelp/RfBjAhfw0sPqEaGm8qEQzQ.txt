Okay... So, Edward Norton was sitting 5 feet away from us eating with some girl. I don't get starstuck, but that was pretty interesting. And he needs to get his hair done. But then again, sometimes I walk around with crappy looking hair. Anywho, Gobo seemed like a very nice place. Honeybuns decided to take me here for dessert since we ate dinner at Alta. Gobo overall has a very beautiful physical appearance. The doors when you enter make it seem as if you're entering a temple. Beautiful wooden doors, and once walking in, the wall is filled with spices, nuts and coffee beans protected by a layer of transparent plastic. Very neat looking, I took pictures. Once entering, we were seated by a very kind hostess. Honeybuns then said to me "Edward Norton is right behind you over there", I replied "Really?", glanced over, and there he was, sitting and eating. How fun. Anyway, back to me. Ummmmmmm. We had dessert there. He had this yummy yummy yummy peanut butter, chocolate and something else shake, along with this... I don't know what it was. I had the layered chocolate cake and a black bubble tea with tapioca (which was very delicious). I remember my first bubble tea days in Flushing... Brings back memories. So that was great. Our waiter for helpful, fast paced, and...... blonde. I'm not sure how else to describe him? Overall, a very relaxed, trendy, and laid back environment. An excellent place for a date as well, but more of a chill, kick back, and have a nice dinner with friends kinda place. I'd see it more as a place to take a friend out for dinner. There are more romantic places out there. Even Cafe Orlin was more romantic than this place. Overall, 5 stars.
