Restaurant: Fontaine&#39;s Oyster House
Category: Seafood
I think of this place as more of a bar than a restaurant.  The bar is great, the bartenders are great, and there is always a great crowd.  i can't say the food is very great, in fact it is very average.  They only serve one variety of oysters, and to be honest I don't eat raw oysters anymore.  The other seafood selections are mostly out of the freezer or fried.  The other items on the menu are strictly bar food standards (chicken fingers etc.).  The lobster bisque is yummy and the same exact recipe from sister restaurant Steamhouse Lounge.
