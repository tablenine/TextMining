Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I'm not exactly an expert when it comes to Korean BBQ, but when you've been going to Gyu Kaku for years and suddenly you have the urge to try something "authentic" things get a bit jumbled in the taste test. First of all, I know good 'ol gyu kaku isn't Korean, it's Japanese and many have seen it as not the "real stuff" but let me just say that the quality of beef is absolutely top notch and that makes me fuss way less about the price, especially if you go at a happy hour time and get a type of beef for 50% off. Anyway back to Manna. It was Fourth of July, it was definitely a BBQ feeling type day so I wanted to satisfy that beef hunger with an all you can eat for $16.99. We ordered every type of meat and with that meal came a salad, egg bowl to mix in rice, kimchee, and a bunch of different sauces and dips. It was definitely an experience as well as an experiment on figuring out what goes where, what tastes better with what, and who the huh, and where the hell is the waitress kinda night. . . The meat wasn't terrible, but the whole time I kept thinking it reminded me of Mongolian bbq and how much I wanted the sauces they have at Gyu Kaku. The sauces they had weren't too bad, I enjoyed a sesame oil dip that went pretty well with everything, but there was just an urge to have some thick bbq sauce somewhere in the mix. . . I probably wouldn't go back, but I will say that it was a great idea for what we wanted, and damn was I full! I think the next open fire BBQ I'll go for will be Manpuku.
