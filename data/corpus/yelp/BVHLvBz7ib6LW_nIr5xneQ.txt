So i was driving at 8:00pm along the 10 freeway on my way in to Downtown for a business meeting with my partner. . . He texts my im at the Wurst Kuche.. I though he was joking...  common its a funny name when your not German.... . So i pop the addy into my GPS, turn the toons back up and arrive with a pleasurable line outside.. I thought it was going to be at least 15 minutes before my stomach stopped growling.. Surprise surprise it took about 15 minutes for me to get in and order my food. . . Well when I'm sober, i eat like a regular California bread boy, tacos, hamburgers, or something Asian. . . So as i was sober, i decided i'd go with a double order of the Italian sausage, sweet peppers, and grilled onions. Even though the fries looked quite appetizing.. . If i had a couple of drinks in me i probably would have spent about $30.00 on the part of the menu, that offers sausages that seem like they came out of a psychedelic stoned chiefs wet dreams.. . After you order, and take your little red retro table sign back to the dinning hall, which is wide, roomy, but somehow through the crowd seems to have no room. You find a spot, plant your bottom, and wait for about 10 minutes; just enough to be really hungry when it gets there, but also enough time to strike up a good conversation before you stuff your face.. . All in all.. i'm going back.. and i think I'm going to have some drinks first. I've just go to try that rattlesnake sausage that just sounds like a little story i can have under my belt.. . cheers.
