This place is THE shiz!! There's hardly any parking at night, the wait can be long and there's no waiting area inside so you have to stand out front, but it's worth it all because of the food.. . The bread basket is amazing - I'd ask for more if I didn't think it'd ruin my appetite for the meal itself. But the most life altering menu item is the Coulotte Steak "Picanha"!!! Steak so juicy and tender it easily surrenders under the knife, yucca flour to dip, rice perfectly salty, black beans in a separate bowl so it doesn't leak everywhere, refreshing salsa, and plantains for a dessert side. Holy guacamole, and all of it on one plate?! Yessuh. My other favorite is the lamb skewers.. . Of all the places on Sunset to try, where tourists will be pleased, the young locals actually eat (and don't just pretend to), this place is IT.
