Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Obviously the people who give this place high ratings have not tasted the juicy hot dogs at Top Dog up in Norcal.  Pink's pales in comparison.  Har har.. . At first the menu looks pretty hefty, but upon close inspection, it turns out that the hot dog selection is actually quite limited.  They merely vary the number of toppings to create new "menu items."  I'm used to a warm toasted bun and grilled dog with bite.  Bite that releases savory juices!  Pink's was unable to deliver, unfortunately.. . I ordered a chili dog and man, it was seriously low qual.  The chili that they scooped onto the dog was SO greasy.  It looked more like bits of meat floating in oily goo.  And with that kind of mess, I naturally expected even more flavor to come out of it.  But no, I was so very wrong.  The hot dog tasted more like a boiled frank you can pick up from any grocery store that had been tossed onto the grill for 30 seconds, just to leave some char marks (to fool the customers into thinking this is how a hot dog should taste).. . I'm thinking the only reason why this place has survived is due to its history and also the fact that there aren't many places in LA dedicated to selling dogs.  The prices are insane here, so save your cash for a better hot dog joint.  I have yet to find one in the LA area...but will report back once I do.  In the meantime, if you're up in the bay area, be sure to stop by a Top Dog for quality and actual hot dog variety.
