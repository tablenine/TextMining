Crap crap CRAP service.. . I wish I would NOT be hounded for tip every single time I eat here.. . We were only filling out the check/signing in and the servers were staring us down and circling our tables like vultures.  They even said "You fill out the tip here." to us, when we were PLANNING on giving them tip in cash.. . Food isn't that great either, the service just totally ruins it all.  There are much better places around my house for bubble tea anyway.
