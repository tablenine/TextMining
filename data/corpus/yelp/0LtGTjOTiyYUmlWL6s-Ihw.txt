First off, tasty chips and salsa.  The chips were not greasy and I thoroughly enjoyed the choice between a green salsa and a pico de gallo-esque salsa.  As for my meal, I loved my combination plate.  Broken down:. . Ground beef taco.  The ground beef has potatoes in it which I adore.  And the taco overall was tasty.. . Vegetarian tostada.  They put beans, rice AND guacamole on it.  Fantastic.  Usually you get beans and that's about it.... . Cheese enchilada.  Green sauce = perfect.  Enchilada wasn't too greasy, it was just delicious.. . I was seriously impressed.  I'd eat that same meal again in a heartbeat.
