Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
Holy Taco had inauspicious beginnings. Some of it was timing, having been the third in the "Great Taco Invasion of East Atlanta." Yes, in the span of 2 months, three "Mexican" places opened within a single city block. This was the cause of great mockery on Yelp and indeed the surrounding community. In addition, some of the mockery was earned in that, at the time, Holy Taco just wasn't that good. I'd eaten there a few times in those early days and walked away, head shaking, and preferring La Casita Cantina a hundred or so yards to the west. Sure the space, a converted gas station and taken over from the beloved Iris, was still pretty, but the menu did little to differentiate itself. AND they charged for chips in those early days.. . But as time went on, La Casita closed and perhaps not so coincidently, Holy Taco stepped up its food game. They expanded their menu to include more "authentic" Mex fair. When elote (roasted corn on the cob), I took notice. Other things were added. Lingua (beef tongue?) Fried chicken hearts? Sure, it took a little time to shake off those initial feelings toward the place, but eventually I did. Now this is the sort of restaurant I can order a heaping plate of arugula and sardines, topped with a Meyer lemon vinaigrette and a shot of tequila.. . In retrospect, I'm glad they stuck around. They provide both flour and corn tortillas, so my gluten-free wife is glad too. (Though she's not a big fan of their chips, since they've got a heft to them that she doesn't dig. I don't have a problem with them though.) The neighborhood no longer compares them to Iris and, in time, they won't be compared to La Casita. By then, Holy Taco will earn its place all by itself. Four stars at least.
