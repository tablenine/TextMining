I hear the Dresden is supposed to be like a closet celebrity hotspot.  But all i saw were old people, and then some more old people.  not that i'm hating cause i love old people!  . . So the decor is nice.  all white and shiny.  My girls and i could not stop talking about it.  I believe their sig cocktail is called "blood and sand" .  I guess it's because it really looks like sand floating in bloood.  Nothing screams "drink me!" like a glass of bloood and sand, but it was "ok".  Not great, but not bad.  . . The food on the other hand was just mediocre.  I was actually expecting it to be a lot better, only because they've gotten such rave reviews but everything just tasted okay.  We had the NY steak, veal marsala and parmagiana and the chicken marsala.  Everything was just okay at most.  In fact that's probably the first thing I said after we got out.  "The food could have been better dude".  They have valet in the back, but you can also just self park and leave them your key without having to pay.  . . If anything, this place is a good date spot.  It's small and intimate, and very eeeerily quiet so you can actually get to talk, unless your on one of "those" dates where y'all aint got shit to talk about.  Then it'll just be one quiet ass dinner.  . . all in all, not bad.  as my 3 stars on yelp says it was  A-ook
