First thing that comes out of my mouth about this place is.. . SALAD DRESSING.. . The salad that comes in a MINI bowl with the ginger/onion/? dressing before your order is such a tease. . I have never been so obsessed over salad dressing until now. . ( The left over dressing poured over rice is heavenly. ). . The long wait is inescapable.. deal with it. . The Bento Boxes are standard - it's filling which is all i have to say about that. . The chow mein and fried rice is something I'd recommend (if you have to choose either one, go for the fried rice). . And lastly... their ramen. . I'd say the first few noodle servings and a couple slurps of the broth is all I need... ..When your body literally starts to ache, and you feel sluggish, and groggy.. you know what they've put in there.. monosodiumglutamate..or more commonly known as MSG. . . The price is fair.. although I'd rather pay 50cents for a cup ramen or shin-ramen. . . The 3 stars I rated is after 4+ visits to this place.. I'd probably have given it 4 or 5stars after the first visit.
