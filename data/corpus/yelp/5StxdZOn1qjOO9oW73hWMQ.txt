it's a great hot spot for a lot of celebrities.. ex: rihanna, t.i., etc. i first ate their years ago. love the food.. the sweeet and salty combination you get from chicken and waffles is great.. however. i must admit this is heart attack central so i can't eat it all the time, at least without feeling extra guilty.
