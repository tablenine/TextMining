Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
A Note: In our continuing series of dreadful and disappointing restaurants in Andersonville, your humble author submits the following scathing, sub-literate review.. . Is this place someone's idea of a joke?. . First and foremost:  "Best Scones in the World," eh?  They're raw.  THEY ARE RAW!!!  (And so are the pancakes!)  If they were cooked?  Maybe the scones are in contention for Best in Chicago, but THE WORLD?  Hardly. . . Look, I know it's heresy and pure balderdashary to speak ill of TOH, but this place is just awful.  Once you get past the overpriced, under seasoned bizarre food (Olives?  In the chili?!) and the under- whelming, often downright rude service, you have to deal with the politics of the place.. . I hate children and adults as much as the next guy, but I keep my misanthropy to myself.  The owner?  He plasters a condescending sign on the door asking people to keep their voices down.  I spent about a decade in the biz before moving onto greener pastures, so I know restaurant folk are a strange and contentious breed.  But rule number one is keep it off the floor.  . . Actually, that works as a literal rule regarding the actual preparation and serving of the food and as a figurative rule regarding the shielding of clientele from the attitude, politics, and lunacy of the people touching the food they're about to eat.  So, yeah, that's a big one.
