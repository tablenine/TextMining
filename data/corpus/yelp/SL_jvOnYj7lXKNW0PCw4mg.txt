Cute place in a super cute area - our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and on top of everything without being pushy.  Wine was a little on the pricey side for a glass.  Food was good - get the half order of pasta, full size is WAY too much.  The chocolate cake with sea salt and olive oil was to die for.  I'm still thinking about it a week later.  Perfection!!!
