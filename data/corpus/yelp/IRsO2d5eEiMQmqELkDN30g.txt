Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Had the ham and cheese frittata to start with griddle potatoes to start. Delicious. Had to start scarfing it down however because the Oreo pancakes arrived. I asked for them to come out a little bit after the egg dish. We learned a valuable lesson on this outing. When not in a rush to be anywhere and you don't want some thing until you are finished with some thing else, wait until then to order it. It makes sense when ordering desserts and that is exactly what this pancakes were going to be for us. Quick mention the 7 grain toast was heaven to Jacki and the raspberry jam was excellent even though she said she would bring strawberry.. . They were the largest pancakes I had ever seen and I was completely prepared to eat them and only them while eating here, but an egg dish off this menu just was too appetizing to say no to. However they came out piping hot with a mound of whipped cream on top that was melting every second, but gotten to just in time. Only the first and a couple bites of #2 were eaten in restaurant. The rest were eaten first while waiting for bus to Venice and then while sitting by Starbucks down town because thats where we ended up. Here it was dipped in hot chocolate, which was ordering mistake #2 of the day. Should have waited til the dipping was going to begin. Debating whether or not I would come back. My time is limited here so unless someone really wants to go, there are just too many spots to try out
