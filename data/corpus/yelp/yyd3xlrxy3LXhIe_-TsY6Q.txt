i would say 3 stars simply because WOW i had one of their "exotic sausages", rattlesnake and rabbit.  but that's where the wow-factor ended.  i think the space is great, the location is great, the beer selection is great, but the actual sausage itself was good and forgettable at the same time.  i'd say the belgian frites were really good as well as the dipping sauces (try the pesto mayo and blue cheese), but if you're main focus is sausages, then they need to step up their game a bit.
