Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
I read about this place being the pick of Timeout Chicago, and thought to give it a try. We ordered Northern Thai sausage, fried worms, kua kae, Gang heart of palm, and yellow curry. The fried worms were surprisingly good, they tasted like crispy rice. Everything else were mediocre, nothing special. I was very disappointed at my kua kae, the pork actually tasted stinky and old. We also found hair in our water. I don't believe that I'd be going back.
