Restaurant: Panahar Bangladeshi Cuisine
Category: Restaurants
Oh, Panahar, you cheeky little Bangladeshi restaurant, you! With your tacky mirror tiles on the walls, worn out, uncomfortable booth benches and elaborately printed curtains hung for decoration, you still draw me in with your tasty food, you vixen.. . You don't need to worry about what to order here. The owner/host will tell you just what to get, and exactly how to eat it. "Stir this vegetable curry into your rice so the flavors mix well, then add this chutney and it's wonderful." I almost expected him to grab my fork and do it for me. But it was charming, none the less. And he's perfected the art of the upsell. "Can I interest you in a delicious mango lassi?" How can you resist?. . I most recently had their lunch buffet which had a nice variety of curries, veggies and meats, plus all the add-ons including several chutneys, naan, etc. The food is always delicious and worth the trip.. . And if you're a newbie, you get a first-timer's gift -- a coupon for 25% off for a month on select evenings. Cha ching!
