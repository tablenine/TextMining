Restaurant: BondSt
Category: Japanese
I've heard many great things about BONDST, but I was slightly disappointed. Fish was fresh, but not very memorable. Â I did enjoy the spicy crispy shrimp, but the highly recommended lobster rolls and spicy tuna rolls were again quite standard.. . Tables were seated a bit too close for my comfort, but that's usually what you get at a Japanese restaurant. Service and ambiance was good and enjoyable, but don't think BONDST will be a regular spot when I'm craving sushi.
