Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Geisha house is all Hollywood. It has a cute decor, the crowd is pretentious and snobby, and the food is good. . It's a theater, so expect lots of illusions but little substance, especially when it comes to service from front of the house - hostesses and managers. . The wait staff is nice. . We made reservations here for New Year's Eve for 9pm. Â They overbooked, and had no tables for us. We were surrounded by tens of patrons in the same situation. We kept on drinking and patiently waiting for the promised table they said would be ready any minute. Finally, nearly three hours later, fifteen minutes before the New Year, we got to sit down to eat. We got a few drinks on the house, but our bill was still few hundred bucks, totally not worth the experience.
