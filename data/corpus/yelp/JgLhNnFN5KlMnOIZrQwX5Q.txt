What can I say? Flip burger was pretty good. I went their last night with a friend craving a good burger. I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, and my guest ordered the Butchers Cut. We had a side of fries and a side of fried okra. . . The burgers were good. Slightly small, but that allowed us to savor the wonderful side items of yummy fries and perfectly fried okra. The fries were perfectly fried, and the okra had a wonderful tempura batter that allowed it to be crunchy yet not too heavy. The burgers were perfectly cooked at medium and medium rare respectively. The only negative on the bacon cheeseburger was the miniscule piece of bacon. It was maybe an inch long, and almost wasn't worth having on the burger.. . The other main disappointment was the nutella+burnt marshamallow milkshake. It tasted like your basic chocolate milkshake. You could barely taste the nutella. Not worth the 6 dollars that it costs.. . Overall, I was very satisfied.
