This place Is frikken awesome..... I discovered it about 6yrs ago...... I live about a half hour away from it, but make it my business to go there at least once a month.. I luv the veggie lasagna, greek salad, bread sticks, meatball sub, &amp; the extra cheese pizza.. N I can't 4get sweet tea with lemon is always a must!. :)
