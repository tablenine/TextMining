Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
The best Korean BBQ in LA.  We love meat, so this place is perfect for us. We order "B", which is such an incredibly large amount of different types of marinated beef (Rib eye, Galbi, Bulgogi, brisket..).  We exchange the "pork neck" for more bulgogi, and it works out perfect for us.  The place is very very clean, the waiters are professional and nice, they even let me add an extra $2 to my tab to pay the valet.  We love this place, we've been twice, and the food is constantly great.. . The beef short rib is so tender and flavorable.  This place is great, we think it's amazing, and they deserve the  5 stars I'm giving them.  Everytime we go, we are stuffed to max, obviously do to the large platter we order. We are very very satisfied every time!. . Overall just a fantastic place!  I love their side dishes too.  The salad is bomb, the potatoe pancakes (aka asian latkas) are amazing, and their pickled vegies are a fantastic appetizer to the wonderful main dish.
