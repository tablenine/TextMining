You can choose from 3 soup flavors: miso, soy sauce, and salt. I chose Miso.  Afterwards you choose how spicy you want it.  I chose #4 which to me is Medium.  I wish I chose 1 step spicier, but don't worry they have this chilli oil at the table which does make it a little better.  You can choose your additional sides as Step 3 of the ordering process.  I can't believe green onion is $1.50.  They also have garlic (which I chose), butter, egg (got this too comes in boiled egg form), and I forget the rest.   A friend also ordered dumplings which came in about 5 pieces.  It was pretty tasty as well.. . -Overall, the wait kind of took a little while because it was pretty busy even for a Tuesday for a party of 4, but I didn't really mind.. -The waiters were really nice.. -I thought it was pretty tasty.. -I would recommend this place for Japanese Ramen.. *Don't forget to ask for validation stickers!
