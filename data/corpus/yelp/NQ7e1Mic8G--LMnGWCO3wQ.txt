Hands down, this is the BEST place to spend Halloween Night!! If you can, go go GO! . . The Halloween decor was beautiful, and I saw so many cool people in costume. The shows were awesome, the magicians were very funny and had charming personalities...oh wait they are supposed to be charming,aren't they? duhhh lol. . The Phantasmagoria show was beautiful! . . I was impressed by the invisible piano player (Irma)...I requested a Lady Gaga song and she played Poker Face for me. I've seen other ppl request songs and she didnt play it/or she played something else...she responds better when you say please.. . They had a dance floor, and an art gallery if u felt like buying a Gris Grimly print...there's so much cool stuff there!. . We were relieved nobody got offended by our costume, lol. ( We were dressed as pilot/attendant plane crash survivors ). . ( I'm guessing they arenot really known for their food, right? People go there mainly for the entertainment and drinks ) . . The food was ok....my husband ordered a filet mignon that was burnt and was strategically covered in sauce, to cover the mistake ) I ordered a chicken masala and it was good...I was pretty happy with my dish, but my husband insisted that I write about his steak on Yelp =P. . Overall, we had a great night!!!!
