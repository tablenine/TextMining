I don't think I've tried very many Cuban restaurants, so i might not be one to judge how good and authentic this place is..but i know when food is good and it makes me happy. so i guess my review is still somewhat legit right?!?!. . the decor is interesting.. don't expect a super fancy restaurant, but the food definitely makes up for it. Â i loveee love love their garlic chicken, the ropa vieja, the oxtail stew...the list goes on!! the best thing to do is to come here with a buncha friends, so you guys can all order and try one dish and share :) . . all of their dishes average out to be around $12 or so, it's not cheap, but its not super expensive either..you get a lot of food so it's not a rip off! . . the crazy garlic taste can be a little overpowering, but this place is definitely good if you go once in a while! i don't go very often, but every time i do, i'm pretty sure i say "OMGG SO GOOD!!" at least once when i'm there!! ENJOY :)
