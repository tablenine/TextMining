Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Apparently waiting in line for an hour while smelling super tasty scrap meat is a requirement for really enjoying LA in all its glory...  because that is pink's.  The chili dog is where it's at - and bacon doesn't make it better, nor does getting it with pastrami or BBQ sauce on it.   Even though bacon, pastrami, and BBQ sauce are pretty much gifts from above in general.   Trust me - I bought twice as much as I needed just so I could see for myself.. . Oh and they have old time sodas there.  Yum!
