Loved it from the moment we walked in...  What a great place!  Authentic university cafe.  We showed up about 10:50am on a Saturday &amp; sat down at the last table in the place.  Huevos rancheros were served with some of the best fried potatoes I've ever eaten.  Also ordered a very large "Insalata Kimba" with turkey.  It was delicious, but could have been smaller.  I think it could easily have served 2 people.   Very comfortable environment, very good food.  What's not to like?
