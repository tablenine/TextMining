Just ate at Maison Akira today for Father's Day brunch.  The food was sooo good!  My husband and I and our 2 year old had a great time here.  We ate a lot of sushi and sashimi.  The salmon with asparagus was delicious.  Roast beef and prime rib were very good too.  We both loved the flan and apple tarts.  There were also many smaller dishes and they were all very good.
