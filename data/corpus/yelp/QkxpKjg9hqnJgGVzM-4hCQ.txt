Cool vibe in this place, hard to find, tucked into the mall and shares a patio with Borders. The outdoor seats were tiny uncomfortable little cubes. The raw appetizer was really something, and the food portions were small but well-presented and very well made. We were celebrating a birthday so the waiter actually surprised us with a round of shots which was really sweet - until I noticed that we had been charged for a couple of them. Weird, and lame. I haven't been to a raw bar place in LA yet that was this hip, though. A good date spot.
