Went there last night with my bf for a belated b-day gift.... We had a VERY romantic dinner. The ambiance with the candle-lit tables everywhere and the romantic music paling in the background, blah blah.... The waiter was great, he recommended wines to us and he was attentive.. . We started with the tuna tar tar as an appetizer. Nothing special to say about the tuna tartar, except that the leaks it came with definitely added something special. He ordered the pork chops which were sooooooo good, and they were served with ratatouille , and I ordered the duck which came with this butternut squash puree which was heavenly.. And for desert Â we had this peach crisp a la mode. OMG it was totally awesome, I mean it really tasted homemade. I will definitely be back. And just in case your curious our tab, including tip was just over 200.
