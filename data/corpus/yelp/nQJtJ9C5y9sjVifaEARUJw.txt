Love this place, one of the only nicer restaurants near our house that we know we can always take guests to.  I really like the chicken alla provinciana, but I ask for it with chicken breasts instead of the 1/2 chicken because I hate dark meat, and I haven't been turned down yet.  I do feel like the portions have gotten smaller since we've started going there about a year ago, but we will always come back, it is cozy, good bread and dipping sauce, nice atmosphere, great food, reasonably priced.  Probably my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood!!!
