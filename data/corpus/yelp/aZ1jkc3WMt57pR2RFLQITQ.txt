I was initially dissappointed at the fact that the gal on the phone said to do walk in since they do not take reservations on Valentine's day. When we walked in they said we need a reservation so I thought we were out of luck. Instead we got a seat in the bar area and the service was no different then the main dinning room. The server and supervisor were very friendly and the food was very tasty. The price surprised me as I thought this place would be very expensive. Our whole dinner with wine and tip came out less than $50 for two which is a great deal. The ambiance is nice with a decent mixed crowd of LA socialites and common folks like us. I highly recommend this place for a date or anniversary.
