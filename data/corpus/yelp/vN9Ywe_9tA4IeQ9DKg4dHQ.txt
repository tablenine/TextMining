I'm stuffed.... couldn't even finish the Chicago Cut. I got it w/ melted blue cheese and it was delicious! (They really do make whatever you ask them to so that was nice!) Some of my friends even ordered seafood off the sister restaurant's menu. And the Porterhouse was well-liked.... . We had a lot of soups and salads and small appetizers. I highly recommend the tomato and goat cheese. The goat cheese was to die for! Everything else was just okay.. . For sides, we got 2 plates of fries, a plate of asparagus, a plate of mushrooms and mashed potatoes. None of the sides were spectacular but it's good to have them to compliment all that meat! (I usually don't eat that much meat.) We also got two bottles of red wine, recommended by our server. . . For dessert, we made a failed attempt at finishing the German Chocolate cake (aka MOUNTAIN!). It was good but definitely not authentic. It tasted more like Tres Leche. . . All in all, I'd go back but I have to check out a few more steakhouses for comparison.
