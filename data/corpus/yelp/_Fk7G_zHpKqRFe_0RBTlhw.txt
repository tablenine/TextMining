The  Earl has great burgers!  I love the shoestring fries and the sweet potato fries.  The place is pretty cool inside and the waitstaff is friendly.  There's good music on the jukebox for lunch times and the live bands are great.. Wish they had a better ventilation system- one smoker can make your eyes burn!
