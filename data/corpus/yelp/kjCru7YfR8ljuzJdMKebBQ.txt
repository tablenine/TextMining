Philippe's makes the perfect beef dip, that's all there is to it.  I mean, it makes sense, right?  They've only been making dips since 1908.  If they haven't perfected by 2007, I'd be a little worried.. . It's not piled on too thick, nor do they "subway" the beef either... just the right amount.  The amount of au jus on the sandwich is pretty much on point as well.  The size if the sandwich is great too, as you don't feel like your pregnant after finishing your meal.  . . Try it with a side of potato salad.  Their lemonade is almost as perfect as their beef dips.  . . If you like a little kick to your food, try it with a dollop of the tableside hot mustard.. . The line to order your food is a little hectic though.  There are like, 6 different lines going on at once.  There's no sense of organization at all with the lines.  It's pretty much a cattle herd, especially during lunch time.  Once you finally get to the counter and order your meal, it's smooth sailing from that point on.. . They have a little tiny convenience store type deallie right by the door too.  After your meal you can buy a pack of gum or some lemonheads, depending on what kinda mood you're in.. . Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that considers themselves a beef dip connoisseur.  Plus, it's a historical LA landmark, so you can make a field trip out of your meal as well.  Philippe's beef dips are very delicious!  It truly is the most perfectly crafted beef dip.
