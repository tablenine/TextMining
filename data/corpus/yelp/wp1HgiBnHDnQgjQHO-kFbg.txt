Nancy Silverton and Mario Batali's latest, next to their pizzeria, has an urban elegance (high ceilings, black chandeliers, floor-to-ceiling mahogany bar) and a marble-topped cheese bar where Silverton turns out those exquisite concoctions she perfected during "Mozzarella Mondays" at Jar: burrata with bacon, marinated escarole and caramelized shallots; and stracciatella with celery and herbs. Batali and exec chef Matt Molina take credit for the rest of an Italian menu that ranges from pigs' trotters to beautiful pastas to a plain but mighty tasty orata. Though the poor acoustics make for a rather noisy dining experience (try the back room -- private, quiet and reminiscent of a mob movie restaurant scene), the outstanding service, excellent bartenders and orgasmic food definitely put Â a muffle on the uproar.
