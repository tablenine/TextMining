It should be noted that this review is based off of two items on the menu. Those items being macaroni and cheese and the passion fruit lemonade. I am very discriminating when it comes to mac and cheese because I like to think I invented it. Uncommon Ground has some damn good macaroni and cheese. Its downright exceptional. If you take me here, be warned that if you order their mac and cheese I will probably eat off your plate. Smacking my hand doesn't work to stop me. Now on to the lemonade. I am slightly addicted to passion fruit flavored things. They have passion fruit lemonade! It's delish! I am really looking forward to the opening of the one on Devon Ave.
