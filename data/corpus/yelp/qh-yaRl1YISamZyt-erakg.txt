Sausage and Beer one of the greatest combos to go together, Germans have it right . I have only been here during the day so I have never seen a line form but I have to say it is a little tricky to find. I have become a fan of the Austin Blues sausage along with a glass of Duchesse De Bourgogne. It is a perfect contrast of flavors that pair together so well. I also really like the fact that they have four different types of mustard, so the possibilities are endless. The fries are also quite tasty and we ended up devouring most of them before eating our sausages. The chipotle aioli is great with the saltiness of the potatoes This last time we went on an exceptionally hot day and decided to get an apple pie ice cream sandwiched between two oatmeal cookies. Spend your last Fiver on one of these, it's definitely worth it. I already can't wait to go back.
