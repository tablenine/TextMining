porto's cake s no good. i don't understand all the hype. the strawberry shotcakes was way too sweet. the texture of the pound cake is too dry.whatsup wiith the Â half ass decoration? half piece of measly gelatin glazed straberry?the choco flourless cake is hard like a rock. again super sweet chocolate. i think it's probably in order to cover the cheap kind of chocolate. bread pudding was okay. oh and the potato ball is way too salty. if you don't want to pay much for dessert, porto's is the place to buy stuff the price is pretty decent. but definitely don't go there for quality.
