I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH DANA S. BELOW.. . PROS:. - great view on the upstairs patio!. - full bar. - open late (til 1 or 2am everyday but Sunday). - 3tacos+1side = pretty big portions. - alot of diff side items (too bad theyre not that delicious....). . CONS:. - mediocre food -- i've had the spicy rat toes, fish stew, shrimp &amp; grits, crab cake po'boy, all the tacos (scallop, shrimp, fish, calamari), shrimp&amp;scallops, hush puppies, and zucchini fries. everything but the zucchini fries isn't good. no flavors. very bland.. - long wait for patio.. . great place for drinks and snacks on the patio! but not so much for food. the view is so relaxing and so niceee
