Halloween night out with my fried Dio.  We started at the Bookhouse because Dio wanted to check it out.  He said there had been a lot of rave on yelp about it.  The menu didn't seem all that interesting so we enjoyed our beers and decided to head over to Shaun's.  A hop and a skip later, we arrived at Shaun's.  The decor looked really nice.  We decided to chill by the bar.  I thought the menu was pretty standard which probably translated to boring in the back of my mind.  I went with my default or most common dish.  I ordered the 16 oz Kansas City Strip cooked medium.  Medium is usually a safe bet for me.  I love ordering the most expensive thing on the menu.  I figure if a chef cared about his food, he would care about what he is charging top dollars for.  The steak was okay, but that in itself was a problem.  The presentation of the steak was good.  I did appreciate the fact that the steak was cooked with the bone.  The meat closer to the bone came out very tender; however, the steak was too salty for my taste.  The Kansas City Strip is not a steak I would consider revisiting if I found myself at Shaun's again.
