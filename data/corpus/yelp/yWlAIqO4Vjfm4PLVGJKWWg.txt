Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Bangin' burgers. That's what Umami serves. Saw a nice review in the Times (sorry Yelp) and decided to hit it up. Parking sucks rocks, especially at night. There's a small lot with permit-only parking in the immediate vicinity, but I lucked out and found a spot next to a "parking attendant" (AKA a homeless guy) on La Brea &amp; Wilshire.. . There was a considerable wait, but the staff was amiable, attentive and apologetic for the delay. We even were given water for our trouble as we waited.. . The menu is simple and the priciest item on the menu is the $11 Truffle Burger. I initially chose the signature Umami Burger for a reasonable $8 and settled on the Turkey Confit Burger when I found out the Umami Burger was sold out. My friend went with the Port &amp; Stilton Burger. Both were awesome! Juicy and flavorful, these two burgers alone blew anything I've ever had at Father's Office out of the water. Seriously.. . Some complained about burger size, but I didn't find them to be too small. There a decent selection of sides. I went with the hand cut fries, but the sweet potato chips looked tasty as well.. . The total bill clocked in under $30 including tip. What a deal, right? With such a simple menu, you could conceivably try everything on it within 3-4 visits if you share with friends. . . Speaking of friends, seating is limited. I saw four-tops and maybe a sixer in the back, but that was about it. This *not* the spot for big groups. If you can brave the parking sitch, grab a bud and head over.
