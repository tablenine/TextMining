Went here for a special dinner night and it was so good! We had a prixe fixe menu and we had leftovers and were very satisfied. I had a Kobe Beef Meatballs and Spaghetti, which I don't think they always have, but it was soo good! The meat tasted so rich and delicious! And fairly reasonable in price for a nice dinner now and then depending on how many course you get or if its fixed. Haven't tried brunch but want to!
