Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I love pickles.. Therefore, Canters would already get 5 stars, BUT, they also have an incredible selection of food, drinks and hot waitresses.   Okay, the waitresses were hot in 1955, but everything else about this place is authentic and good.  Not even that pricey for LA.  Probably more traditional than Jerrys, and just as unhealthy.  The kind of place you can just hang out for a few hours.. . Parking is a problem but... it's LA.  Just find a small spot on the street and use the 'bump &amp; feel' technique.
