I went here on a date and we had such a nice time that they were playing dave matthews band and jack johnson and it didn't even bother me.. . i got a chicken and brie sandwich that people apparently go crazy for but just thought it was so-so. my date got pulled pork sandwich which he loved loved loved. we split a pitcher of hefeweizen which was expensive damn but we really liked it. the service was a really nice young lady, pretty fast cookin' too.. . so i would definitely go back and recommend it to you if you are in eagle rock, especially if you are sick of coffee table. but only 3 stars because like yeah it's good but i didn't think great and it's not the cheapest place. but still go try it.. . also for eagle rock music fest this is the raddest place to drink beer.
