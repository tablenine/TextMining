Was there last Friday. Food was great but a little on the salty side. My hubby &amp; I had the family meal. The lamb was perfect and was the best thing on the menu. The host is a grumpy old guy and their servers are not too pleasant. They need to work on being a little more friendly and try to smile more. Overall, it was okay. I prefer Raffi's in Glendale, CA.
