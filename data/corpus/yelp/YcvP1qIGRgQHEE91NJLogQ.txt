1st off, STOP BEING STUPID PEOPLE. I see people who wait in 1-2hr+ lines just for some tacos and burritos... If you're one of these people you're not the brightest bulbs in the shop. Get the specials, get the specials, oh wait, did I tell you to get their specials. It's the only things that are really good and out of the ordinary. I've had their spam/short rib sliders, the jalapeno french toast, their various quesadillas such a short rib quesadilla with a special sauce, their calamari tacos, etc. If they are out of the specials get sliders and order a short rib quesadilla. . . Get to the location a half hour early or so, and it'll save you a hour and a half haha.
