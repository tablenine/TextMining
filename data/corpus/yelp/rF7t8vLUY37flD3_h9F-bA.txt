I finally decided to try Kogi after hearing about it from a couple of my friends...Although the idea of Korean-style tacos seems great, waiting in line for an hour made the overall experience less enjoyable.... . I tried the chicken and beef tacos, as well as a chicken burrito (they weren't serving quesadillas at that time).  The meats were all well marinated and tender and the Korean-style slaw and sauce added a nice touch.  However, the tacos were drenched with the sauce, to the point that the tortillas were soggy, which overpowered the rest of the flavors.  The burritos were just ok and were filled with the same filling as the tacos along with scrambled eggs.. . Overall, it was a unique experience.  However, I probably wouldn't wait in line to try it again, especially since there are other Korean taco trucks (Calbi) that I've tried and thought tasted better.
