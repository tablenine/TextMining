Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Mastro's is my favorite steakhouse in Los Angeles. This is a BIG statement coming from me. The waiters are what takes this place to 5 stars for me. The way they describe the dishes make me feel like I am tasting what they are telling me. . . My favorite dishes at Mastro's are:. - Scallops appetizer. - Lobster Mash Potatoes. - Bone-In Filet (the best in town!!). . The atmosphere is great but a bit dark if you are sitting down stairs. The only down side to coming here is a wait some times even with reservations. . . Mastro's may be a bit pricey but its well worth the price.
