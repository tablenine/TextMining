Went on Sunday for the extended dineLA lunch, but they weren't serving it even though the dineLA had their menu listed as part of the extended dates. Needless to say, my friend and I were disappointed. Still we had a yummy brunch - ham and cheese omelet, eggs with truffle oil, applewood bacon, salmon tartare and chocolate brioche pudding. All very rich and tasty. We both had ond drink and were surprised to see the outrageous cost of one mimosa and cocktail. For the price and food, I recommend skipping brunch/lunch and doing dinner.
