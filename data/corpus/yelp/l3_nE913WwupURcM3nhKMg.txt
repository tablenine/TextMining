Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
The Umami burger left me totally confused.  It's so weird.  There is some odd sweetness too it that didn't agree with me which held it back from being one of the greatest of great burgers.  On the other hand the patty was spectacular.  The bun was good too, but there is too much butter on it (or whatever the greasy shiny coating is).  The thick butter taste is a crutch this burger doesn't need, and it ends up detracting from it.  I had to go with the namesake burger since this was my first trip, and I probably won't get it again.  Next time I plan on trying the port-stilton burger, which I think will be more up my alley.  It's easy to tell they have the ability to make an incredible burger, but this is a tenuous 4 stars right now.  My next burger will push it to either a 5 or a 3.. . The tempura onion rings are ok, but why not have all the tempura veggies then if you're making tempura?  The tempura is about the same as any Japanese restaurant would serve.  On their web page it looks like they cost $25, but it's really only $2.50.. . Boo for being out of the veggie burger (gf's need to eat too!). Yay for selling Cake Monkey. Yay for incredible quality meat. Boo for too much butter. Boo for crappy sauce (ketchup?) with the onion rings. Yay for fast pick up ordering compared to the horror stories of dining in.. Yay for a different, thoughtful burger with its own distinct taste.. Boo for the price (I'm a cheapskate).. Yay for my gf picking up the food even though she didn't order anything because they were out of veggie burgers, all so I could watch the Red Sox beat the Yankees on ESPN.. . Verdict:  Not as good as Father's Office, but could be.
