It wasn't absolutely magical and amazing. The fish tacos were alright... my boyfriend tried some of their other tacos and he said they were pretty damn good. Our server didn't seem to come by enough to refresh us on our beverages of the alcoholic persuasion. I just wasn't impressed. Wasn't bad, but I'm not begging anyone to go back.
