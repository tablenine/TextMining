I had the pastrami sandwich, quite plain.  Not much too it. The Hat in Alhambra or in Pasadena is a jillion times better.  It had a decent stack of pastrami on regular slices of oval loaf type of bread, but the sandwich is small for $11.  No sides, if it wasn't for the pickles that they had on the table comp, it would have totally been not worthwhile.  I asked if there was a dip or anything and the waiter said no, just mustard and that's the way they make it.  I had the matzo ball soup here a while back and the matzo ball was like tasteless white bread dunked into clear chicken broth.  My friends had the tuna melt and the turkey sandwich, both $10. For some reason, their sandwiches came with cold slaw on the side.  Both of them only ate half of their sandwiches.  My friend and I agreed that the floor is slipperly in certain spots.  I wouldn't come back here - this is a historical LA restaurant with mediocre food, outdated interior and updated prices.  Open 24/7.
