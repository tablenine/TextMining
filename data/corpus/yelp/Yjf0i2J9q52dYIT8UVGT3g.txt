After a bridal show, our group converged here for a late afternoon lunch. The waiter was very friendly in helping us out with ordering the appropriate drinks and more than accommodating when some of our orders were misinterpreted. I tried one of their clear ciders and it was delicious! Forgot the name though... Parking was cheap after validation, easy to find, and lots to do around the area.
