"What that place with no sign?". . I had only had Pho in Korea Town, so I was surprised when a friend asked if i wanted to go get Pho around the Silverlake area. Â We pulled up to the cramped parking lot and went into the non-descriptive facade, that had just a row of benches and a row of seats. . . It was great. Pho is always filling and this place doesn't differ. . . It was a quick meal with a good ambiance. Great prices. Quick service.. . Ended up talking to the couple sitting next me that had a one-year-old, that was having his first Pho experience. Talk about hip. I didn't have Pho until I moved to Korea town three years ago.
