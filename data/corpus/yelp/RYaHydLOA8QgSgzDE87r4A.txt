FINALLY!  someone brings REAL japanese food to chicago!  japan is much much more than sushi.  most people have no idea what that luscious country has to offer the world.  and one beautiful thing is hand made noodles :-). .  i went alone, sat at the bar &amp; ordered the cold housemade soba-buckwheat noodles with nori, yuzu, wasabi soy-dashi dipping broth with a side of tempura.  ahh...even in japan its rare to have the noodles prepared by the chef with his name on the door.  i could see him in the tiny kitchen preparing them.  what a treat!. . my noodles were light, simple, tasty, perfect.  not surprising.  what was surprising was the tempura!  i am not a fan of tempura, but since it was offered by the waitress, why not?  it's my birthday.  it was the best tempura i've ever eaten in my life.  a couple generous size prawns, some sweet potatoes, a couple of long beans, some zucchini &amp; hot green japanese chili peppers-what a thrill!  those really caught me off guard.  with a couple of hitachino nest white ales, i left satisfied &amp; happy.. i will return weekly until i've eaten my way through the entire menu.  thank you, takashi.. . itadakimasu!
