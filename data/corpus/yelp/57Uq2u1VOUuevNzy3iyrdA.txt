I guess I will add my name to the mixed reviews of this place.. . Service was very good, decor very interesting. The place was pretty busy, in a good way. Trendy room, but warm and inviting, not cold and stark.. . The food, however, was just average. And for the price, average won't do. If I am going to pay $17 - $26 for stir-fry dishes, they had better be stunning! Think about it this way - if you went into a really fancy Italian place, say Cocco Pazzo or Cafe Spiaggia, the pasta dishes would be $14 - $18 and would be fantastico. In my mind, a good pasta dish is like a good stir fry - a nice sauce to ladle over lots of carbs. It certainly isn't rocket science, especially so close to Chinatown. It's PEASANT food for f's sake, just like pasta, just like a big honkin' burrito, just like shepard's pie. Can you imagine paying $20+ dollars for shepard's pie?. . Anyway, we had firecracker chicken, slow-roasted salmon and the peking duck service. Portions were immense and the food was good, but in the end it was still basically stir-fry. I have eaten out a lot in Chinatown and you might not get the ambience this place has, but you'll get the food at half the prices almost anywhere just down Archer about a mile from here.
