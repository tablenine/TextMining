Kim B. thinks the Mai Tai is the devil's drink.  I wouldn't go that far but they are pretty strong and on Mai Tai night (Thursday) when they're only $5, they can be quite dangerous.  I got the pleasure of sitting at the bar and watching them mass produce the Mai Tais for customers greedily yearning to imbibe them and there's a lot of liquor in there packing all that punch.  They have an excellent price-to-punch ratio.. . It's definitely a bit tacky but fun.  I mean, really, just let it go and stop taking yourself so seriously and you'll enjoy it.  They have an assortment of tiki-style drinks in addition to the Mai Tai, as well as beers and standard cocktails, too.  There are specials every weeknight so you're not just limited to Mai Tai Thursday.  Although, Mai Tai Thursday does feature Tongo Hiti performing excellent renditions of Abba, Springsteen, Journey, Styx and the "Titanic" theme song.  The crowd is pretty diverse with the common thread that pretty much everyone is there to throw back and have fun.. . I can't speak to most of the food but, in light of the expected number of Mai Tais I would consume and the fact that I hadn't eaten dinner, I tried the calamari and the crab Rangoon appetizers.  The calamari was actually very good and very welcomed.  The crab Rangoon was good, too, and I was pleased that it featured more crab than cream cheese which set it apart from other typical crab Rangoons.. . I will definitely return here for Mai Tai night and I look forward to enjoying their other specials, too.
