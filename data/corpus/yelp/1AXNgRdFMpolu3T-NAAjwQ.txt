This place is old school at its best. My dad and I always come here before we go to Loyola basketball games- it's become a tradition over the last few years. The burgers never disappoint- big, juicy, covered in whatever cheese you like and fresh lettuce and onion. Beware, the onion can be pretty strong. The fresh cut fries that come with the burger are my favorite fries- anywhere- period. It's a hell of a lot of food for the money.. Perhaps the best deal here is a pitcher of Anchor Steam for $9. This is an ale brewed in San Francisco that absolutely tastes great with their burgers. . The waitstaff can be a little slow; I think it's just that they have them covering too many tables. It's dark inside, the tables are too close together, they accept cash only, and you're sitting in plastic chairs indoors. So what? This place rocks, and in my opinion, the only better burgers are the ones I make on the grill at home!
