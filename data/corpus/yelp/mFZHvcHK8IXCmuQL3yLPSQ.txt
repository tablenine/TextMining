Aside for having to spend 45 minutes waiting at the bar with a reservation we had a really nice dinner here last night.. .  I was really excited to try the chinese pork buns but they turned out to be only the letdown of the evening, the bun being cold/almost stale and the pork being just a little too fatty. I understand that fatty is kind of the point but still, this was absurd. The rack of lamb with blue cheese polenta that my girlfriend got was amazing. I was in the mood for steak so I got the flat-iron which was about as good as flat-iron steak can get (that cut of beef just lacks the fat content necessary to make a really tasty steak). And their duck-fat fries were crisp and delicious. Zeppoles for dessert were fucking incredible. Great service at the bar and at the table.
