Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
i remember when i first moved to LA, and at my FIRST job in LA, a coworker brought in a box of portos pastries. i had these for the first time, about 3 years ago, and it was the spinach and feta croissant. outside of paris, france, i've never tasted a better croissant, until portos. after eating portos that first time 3 years ago, i never had the opportunity to go back. this time, i was actually in glendale, and got a chance to have lunch with a friend at the actual store. aside from it being super crowded, everything was perfect. i had the fresh squeezed orange juice, spinach and feta croissant again, and the pastrami sandwich. EVERYTHING was so delicious. i think what made the pastrami sandwich so good was not only the bread it was on (piled generously high with pastrimi), but the fact that it was under $5. the entire meal i had was $9, and i couldn't finish it. pastries here are from heaven, all for an unreal low price. i only wish i could've gone to portos more when i lived in LA...
