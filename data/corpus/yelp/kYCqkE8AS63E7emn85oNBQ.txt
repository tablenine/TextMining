8 dishes, 4 TsingDao beer, and $170 later... equals 6 happy fat people.. . We came here for my dad's 60th birthdate and one of the best meals ever!  Can you believe it?  We've lived in SGV for 18 years and my parents have never been to Newport until this time?  What was wrong with them?!?!?  The meal was amazing, the best dishes were obviously the House special Lobster (I'd say about 90% of the tables that night had a lobster on it), Basil Clams, Walnut Shrimp, French Beef, and Kung Pao Beef (as an Asian, I normally would not order "Kung Pao" anything, but it is damn good here).  To a bigger surprise, neither of my sisters have ever been here as well, so it was definitely a good discovery for them, for they will be back next month to get some more of the delicious house special Lobster!. . I think the 50+ reviews for this place speaks for itself, so no need for me to add more to it, then YOU SHOULD TRY THEIR LOBSTER, but bring CASH.
