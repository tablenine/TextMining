Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Mixed feelings about this place.. . I will agree with the people who say that the service at this place is NOT the best. The waiters/bus boys/etc. were a little bit rude and were never friendly-- but this kind of service in an Asian restaurant isn't a surprise to me. Frankly, if you're looking to eat at a place where you want and expect to be a bit friendlier with the person serving you... don't come here!. . Now for the good parts!. . We went here for a birthday as a big group. I think that is definitely the ONLY good reason to go to this restaurant. It's good fun. They literally shower the birthday person with two bottles of champagne until they are begging for it to end! It's so funny! . . It is also entertaining when they other customers go the extra mile with their birthday celebration. In our case, a group of Japanese guys stripped down to their swim shorts and marched around the restaurant before getting sprayed with champagne.. . The food was all right. Not the best, but I can't say it was horrible either. I ended up eating my fill and was satisfied with the taste of the meat. I didn't expect organic, amazing meat... just good ol' Korean BBQ. . . Overall, don't go expecting a nice, sit down Korean BBQ meal. Go for the party!
