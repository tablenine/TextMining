Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I've bumped this place up to 5 stars.  The acoustics seem to be just as bad in the main room, but there seem to be viable alternatives now.  It's way better at the "counter"--a room with counters up against 3 walls.  Apparently there's seating in the back with heat lamps too.  That might be a to-go dining area since I didn't see waiters going over there.. . The burgers are delicious, just like last time.  I shared an umami burger and a triple pork burger with someone.  The umami burger is pretty good, but the triple pork is like it's hotter, more successful sister--at the end of the day I'd just rather put my lips on her.  Really though, to say it's flavorful is an understatement.  It's like the first bite was an earthquake of taste in my mouth and then there were successive aftershocks of flavor.  Layers upon layers.  I may be unable to go here again and NOT order the triple pork.
