Restaurant: DBA Barbecue
Category: Southern
Definitely a fan of DBA. Having only had catered DBA prior to this past Monday I went in knowing I loved their ribs, but found that they have taken over this little knitch in Atlanta quite nicely with an adequate bar, nice patio and plenty of seating. We were there for awesome guest bartender night with Becca Grant, woo hoo! Can't beat $1 Yuengling's and their 2 meat platters were plenty for dinner and lunch the next day for me and my husband. If you like BBQ you have to add DBA to your list and make sure to try the Mac &amp; Cheese and Green Beans, they are great and they DO have vegetarian options, which is nice.
