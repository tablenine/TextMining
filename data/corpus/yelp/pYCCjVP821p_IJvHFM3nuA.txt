Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Yuuuuuummmmmm! Split slices of pizza so I tried three - mac n cheese, chicken taco, and tortellini. All were pretty awesome but tortellini was my favorite. Let's just say I'll be craving this pizza till I get back there - and excited to try some more! Yuuuuummmmmm again!. . AND recently went back - tried the carne asada.  yum yum yum.  I just think you cannot go wrong here!  I tried little nibbles of all of my friend's pizza when we were here too - probably 4 more kinds - all awesome!  Always look forward to being in the Ian's vicinity!
