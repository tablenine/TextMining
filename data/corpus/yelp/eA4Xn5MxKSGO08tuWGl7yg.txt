Restaurant: Fox Bros Bar-B-Q
Category: Barbeque
Having driven past Fox Bros. a few times and also hearing good things from others, we were anxious to try it out last night.  My conclusion is that the food is only as good as people say IF you haven't had really excellent barbecue anywhere else.  In other words, Fox Bros. may be the best BBQ in Atlanta proper, but it ain't the best BBQ within reasonable driving distance (which, for the record, I think is about an hour).  I've definitely had better.. . The fried pickles were great--I had actually never had them before.  Crunchy, sour, and totally addictive.  Boyfriend's brisket was bland and not very warm, as were the tots and fried okra on the side.  I had a bit more luck--the chicken was really good, with a great smoky flavor and surprising moistness.  The pulled pork was respectable, though I would have liked a little finer pull.  I didn't put BBQ sauce on anything, since the smoke flavor was so prevalent--but speaking of the BBQ sauce, it was way too watery for my liking.  It did have a nice smoky chile flavor, though.  The mac 'n cheese was nothing special, thought it was hot, which I appreciated.  The potato salad had potential, but it didn't have any zip or tang or anything--so it fell into the bland category with most of the side dishes.. . An app, a one-meat platter, and a two-meat platter, plus a pitcher of 420, and we were out almost $60 bucks (with tip).  While I'm happy to have a decent BBQ option in the neighborhood, I think next time I have a craving, I'll take half of that tab, put some gas in my car, and drive outside of Atlanta to one of the many other great 'cue joints.
