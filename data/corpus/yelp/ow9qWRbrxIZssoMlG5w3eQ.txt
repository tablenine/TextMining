Left the house early because I thought there would have been a line.  When I got there it was quite empty and I believe we beat the church crowd.. . So finally I got around to trying Oinkster and here I was expecting some awesome pastrami and bbq pulled pork sandwiches.  When I take my bite... nothing.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a good sandwich but nothing amazing.  I would say the food is "slow fast food" done right but not done perfectly.. . I do like the fries, they have a very good crisp to them and they stay crispy even after they cool off but the amount of interior potato flavor is lacking.  Then again what do I expect for $3 fries?. . It's in a nice location and in a quiet town, sort of a local place I suppose but I'd rather stay over on my side of the bridge in Arcadia then try getting out the door to beat the lines again.
