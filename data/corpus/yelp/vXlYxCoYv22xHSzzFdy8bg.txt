Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
Ping Pong is AWESOME!. . I moved to Lakeview from Old Town, and the biggest complaint I had was the small number of good dinner spots within walking distance. Enter Ping Pong:. . Ping Pong shines with its well-balanced main dishes and really trendy appetizers, with the salt &amp; pepper calamari and tuna tartar topping the list. It's not going to appear in "Le Guide Michelin" and for better tuna tartar I'd go to Le Colonial, but for great food that's quite affordable it's become my staple.. . If you haven't visited Ping Pong in a while, you might want to note that they have done away with a few favorites:. . 1) They no longer take your cell when you place a reservation. I used to LOVE this feature, since it allowed you to shop on Broadway while waiting to be called to dinner.. . 2) BYOB is now only allowed inside. I'm not sure if they were ever allowed to serve outside, but for the first two years, nobody seemed to care. Kind of puts a damper on the excitement of brining a great Riesling or Gewurztraminer if you can't eat outside.. . 3) They no longer will chill your wine in their fridge while you wait. Long waits could result in warm whites.... . Even without these perks, Ping Pong is still one of the top places I take out-of-towners hands down.
