Seafood Shack-ish place in Grant Park. Lovely new building just opened with a kick ass rooftop bar. I love the bloody mary with a raw oyster on a morning after a long night. Get's the juices flowing again, if you know what I mean. Shrimp tacos, seafood stew, fried okra, rat toes, and the scallops all rock here. Good beer list too.
