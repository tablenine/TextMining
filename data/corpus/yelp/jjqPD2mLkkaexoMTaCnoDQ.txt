Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I've been to Kopi Travelers Cafe a total of three times. The food there is very good. I love the inside of this place, and in the summer it's fun to sit out in the sun and watch all the dogs trot past. The food is simple, yet unique in its own small cafe way. The drinks are fantastic and I love the huge variety of juices, coffees, and teas. Having the option to create your own juice is pretty awesome, too.. . I love the upper floor seating in the front of this place and the nifty little store in the back. It's a pretty comfortable cafe. My only complaint is the wait staff. They're not overly friendly there and I always get this feeling that they would rather be elsewhere. It's the kind of place you don't know if you're supposed to pay at the front or wait for the waitress to come back. And after about 15 or 20 minutes some different waiter might take the bill for you.. . Besides that, I'm still a fan!
