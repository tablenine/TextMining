OK.... First of all I want to say that the ambiance from the moment you walked in was so romantic and cute. The lighting was perfect and I thought that everyone there was so attentive to us and helpful. They had a great wine list and the appetizers were quick and great.. . Halfway through my meal I noticed someone familiar seated at the table next to us... It was Ron Howard, how funny! It was weird but he was just another guy having some dinner with friends. . . FYI... The figs wrapped in prosciutto were to die for!
