Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
WOW! what a lovely place. I attend Mastro's Steakhouse on my last birthday with my family. I found that it is the best in prices. they impressed me with lovely food. I like it very much. the interior of Mastro is fantastic. It is the second most attractive part after a good taste of this venue. . atmosphere of Mastro is also very good. friendliness or polite staff, they know how to treat a customer. I became a fan of this beautiful place. thanks to CA to have a such nice spot of food.
