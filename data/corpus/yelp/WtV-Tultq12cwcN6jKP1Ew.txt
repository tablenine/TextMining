Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Yummyyyyyyy my favorite deep dish in Chicago! I always bring out-of-town guests who want to try Chicago-style pizza to Lou's.  I'm not a fan of Giordanos which I find to be way too heavy.  . . I've had several variations, but my favorite combo is sausage, mushroom, onions and roma tomatoes.  Start off with a Malnati's salad and you're good to go! . . P.S. I like the ambiance of this location more than the Lincoln Park restaurant.
