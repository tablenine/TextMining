Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Orochon and I have a long history of abuse...which is pretty one-sided since I always leave defeated. . The first three times I went there, I chose to do the "Special #2" challenge which really shouldn't be legal. You're pretty much given their spiciest ramen and 30 minutes to eat all the noodles/drink all the broth.. . The Special #2 is seriously the spiciest thing I have ever eaten. Don't even try it unless you're some kind of masochist. I'll sum it up for you...The first bite of it will make your tongue writhe in pain (note how I don't describe the taste because BURNING is not a taste). After a while, your endorphins will kick in and you will become jittery. And finally, you will lose your sense in taste all together which will make you believe u can finish the bowl, but you really wont. The reason people don't finish the challenge is because of the broth. The noodles are easy to finish but that neon orange broth is just wrong and shouldn't be consumed. After my first attempt at the challenge, I left defeated with less than a cup of the broth left, and as I walked outside, I collapsed in pain and couldn't move until my dad ran across the street to buy me some tums. Moral of the story: just don't do the Special #2. . However after failing the challenge 3 times (because I'm stupid), I went back again and tried a regular #2 with a soy Â sauce base which was good. It made me regret doing the Special #2 so many times before. It has just the right amount of spiciness and overall I enjoyed the bowl. So solely based off the regular menu, I give the place 4 stars, but if I rated it off of the Special #2, I would give it a negative 2 stars just because I don't believe that customers should be leaving restaurants in pain.
