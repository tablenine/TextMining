Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Late saturday night just after leaving Mullen's, my friends and I were headed down Clark with the idea that we would trek all the way out to The Weiner Circle when I had to do a double take at the cornucopia of Pizza that passed me by on my left. I had to look up the name of Ian's this morning because that night all I could think was, "Need!". . The ordering process was simple enough, I stared open mouthed at such a wide variety that I eventually had to point and mumble "pineapple and whatever" and they shuffled me along to pay. It turned out to be pineapple and chicken and i was absolutely satisfied. My girlfriend didn't finish her Mac N Cheese and I was more than happy to oblige, waste not friends.. . Overall, for $3.75 you can have almost anything your little heart desires and the spot is what it will hit when you inhale your slice in record time. Dig it.
