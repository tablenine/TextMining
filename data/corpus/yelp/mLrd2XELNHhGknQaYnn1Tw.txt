Strange how this truck has become a phenomenon on wheels.. . Anyway long story short.... tracked it down on twitter. waited in the massively long line. found out the rainy day special- short rib quesadilla was sold out. ordered a $2 tofu taco. waited some more for our food. ate the sour/tangy tofu taco. wasn't impressed.. . Maybe because I was full from stuffing myself at happy hour but I would not pay $2 for their itty bitty tofu taco again. It was like a korean side dish on top of a corn tortilla. I can't say anything for their meaty options but yeah won't be following them too eagerly.
