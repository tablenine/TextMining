OH.. MY.. GOD.. . This place is awful.  Gotta love the Dolce Group.  Between DG and SBE, LA nightlife spots are going to turn into characterless carbon copies of eachother.. . At any rate, what used to be a beautiful space with a nice courtyard is now a beautiful space with a nice courtyard + awful bartenders, $12 drinks with charcoal filtered well vodka, and a strange entrance from a pothole-filled parking lot.
