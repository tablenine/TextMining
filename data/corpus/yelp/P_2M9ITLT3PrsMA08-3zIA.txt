We hoofed it to Coobah last weekend for brunch because, dang it, we were too starving to make it all the way to Deleece.  Our hungry tummies urged us to sit inside at the bar anticipating faster service and while I guess I don't know how fast regular table service is, I thought things went a bit too slow at the bar.  At least the space is uniquely decorated, so aside from my stomach devouring itself, it was enjoyable to sit there.... . I was intrigued by the blue corn pancakes with the canela-cinnamon butter and rum-ancho maple syrup, but somehow forgot that I DON'T LIKE corn tortillas or corn bread or corn stuff, generally... And sadly, the butter and syrup did not save these pancakes for my apparently anti-corn taste buds.  It just tasted off and the butter was oddly grainy.  Cinnamon isn't grainy.  Use superfine sugar or honey next time, kiddies.. . Anyhoo, while I wasn't thrilled with my dish, Justin's sister had "the best reuben ever" and Justin enjoyed his porkalicious Sandwich Coobah (roast pork, serrano ham, smoked ham, baby swiss in a bocadillo roll).  The steak fries were eaten, but not particularly enjoyed.  We didn't partake in what looked like some tasty inebriators, but I'd be happy to sit outside and sip a mojito sometime.  As long as no corn is involved.
