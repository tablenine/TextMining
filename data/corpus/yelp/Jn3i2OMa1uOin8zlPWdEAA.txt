Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
My review for Comme Ca is a little late - I dined here in Nov 2008 for a friend's birthday. The meal was delicious and the wine... the WINE.. the pinot noir was amazing! . . Our party started off with french onion soup, roasted beef marrow and oxtail jam and, forgive my lapse in memory, I believe we also had an app that I think had caramelized onions and cheese on flatbread. The entrees ranged from the roasted chicken to steak frites to coq au vin. We all sampled each other's dishes and everything was delicious, especially the chicken! I also remember drinking bottles and bottles of wine and not being able to finish our dinner because EVERYONE was hammered. Good freakin' times. . . The damage? I think approx $170 per person. . . I recommend to others and I'd definitely go back... (maybe after I go down my list of TO TRY French restaurants).
