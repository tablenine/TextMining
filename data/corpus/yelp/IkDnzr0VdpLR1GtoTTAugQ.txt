Located in the W Hotel/Midtown, the place is lovely and swanky and sexy and fun - all except what the poor waiters have to wear - some serious long shirt wrap around thing that goes to the knees with matching pants.  Very Indian looking, but in purple.  Not buying it.  The decor is spot on and the lamps give a nice hue over the place.. . And then there is the food.  Everything we had was excellent - from the spiced chicken samosas and tuna tartar for appetizers to the cod with Malaysian chili-sauce (pictured) and the spicy Shanghai noodles for dinner.  The cocktails were yummy as well.  I had a lychee raspberry Bellini to start with and the others got a few of the ginger margaritas with fresh ginger and ginger salt.  If I liked ginger, I would have loved these.  All drinks were well made and worth the price since the ingredients were very fresh.. . Had we had time, we would have stayed for dessert, but alas, we had to get to the new comedy show at the vortex's laughing skull lounge- which by the way, is great fun.  Alison and I will certainly be back to The Spice Market.  We enjoyed walking through the W Hotel as it is sexy as well.  Thank God we actually got a little dressy to go out this night.  And I am sure the concierge and parking guys loved the red sheet for the dogs in the back seat of my Prius.  Let me just say classy came to the W!
