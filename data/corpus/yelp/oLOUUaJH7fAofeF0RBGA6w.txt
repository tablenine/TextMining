Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Went there a long time ago but never reviewed it.  Finally went back last night for dinner so figured I'd catch up on finally reviewing this place.. . We came right around dinner time and it was an hour and half wait but luckily, they squeezed us in so our wait ending up being maybe 10 mins or so.  Everything was great as usual.  My friend and I both had the Lawry's cut prime rib with creamed corn.  So good!!!. . Service was excellent.
