Good quick Taiwanese food.  Some of my favorites are sausage rice, ground meat with brown sauce noodle, and dumplings.  Only downside is there may be a wait but usually not for too long.  If you don't like to wait you may want to try another nearby Taiwanese restaurant called Old Country Cafe in Temple City.  I had the watermelon juice at both places and Old Country's is better.
