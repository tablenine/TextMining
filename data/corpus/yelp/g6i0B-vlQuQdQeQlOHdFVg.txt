This place gets an A for effort, but that is about it.  Yes, the food was fresh, but I've never really come across any bad fish here in ATL.  The atmosphere was quaint and cozy, very pleasing to the Spartan eye.  I did enjoy my meal, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  For the same price, I could go to Harry's and get three times as many menu choices and also have enough room to swing my chopsticks if I so chose.  I'll come back to Wasabi, but only if someone else is footing the bill.
