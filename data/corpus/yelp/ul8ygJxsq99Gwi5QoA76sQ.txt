I love this place!  The taiwan sausage is the best I ever had.  Everytime I go to a new taiwanese cafe I try their sausage, and I have yet to find anything comparable.  I would still eat there even with their health violations.  For all those people complaining about health violations, have you ever left America?  . . The only down part to Sinbala is the long waits, but try to avoid the rush hour time and you will be fine.. Next time I am out in Arcadia, I will definitely go there again.
