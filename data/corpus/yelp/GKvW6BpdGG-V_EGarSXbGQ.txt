Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
it was 2:31 am on a saturday night and I had just come from a bar...my feet hurt, I'm hungry, I'm tired..I should sleep, but I'm more hungry than tired...so we head to Fred 62's for some hearty diner food. We get there and there's a line...it's cold, I just want to sit down inside, and then the moment of truth...the waitress says..."it'll be about 20-30 minutes."  I'm appalled...I'm so hungry and cold.  I think she notices my desperation and offers me leniency in the form of "If you give me $20, I'll get you that table" (and she points to an empty booth.  "Really?  I can have it now?" "yea" she responds...I think about it..."You gotta make up your mind quick because I have other people on this list." Thoughts of bribery, her audacity, my hunger and freezing level run thru my mind..."ok" and I hand her my $20.  We're seated immediately.  who would have thought?  . . after burgers, omelettes, po boy sandwiches and fries later, we're all completely satiated.  I'm assed out $20 but at least i didn't have to wait, so...it was worth it.
