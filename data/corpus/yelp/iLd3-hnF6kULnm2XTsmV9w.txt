I love bringing friends to this place, especially newbies to LA. It's SO LA (if you know what I mean). Trendy, organic, and a bit expensive. You may spot a celeb there. But as a coffee lover, you cannot compete with this. . . As for me, if it's good coffee, I drink it black. I drink my coffee black at La Mill. The clover coffee and siphon coffee is so clean. Last time I got the Guatemalan bean, which was about medium bold and a chocolatey flavor. My one complaint, though, is that they don't do the siphon coffee at your table anymore! Maybe it's a liability or something. That was so fun before. . . Breakfast is good. You have to get the doughnut holes with the Madagascar cream!!!! Do it!!! It's the best. I often get the huevos "blanchet" which is scrambled eggs with salmon and asparagus. I like the smaller sized portions and nice conversations with friends you can have. . . Gets busier and busier every time I go. Bummer, but I'll still drop in every now and then.
