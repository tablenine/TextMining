I love this place!!! I love the Hainan chicken and i love the ginger sauce. I can never get enough of the chicken and the rice. Whenever i go here, i ask for lots of ginger sauce. Lol. And the freshly brewed iced tea is great too to go along with the meal. Even though the restaraunt is small and crowded, it's worth it. And cheap too. I will definately continue going here for my cravings for hainan chicken. And the service is excellent.
