*Drinks only*. . I was pleasantly surprised by the Mercer.  After a work event at a nearby gallery, we were looking for a place to sit down and have a drink before dispersing.  Much to my dismay, the group vetoed Pegu Club ("too far"), so we headed here instead.  I was in the mood for a margarita, and this one was way above par, and even came with candied ginger -- you know this girl appreciates the use of fresh ingredients.. . On top of that, our waitress seated us immediately and was professional and super-friendly (but still cool and not creepy -- you know that type).  And we saw Spike Lee as he was leaving.  Bonus!. . Three stars because you can't sit in the sexy little library area, which was reserved for hotel guests but in plain sight of us unwashed masses (can't even sit there when it's otherwise empty).  It's also pricey, so it gets judged on a higher standard.   However, the Mercer Hotel has the potential to earn more stars based on the food / dining experience, and while it may no longer be the "it" place for NY nightlife, I think it's still a stylish, centrally-located Soho spot for decent drinks and celeb.-sightings on the side.
