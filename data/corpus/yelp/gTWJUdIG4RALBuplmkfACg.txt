By far one of my favorite restaurants.. . And not because almost every time I've come here it was free.. . I'm not going to tell you how ate for zero dinero, but I would like to say for the record that I'm NOT a moocher.  With that, let me begin:. . The Chilean sea bass was delectable and melted in my mouth.  You'll see a section on the menu that it was served to the Emperor &amp; Empress of Japan in the 90's.  Royalty worthy?  I certainly concur.. . I had a piece of my husband's seared yellow Fin Tuna &amp; Duck Foie Gras...WOW was it good!  funny, I don't even really like foie gras.  The subtle flavors blended in such a lovely way...i can't tell you how much I wanted to do a bait and switch.  But the human decency within me made me stop. After all, I married the guy.. . The flourless chocolate cake w/ the espresso ice was a chocolate lover's dream!  it did seem a bit like a lava cake, but not as mushy.  A definite show stopper :). . I've also tried the champagne sunday brunch, and for $36 it's totally worth it!  The chef himself is usually at the carving table to explain some of the buffet items.  I found myself having a hard time eating like a proper lady when all i wanted to do was shove every item into my mouth and chug my mimosa to wash it all down.. . Try it, your tastebuds will thank you endlessly.
