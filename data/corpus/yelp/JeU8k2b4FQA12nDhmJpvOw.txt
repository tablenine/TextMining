Oh my fuggin gosh. Lamb fuggin double dipped sandwich. . . Seriously the lamb literally falls apart as soon as it hits your mouth. So freaking good and flavorful. Best french dip sandwich I've had everrrrrr. Macaroni and potato salad are just that. Nothing fancy schmancy, just a side to the real show, but also necessary to complete the meal. Favorite part is how iced tea and lemonades are under a buck - transports you back to the good ole' days. . . OH and warning - be careful with their hot mustard. By hot they mean a kick in the back of your throat all the way up your nose haha. It's packed full of horseradish and punches you but perfect in small doses.
