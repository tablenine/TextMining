You know the food is delicious when you spontaneously begin planning a trip to its country of origin during your meal.  Greece wasn't near the top of the list of countries I'm planning to go visit soon, but it moved up several notches today.  Any country that serves food like this is a country I want to visit.  Funny - I've had Greek food before, too; apparently, the other places didn't give it the justice it deserved.. . Why didn't I come here sooner?  I've lived near the place for years, but for some reason I've always tried to go on a Monday or at some other time when they were closed.. . Fun, fun, fun!  Great food, a market with lots of fun items, including Greek wines and spirits, olive oils, vinegars, etc, etc, etc.. . I really loved the sizzling feta cheese plate.  Three slabs of really zesty feta, slightly charred tomatos and a few olives.
