Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
The L.A. Times had this interesting article on poetry, notes, messages, and random musings scribbled on paper and stored in the drawers of a chess table in Alcove's 'back' room. (See . http://www.latimes.com.... ).. . Hummmm... who on earth sits in the back room of Alcove when this place has one of the prettiest patios in the neighborhood? Plenty of folks, so the story goes, so I'll be sneaking a peek at those notes on the next rainy day.... . Otherwise, find me and most people on the OUTside of this lovely cafe. Food is simple; quality is solid -- I like the salmon salad and the burgers. If you're not in the mood for a meal, a nice glass of wine or a cup of tea and dessert can make one very happy here too.
