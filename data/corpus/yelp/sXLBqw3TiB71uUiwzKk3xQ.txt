Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
The first time I had Kogi was when I was a student at UCLA.... . They were there... on the corner of Gayley/Strathmore before their taco trucks got super, super, SUPER popular.. . All their tacos were DELISH - juicy and succulent; perfect with the crunchy radishes.... . ...but then they left Gayley/strathmore and moved on to bigger adventures :( ... and I moved back to the OC after graduating. . . I haven't had Kogi for 4 months... Oh, how I miss them. . . I wish they would open a Korean Cantina in the OC (near Buena Park!). One can only dream.
