Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Yes, I'm a late bloomer and have not been to Roscoe's prior to coming here this weekend. I was in serious need of sobering up after our pub crawl through downtown L.A. and Roscoe's did the trick. As a first timer, I was convinced to try the Scoes #1 meal. It consisted of two pieces of chicken (I'm a white meat eater) and 2 huge portions of waffles. Can I just say that these are probably the best tasting waffles I've ever had? I want the recipe! I've had better chicken but with a ravenous appetite @ 2am, it was delish. Chicken and waffles...what a concept. I will definitely be back!
