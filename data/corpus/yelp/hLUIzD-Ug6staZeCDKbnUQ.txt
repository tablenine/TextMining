Really the food isn't that great but if you're looking for a nice place for a group to go and have dinner and drinks its perfect, and the location is great, right in hollywood.. . Their rolls aren't the best for sushi lovers but it gets its job done.. Drinks are definitely more appetizing, try the lychee martini.. . Make sure if you have a larger group ask for a table near the bar upstairs and more of a romantic ambience ask for downstairs or a room
