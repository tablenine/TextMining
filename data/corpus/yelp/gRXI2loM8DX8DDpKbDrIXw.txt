Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Three little Asian girls walked into Roscoe's last Friday in the middle of the afternoon and were swept into Roscoe's to get their bellies filled. . . Half a chicken with two waffles, candied yams, and corn bread. . . All of the chicken was delicious and moist. Even the breast! And the crispy skin! Ohhhhh. It took so much self-control to leave the little fatty bits behind. . . Waffles have something special in them. Like cinnamon and brown sugar? It felt so good after the meal to burp and remember my waffle memories of waffles dipped in butter and syrup.. . Yams were a little too sweet. I know that they're candied, but they were floating in their syrup.. . Corn bread was kind of dry. I like my cornbread with butter and creamed corn baked into it. . . The restroom is AMAZING! So clean and automatic! Exactly what a 21st century bathroom should be. Â . . The service was super friendly and quick. The bathroom was closed for repairs at the end of our visit and I had to go so bad that our waitress let me use the staff restroom! It was nice too but not as nice as the one for the patrons. I think that they deserve a 21st century bathroom too. Maybe one day...
