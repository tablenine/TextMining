Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
Buckhead Diner is flashy, with colored lights drawing attention from the streets. I expected little from the food, assuming that this restaurant was more about the trendy crowd and ambiance. However, my shrimp with white wine sauce and pasta was impossibly fresh and delicious. I also had a creamy key lime dessert with strawberry sauce. I was tormented by my tight outfit, as I wanted to eat the whole thing but I felt I shouldn't. Damn. The piece that got away.... . I recommend this restaurant for a date. The food is delicious, the wait staff is attentive, and the ambiance is equally enjoyable.
