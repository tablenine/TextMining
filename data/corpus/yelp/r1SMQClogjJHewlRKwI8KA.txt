I have only been here once, but I am dying to go back!  My husband and I went there for an early dinner, and we were practically the only people in the place.  The room is very tasteful and elegant, and the food was spectacular.  Our waiter helped us create a great vegetarian dining experience.  Everything we ordered was fantastic(the pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas were particularly good), and the service was exceptional...friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.  I want to come back for the live music sometime, as well!
