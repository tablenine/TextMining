I've been to Hub 51 a number of times because it's right down the street from work and a great spot to go for dinner and drinks after work. This time around I went for lunch.. . Typically I start with the hummus which is wonderful, but I went around with the guacamole and chips, which turned out to be a great decision! Chips were lightly fried, salsa was spicy, and the guacamole was really good. I'm not a big fan of chunky guacamole and Hub 51's is a little creamier, which I like. . . For my main dish I went with their Grilled Vegetarian "Burger". This veggieburger is made up of lentils, pintos, chilies, and shredded cheddar cheese. I opted out of the cheese. Unfortunately, the waitress said that the burger isn't vegan, but it's the best option for all vegetarians. I have to point out that the best part about a veggieburger is when it falls apart when you eat it. I love that! It feels like the chef just made the burger 20 minutes ago against a hard, frozen patty. Props for that! For my side I got the green salad with the "Hub" vinaigrette, light and flavorful. Better than getting heavy fries.. . Big fan of Hub 51. I love the music, atmosphere, and crowd. The service is attentive and helpful. The only reason I'm knocking off a star is because aside from the veggieburger and salad, you're left with little vegetarian, especially vegan, options. I highly recommend it for lunch and well-priced dinner!
