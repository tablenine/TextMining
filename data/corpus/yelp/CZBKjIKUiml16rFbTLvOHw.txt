So, I went there with 6 people Saturday night for 2 birthdays. It was the new location. The food was wonderful, BUT I WILL NEVER RETURN..... Service was non existent. The manager, a nice guy from the islands it appeared, was useless as well. Food auctioning was at its best. 20 minutes to get a diet coke with no ice, that finally showed up with ice. Entree came after we were there 40 minutes, BEFORE the appetizers.. Just spoke to friends who were there Friday, same....... Nobody cared. Once the manager was told of the issues, the server came back and apologized, then continued to forget about us........ Too bad, because the food was really good but not worth the trouble.
