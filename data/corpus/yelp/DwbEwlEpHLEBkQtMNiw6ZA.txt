Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Delicious, fresh Â meat! Great marinade! Excellent appetizer dishes! . . Only downfall: service can be slow.. . I've brought many people here and no one has ever been disappointed. In fact, I've had some co-workers come here that were cynical about this place, boasting that their KBBQ place was the best. Well, after leaving here, they shut right up. I can almost guarantee that you'll leave here with a satisfied belly!
