Another review from . http://www.PinkyArcade....  , where you play games and win prizes daily!. . Pros: EXCELLENT location at the top of a hill with beautiful garden, atmosphere, and seating.. Cons: Mediocre Japanese and American food, road is dark driving up and down.. Parking: Valet only for $7.50, but MAKE SURE you drive up to the top and not park yourself when you see a parking :) Don't bother trying to save money on parking because it's on top of the hill.. . I don't have much to say except that the place is just for the atmosphere and garden. The food isn't all that great as you can eat it anywhere for half the price. The only reason my wife and I came here to dine was because of the $50 Groupon certification we had. . . I ordered the Sushi entree and it's nothing special. My wife ordered the Korean Style Braised short ribs, which was very tender and soft. The sauce was GREAT and on top of mashed potatoes.. . The focus of the night was the desserts, but that was basically it.
