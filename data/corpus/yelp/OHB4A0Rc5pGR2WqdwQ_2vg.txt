I always trick myself into coming here. I say to myself, "I need to eat healthier, and 'greens' are healthy." However, I always end up ordering the platable, moist, grilled chicken (skin on), and the buttery, buttery, buttery, yukon gold mashed potatoes, and a just side of arugula salad (with dressing of course). Sometimes I'll even throw in a cup of soup if it is cold out.. . I've tried the line-caught tuna once, in efforts to be more "healthy." But the fish was bland and tasteless, and I immediately regreted straying from my norm.. . I enjoy sitting in the outdoor side area when the weather permits and watching the people line up to order.. . Go on Tuesday nights, there is a Farmer's Market around the corner.
