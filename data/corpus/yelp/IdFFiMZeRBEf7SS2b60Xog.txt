Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
The Counter suffers from the same syndrome that lots of restaurants do after to first opening.  The food just gets worse and worse.. . I've been coming here since it opened, and while I generally have good experience, each time is worse than before.  Now the buns are kind of stale, the ingredients kind of questionable, and my turkey burger gets progressively more burnt.. . I love the look and feel, it's one of the only places in the city you can get a martini and a milkshake, and the servers are always nice.  I love the options they offer, and the tv's they have are cool.. . Just don't serve me anymore crispy turkey burgers and stale buns, and I'll be back in business.
