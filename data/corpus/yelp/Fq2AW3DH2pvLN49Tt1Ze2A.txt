the toro takes the gold medal.  it melts in your mouth....hmmmm. . the service is good, and the food quality is excellent.  . . i tried to send the sushi chef a beer but our waitress didn't have an immensely strong grasp of the English language so we couldn't make it happen. . . when in the chi, i will return to wakamono
