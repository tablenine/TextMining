I've gone to a ton of BYOBs in the city and finally got the courage to drive up from the west side to go to HB.  Parking at 7:00 (Friday night) wasn't bad- there were plenty of places across from the 7-11, south of the restaurant on Halsted.  Unfortunately, I panicked early and parked on Belmont without even looking.  . Service was very good, waiter was nice and helpful with good recommendations.  Had the escargot w/mandarin orange slices, tomatoes, garlic etc.  Really good, interesting flavor combos, particularily since I'm used to getting them drenched in butter.  . Bf got the flank stead with blue cheese risotto- both items very good except that the steak could have been a little more rare (he indicated medium, but didn't really get that until the very center part of the steak).  This review would be 5 stars if the steak had just a bit more red.  I've always stayed away from flank steak thinking it'd be too chewy, but it wasn't at all!  I had the Cider Brined loin of pork which was also really good- very juicy and I loved the sauteed pear slices.  We had the Bread Pudding to finish, which was the perfect finish on a cold spring night.
