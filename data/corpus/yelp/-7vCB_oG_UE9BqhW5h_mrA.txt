Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
There's not a lot I can add to what previous reviews have said, as everything is pretty well covered ground.  I wholeheartedly agree that this place has the best pastrami I have ever had or will have.  I'm sure that there are other good menu items, but I've never strayed away from pastrami. . . I've never liked the area of the restaurant.  I used to work in the area, and we would walk to Langer's in large groups of people for safety sake.  That, and there's not much in the way of parking.  Thank goodness one of the guys who was in our lunch group was 6'5'' and used to be a detective for the LAPD, so we felt pretty safe.  Oh yea, add me to the list of people who hate the fact that they close at 4 p.m.
