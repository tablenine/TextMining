This is always a great place for martinis. We were here for the Elite event and the apple martinis were on the Yelp menu. I missed the appetizers since I don't get off of work until 7PM. I've been here before with friends from work and their bruschetta is really good from what I remembered. I also remember they used to have their apple martinis with a slice of apple in it or a watermelon martini with a slice of watermelon on the side of the glass. This night, we had a "naked" apple martini since it didn't have the slice of apple since us Yelpers have been ordering them like crazy for them to keep up in it. These packed a big wallop and I had 2 of them. Always a great atmosphere and ambience whenever I come here with friends. I'll have to try the restaurant part one day.
