I would probably still be considered a Canter's newbie considering the few times I've been, but they have all been pleasant and memorable experiences in their own way.  On one occasion following a night out at The Dime across the way, my sister's boss insisted on being seated in the booth between my sister and I at a table that included non-stationary chairs, and looking like the emperor, his wife, and his concubine, we had a wonderful 3am meal of matzo ball soup and pastrami.  And we were truly served like kings, even on a Saturday's e'en.  More recently, a friend in a drunken stupor talked wildly (and loudly) of her sexual escapades without causing a stir in the establishment.  This is the place to come when you're drunk because they've seen it all!  And finally, even the women in the bakery are sweethearts because when I still worked on Melrose and was itching for some sweets for myself with only $2 in my pocket and the brownie craving of a coworker to quell, the darling behind the counter made my meager change work and ensured a pleasant workday for me, my coworker, and all of our customers.  (They have a powerful brownie.)  It's just one of those institutions that still knows we're all human and cuts us some slack when we need it.
