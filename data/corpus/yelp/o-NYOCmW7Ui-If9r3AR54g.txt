Seriously starve yourself before going to Manny's because their portions are huge and the food is rich.  My father asks for two extra slices of bread with his corned beef sandwich because they give him enough meat to make two decent-sized sandwiches.  Personally, I always get meatloaf and pickled beets, or some other equally old-man-style meal.
