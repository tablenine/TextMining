I've had some great meals here.  Brunch is good but really, I'd come for lunch or dinner to get something more memorable.  That croque monsieur is insanely good and I usually like their quiches.  I've had great and unusual soups that are awesome.  I like how they have a seasonal menu - only using the freshest ingredients.  I was very impressed with our waitress' knowledge of the wine she was serving.  I once ordered a alsatian stew that was great and the waitress paired a fantastic Chilean wine with it.  It was like heaven.  The deserts and bakery and incredible.  It's spendy allright and sometimes I've actually thought, "that salad is HOW MUCH?"  but just order wisely and you'll be happy with the meal for the price.
