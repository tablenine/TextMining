Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
So I just moved to Chicago/Lakeview from San Diego and was in need of a good cheap Thai place to fill the void created by leaving California. I kept walking past Joy's and after reading the reviews decided to try it out for lunch. SOOO happy I did.. . The service was incredibly fast with out being overbearing. The spring roll apps were great and really refreshing. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with chicken and was happily surprised with not only how fast it came out but with the very generous serving size. Everything tasted great and I can't wait to go back and try the other delicious looking menu items I was spying at other tables.. . Oh and the fact that my whole meal with tip came out to just $10 was fabulous!
