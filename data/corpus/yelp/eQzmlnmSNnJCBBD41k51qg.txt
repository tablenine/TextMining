Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
The boyfriend and I had dinner here at a spur-of-the-moment kinda thing. I remember a friend telling me about this place, so we looked it up on the Garmin, and it led us right to it. Right when we stepped into the restaurant, we noticed the delicious aroma of garlic in the air. I ordered the smoked salmon ravioli and he ordered the prime rib, both of which were really good. Some of the waiters kept passing by our table with sizzling platters, and just a whiff of those dishes was enticing enough to make me want to eat more, but my stomach was too full to agree with my nose. Maybe next time we'll try out their seafood. Since we don't come out to L.A. too often, we always have trouble with parking (we hate carrying around cash!). Our waitress, Agnes, was kind enough to help us out with parking (she gave us cash, and we over tipped her). Next time, we'll remember to bring at least $3.50 for parking, and a bigger appetite.
