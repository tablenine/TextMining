Restaurant: The Porter Beer Bar
Category: American (New)
The Porter has instantly become one of my favorite beer bars in the United States. As an avid fan of all types of beer, I ran here the minute I found out about it during my recent trip to Atlanta. And it did not disappoint.. . The Porter is an a funky little mini-neighborhood called the Little Five Points - a hipster-esque, mission/brooklyn-like haven for the tattoed and educated-but-alternative lifestyled folk of Atlanta. I sat next to a girl who worked at a bar down the street and claimed the Bill Murray had been in for a few drinks the other night (and yes, he is a grumpy guy...apparently...but he also left a $30 tip on a $20 bill...apparently).. . ANYWAYS, what I loved about the Porter is that it was a no-nonsense beer bar for beer lovers. A massive, frequently update beer list of informed, hard-to-find brews. Generous barkeeps who offer tastes of everything before you commit to a pint. Good gastro-pub food, including the staples of moules and frites (but not over-the-top belgian). The beer menu keeps an even keel, listing American, English (often overlooked), Belgian, German, and others with equal thought put into each. When I went for St. Patrick's day, the choices were Beamish draught and a whiskey-barrel-conditioned cask ale called "blarney" straight from Ireland which was simply incredible. . . Lastly, the thing that I just couldn't get over were the affordable prices! Somehow, all of the beers here were $1-2 cheaper than anywhere else I've been with a similar menu. They have Maudite on tap for $3.75...that's insanity! I don't know how they manage this, but all beers on tap were clearly below what I considered the fair market-price to be. Amazing.
