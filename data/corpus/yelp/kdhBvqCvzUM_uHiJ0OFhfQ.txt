Cheap drinks and food can't beat that. Outdoor patio is nice and there's always a crowd there. If you are looking to go to use the bathroom, be prepared to wait in line for a while. They have a fairly large venue and only 2 unisex restrooms.. . $4 drinks and cheap shots usually brings someone in, but they have cheap food too, and they are pretty decent for the price. I enjoyed the $3 hot noodles and the $7 mussels.
