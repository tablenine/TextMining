Dang! This place was just not good. I have to say this is one of the first yelp letdowns I have experienced. I think you guys really missed the mark on this one. The best part of the meal was the house Chianti at $31/bottle and the Caesar salad -- lemony and crisp! The rest of the meal served up a major disappointment for this gal. . . On the suggestion of our waiter I went with the duck filled tortellone with spinach (burned) tomato and fresh mozzarella with a wine and cognac reduction. A) I love love love cheese but this was ridiculous! If I wanted clumps of cheese (I am talking about blocks of cheese through out) I would have ordered a side of mozzarella B) the cognac reduction was hardly a reduction and maybe resembled a broth soup better C) the meal just wasn't hot. I want my plates of pasta to come out steamy. . . My cousins had the Ravioli with the sun-dried tomato cream sauce AKA the Campbell's tomato soup sauce and the Portobello con Pollo . Blech for both. The chicken was dry and the sauce was an gross mucky-grey color. I understand that the makeup of the sauce was mushroom and balsamic but there must be something you can do to make it look like you aren't eating a hunk of chicken in the middle of a mud puddle. . . I am so sad to be this disappointed about this place! On the brighter side, the outdoor seating is adorable and the service was very attentive. Stick with the bread, salads and wines and you'll be alright at this little neighborhood spot.
