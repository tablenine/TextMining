I've never been one of the Sex and the City girls, just a disclaimer so you know who you are dealing with.. . Overall impression - they are trying too hard. Pretentious, overpriced, snobby, and insanely loud.. We came there at early dinner time (5ish), and brought the kid with us.. . They had the high chairs, but they were the snobby kind - Stokke.. We have Stokke at home, and I love it, but it needs a rail or a strap to put a child in. They didn't have the rail or a strap. So they spent 170 bucks on a chair that was useless. Tells me that they tried to impress, but didn't put that much thought into it.. . I thought the interior was pretty interesting.. . I felt very uncomfortable there, and the cool club ambiance didn't excite me. I felt I didn't belong. Â I feel the servers were arrogant without any good reason - service was slow.. . The food was OK, even though I don't even remember now what I ordered. I just remember it was OK.. . And then of course the muzak started. Oh, man. I think I still have light buzzing in my ears.
