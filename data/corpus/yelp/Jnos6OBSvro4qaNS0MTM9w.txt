Alright, well this is my second time back to Crust since my pretty crappy service experiences. Crust has since, redeemed itself, much to my pleasure. I have sat at the bar both times and the service has been great. Bartenders are pleasant and helpful with the menu.. The caprese (shocker, shocker) I had was great, the mushroom soup on special was great and the new shrimp arriabiatta was awesome! Spicy but not overwhelming and just really good! . The place was packed as usual, which is great Â because I do support the mission they are behind. . I wish they had more choices for appetizers though! But, no complaints this time around!
