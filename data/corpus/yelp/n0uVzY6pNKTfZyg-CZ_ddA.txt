Restaurant: FLIP Burger Boutique
Category: Burgers
Been to Flip a couple times in the past few months for dinner on weeknights both times.   Its been crowded each time, but we've been able to get a seat with a rather large group without too much trouble.  I think the beer selection could be a bit better; I ended up ordering UFO bottles.  But you don't come to Flip for beer, so onto the food!  Most of the sides are good, fries are tasty, onion rings are very good!  I've tried a couple of burgers, and they've been really great every time.  The most memorable were the Venison (which wasn't on the menu the most recent time) and the Butcher's Cut.  I've read a few complaints about the portion sizes, but in my opinion, its the perfect size to enjoy a salad, a few sides, a burger and then have room for a shake.  Overall, I've left very satisfied every time I've been.  Its a good, hip crowd and makes for an enjoyable dinner.
