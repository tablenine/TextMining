Dont let the name of this place fool you. When my friend told me he was craving for some dogs at this place called "worst coochie" I started LMAO.  . 30 minutes later I was in complete silence just enjoying my "marharlika" filipino inspired sweet pork sausage with a side of sweet potato fries. The ingredients just blend so well together. Combine that with a franziskaner (hefeweizen) and it is pure bliss. Im definitely coming back to try the other "exotic" sausages.
