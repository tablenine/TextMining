Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
If someone told me that the formula for a winning restaurant consisted of (1) tiny restaurant spaces, (2) hokey themed decorations (3) no reservation system, (4) and no utensils, I would have never believed it.  But someone had the foresight to know this could turn into the scary popular Boiling Crab.. . It is absolutely imperative to come with lots of patience and perhaps a magazine because the wait is insane.  Even if you are patient, you should probably arrive no later than 730 pm because at some point in the evening, the hostess comes out to read the "guarantee" list.  If you're not on the list, you will be turned away and might be reduced to take out.. . As for the food, my group of four women ordered 4 lbs of food, which turned out to be near perfect in amount: 1 lb king crab legs, 2 pounds shrimp and 1 lb crawfish, plus corn on the cob, 1 dz oysters, and sweet potato fries.   In the future, I would only get shrimp and possibly crab legs for the crab boil because the crawfish shells are too large and heavy.  It was sauced with "The Whole She-Bang" (all sauces combined) at Medium level of spiciness.  Oysters were also good.  Shells not particularly well cleaned but they were fresh tasting.  . . Once you get over the fact that everything, and I mean everything, is covered in garlicy, spicy sauce, including your hands, your hair, your clothes, your breath, your face, your nose, your drink cup, your napkin, your tastebuds, the burning will eventually subside and you will enter the shrimp peeling zone.  It is quite wonderful. . . In the future I'd order at least 2 corns per person, nix the crawfish, and perhaps get some kind of carby substance.  More fries or potatoes perhaps.  A girl only needs much cholesterol in her life.  . . Now, I just have to round up another group of patient people and I can return....
