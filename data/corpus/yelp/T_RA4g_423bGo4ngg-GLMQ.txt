This place is for real. Forget about  the 40 min wait on a Friday or the waiters who are overly busy. The environment is great and the food is even better. It might be the best breakfast cafe I have ever been to. Try the peanut butter crust french toast. Nothing compares to this breakfast/dessert (it is extra sweet). I would recommend this place to everyone.
