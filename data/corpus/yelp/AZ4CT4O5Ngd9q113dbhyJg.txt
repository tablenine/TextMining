Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I have been to Manna many many times, it is mediocre but fun. There are certainly better ones for the meat quality. . . Tonight was the last time I will attempt to go there. As crappy as they are, they informed us that on Fridays and Saturdays they are now reservation only. srsly? wtf?
