I have been here several times and find it consistently quick service, very decent food, and very low cost for decent portions.  It doesn't really go for a "Thai" feel but I suppose that's what it is based on the selections; perhaps not authentic, but it still satisfied my stupid Americanized palate.  Maybe not the biggest menu compared to similar places but I don't judge based on that.  One the few good, cheap, fast places on that corner of overpriced, overcrowded, and loud establishments.
