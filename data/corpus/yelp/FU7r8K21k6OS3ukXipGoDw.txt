Great service, very good food, great prices on the pre fixe menu. I've been here several times, and at least one person at my table orders one of the specials, which never disappoint. Their house wine is very good, and parking is not terrible either. I wish I could remember to plan to go on Mondays, when all bottles of wine are half off. . . Perfect place for a first date or drinks after work.
