Great service, nice atmosphere (elegant, cozy without being pretentious), and a really good deal. . . Five of us ordered a shit-ton of food. We ordered:. - aginares moussaka. - domathes avgolemono. - kolokythakia kai melitzanakia tyganita. - soutzoukakai smyreika. - manrodaphne htapothi me fava. - poikilia. - htenia me fasolia kai roka. - horiatiki. - pasiar sta karvouna. - a greek white wine. - and two desserts to share. . So other than the last two bullets, I have no idea what it all means, but I do know that every single dish was so flavorful. Every one was delicious and was the perfect serving size to share between us 5. . . I left stuffed beyond belief, but not too much lighter in the pocket. With all that food, dessert, a bottle of wine, tax and tip, we each threw down $44. Not bad for a fun dinner in NYC.
