Restaurant: Colonnade Restaurant
Category: Southern
What a great place! If you ever have any friends or family that come to visit Atlanta and you want to take them to a real southern restaurant. Well, Colonnade is your place. They have the best corn bread, fried chicken, or my favorite turkey and dressing you have ever had.. 5 stars (wish I could give it 6 stars).
