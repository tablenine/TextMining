Ok.. well I wish I could give this place more than 4 stars as I think it is better than three for sure, but just doesn't stand out enough for 5.. . The burger: Well tons of different toppings. That was really nice for an idea. It's too bad that some items are premium and cost more. Also, you can only choose up to 4 toppings. I think they should make that as many as you want for just regular toppings. Also, goes the same for cheese and sauce. The meat itself was ok. I believe the meat is freshly ground, but just didn't seem that good. The nice thing is that the weight is after cooked so my 2/3 lb burger was more than enough! . . The starters were good. I'm a fan of sweet potato fries and these were really good. Fries were good, but didn't stand out.. . Service was good with the person we had, but my friend had to wait a while as they forgot his splenda a few times. It's ok though as they kept me refilled on my pop at all times which was nice as I go through it like water at times.. . I was a little disappointed given the hype The Counter has, but I will definitely try to give it another shot as it could of been a mediocre batch of beef.
