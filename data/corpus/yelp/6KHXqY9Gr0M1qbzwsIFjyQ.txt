Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If LA is the City of Angels,  The Pinks is the breakfast of hangovers.. . This place has so much hype on it. And the line is about an hour long.  . . There are so many different hot dogs to choose from, so if you don't like it you probably just ordered the wrong thing.. . I order just 2 regular chili dogs and they were pretty good.  I wouldn't say they are the best hot dogs ive ever had. . . This is a cool place to go to, lots of history and pictures of famous people all over the place.  So if you go to LA, you might as well stop in and eat here just to say you did.
