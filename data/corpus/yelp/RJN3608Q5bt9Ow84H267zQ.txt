So far this is the only place in downtown atlanta that seems to have a little more chill the way I like in NY style.  It has a dress code and they stick to it..I guess that can go either way.. . . Some friends had the sushi platter and seemed to like it alot...waitress was friendly and not over bearing and the only bad part that I found was that it closes at 2am... but i guess that is late for a city that seems to shut it down at 9ish..... . yeah ATL what is that all bout.... . I'm just sayin, if they could kick it like that till 5 this place would be the most happenin place in ATL for a 30 sumthin group  that is not a lounge or a club,...like a nice chill place for eating music and if needed dance...
