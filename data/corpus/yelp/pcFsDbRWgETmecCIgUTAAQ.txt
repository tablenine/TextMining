Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's Tacos was recommended to me by my landlord so I decided to go check it out after work one day. I biked there and was rather horrified at the chaotic mess in front of the store. I had absolutely no idea what to get as I didn't even know where the menu was. I played safe and just asked for a beef burrito. . . I got it to go and I didn't even know it came with the chips and salsa, which was a pretty good deal I guess, for something that's less than $5.. . I got home to eat it and the burrito was okay. It was pretty big but it was rather bland. The beef was very well cooked though. The chips were okay and the salsa was interesting. Everything in the salsa was extremely fine, nothing like your regular salsa with chunks of tomatoes or whatever else. It's very watery and the flavor wasn't really my thing. It was pretty sour and wasn't spicy at all.. . I'll probably try the tacos the next time.
