kinda POed that i was hella looking forward to the Special this time which is the Persimmon Mandarin Sesame Sausage Tacos. all it came with was the sausage and none of the persimmons, mandarin orange nor the sesame leaves. i didn't find this out until after i received my order, i wish they told me b4 hand when i was ordering.  the blackjack quesadilla didn't look as appetizing as it does on the website picture of it.  Kogi dog toppings were good, reminds me of Pink's hot dogs except the wiener is a lower quality crappier one, but i liked the ingredients.  the Tres Leche didn't look that great and tasted average to me. line was shorter this time around though.
