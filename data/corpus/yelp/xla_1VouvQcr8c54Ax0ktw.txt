I'm not into spicy food, so I never get it spicy. I like the noodles here. It's not typical ramen noddles. They are fatter than most noodles. I can't believe the chef serves food he has never tried. According to the legend, the chef thinks his soup is so spicy, he dares not to try it. I do pile on some of the toppings like green onions. I thought the fried rice was good, and my group of eight had to wait awhile, ad stare at the scary health rating outside.
