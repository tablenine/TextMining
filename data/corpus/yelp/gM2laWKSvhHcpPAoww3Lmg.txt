My boyfriend and I split the TBLT, jasmine iced tea, caramel milk, assorted ice cream bon bons (berry nilla, coffee toffee crunch, and the mint chocolate) and a snickerdoodle.. . Everything was amazing - however, the snickerdoodle was a but doughy (but sufficiently buttery) and the jasmine iced tea was way strong (I had to dillute it with a whole cup and a half of water).  This is a pretty far drive for us but totally worth it.  I can't wait to drive out here again to try the chocolate chip cookies and blue velvet cake.
