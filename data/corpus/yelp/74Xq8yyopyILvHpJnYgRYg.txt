What can I say about Fred 62 that hasn't already been said by the other 134 peeps who wrote reviews? lol. . It kind of reminds me of Swingers...but...dirtier.  If you could imagine!  Fred 62 is one of those places where you'll find all walks of life from that funky chick with platinum hair to the hot couple dressed in high end motorcycle couture fresh off the bike to the European kid toting a long-haired Chihuahua.  And same goes for the menu...burgers, shakes, Mexican food, omelette's and the like makes the food list as eclectic as Fred's clientele.. . Decent enough food...it's a diner so run with it people. Good for a hangover!  Awesome malts...try a black and white.  Good stuff.  Service is a tad on the slow side...you might have to flag someone down.  The restrooms are unisex and I highly advice washing your hands less you feel grungier coming out than you did upon entering!
