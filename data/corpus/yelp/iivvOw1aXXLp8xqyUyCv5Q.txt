This has to be one of the best diners in the world.  Let's face it, how many places cater to you while you are standing outside in line.  They bring you coffee and tea, cookies, sausage, oranges, strawberries and whipped cream...all while waiting in line.  Then you get seated and the fun begins.  Huevos Rancheros is one of my favorites, gooey with egg, cheese and salsa.  The best turkey bacon on the face of the earth.  The staff is always friendly and you are waited on immediately.  I have never had a bad meal here!!  GUS, you rock!
