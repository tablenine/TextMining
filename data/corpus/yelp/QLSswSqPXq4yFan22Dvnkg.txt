Glad i had a Groupon.  The appetizers were tasty and the ambiance is really what you are paying for. The main dish, I had the cod, not so filling but tasty, and my friend had their recommended stake, quite salty, she did not finish.    We both left kind of hungry and we had 4 appetizers and a main dish.  I would go back to watch a movie in the Japanese gardens, or the farmers market, otherwise not worth the money
