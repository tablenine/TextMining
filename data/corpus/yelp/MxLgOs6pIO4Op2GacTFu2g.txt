Tantalizing flavors and fresh ingredients breaths life back into Latin American and Spanish food. . . This is for the ceviche lovers.... . I am a ceviche fanatic.  I love the taste of fresh seafood marinated in citrus juice and heightened by bold flavors.  Pura vida does just that by serving up three variations of ceviche.  . . The tilapia tica ceviche is a wonderful example of a Latin American/ Spanish dish. Just the right amount of citrus mouth pucker that is mellowed out by coconut sauce. . . You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy their tofu ceviche.  the sour orange sauce has a sweet zing balanced out with a little soy chipotle "caviar". . . georgia trout ceviche is a very simple and clean dish but never lacking in flavor or taste.
