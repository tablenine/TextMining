Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
Super cheesy decor and they have like 50 items on the menu with spam, but this place started my obsession for Sriracha and for that, I am greatful!. . I used to come here for lunch about twice a week (be away they are not open on Mondays) and almost always got the BBQ Beef. Â It comes with a scoop of white rice, a scoop of pasta salad, and the beef over some cabbage. YUM! I know people hate on rice for not having a flavor, but I love it and when you throw some sriracha and teriyaki sauce on top, boom!. . I've had many other dishes from there, but the BBQ beef was the favorite by a mile. The kimchee I remember wasn't very good, though.. . Anyhoo, thanks Waikikie for letting me listen to some haiwaiian ukulele as I scarf down anything covered in Sriracha!
