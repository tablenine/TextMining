Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Logan Square doesn't really have a lot of options for nightlife.  But even if you do end up here by default, you could do a lot worse.  . . The staff is friendly (and there's a hot bartender), the clientele isn't horribly obnoxious, the food is decent (good cheeseburgers) and despite what some other reviewers say, I haven't found the place to be all that terribly loud.  I've been on a couple dates here, and conversation was possible (though in some instances, I wish it hadn't been).  . . Plus, you've got to give it up for any place with a 1/2 price wine night.  At least, if you like wine.  (I do, and they have a pretty nice selection here.). . Is this the most incredible dining/drinking experience you'll ever have?  No.  Still, a good (and needed) neighborhood establishment, and definitely worth a visit.
