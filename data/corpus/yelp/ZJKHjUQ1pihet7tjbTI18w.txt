I'm not normally one to order girly drinks, but I have to say that the watermelon and the blueberry martini's are pretty damn tasty.  They could have put in little paper umbrellas, and I'd still order them again.  I like how Lola's has a casual vibe (with a free pool table too), and there's plenty of eye candy.  I didn't find the food particularly special, which is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me.
