This is my favorite restaurant.  I've been coming here since it opened, and I've never had a bad meal.  When they began, they were the only dining establishment west of the Blue Line.  Oh, how the landscape has changed over the past decade.. . Service has always been first-rate.  I prefer to eat seafood when I dine out, so their menu has always been right up my alley.  The fish has been perfectly cooked every single time.  Spring is also one of the few places where I willingly order salads.  Desserts were the weak link for many years, but now it's a strength.  The current pastry chef is doing remarkable work.. . It's not cheap by any means.  I feel the appetizers are severely overpriced and the entrees slightly so.  Still, the consistency of excellence over the years make it a worthwhile dining experience.  I wish I could afford to eat here more often.  I've had to take advantage of Groupon opportunities whenever they've presented themselves.  Fortunately for me, I don't care for wine or cocktails, so it keeps the tab down.  Dining here is not merely an indulgence; it's comforting, as well.. . I have a lot of great memories of Spring; it was also my late mom's favorite restaurant, and we ate here often.  When I eat here now, I can almost feel her sitting across from me.  It always brings tears to my eyes.. . EDIT:  I've been informed by the restaurant that they are in fact NOT closing, which is a monumental relief.  Restaurants of this quality are rare, so knowing that they're not done is welcome news.
