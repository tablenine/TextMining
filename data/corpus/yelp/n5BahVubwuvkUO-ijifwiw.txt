Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My favourite things about Lawry's: free appetizers, creamed corn, and the spun salad. I didn't mind the wait, the crowd was pleasing to the eyes, we had a private room so not sure how the dining room atmosphere is, seemed jovial and comfy. Wait staff were friendly and accommodating, and the prices are completely reasonable for a meal in Beverly Hills.
