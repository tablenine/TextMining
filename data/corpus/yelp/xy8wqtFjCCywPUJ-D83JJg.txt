Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I have been coming to El Tepeyac since I was in my mom's stomach and then I came out of her like a Manuel's special .A big ass burrito the size of a baby .I have gone as far as eating half of one and no mas.. There large portions menu will satisfy your hunger,I mean this place is like the mecca of mexican food in LA and it has been for the past  50 years.Often imitated but never duplicated and a landmark in Boyle Heights that will always have a special place in my heart with great food and good  people!!
