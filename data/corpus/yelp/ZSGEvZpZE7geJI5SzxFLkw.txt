The two stars are for the food alone, which ranges from good to excellent. I love the salads and the specials are almost always to die for. . . On the flip side, the service here flat out sucks, unless of course you're an actress or a model or dining in the company of an actress or model. If you're a regular person you're likely to get indifferent service or no service at all. My husband and I have visited on more than one occasion and after being seated were entirely ignored for thirty minutes or more. . . I've complained to the management twice and received gift certificates for free meals but the service hasn't improved one bit.. . And to top it off the prices are outrageous for what you get. There are far better healthy restaurants out there, like Inaka and M Cafe de Chaya.
