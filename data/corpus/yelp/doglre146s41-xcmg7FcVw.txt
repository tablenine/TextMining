Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I agree with all the other yelpers that this place is overrated! Its just a hot dog place that throws just about everything you can imagine onto a hot dog and gives it a celebrity name. I came here twice and luckily the times i came the lines were not long. I waited about 15 minutes each time. The hot dogs are alright but their not as ravishing as everybody says they are. I wouldnt mind coming back especially since their open late and i love looking at all their celebrity photos on the wall.. .  Its pretty amazing how well they remember your order though without jotting it down. If you havent came here, give it a try! Some of my friends think its the best hot dog place on this planet, i just thinks its ordinary but test it out for yourself.
