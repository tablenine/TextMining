Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
This place is decent. A pound of crawfish won't fill you up---better order 2 lbs. Corn on the cob is tasty. Fries are nothing to brag about. I think the service is wonderful---they even provide small, wet towels so you can wipe your hands with.. . Pricing is reasonable---it's like $5-$6/lb of crawfish I believe? Better get it boiled. NOT steamed.. . It's probably the best place I've found that's close by, but I've had better.
