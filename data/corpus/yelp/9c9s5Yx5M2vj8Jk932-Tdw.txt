The fact that I worked here (for too long) and still get the craving to come back for the pomegranate margaritas and filete con hongos surely says something!  After all, it's rare that one can experience such jarring, traumatic memories and still have the desire to return to the scene of the crime.. . Having been yelled at, insulted, and threatened as a Maitre'd here (because people throw tantrums when they're hungry), I'll give you this advice:. . MAKE A RESERVATION IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE WAITING FOR A TABLE.  AND IF WE SAY WE'RE BOOKED, THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE.  Oh, and yelling at the staff doesn't get you seated sooner.  Sorry.. . Was I just yelling?  Why is everything getting dark?. . Anyway, on a more practical note, the guacamole, frozen margaritas, and authentic dishes are delicious and are consistently good.  If ever you have a less than perfect experience, make sure to tell a manager!  They will do everything in their power to make things right.. . The bottom line is that Rosa is FUN and ENJOYABLE.  It's the kind of place where it's fun to go all out.  Starve yourself all day so that you have room for appetizers, guacamole, drinks, entrees, and dessert.  You'll be glad you did, and even when the $150 dollar bill comes for you and your date, you'll be drunk off of the strong drinks and won't care/notice until your statement comes at the end of the month.. . Would I work here again?  I'd rather eat poison.  But I will definitely be back the next time I plan a nice night out.
