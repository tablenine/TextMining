Nothing too fancy, just perfect ingredients, perfect preparation and four star service. . . If this is your first time to a top notch steak house... please don't order Filet Mignon... while this a gorgeously tender cut of meat, it's not where the flavor is. Not sure which cut (rib-eye, strip, etc) to try ask the waiter. He'll know way more about it then you'll probably care to know... but that service is one of the things you pay so much for at a place like Bones. So use it!. . A great place to celebrate something very special, call ahead and let them know the occasion, they're great at making extra special.
