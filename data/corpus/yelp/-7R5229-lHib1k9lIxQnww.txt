Excellent!! I know this sounds insane, but we ate at this place two nights in a row because it was so good! It's loud with high ceilings and marble floors, so just be forwarned.. Curried chicken is salad divine, they were handing out samples as we waited for our table. Chicken with artichokes capers and garlic amazing. Crepes suzette fantastic. Service the first night was a little slow, but great place with equally great food.. Second night we went with the pizzas and i have to say, i was a bit disappointed. Our service ROCKED though, so that made up for it. Both nights we got free desserts. Don't waste your time on the chocolate souffle, it wasn't that fantastic. Get something else. Lemon and Pear tarts were both delicious!
