I have yet to actually grab a bite to eat at this joint, but between the bartenders and servers, the nightly events that take place here (live music, awesome d.js, drink specials, debate watching, jello wrestling (yes I said jello wrestling), birthday parties, and various other themed parties) the size and set up of this place and not to mention the large bar area as well then they definitely get 5 stars from me. I love it! It's like my 2nd home away from home and the Highlander. Would that make it my 3rd home then??? Hmmm. lol . . The place itself is very what I call "woody". It has a new feel to it but it's wood (lol) and has that LARGE pub feel to it. You've got a dance floor, a place for the bands to perform, couches, pool tables and an abundance of bar space, tables and booths to accomodate almost any size party. I have to be honest though. The thing that takes the cake for me is the service and the atmosphere. East Atlanta is the sh*t anyway, but the bartenders and servers and the variety of people that mingle together in this place make it what it is. Polo shirts and tattoos Mmm mmmm. lol Well not together but you know what i'm saying. lol. . Either way if you're looking for a good time dial...just kidding...but if you're looking for good time check out the Graveyard. You've got industry night on Mondays, DJs and sometimes bands on Thursdays, and Fri and Sat you just need to go find out for yourself. ;o) You can't beat their drink specials, and the bartenders are the bomb.
