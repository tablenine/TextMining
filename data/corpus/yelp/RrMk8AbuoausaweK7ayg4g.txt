Restaurant: Tin Lizzy&#39;s
Category: Mexican
My sister and I dined at Tin Lizzy's on an uncommonly warm winter day, enjoying the opportunity to sit on the upper-level deck, leaning back in the sun, ogling Oakland Cemetery. . . We began our lunch with an order of chips and spinach cheese dip. While I was disappointed that Tin Lizzy's doesn't offer diners complimentary chips, I must say these were wonderfully seasoned and soared above and beyond the typical chip. . . The sis and I both ordered two tacos, the fried fish (tilapia, Poblano tartar, jalape√±os and iceberg lettuce shreds) and the buffalo shrimp (fried shrimp, a so-so sauce, shredded iceberg). The food took forever to arrive--had the tacos been delicious, I wouldn't have been disappointed. In fact, a random waitress wandered around the entire deck, asking if our tacos belonged to each table. Finally, she delivered our food. Anyway, the shrimp taco contained three pieces of shrimp; similarly, the fish taco cradled a scant amount of tilapia. Six Feet Under, just down the street, offers much more phenomenal, substantial tacos.. . I have to say that I prefer the Buckhead location, since the service is better, and I remember the food being better.
