Love this place! Great place for acoustic music. I love that they celebrate all that is Jeff Buckley. A friend to the local artist as well. And now it is time for the pumpkin martini. my favorite drink...almost ever. Innovative and unpretentious menu. comfort food with flare. Always delicious, but a little over priced. Have never been disappointed with the experience. Staff is always great. Give me a pork chop, a pumpkin martini and a little acoustic music and I am happy.
