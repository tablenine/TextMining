Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
It amazes me that restaurants like Feast manage to stay in business!  . . In fact, Feast is an example of pure chaos at its best.  . . After we were seated it took 15 minutes for our server to arrive at our table, and another 15 minutes before we received the wine we ordered.  Then, it took forever to receive our food!  . . Honestly, I can't believe we actually stayed here for the entire meal.  The waiters and busboys were running around frantically, making the dining experience unenjoyable and stressful.  The busboys were filling up water while they were sweating which was really gross and made me loose my appetite.  A waitress broke about 5 glasses at once, and, then, believe it or not, broke more glasses about 5 minutes later.  . . The food, other than the guacamole, was average to outright horrible.  But, what is crazy about the guacomole is that I asked if we could get salsa with the chips and our waiter informed me they did not have salsa.  Well, that's strange, because one of the menu items came with salsa!  My friend could not even finish his ravioli because the edges were uncooked and hard.  My chicken tasted like something I could have cooked which is a really bad thing!  . . We asked to talk to the manager, and it took about 20 minutes for her to arrive at our table, and all this time we were done eating and waiting for our check to come, but our waiter had disappeared, leaving us to endure this horrible experience even longer.  The manager was quite unapologetic to the situation and did not seem surprised we were complaining.  She did comp my friend's meal, and did offer to comp the entire meal, but since we did drink the wine and eat the guacomole I refused.  . . What surprises me is there were lots of people in this restaurant dining.  I really can't imagine why anyone would waste time and money to come to this restaurant.
