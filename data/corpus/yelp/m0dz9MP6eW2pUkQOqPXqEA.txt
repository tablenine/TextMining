LOVED it.  Totally hippie, progressive place with a huge variety of unique, reasonably-priced food.  The shop in back is particularly eclectic, with a lot of travel books and travel-related stuff.  I got the quesadilla which was great (but had some spicy peppers in it, fyi, which is not my style), and they even adjusted the milkshake to make me a chocolate soda!  Totes good times!
