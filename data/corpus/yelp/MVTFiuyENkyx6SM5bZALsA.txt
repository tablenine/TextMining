ust as good as the first time, but now that there are a few trucks to choose from, it isn't my top, but it's still very good. It's at least worth a taste to see what started all this craze. It has slightly more greens in it that I want, but for some people it's a perfect amount. The kimchi quesadilla is good, and so is the Kogi Hot Dog, but the best thing to have is definitely the tacos. Just stick to the basics.
