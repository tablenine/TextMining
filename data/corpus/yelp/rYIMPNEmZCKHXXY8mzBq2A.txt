Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I love this place.  Sure, it's messy and stinky but it's filled with flavor!. . I think the shrimp, crawdads and the lobster done with the whole shebang is the best.  The crawdads don't yield much meat, but I think it soaks in the flavor the best.  I think the shrimp does too.  I've tried it with the crab -- the dungeness crab was a little bit of a let down, and the King Crabs were ok, but it didn't soak up any of the flavor.. . I think the sweet potato fries (not their cajun ones) is a good way to offset the spices.  I thought the cajun fries dumbed my tongue down too much to really enjoy the seafood.. . The staff is friendly and do a great job keeping up with the refills.  . . Only complain is that the restaurant is small and sometimes it can be a dire wait.
