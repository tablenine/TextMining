Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
What can I say about pink what other reviewer say?. Yes the lines are very long ranging from 30-1 hr depending on the time u get there. There are various choices of hot dog from regular one to the most outrage and unthinkable one u can image. I normally just pick my favorite one Chilli cheese dog w/chilli cheese fries w.alot of pickle sweet chili. If anyone who hasn't gone there, it is worth going there for 1 time just to know u experience it but the food is just ok. Anytime u have a late nighter then the hot dogs seem to taste better. . So take your pick and maybe u will get lucky and see a celebrity
