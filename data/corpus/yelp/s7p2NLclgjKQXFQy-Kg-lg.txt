Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I have officially died and gone to sandwich heaven.  A heaven that includes ciabatta bread, smoked turkey, bacon, cheddar, avacodo and hot &amp; sweet mustard, otherwise known as the Eli S.  There truly is an art to making a good sandwich, and Jerry is an artiste!
