Went here on a Saturday night without a reservation (I'm not even sure if they take reservations) and were seated immediately, although by the time we left, there were several groups waiting for tables to open up.  Of course we had to get the rice paper wraps and try making our own fresh spring rolls.  It was fun.  I love cilantro so I piled it on and asked for more when we ran out.  Service was good and the inside was nice, especially for a Buford Highway restaurant.
