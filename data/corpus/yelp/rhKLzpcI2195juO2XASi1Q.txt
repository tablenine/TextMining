The only good thing about this place is the patio on a warm weekend. Other than that, I can't stand this place. Albeit, some of the food is good, I'll admit. But the beer is overpriced, the good beer that is. And good luck getting a table/spot at the bar. This place gets very crowded with the button-down blue stripped shirt guy. The bartenders and servers aren't bad, it's not their fault that the place sucks. I just don't know how I feel about bars that hand out wristbands to distinguish the children from the adults. Ooh, I guess I can also admit that they have a fair amount of TV's, which is great to watch games. But I just can't figure out if this place is a sports bar or not. Is it? Because if it is, they need to accommodate those who don't have their name down for booths or tables. And their happy hour, is literally 1 hour (5-6pm). So you better hurry over there, and get your order in!. . Why do I hate this place so much? It's never been bad to me. I'm not completely against taking a pager and waiting for the vibration to tell me my table is ready...or am I.. . Note: They don't have beer by the yard anymore, and I don't know why. Maybe it was because those button-down blue stripped shirt guys were getting too hammered and crashing into others on their way home. Or maybe they were breaking too many of the glasses, and it cost too much to replace. You can still get half-yard drinks though, the last drink is a doozy, watch your nose!
