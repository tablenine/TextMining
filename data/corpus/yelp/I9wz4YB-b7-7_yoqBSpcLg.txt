jsut go. its awesome. you'll thank me later. ok, maybe you wont actually thank me, but youll like it. Its a fantastic place, both the ER one and the new downtown one. classic doner is amazing in both wrap and sandwich form, and the sides are great. there was a point in time where i was rocking spitz twice a week for like 3 months. its that good.
